    Project CAV²R is a Python-based web app that analyzes and visualizes previously extracted YouTube channel data and video data (focused on comments). Another purpose of building this software is to find and recommend the best videos of each and every channel based on what their viewers had to say in the comments section. The belief here is that sentiment should be a significant influencing factor in recommendation algorithms. High numbers of likes, and especially views of YouTube videos, do not always mean high positive sentiments on the quality of those videos' content.\n\n

with st.expander("App"):
    st.write("""
    In the main page, users are introduced to an overview of 17 educational YouTube channels' dataset and below are bar charts which give a clearer display of differences in their subscriberCount and total number of videos. Then, users can select one YouTube channel in the drop down menu to navigate to recommender page for recommendations of videos starting from the video with the most positive sentiment or if they click on the analyzer, they will be brought to a page of sentiment analyses and visualizations of their chosen channel.\n\n
    """)
with st.expander("Recommender"):
    st.write("""
    In the recommender section, videos of all subjects/genres with the most positive sentiment scores are embedded first. The underlying structure implements code from analyzer. Recommendations are decided on the strengths of videos' normalized positive sentiment scoring which is a result of summing up the frequency of mainly positive comments then comparing the averages on a fair scale.\n\n
    """)
with st.expander("Analyzer"):
    st.write("""
    In the analyzer section, there are loads of data from comment json files being normalized and run through vader behind the scenes. For a cleaner look, users only see the sentiment analyses results and visualizations. CAV²R goes for the numeric approach which is why there are no emphasis on wordclouds or frequency of positive or negative words.
