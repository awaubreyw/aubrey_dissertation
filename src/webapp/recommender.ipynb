      "Score: 0.9889, Comment: Thank you very much, Phil Plait and the others there at <i>Crash Course</i> Astronomy, for making this video! Wow, the Universe really is amazing! I did know about galaxies before watching this video but I did not know about clusters and superclusters. 100 000 000 000 galaxies! Wow, that’s a pretty big number. It’s only a shame that we only will be able visit so few of them...Anyway, quasars are also splendid, fascinating! Thank you for making this video!<br><br>I do have a question, though. You mentioned that there are a number of ways to classify and group galaxies together, but only talked about two grouping them together based on shape (spiral, elliptical, irregular etc.) and based on energy-output (active, non-active and quasars). So galaxies are really huge, but how massive are there? How do you group them together based on mass? How massive are galaxies?\n",

Phil sure knows how to share his passion. I already knew about the Hubble deep field, but my neck and arm hairs stood up anyway (and I felt like Phil&#39;s did the same ;).<br>2. There is way too much information and the numbers are way too big for me to understand and remember everything.

Every single episode you write and host is not only extremely entertaining to watch but also deeply mind expanding. You have a gift mate, please never let go, you are doing an immensely important job teaching and spreading this subject.<br><br>The day when every single person on our tiny planet is aware of the contents shared in this series, Earth will be an awesome place to live in. We should all help that day come as fast as possible.<br><br>Already waiting for the next episode :)\n",

      "Score: 0.9709, Comment: Phil, <br>your series has inspired me to become an amateur astronomer. I am fascinated with the content you put out every week and always look forward to your videos. I&#39;m hoping you can recommend a good stater telescope... I have done a lot of research and am currently leaning towards the Celestrone 6SE (roughly $1000.00 CAD). If you have time to respond I would love your input (or any other knowledgeable astronomers on this comment section) . <br>Keep up the excellent work!\n"
