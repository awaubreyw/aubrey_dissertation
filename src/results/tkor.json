In this video we'll show you how you can reuse some of the plastics around your house, as opposed to letting them go into the ocean. Using number 2 HDPE plastic you can melt them down and shape them into something else. This is a great way to recycle old plastic and easy to do at home.\n\nCheck out all of our socials: https://link.snipfeed.co/tkor\n\nWatch The King of Random in Spanish | Mira The King of Random en Espa\u00f1ol: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf9RdZvBJGQUjSCBMnXGAPQ\n\nSend Us Some Mail:\nTKOR\n63 East 11400 S # 198\nSandy, UT 84070-6705\n\nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound.\n\n\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc46\n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

It has some unique features and to some is considered the car of the future. But there's one thing it's definitely missing- the ability to glow in the dark. So today we're laying down some plastic and getting out the Plasti Dip to make a Tesla that can glow in the dark! In this video we're going to test out a few different glow powders and UV lights to see which one will give us the strongest glow. We're also going to paint an entire wall with glow in the dark paint and build a UV Glow Charging station we can drive through. Then finally, we'll take it out to the Bonneville Salt Flats to see how it all looks!  \n\nCheck out all of our socials: https://linktr.ee/tkorsocials\n\nWatch The King of Random in Spanish | Mira The King of Random en Espa\u00f1ol: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf9RdZvBJGQUjSCBMnXGAPQ\n\nSend Us Some Mail:\nTKOR\n63 East 11400 S # 198\nSandy, UT 84070-6705\n\nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound.\n\n\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc46\n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

It has some unique features and to some is considered the car of the future. But there's one thing it's definitely missing- the ability to glow in the dark. So today we're laying down some plastic and getting out the Plasti Dip to make a Tesla that can glow in the dark! In this video we're going to test out a few different glow powders and UV lights to see which one will give us the strongest glow. We're also going to paint an entire wall with glow in the dark paint and build a UV Glow Charging station we can drive through. Then finally, we'll take it out to the Bonneville Salt Flats to see how it all looks!  \n\nCheck out all of our socials: https://linktr.ee/tkorsocials\n\nWatch The King of Random in Spanish | Mira The King of Random en Espa\u00f1ol: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf9RdZvBJGQUjSCBMnXGAPQ\n\nSend Us Some Mail:\nTKOR\n63 East 11400 S # 198\nSandy, UT 84070-6705\n\nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound.\n\n\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc46\n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

The dragon has workable hands to help pass candy out in a more hygienic way, and makes Halloween a more health oriented experience. The dragons eyes and head can also change color and brightness by using a smart light switch from Caseta by Lutron that help us control everything on our phone.\n\nCheck out all of our socials: https://linktr.ee/tkorsocials\n\nSend Us Some Mail:\nTKOR\n63 East 11400 S # 198\nSandy, UT 84070-6705\n\nMusic by: \nFirst Bassists - \"Cambridge Twang\"\nJohan Glossner - \"My Baby Knows (Instrumental Version)\"\nTommy Ljungberg - \"Nothing Without You (Instrumental  Version)\" \nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound\n\n\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBob\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc46\n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

Wondering if we can make the biggest ice cream in the world? Think TKOR has what it takes to make the world biggest ice cream? \n\nWe\u2019ve seen experiments where you can make ice cream do cool things, but we wanted to know if it was possible to make the world\u2019s largest ice cream, if it\u2019s easy or hard, and if it tastes good! King Of Random has done some cool experiments and tests in the past and in this video, we're just attempting to make the biggest ice cream in the world! Hopefully this gives you an idea as to whether or not you can make this incredibly large ice cream at home.\n\nThis interesting ice cream experiment is perfect for those wanting to try some cool experiments: ice cream project, how to make ice cream, build the biggest ice cream in the world, giant ice cream project, how to make giant ice cream bar, what to do with gallons of ice cream, TKOR projects, TKOR experiments, and at home experiments.\n\nIf you want to test something creative and entertaining or do an activity such as: ice cream projects, science fair project, school project, science experiment, STEM project, STEM science experiment, science fair project, science fair experiment, or a fun weekend project...watch the video to learn more. \n\n#IceCream #BiggestIceCream #GiantIceCream\n\nOrder the 52 Random Weekend Projects Book!: https://amzn.to/31MMoO0\n\nSee What Else We're Up To:\n\n\n\nTKOR Facebook: http://bit.ly/2Kl2zgr\nTKOR Email List: http://eepurl.com/dJmHRv\nTKOR Instagram: http://bit.ly/2Ihef1j\n\nSend Us Some Mail:\nTKOR\n63 East 11400 S # 198\nSandy, UT 84070-6705\n\nMusic by: \nDylan Joseph - \"Let's Go Get Ice Cream\"\nJon Bjork - \"Battle of Wills\"\nDuplex Heart - \"Don't Blame The Weather (Instrumental Version)\"\nGavin Luke - \"Uplifting Piano Pop Rock 6 (Indie Pop  Version)\"\nDaniel Aldenmark - \"Looking For Love (Instrumental Version)\" \nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound\n\n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

Is it an optimal way for freeze dried meat? What about freeze drying skittles? TKOR has done some random experiments and in this video, we're seeing if it is possible to freeze dry bacon. We explore the chemistry of freeze dried food and if we can use a freeze dryer to make astronaut food, especially astronaut bacon. We also have other fun tests we performed. We hope this gives an idea as to what can or can\u2019t be used in a freeze dryer. \n\nThis freeze dryer experiment is perfect for those wanting to know if freeze dried food is legit, what should you put in a freeze dryer, how make astronaut bacon, how to make space bacon, freeze drying candy, freeze drying skittles, reconstituting freeze dried food, and those interested in the way our foods react to freeze dryers, most notably the Harvest Right freeze dryer.\r\n\r\nIf you want to test something creative and fun with a freeze dryer or do an activity such as: freeze dryer experiments, a bacon experiment, science experiments, random experiments, fun stuff with cooked bacon, survival skills, STEM project, STEM science experiment, science fair project, science fair experiment, or a fun weekend project...watch the video to learn more. \r\nGet your own Harvest Right freeze dryer: http://bit.ly/323wjTx\n\nCheck out our DIY Build Kits: http://bit.ly/2NnXiVp\n\nGet tickets for FanX: http://bit.ly/2Psd3gz\n\nToday we're taking two varieties of bacon, cooked and uncooked, and seeing how they taste after going through the freeze dryer.\n\nCheck out the TKOR Shop: http://bit.ly/2UCNpEb\n\nSee What Else We're Up To:\n\n\nTKOR Instagram: http://bit.ly/2Ihef1j\n\nTKOR Facebook: http://bit.ly/2Kl2zgr\nTKOR Pinterest: http://bit.ly/2InY0iT\n\nSend Us Some Mail:\nTKOR\n63 East 11400 S # 198\nSandy, UT 84070-6705\n\nBusiness Inquiries: For sponsorship requests or business opportunities please contact us directly: http://bit.ly/2VwFw3x\n\nMusic by: \nRamin - \"Quicksand (Instrumental Version)\"\nMondays - \"Perfect (Instrumental Version)\"\nJohn \u00c5hlin - \"Odd And Indie 02\" \nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound: http://bit.ly/2YZS8SH\n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

                "description": "Have you ever questioned: Can you boil water in a plastic bottle? Can you boil water in a plastic cup? Can you boil a water balloon? Can you boil water in a paper cup? TKOR has done some random experiments in the past and in this video, we're just seeing if it is possible to bring water to a boil in plastic. Will the plastic bottle catch on fire? Will it fall apart and melt? We dive into the physics of boiling water and just how good of a vessel a plastic bottle can be for boiling water. We also have some other fun tests we performed. Hopefully this gives you an idea as to what can or can\u2019t be used to boil water. Today we're testing whether or not water in a water bottle can boil without melting the bottle, as well as a few other fun BBQ tests.\r\n\nThis entertaining boiling in plastic experiment is perfect for those wanting to know if a plastic bottle can boil water, can you boil water in a paper cup, can you boil lighter fluid, what is boiling point, how to boil water, hair spray in a balloon, can you boil water in a wooden boil, or can you boil water in a plastic cup?\r\n\r\nIf you want to test something creative and entertaining or do an activity such as: science experiment, survival skills, STEM project, STEM science experiment, science fair project, science fair experiment, or a fun weekend project...watch the video to learn more. \r\n\r\nWe also tested if you can boil water in its plastic bottle: https://youtu.be/_uYppDCWHjM\r\nGet TKOR DIY Kits and Merch: http://bit.ly/2UCNpEb\n\nSubscribe & \u201cRing the Bell\u201d: http://bit.ly/2UpJazJ\n\nSend Us Some Mail:\nTKOR\n63 East 11400 S # 198\nSandy, UT 84070-6705\n\nSee What Else We're Up To:\n\nTKOR Instagram: http://bit.ly/2Ihef1j\n\n\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2Kl2zgr\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2InY0iT\n\nBusiness Inquiries: For sponsorship requests or business opportunities please contact us directly: http://bit.ly/2VwFw3x\n\nMusic by:\nThe New Fools - \"Fifth Avenue Stroll\"\nTigerblood Jewel - \"Lasers And Stuff\"\nVictor Olsson - \"Redneck Rumble 4\"\nMartin Klem - \"Rabbits Foot\" \nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound: http://bit.ly/2YZS8SH\n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

Is flamethrower snow removal even a good idea? Stuck trying to find better ways to clear your driveway of snow? We get it. Today TKOR is taking three different flamethrowers and seeing if they can work as an alternative to shoveling snow or if it\u2019s a substitute for how to shovel snow faster. \r\n\nFlamethrower vs Snow. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019ve never wanted to know if using fire for ice and snow removal is legit. We\u2019ve got your curiosities covered ;) Crafting one of these flame guns was entertaining but meticulous! Testing it on an idea like fire for shoveling snow was beyond fun. Did it work though? TKOR built a homemade flamethrower and tested it to see if it really is viable for how to shovel snow fast. \r\n\r\nIf you want to try something new and creative or an activity such as: DIY flamethrower for snow removal, snow shoveling ideas, wondering whats the best way to get rid of snow and ice, science experiment, how to quickly remove snow, amazing inventions, pyrotechnics, pyro custom builds...watch the video to learn more.

                "description": "What happens if you put frozen steak in a Harvest Right freeze dryer? What if you want to make a protein shake out of freeze dried steak? Everyone loves a nice juicy steak, but does a freeze dryer create the best dehydrated steak? Is it an optimal way for freeze dried meat? Is this even a good idea? TKOR has done some random experiments and in this video, we're seeing if it is possible to freeze dry steak for powder steak and then use it for a meat smoothie. We explore the chemistry and the process of freeze dried food and if we can use a freeze dryer for freeze drying steak for the ultimate steak smoothie. We also have other fun tests we performed. We hope this gives an idea as to what can or can\u2019t be used in a freeze dryer. \n\nThis freeze dryer experiment is perfect for those wanting to know if freeze dried food is legit, what should you put in a freeze dryer, how make a meat smoothie, reconstituting freeze dried food, and those interested in the way our foods react to freeze dryers, most notably the Harvest Right freeze dryer.\n\nIf you want to test something creative and fun with a freeze dryer or do an activity such as: freeze dryer experiments, freeze dried meat, science experiments, random experiments, fun stuff with cooked steak, survival skills, STEM project, STEM science experiment, science fair project, science fair experiment, or a fun weekend project...watch the video to learn more. \n\nGet your own Harvest Right freeze dryer: http://bit.ly/323wjTx\n\nLimited TKOR T-Shirts Sale: https://goo.gl/DRpfGY\n\nIn today's video we're seeing what happens when you freeze dry a steak and blend it up!\n\nSubscribe & \u201cRing the Bell\u201d: https://goo.gl/618xWm\n\nGet TKOR Merch:\nhttps://goo.gl/i5ehRg\n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\nInstagram: https://goo.gl/C0Q1YU\nFacebook: https://goo.gl/EWo7S7\nPinterest: https://goo.gl/Gbffq4\n\nBusiness Inquiries: For sponsorship requests or business opportunities please contact me directly: https://goo.gl/Z2L6yM\n\nMusic by:\nNiklas Ahlstr\u00f6m - \"Pure Gold 2\"\nVictor Olsson - \"Beer Beards and Barbecue 3\" \"Fragile Power 1\" BLAEKER - Follow You (Instrumental)\nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/jlJWJO\n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

                    "description": "What happens if you put frozen steak in a Harvest Right freeze dryer? What if you want to make a protein shake out of freeze dried steak? Everyone loves a nice juicy steak, but does a freeze dryer create the best dehydrated steak? Is it an optimal way for freeze dried meat? Is this even a good idea? TKOR has done some random experiments and in this video, we're seeing if it is possible to freeze dry steak for powder steak and then use it for a meat smoothie. We explore the chemistry and the process of freeze dried food and if we can use a freeze dryer for freeze drying steak for the ultimate steak smoothie. We also have other fun tests we performed. We hope this gives an idea as to what can or can\u2019t be used in a freeze dryer. \n\nThis freeze dryer experiment is perfect for those wanting to know if freeze dried food is legit, what should you put in a freeze dryer, how make a meat smoothie, reconstituting freeze dried food, and those interested in the way our foods react to freeze dryers, most notably the Harvest Right freeze dryer.\n\nIf you want to test something creative and fun with a freeze dryer or do an activity such as: freeze dryer experiments, freeze dried meat, science experiments, random experiments, fun stuff with cooked steak, survival skills, STEM project, STEM science experiment, science fair project, science fair experiment, or a fun weekend project...watch the video to learn more. \n\nGet your own Harvest Right freeze dryer: http://bit.ly/323wjTx\n\nLimited TKOR T-Shirts Sale: https://goo.gl/DRpfGY\n\nIn today's video we're seeing what happens when you freeze dry a steak and blend it up!\n\nSubscribe & \u201cRing the Bell\u201d: https://goo.gl/618xWm\n\nGet TKOR Merch:\nhttps://goo.gl/i5ehRg\n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\nInstagram: https://goo.gl/C0Q1YU\nFacebook: https://goo.gl/EWo7S7\nPinterest: https://goo.gl/Gbffq4\n\nBusiness Inquiries: For sponsorship requests or business opportunities please contact me directly: https://goo.gl/Z2L6yM\n\nMusic by:\nNiklas Ahlstr\u00f6m - \"Pure Gold 2\"\nVictor Olsson - \"Beer Beards and Barbecue 3\" \"Fragile Power 1\" BLAEKER - Follow You (Instrumental)\nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/jlJWJO\n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

                "description": "Ever wondered if you can turn coal into diamonds using peanut butter? What about a charcoal peanut butter crystal? And if so, how do you make peanut butter coal crystals? TKOR has done some random experiments in the past and in this video, we're just seeing if turning coal into crystal with peanut butter is even possible. We test the concepts in a viral video of peanut butter and crystals. Will adding ice matter? Is this crystal experiment based on real science? We dive into the chemistry of making crystals with coal and peanut butter. We also have some other fun tests we performed. Hopefully this gives you an idea as to whether or not you can turn coal and peanut butter into a shiny gem.

TKOR has done some random experiments in the past and in this video, we're just experimenting if it is possible to grow an apple tree from an apple seed. What will happen when we prep the seeds?
