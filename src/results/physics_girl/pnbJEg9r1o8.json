I suspected they share a funnel. make sure when you do this experiment, such as a tub, you fill it with enough water. usually to the top is good enough. when you use a single paddle to make the vortices, you will notice a particle and anti particle relationship. The closer they are to each other, part of their energy will transfer in both energy waves broadcasted from them,  as well as force lines. if they combine they will explode, forming smaller node and anti-node vorts. If the slow down enough, the same thing occurs except at a smaller fraction than from annihilation. if you use 2 paddles, you will create 2 of the same node, and therefore it will demonstrate repelling force lines in the middle. I used this experiment a possible correlation to electro-magnetic forces as well as a possible model for sub-atomic particle formation. Most of the predictions and formulas generated from observing the interactions in the pool are mirrored to quantum-mechanics. These experiments led me to conclude that if particle act as they do in the pool experiment, then a &quot;stable&quot; particle, which would be a full ring that has spin ( magnetic moment) would be the shape of a donut-toroid. The most stable of particles being an electron, where it exists in two distant points at the same time. 20 years after that prediction, the first image of an electron was identical in description.
