That honor goes to your(absolutely miniscule) gravitational influence on the earth. The force pushing up on you is a completely unrelated force that has to be the same as the force of gravity due to physical reasons(similarly to how the rope must have a tension force because you can&#39;t just pull a rope apart). The force pushing up on you in your chair is called the Normal force(the worst name ever). You can do several experiments to prove that it is not the same as gravity. The easiest is just to put something that can slide on a sloped surface. You will observe that the object accelerates down the surface, which means it must be experiencing a net force(parallel to the sloped surface) and it must be caused by gravity or the normal force because those are literally the only two options, so the normal force cannot be equal and opposite to gravitation. The normal force does have a third law compliment, because the normal force can be thought of as the force that stops you from falling through the earth, and the third law compliment is the force that pushes the earth away from you as a result(exactly countering the third law compliment of earth&#39;s gravitational pull on you)", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T06:22:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tech help", "comment_text": "Every time order of differentiation changes....nicely explained Diana.", "comment_date": "2021-01-20T08:38:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Kramer", "comment_text": "I wanna be the top cow", "comment_date": "2021-01-17T22:14:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Kramer", "comment_text": "what&#39;s a Newton what&#39;s a Newton what&#39;s a Newton please explain how much a Newton is!", "comment_date": "2021-01-17T22:06:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ECB", "comment_text": "Those \u201ccow\u201dculations were really helpful!", "comment_date": "2021-01-12T00:12:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vivek Yadav", "comment_text": "Only one word for you is AMAZING \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "comment_date": "2021-01-08T03:17:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "seval", "comment_text": "It is really perfect video\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29", "comment_date": "2021-01-04T15:38:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sri Devi Siva Subramanian", "comment_text": "fallen love with that &#39;tadhaah&#39;", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T10:50:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheBinarydeity", "comment_text": "Incredible video.

Eating cold eggs was worth it though, it turns out that there was no such thing as a soft \u300aC\u300b in classical Latin, but it did become a thing in late Latin due to a phenomenon called \u201cpalatalization\u201d.

The centrifugal force will be acting in a vector parallel to the equatorial plane due to momentum in the direction of spin,  so if I were standing on the equator (ignoring the oblateness or obliqueness of spheroid Earth) would I weigh less than if I stood at the North or South Pole?

To me, it feels much more logical to argue the other way: gravity is proportional to mass, so F=mg. Then knowing \u03a3F=ma, it follows that if gravity is the only force, a is constant and independent of m. Which you can then show to be correct through an experiment.<br>The crazy thing about all this is that the amount of inertia of an object is determined by some property which we call the mass of the object, and the amount of gravity is determined by some property which we also call the mass, because it turns out to always be the exact same thing. Why??? Why are there no objects that are affected very much by gravity, but are easy to accelerate? Or the other way around?

If yes, then why does not inertia of the coin separate the coin from hand when we slowly move the hand downward? <br>2) Place a coin on the top of a book. If you pull the book hard, the coin &quot; seems &quot; to move in backward direction. Is it due to inertia of coin? Coin was at rest. In an attempt to remain at rest, it slips on the book. If it is true, then why doesn&#39;t inertia work when we pull the book gently? <br>3) A popular demonstration is card coin experiment (or different versions of it). Place the coin on the card placed on a glass. If you flick the card hard, the coin falls into glass. The explanation given is that the coin has inertia. It was at rest. Even if card moves, the coin remains at rest due to inertia of rest and falls into glass when it finds no card beneath. If this is true, then why doesn&#39;t inertia make the coin fall into glass when you SLOWLY flick?
