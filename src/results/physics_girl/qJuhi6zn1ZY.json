You pronounced one millionth of a meter as &quot;micrAHMeter&quot; when it should be &quot;micrOmeter&quot;. By using micrOmeter  to tell the size of something you can distinguish between &quot;micrAHMeter&quot; as the pronunciation  of the word for the device used to make very accurate measurements.  By the way, while on the subject of pronunciation of metric terms, the correct pronunciation of 1000 meters should be &quot;kilOmeter&quot;, and not &quot;kilAHMeter&quot; as almost everyone incorrectly uses.  The pronunciation of that word is given in the official standard defining all aspects of the present ISO metric system, but that one word &quot;kilAHMeter&quot;, has been corrupted over time.

The &quot;pilot glories&quot; I have observed for almost 50 years are not so much about a rainbow forming around the shadow of a flying aircraft as the fact that the light is more intense immediately around the shadow itself than the surrounding area. My personal theory was that since any heavier-than-air aircraft stays aloft by forcing a considerable amount of air downwards when passing through it, the momentary pressure differential in the air caused the air to act like a weak lens, concentrating the light around any shadow formed by an aircraft. This phenomenon is easily seen when a shadow is observed on clouds, snow or even water and the ground. What I always found very interesting is the fact that this effect is very similar whether you are observing the brightness around the shadow formed by a 200 ton jet you are flying in at 500 knots or a 400kg ultralight at 80 knots. I have even observed this phenomenon when flying a hang glider - total weight a mere 120kg and very low speed!
