Brilliant and great clip about the LHC, quantum particles, the Higgs boson, and how they relate to fields. I am not a physicist, just someone interested in science that tries to find the origin of life. Because, logically speaking, that&#39;s what this is all about. If there is a Unified Field, what all physicists expect there is, of all other smaller fields and matter that are being studied now, then that field should be the universal basis for all the animate and inanimate. So, it would be the basis of all objects and subjects, including us. So, the same principles that are studied outside of us at the quantum level objectively should be able to be studied on the subjective level or the Unified Field is not a universal field. When I watch what is being said about quantum particles being fields of certain vibrations, the first thing that comes to my mind on the level of the subject, us as human beings, is a thought. A thought, just like the proton, is invisible, basically only a certain vibration in the form of a field. Thought is the same thing on the subjective level; it&#39;s invisible and technically in our brain a vibration that can be measured in waves, EEG waves. So, just as there must be a unified basis for all quantum particles, there is a unified basis for where all our thoughts originate, a field that is beyond the field of thinking. It&#39;s called Transcendental Consciousness and the machine, the equipment to reach that state, the human LHC, is called our mind with the physical aspect being the body. The technology to reach that transcendental field is called the Transcendental Meditation technique. It May sound strange, but it&#39;s just 2 parallel dimensions or universes with different appearances, where the same natural laws, the same principles apply. So, what you have just studied at CERN objectively, you can experience at home or anywhere subjectively. Just have to close your eyes and apply this meditation technique.

The facility itself is very large and the positive grounding even more expansive. The electromagnetic reflection of the facility creates ripples in the empty space. Direct interface with the particles, gives response to the unified field detection. The universe created the living world, in the same way. The giant reflection plugs into the smallest particles. The smallest type of current flow through those particles causes many micro fluctuations rather than the normal electronic flow. The reflection current is in fact able to form molecules and clusters of such naturally. The inverse square gives life through the intersection of macroscopic and microscopic: In turn the non-scopic realm is the medium. With far more functions per iota; the unseen field particles can sustain intelligent molecules. The cyclic process of static reflection radiation, goes on forever.

We are not swimming in a morass of quantum fields that can become anything and seem<br>to be there for one observer and not the next. The truth is almost the opposite. The morass is relaxed and linear in all directions when there are no energetic entities passing through it. When a Photon passes through the morass, it distorts the TIME that OTHER Photons experience as they pass through. The distortions do NOT represent particles... the are merely the waves caused by the passage of  Photons.<br>Mass&#39;querade explains how Photons create Gravitational fields by compressing or decompressing TIME during their passage through a given volume of space, the morass. Please take a look at my kickstarter<br>project and if you would like, you can have a special Preview of Mass&#39;querade: The Movie.

But, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite accurate to say that a particle can &quot;exist or not&quot; based on the motion of the observer. This really depends on the excitation energy of the field. In particular, this can seem to contradict the fact that the equations in Quantum Field Theory are constructed in such that they are Lorentz covariant (i.e. any equation that holds in a given inertial frame and can be written down in terms of Lorentz covariant terms will hold in <i>all</i> inertial frames). But the properties of a particle will certainly change under relative motion (think of redshift as an example, where the frequency of the photon - and hence its momentum - will depend on the relative motion wrt the observer).", "comment_date": "2020-01-05T01:30:04Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Andr\u00e9s G.
