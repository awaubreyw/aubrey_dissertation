The cylinder is also floating. You mark the water level on the side of the cylinder. You light the candle, and burn it all the way through, then mark the new higher water level on the side of the cylinder. Lastly, you can simply measure 3/4 of the way up between the two lines, and mark that point as 45min. Then let more air (of the same oxygen concentration) into the cylinder, such that the water level returns to the first, lower mark. Burn the second candle in that cylinder and once the water level reaches the 45min mark, it&#39;s been 45 minutes!<br><br>Obviously, this solution is more complicated, and takes a lot more time and resources to set up, but it should work, and has the advantage that you an effectively measure any amount of time, up to an hour, theoretically.

More accurately, the question is incorrect.  A servo motor can still be a DC motor. The majority of servo motors are in fact DC motors.  The requirement for a DC (or any type) motor to be a servo is some form of feedback to provide positional information. This can be as simple as an encoder, or a resolver , or some other means to tell where the shaft, or something it is connected to is positioned. Either absolutely, or relatively.   A servo motor can be any type of motor. DC brushed, DC brushless, stepper, AC, etc..  The more appropriate question would be &quot;What is a servo motor&quot; or &quot;When does a DC motor become a servo motor&quot;.   Actually, the motor itself never becomes a &quot;servo&quot; motor at all.  Its the system as a whole that is a &quot;servo&quot; , not the motor.  It is just referred to as such ,as motors with positional feedback are typically used in servo systems , and should be thought of more as &quot;Motor used in a servo system&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-02-08T00:01:52Z", "likes_count": 44}, {"comment_by": "Greg Feldman-Hill", "comment_text": "Silly and cute <b>and</b> funny <b>AND</b> smart!!

Throwing it out would let the boat rise 1 weight worth, and the water would fill in the gap (of 1).
