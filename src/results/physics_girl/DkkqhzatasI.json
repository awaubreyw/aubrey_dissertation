Then depending on how you define north and south you can still make this happen.<br> If you&#39;re 1 mile off the ground above the north pole then which way is north and south? North should be down, and the Southpole is technically also down so North and South are both the same direction. Or another way you could determine south is with a compass. If you use a compass one mile off the ground then south will be the opposite direction of north so south would be up. <br>Going East and West would just result in you making infinitely small circles around the north pole so they effectively become null. <br>So by the 2nd definition of south you could say, you&#39;re going north 1 mile which makes you go down to the ground, then east one mile which doesn&#39;t move you and then south one mile which makes you go back up into the air one mile back to where you started. <br>That&#39;s what I was thinking.", "comment_date": "2020-07-04T19:09:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David", "comment_text": "I would like to see Jamie Heineman.", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T05:19:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lake Cooper", "comment_text": "So I just watched that video for nothing?

Now it looks like a popcycle stick with a string attached to the middle.<br>Now, if the string was pulling from the bottom, it would lock in place since the gears are in plane with the force, and the reaction force against the ground would equal the pulling force, like trying to topple on a flag pole by pulling it from the base.

The center of the force (the fulcrum) is the ground, NOT the center of the spool.

In this situation you can think of the spool as acting like a lever and fulcrum where the lever arm is the outer edge of the flange which hangs below the railing and the fulcrum is the point where the smaller diameter portion of the spool is contacting the railing. Pull on the lever and the spool begins to roll away from you. You could also think of this situation like so.  When the spool rolls away from you on the railing the bottom part of the flange is actually moving slightly towards you while it is below the railing. Now think of the spool rolling on flat ground.
