While working as a tester and certifier for, among other things, ventilation systems, I was invited to a group of consultants (lots of doctors of science and engineers, and I just a poor nuclear reactor technician) to solve the problem of contamination in a completely closed system biomedical sterile laboratory. It is interesting that I was called up because I was also a diver in the military service with closed breathing systems for diving, as was the ventilation system in the laboratory. Nitrogen and oxygen came from pressure cylinders and the cryogenic system rather than from outside air, and CO2 was removed through chemical scrubbers. Workers wore fully enclosed suits under pressure to prevent their contamination with bio material. The problem was in the contamination of the samples and the clogging of the nano filters in the inner ventilation circuit. After a week of dismantling and cleaning the system to no avail, I suggested that the staff stop showering daily, to which I received murderous shots from the others, but the owner of the lab decided to take care of it as well. In 3 days the contamination dropped to an acceptable minimum allowable concentration. Simply put, natural skin oil reduced the peeling of skin cells and thus reduced the amount of harmful bio material. Eventually, at my suggestion, the system was redesigned so that the breathing gas mixture system was completely isolated from the lab&#39;s ventilation system so that all breathing air was blown out and disinfected and released into the atmosphere, and the lab had its own closed circuit. This reduced the  contaminants to 2-3 ppm of bio particles inside the laboratory", "comment_date": "2021-01-06T14:20:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alephii", "comment_text": "O Cu tem propriedades antivirais!", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T22:54:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "alephii", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUCru4p15-4&amp;t=10m51s\">10:51</a> don&#39;t touch yourself!", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T22:53:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GuruOfEverything", "comment_text": "I am from the future, a vaccine has been made...", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T09:30:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fra", "comment_text": "Coronavirus :)", "comment_date": "2020-12-04T12:57:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WolfShadow247", "comment_text": "The unit of measurement for replacing air is Air Changes per Hour (ACH).

Thank you!  <br><br>Also putting UVC lights in ventilation ducts can greatly reduce the number of active pathogens in a ventilation system.  (These are sold on Amazon I found out as well as at HVAC and electrical contractor supply houses).  The wattage, number of lights installed, and spacing would be dependent on the size of the duct and the airflow.  I know that for surface decontamination by UVC there is a certain number of Joules of UVC energy that must be applied to the surface, I imagine there is a similar calculation for airflow.  Interestingly shiny aluminum is a great UVC reflector and that would be best to use to line the illuminated part of the duct - most efficient use of the UVC energy.<br><br>A post on one COVID-19 related video a while back was from an electrician who had worked in an office building.  He noted that when the UVC duct lights were working, the absenteeism in the building was lower than when the lights were burned out and not working.  He hinted that the management was slow to release funds to replace them once a year.<br><br>Years ago, hospitals used to have germicidal UV lights installed in hallways that could be used at night when no one was in the hallways.

Also most elevator shafts that I&#39;ve seen don&#39;t have active ventilation in them.

I read about that Air Alaska flight probably as soon as it was published -- the news didn&#39;t mention sitting on the ground with the ventilation turned off.  What I did learn shortly after the first news of the paper was that the only way this investigation was possible is that all the people on the flight were somewhat easy to contact. A typical lower 48 flight would&#39;ve scattered the passengers in every possible direction. The implication being that this is happening all the time. <br>The value of this video and these investigation emphasizes how little we really know about transmission. (If you read sources about the Great Plague of London 1665, they all begin to touch on germ theory which wasn&#39;t widely accepted for at least another 200 years. Social distancing was quickly adopted. The sad aspect is that things they knew to do 350 years ago we in the U.S. refused to consider until Covid was widely spread. It&#39;s shameful.) <br>Here&#39;s an odd but related factoid. My bedroom, about standard size 11 x 13&#39;. When my girlfriend and I have the door closed and the window AC unit running (on recirculate - not sure it does anything else). After about 6-8 hours the CO2 ppm rises to about 1100 ppm (this is with my meter calibrated at 400 ppm, which should actually be calibrated to the new world standard of 440 ppm. I have an Amprobe CO1-100 CO2 Meter. A very nerdy thing to have.)  I notice the air is a bit stuffy at about this level  (1000 ppm) -- most people seem not to.  <br>I also notice that around me, windows open, but no fan blowing I can get readings of 450 to 550. I assume this is just the CO2 I exhale that just sort of hangs around for a while.  CO2 metering is how indoor air quality is measured. It&#39;s what they check at the gym when the fans are running and why they might add more.<br>I think I also notice that when a room is stuffy people don&#39;t think as clearly, but they also don&#39;t seem to be aware. Hot and cold they notice. And in very old people, some that I know have been diagnosed with some degree of dementia, when they&#39;re on oxygen the dementia seems to almost disappear. (But not Alzheimer&#39;s).   I&#39;ve always been a fresh air fiend, to borrow from Paul Theroux. <br>And I&#39;ve always worried about air quality and flying. I returned to Los Angeles from Hong Kong on about February 7 this year. Everyone wearing masks. I was wiping everything down with hand sanitizer, before and after I touched it.... But you know what. I don&#39;t remember smelling bad breath, mints, farts, etc... on an airplane. (Of course ten years ago why I have even noticed? I can however tell you the four times someone coughed near me in Hong Kong after about January 15, about when I started wearing a mask when out and about. There was one drunk woman on a cross country flight. I only noticed her boozy breath when she (repeatedly...) leaned in to tell me something especially important.<br>Back from Hong Kong, I started to get involved in DIY masks (Even though I already had a good supply of N and P95 masks - that I shared around. I reuse them a lot. Between shopping expeditions I leave them in the sun for at least a week) I asked a friend who sews a lot better than I do to help with the DIY masks, she just blew me off, &#39;the news says, fabric masks don&#39;t work.&#39;  I&#39;ve been wearing a mask since mid January. Was it April when the CDC started recommending it? As soon as my friend got a more reliable source of information than me she got on board. <br>I thought I&#39;d get more looks in stores, but no. One checkout clerk I suggested should use hand sanitizer after she sneezed into her hand and then went back to handling my produce, just glared at me. Two weeks later the whole store was masks only, 6&#39; marks on the floor, sneeze protectors at every check-out. They came up to speed brilliantly. <br>And while I&#39;m on a tear. When I was teaching health to middle schoolers I decided to do something about respiratory illnesses that usually run rampant through schools. I brought in 2 liter bottles of Purell, and Clorox wipes. I carefully wiped down every surface kids touch, doors, books, tables, chairs. After that whenever I could I&#39;d wipe down the door handles, desks, chair backs and seat where we grasp them to move &#39;em. I think I noticed fewer respiratory illnesses. I also began using hand sanitizer if I merely thought about it. If my eyes itch I reach for it. The two a year illnesses I normally got vanished - except one morning I woke up and had the thought, &#39;gee, I better take it easy, I might be coming down with something....&#39; Instead of going about my business and be hammered by the flu during the day, I called in sick and went back to bed. I felt like a complete flake, not ill at all. But that night I felt the flu headache coming on, uh-oh here it comes.... but the next day I woke up feeling great. I&#39;d beaten the flu. This was almost five years ago. I&#39;ve since made long trips to Japan, the UK and Hong Kong and didn&#39;t get the usual mid-trip respiratory illness. But most of what I did is about surface contact and self-infection, so this at best may be interesting but hardly definitive.", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T22:14:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doug LaVigne", "comment_text": "OMG!

The COVID-19 pandemic has opened our eyes to many new and previously-underappreciated, important health-related matters. One of these is indoor air quality. As an HVAC system engineer, I have been astonished at the high percentage of HVAC systems that are poorly designed, poorly installed and/or poorly maintained. One or more of these deficiencies can easily result in poor air quality within a building. Such HVAC systems are highly prone to circulating air that transfers harmful fumes, particles, bacteria and viruses throughout all spaces being supplied. The HVAC systems in hospitals and &quot;clean rooms&quot; used in certain manufacturing facilities can be the exceptions since these spaces are highly sensitive to low quality air circulation. However, my experience has been that the vast majority of HVAC serving virtually every other industry have some degree of deficiency referenced earlier. There are local Codes and National standards that specify the design, installation and maintenance of HVAC systems, but in reality these standards are almost universally compromised for a wide range of reasons, with cost being at the top of the list. HVAC systems are generally invisible both physically and functionally to almost everyone, so there&#39;s a higher likelihood your local gym, restaurant, tavern or shopping mall has a system constantly introducing inadequately filtered air into the various spaces.

Thanks.<br>Note, in active ventilation systems most of the air blown into your room is re-used from what was taken out of the space. Often there is a heat exchanger that heats cool air flowing in from a cold outside or cools hot air coming in from hot outside. That heat exchanger will physically isolate two air streams, but exchange heat. The air going back into the building is the concern. Elaborate studies of &quot;sick building syndrome&quot; in the previous millennium pointed to moisturizing tech doing a bad job when people e.g. complained about dry eyes. The eyes weren&#39;t dry, just infected by pathogens that grew in the moisturizing section of building air treatment &quot;streets&quot;.<br>In airplanes, there is a lot of re-circulation. Also note that the air may be run over some compressor stage of the turbine that drives the plane and this might introduce dangerous solvents (lubricants) if maintenance was not done properly.<br>If we compare building air treatment with water treatment in aquaria with tropical sea water fauna and flora, then from that we can learn that a filter system may be as big as the thing we try to keep healthy - and when all matter we can filter out is gone, we run that water along a very strong UV-C lamp to kill the last bit of pathogens still in there. Maybe building and airplane air treatment systems should add that UV-C lamp too. I have seen too many filters coming out of air treatment systems with a dirt level that implied maintenance had not been done for a long time. This is an area where all countries need regulation.

So do you risk getting your video taken down and going with the peer-reviewed research? Or do you tow the line of the WHO in order to avoid the risk of losing your YouTube channel for &quot;misinformation&quot;? <br><br>This was brought to my attention by a Yale professor of Epidemiology who wrote an op-ed in Newsweek. This is what he said that startled me: &quot;I have authored over 300 peer-reviewed publications and currently hold senior positions on the editorial boards of several leading journals. I am usually accustomed to advocating for positions within the mainstream of medicine, so have been flummoxed to find that, in the midst of a crisis, I am fighting for a treatment that the data fully support but which, for reasons having nothing to do with a correct understanding of the science, has been pushed to the sidelines. As a result, tens of thousands of patients with COVID-19 are dying unnecessarily.&quot; <br><br>(source article can be read here - <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/key-defeating-covid-19-already-exists-we-need-start-using-it-opinion-1519535\">https://www.newsweek.com/key-defeating-covid-19-already-exists-we-need-start-using-it-opinion-1519535</a> )<br><br>He is concerned that people are ignoring treatments to the virus, which the data and science fully support, but that mainstream medicine authorities are rejecting because of politics or by pointing to organizations like the WHO or the CDC. I&#39;ve always been told that science as a whole was supposed to be about the data, and the research, and finding the truth. I&#39;m not an epidemiologist, or an expert on anti-viral drugs. But just from looking up the studies that I could find, they all seem to agree with the Yale professor, not with the WHO or CDC. <br><br>That leads me to another question. In most of the videos I&#39;ve seen on Covid in the last couple months, there has been a little information box below the video saying &#39;Get the facts about Covid-19&#39; and a link to the World Health Organization&#39;s website. This video doesn&#39;t have that below it. Why not? I hope that means that YouTube no longer uses them as an authority on this virus. I have been reading a lot about the WHO, and I am concerned that they might be incompetent or corrupt. They spent months saying that Covid was only transmittable from bats to humans, and that human-to-human transmission was not possible. And when valid studies from Taiwan came out saying that it was easily transmitted from human to human, they ignored the study and would not allow Taiwan to submit their research. I asked one of my friends about this and their response was &quot;The WHO has more information than we have access to, so their information is better than ours.&quot; But when I asked for evidence that they had more information, my friend couldn&#39;t find any or back up the claim. <br><br>Sorry this is so long, but here&#39;s a summary of the questions. When the science contradicts what organizations like the WHO and CDC are saying, do we go by the research, or should we trust the big organizations? Has YouTube stopped using the WHO as their go-to fact checking source for information? And do you guys think that the WHO is still trustworthy, why or why not? Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Thank you for your time. I really just have no idea where else to post these kinds of questions.

It usually takes a few days incubation period from contraction to start showing symptoms. I would speculate that the vast majority of these symptoms were psychosomatic. One person was indeed infected and showing symptoms, potentially suppressed temporarily by medication. Lack of circulation and filtration spread it to everyone with exception to those already immune or just lucky. However, the spread of the symptoms was likely a combination of allergy-related symptoms in some of the other passengers combined with psychosomatic projection. One person was sick; many thought they were going to get sick because of that person; some allergy sufferers were showing signs of illness due to the lack of circulation; further reinforcing the belief that they were going to get sick; so their bodies start reacting as if they are actually sick.

SarsCov2 is not spread very well by touching surfaces and then touching your face.  In other words SarsCov2 doesn&#39;t have much of an upper respiratory mode of infection and talking about surface survival is mostly a red herring.  SarsCov2 primarily acquires host cells through the lower respiratory tract through it&#39;s ability to become aerosolized in the fluid air (not as spit balls) and specifically dry air (think winter air as found in the respective northern and southern temperate zones) where it can stay in suspension (much like a colloidal suspension) for a longer time .  This is why masks don&#39;t work.  Any mask that lets the fluid air in (ie. allows you to breathe) is letting the viral/air-suspension in and out also and you are not thereby protected.  SarsCov2 viral particles are only 1.5 micrometers in diameter.  The best protection is the open air of the outdoors (ie. highest rate of exchange; ionizing energy of sunlight; humidity).  In the serious matter of your physical, emotional and spiritual health don&#39;t get overly caught up in Dianna&#39;s upbeat bouncy manner of accumulating &#39;likes&#39;.  Real science isn&#39;t always amenable to &#39;likes&#39;.  If you&#39;re not willing to be on the wrong side of popular political and media driven consensus nonsense then how much of a scientist are you really?  If you can stand it, take a look at a recent (July 23, 2020) interview that Dr. Mercola did with a physicist named Denis Rancourt.  It takes a lot of stamina to sit through some of Mercola&#39;s BS interviewing style but Rancourt has something worthy to say.  Good luck though.
