[{"comment_by": "Physics Girl", "comment_text": "\u2b50\ufe0fANSWER TO THE BONUS RIDDLE \u2b50\ufe0f<br>The first question? Mostly\u2026 no. Buckle up, this is a long answer. First of all, what humans can discern with their eyes is mostly only apparent brightness of a star (how bright the star looks. It\u2019s an actual astronomy term). You can\u2019t see really the color, and color is key. We\u2019ll get to that in a second. <br><br>So, apparent brightness. Is it useful? Temperature of stars is loosely related to luminosity (another actual astronomy term. It\u2019s like the \u201cabsolute brightness\u201d of a star, or how much power, it\u2019s outputting in all directions. Not just in the direction of your eye.) If you\u2019re lucky and you\u2019re seeing stars on the main sequence, oh, right. What\u2019s the main sequence? <br><br>There\u2019s a useful chart called the Hertzprung-Russell Diagram (google images it!) that shows temperature vs luminosity of stars. Temperature doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with luminosity. You\u2019ve got these stars that are pretty normal and are on the \u201cmain sequence\u201d that shows a linear-ish relationship between temperature and luminosity. Then there are other stars OFF the main sequence like Red Giants that are really bright but really cool. So you can\u2019t necessarily count on temperature being related to luminosity. You ALSO can\u2019t count on luminosity being related to apparent brightness, the thing you actually see, because stars appear dimmer when they are further away. You could have a really hot bright star far away and a really dim cool star close by and they would look the same brightness in the sky. So you can\u2019t rely on brightness. Poop. <br><br>You can rely on color. You need to know the peak color of a star\u2019s emission spectrum. That will tell you the temperature. Stars approximate black bodies which means that their peak wavelength correlates with their temperature. But the thing is, you can\u2019t make out peak temperature with your naked eye because it\u2019s emitting lots of colors even when it\u2019s emitting the most of one color. So it ends up looking white. For example our star, our sun, we say it emits white light, but it actually peaks in green. <br><br>So to learn the temperature of a star, you need to measure its spectrum with a telescopey thing. But EVEN THEN you can\u2019t necessarily tell which star is hottest based on the peak of the spectrum because some stars that are really far away are redshifted by really complicated effects from the expansion of the universe. Stars that are far away LOOK redder (if you could see the peak color of a star by looking). What you need to do then is look at detail in the spectrum, see where signature emission and absorption peaks are from elements like hydrogen, correct for redshift of the start to adjust the peak to the right color and THEN you can tell the temperature. Phew. Astronomers have a lot to do. <br><br>(Also, whooooops. This was meant to go up days ago. I don\u2019t know why I make internet promises I can\u2019t keep.)", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T17:14:31Z", "likes_count": 412}, {"comment_by": "The Anonymous Seeker", "comment_text": "Vsauce says that diamonds float?

It does still float but with much less if any of the ice volume above the surface of the water. And when ice melts it becomes more dense as water. Therefore a clear Ice Cube melted into a volume of water could cause the water level to drop a minut amount. Returning to the subject of the size of the Ice Cube and the size of the Dimond the ratio between the two would determine whether or not the Ice Cube floats as well as the type of ice it is. If the ice has a lot of gas Pockets trapped in it it is more buoyant. And therefore would require a larger daimond to ice ratio in order to make the Ice Cube sink before it melts. Whereas if it is clear ice it would require a smaller Dimond to make it sink before it melts. In either case as the Ice Cube melts it will reach play Ice Cube to Dimond ratio that will cause it to sink before it is completely melted.

So the initial total volume is the original volume of water + the volume of ice + the volume of the diamond.  When the ice melts it makes a new volume of water.

One has a diamond in it, and one is only water.  Can you tell which is which? Yes.   If you have two identical boats they have the same water line.   If you put a heavy weight in one boat, it will sit lower in the water (has a higher water line).  If the boat is in a tank, the lower the boat rides, the more water it displaces, and the higher the height of the water in the dank.  In this case,   the diamond  is just like a weight, and the  ice is like a boat. The extra weight makes the ice cube with the diamond sit lower in the water than the other ice cube.

We could again look at the spectrum of a star and based off of what elements we see in the star we can (assuming there&#39;s no extra elements thrown in) determine what evolutionary stage the star is in and since stars tend to be hotter as they age, that will help us determine which stars are hotter. Without using the spectrum of a star we could just look at the colour of the star as bluer stars tend to be hotter and redder stars tend to be colder. We could also look at the type of a galaxy the star is in or where in the galaxy the star is in as that gives a pretty good idea to what age the star is which again gives us an idea of how hot the star is. We can also rule out certain types of stars for example, white dwarfs are very faint and are fairly cold, neutron stars are pretty easy to tell what they are and are very hot.

(I like the name with curve) which a black body is a graphical distribution of light that is emitted from a substance that is usually classified as perfect. It means if you heat a substance than than it will distribute light across all spectrum, but prodominatly in a certain wavelength which usually is a color. This ranges between brownish red, red, red  orange, orange, yellow orange, yellow, white, white blue, blue, blue purple.(note it says all spectrum so there is light being emitted in colors I didn&#39;t say such as x-ray UV and even green) If you bought light bulbs recently, they have this measurement on them which will usually say 2700K or 5000K, which is a measurement from a black body curve. However there is one problem. The universe is expanding which red shifts 98%-ish stars in the sky. So if you look up, you will see they are mostly red.  Fantastic news! Take a spectrograph to the light emitted from the star, and you will notice black lines known as special lines. These black lines are unique to an element that has absorbed certain frequency&#39;s of light. Now uses these lines in comparison to the lines you will see from something up close. You can now unshift the stars and properly sort out which ones are cooler and which ones are hotter, So blue stars are usually hotter and red stars are usually cooler. Note if you had the luminosity and apparent brightness you can put this on an HR or Hertzsprung Russel diagram to classify which stars are red giant, blue giant, brown dwarfs ect. It&#39;s a very helpful diagram because you can find out distances and what the stars life will likely come to. The middle of the graph is our sun which follows something know as the main sequence. I think it&#39;s cool, so check it out if you&#39;ve never seen them. \ud83d\ude00", "comment_date": "2018-07-06T21:01:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "josh pickering", "comment_text": "color the bluer the hotter", "comment_date": "2018-07-06T20:59:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Felipe Lorenzzon", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t the ice cube sink?
