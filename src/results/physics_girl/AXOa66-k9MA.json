It turns out that the field is strongest:<br>1) inside the coil<br>2) as close to the INNER surface as you can get, ie, right at the inside wires, and<br>3) in the center of the coil<br>I even simulated current in the &#39;billions&#39; of amps with tiny dl&#39;s...the program took days to run  The field pattern does NOT change (just the field intensity).<br>Some MIT lectures even claim max. field is down the center axis!<br><br>I have had some luck with a re-usable quarter shrinking coil...one that does not explode!<br>ps<br>I&#39;ve yet to zap a can...can&#39;t be better than seeing yours in slo-mo.<br>THANKS FOR ALL OF THE GREAT VIDEOS!!!<br>--dALe", "comment_date": "2022-04-30T03:02:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tuli2x", "comment_text": "why was the wooden box needed?", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T21:09:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kamran Ali", "comment_text": "Nice", "comment_date": "2021-12-31T12:06:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julian R", "comment_text": "Lol that ending &#39;we are going to figure out..&#39; no you are not because you explained absolutely zero of how this stuff works.

Similar to the way a Weller soldering gun works to heat the tip.While it is true electrons moving generate a magnetic field, the aluminum can is non ferrous and cannot be magnetized to create an electron\u00a0cascade effect. Aluminum is conductive but electrons must be flowing through it and only while\u00a0for it to attain magnetic properties. (This means you must apply a direct power/electron source to the can itself) No amount of magnetic field applied to it will induce a magnetic field and subsequent potential electrons or collection thereof. I call bull. Maybe the magnetic\u00a0field has a similar effect as gravity has on all matter. We still don&#39;t understand the correlation between magnetism and gravity. Sparks/heat???

But Faraday and Maxwell moved beyond the entertainment and they realized the importance of electromagnetism giving us what we see today. I believe simplifying science to such a level can only do more harm than good as Feynman said knowing the name of something is not knowing something.

But the one thing you don&#39;t show in your videos is the pain that is behind science. In this video I can hear only &quot;this is awesome&quot; and &quot;this is so cool&quot; which I don&#39;t say they are not but it&#39;s really not like the physics that is being taught at schools. The truth is that physics is not always this fun and exciting but there&#39;s a ton of complicated calculations, a lot of definitions behind it etc. I wish you showed more of this &quot;boring&quot; side of physics to people so that they can really see what it&#39;s all about.", "comment_date": "2016-06-14T21:07:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rubashow", "comment_text": "I have the suspicion that if that aluminium ring hits your face you&#39;re like: &quot;Ze Gaggles!
