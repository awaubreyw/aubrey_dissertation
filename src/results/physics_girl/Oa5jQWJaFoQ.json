Separate waves of light do not interfere with each other. Interference is only possible between waves that belong to the same photon. A lot of people get this wrong: unlike sound or water waves, light does not behave like a vibration in some medium. You would not be able to let two lasers cancel each other out (though I would love to see you try). What you CAN do, is send one laser beam through a beam splitter and let those two resulting beams interfere with each other. That&#39;s because each photon will be traveling through both beams simultaneously (in the form of probability waves) and those pairs of waves will interfere just like in the double split experiment. Watch Richard Feynman&#39;s QED lectures for an excellent explanation of how this works. So what&#39;s happening in the soap bubble is that individual photons are bouncing off BOTH sides of the bubble surface (just like photons going through both slits in the double split experiment), and the waves associated with those two paths of the same photon are interfering with each other. If those waves cancel each other out, the probability of observing that photon becomes zero.", "comment_date": "2021-05-19T13:30:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "David Belen", "comment_text": "Yo..

The more heat is used, the more hardness is traded for toughness as the steel &#39;relaxes&#39; a little. As you heat up the steel, a thin layer of iron oxide forms on the surface and you can see this as the shiney steel turns to a straw/yellow colours initially and then moves towards a bronze and then a dark blue/purple as the layer thickens due to the rising temperature. This technique is how they could judge the temperature of the steel to get the right temper on a tool for its purpose.", "comment_date": "2020-09-25T20:55:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fear is mother of God", "comment_text": "Thank you for", "comment_date": "2020-09-25T20:54:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lazylizard", "comment_text": "I&#39;m pretty sure that the striping effect is not due to the thickness but rather due to the angle difference.

I&#39;m glad you made a video about soap bubbles and color, which is one of my favorite things.  But guess what.  You <b>can</b> get red in a soap bubble with white light.  You just need a certain light source.  Specifically the common <b>triphosphor fluorescent</b> light bulbs or tubes.  I actually used Kaleidagraph to graph the intensity of the colors in thin soap films, based on the mathematics of interference (adding sine waves together with a phase shift).  I have actually been able to accurately predict the colors in the soap bubble all the way out to 1500 nanometers or so, and the colors repeat after about 1600 nanometers.  This is assuming the fluorescent light illumination, and a refractive index of 1.35 for the film.  At about <b>800-850 nanometers,</b> there is a spot where the 611.5 nanometer spike, and 630 nanometer area of the fluorescent light add together, and most other colors, except one peak at 488 nanometers, cancel.  This creates a red-like color I like to call &quot;interesting red&quot;.  So there&#39;s actually no reason that you can&#39;t get red in a soap bubble.  You just need a light source with <b>discrete</b> emission spectra (rather than the continuous incandescence of the sun and light bulbs).  And as long as those wavelengths are in the right place, red can appear.  It&#39;s really cool!
