Then, more is added the further down you go, so at the very bottom end, up to eight or nine inches are added.There&#39;s a bit of a difference between the British players and elsewhere. For example, British players have been relegated an inch when they&#39;ve moved to Major League Soccer or a European club. But in the UK, a player who is 5ft10ins will probably be listed as 6ft1ins, and a player\u00a0who is 5ft5ins will be listed as 5ft10ins.Lionel Messi is really only about 5ft2ins. Players who really are 5ft7ins are listed as 5f11ins.This all seems to have begun way\u00a0back in the early 1980s. The fact is that players have shrunk. In the 1970s, they were the same height as the average man, but I&#39;d say that the average British-born player in the English Premier League, excluding goalkeepers,\u00a0is only about\u00a05ft7ins - three inches shorter than the average for a young white British man.", "comment_date": "2018-04-27T14:36:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Yolo Dolo", "comment_text": "Does height matter in a sport like rugby ?

Swimming is mainly about decreasing drag and not as much about increasing propulsion. As you increase speed, you increase drag more. A rough example is, say you were going at a speed of 1 unit then your drag would be 1 unit to the power of 3 but if you are swimming at a speed of 3 then your drag is 3 to the power of 3, which would be 27 units of drag. So by being stronger you are moving faster, but look at the extra drag being created. You will tire out quite quickly. But if you reduce drag you will go faster with less effort, for longer. Objects that are long and slim move much quicker through the water than broad objects. Look at yachts, sail and rowing boats compared to cargo ships. Which is more efficient? Same with swimming, a long slim body will move quicker through the water. This is also one reason why swimmers extend their hands forward and rotate their bodies after entry. The rotation makes them slimmer in the water and helps reach further forward", "comment_date": "2016-08-12T18:39:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eliezer Velev", "comment_text": "Hello, i love this subject!!

With the difference in height also comes differences in tendon attachment points.  With running and swimming you also have the differences in stride/stroke length (taller can reach further). So if i am a sprinter who is 2m tall with 2m stride length vs. another who is 1.5m tall with a 1.5m stride length and we both have the same stride frequency I will win every time. Also, from an injury standpoint, if you have a 2m gymnast trying to do something that a 1.2m gymnast does their risk of being hurt is much higher. Though the taller person has higher potential for force output because of lever length, they also have to be able to absorb those forces with those longer levers.

I love your channel!   But I think you got a few things wrong with your &quot;Why does Height Matter in Sports&quot;.  <br><br>One thing is that muscle mass is proportional to muscle force.  (ie, the cube of your height) You said that smaller people can change direction more quickly their muscluar force scales with the square of their height, while their mass scales with the cube - which is false.<br><br>What is actually happening is more complicated.  While mass and muscle force both scale with the cube of height, what DOESN&#39;T scale is the angular momentum of motions.  To change the direction a limb is moving, you need to consider the angular momentum, because of course all our limbs are compound joints.  The angular momentum of a limb in motion is proportional to the fourth power of the mass of the limb, obviously.   That&#39;s why gymnasts are short, because they have to twist and spin.<br><br>Your discussion of swimmers was off because you confused these as well.  If muscles scaled with the square of height, which is also how cross sectional area scales, then swimmers would have no advantage for being tall.

Like Murphy&#39;s Law I have had an hypothesis that creatures are the &#39;right size&#39; for whatever they do best. An ant, for instance can lift 20 times its own weight, but it takes a great number to lift the weight what one human can.  Conversely an elephant cannot lift even its own weight to get out of a hole and will die trying in some cases. a Human in good fitness can lift his/her own weight and thus we can rescue one of our own species in most cases. We therefor are the &#39;right size&#39;.<br>As for the Olympic sports this video alludes too, I have lost a lot of my interest since the humans for each of the classic  modern Olympic sports have had to be so carefully cultured from among those elite athletes who fit the profile best suited to that sport.<br><br> It was not meant to be that way in its incarnation more than a century ago. while there were elitist instincts at that time, the amateur requirement meant that only those with collegiate support, generally the well to do, would have the leisure to participate, it was meant as a contest for average human abilities that average people could aspire to. Now corporate sponsorships,  overweening national pride and  the competition for the most unique stadiums have subsumed all of that, as well as the ever diminishing increments of improvement possible to the human animal in rigidly defined sporting events.

I don&#39;t agree with the reasoning on the swimmers though. Drag is a function of area just as much as strength is a function of area. The surface area of Flow&#39;s body is proportional to her height squared, and all that surface area will cause drag in the water. And also sure, weight is not an issue (because of buoyancy), but mass is because of intertia! And mass is proportional to the height to the height cubed so actually Bubbles has an advantage there because of the square-cube law. That being said, inertia probably is not very important compared to drag. Anyway, i do still feel like there is something going on with taller/bigger swimmers being faster. I tried something Physics Girl talked about in another video: extreme cases! Compare a action figure sized human to a whale sized human. Intuitively which would be faster? The whale sized human i think, he would just do one flap and be at the other side of the pool. The action figure sized human would flap and flap but not get very far. He would be able to flap at a much higher frequency than the whale though, because he&#39;s stronger for what his limbs weigh (because of square-cube law). And he certainly has to flap at a higher frequency to keep up with the whale. Hmm. Still not sure why exactly bigger swimmers seem to swim faster....", "comment_date": "2016-08-10T18:03:22Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "WikiVault", "comment_text": "Hats off to you!!!", "comment_date": "2016-08-10T17:54:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wes jales", "comment_text": "She is epic.", "comment_date": "2016-08-10T17:51:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Coolman", "comment_text": "Nice bicep! <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcTNIk0yfj0&amp;t=2m49s\">2:49</a>", "comment_date": "2016-08-10T17:49:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Itskelvinn", "comment_text": "Imagine spinning a 1meter stick above your head like a helicopter compared to a 5 meter stick.
