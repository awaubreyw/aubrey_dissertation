Some can see the difference between light being polarized or not. We&#39;re not all the same. Most humans see color in three color bands of the humanly visible spectrum of light, some see colors in four bands and another group is color-weak or color-blind. Generally the women that see color in 4 bands have sons that are color blind. As the photosites in the retina are connected in strings to one neuron, there is serious lossy data compression going on in there, and we loose most of the 120 &quot;megapixel&quot; resolution that way. This facilitates a much thinner optical nerve and is why we can rotate our eyes in the socket. When we are born and open our eyes, we must learn to interpret the visual information - e.g. we &quot;see&quot; upside down in vectors, not pixels.

What I however noticed strongly, was a color shift in the viewfinder, from orange to blue. Of course, the final photograph was not tinted (nor a positive &quot;slide&quot; film, e.g. Velvia). It was just an optical quirk due to polarization and how the system worked (as well as how my eyes worked - how I perceived the image). As far as I know, only the VLC line of Praktica &quot;L&quot; series cameras was affected, as it had exchangeable viewing screens as well as prisms, so the metering was different than other models, and it used polarization of light.

This always added another $80-$250 to every camera lens purchase price because I only would by German made B+W filters. Polarizing filters for camera lens are made so they can rotate on the front of the camera lens so it can be oriented to block glare to coincide to the orientation of the light source such as the Sun or other point light source. This allows to take pictures though a glass window and capture the subject behind the glass or reduce glare on a reflective surface such as a car, wet pavement, etc. or foliage such grass, trees, or intensify the blue of the sky and add more detail to clouds. What the pretty young Physics Girl didn\u2019t show was how polarizing filters are made. With eye glasses or camera lens filters, are made of three layers. The two outside layers sandwich a middle layer of a corrugated thin transparent film. The corrugations only allows photons traveling in one direction/orientation to pass through while the rest of the scattered photons are blocked. The corrugation is so small measuring in microns that it is beyond the resolution of the human eye, photographic film or photosensors.", "comment_date": "2021-05-11T10:24:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jorgemt62", "comment_text": "Et comme ca je suis all\u00e9 pratiquer mon francais at Leo&#39;s channel...", "comment_date": "2021-05-11T04:49:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nenhum usu\u00e1rio", "comment_text": "I wasn&#39;t prepared for the super cute biologist", "comment_date": "2021-05-10T22:07:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary Bickford", "comment_text": "Fun fact: the Vikings used a &quot;birefringent crystal&quot; for navigation in high latitudes, where magnetic compasses are unreliable.

However I have to clear something up; hi, electrical engineer here, electromagnetic waves look nothing like the one flat plane of electric up/down wigglies perpendicular to the one flat plane of magnetic side/side wigglies. The problem with that god damned chart and representation is that it&#39;s easy to grasp onto when you aren&#39;t familiar with the topic, and all media grabbed onto it at the expense of the larger picture. What that chart is <b>representing</b> is the <b>change</b> in the <b>amplitude</b> (intensity) over <b>time</b> of each of the types of waves,  and for <b>mathematical convenience</b> they are shown perpendicular to each other, as the fall in intensity of one type of wave inspires the rise in intensity of the other and vice-versa. What it does show well is the fact that it is self-propagating with no loss as it goes along through the medium it&#39;s travelling through. So, trying to picture light waves as + shaped wigglies is really useless when trying to imagine how polarization factors in; really, it&#39;s hard to say what it DOES look like, but I had to clear up a widespread misconception about what that specific graphical representation is displaying.

You dismissed circular polarisation almost as a conceptual thing made up from combining a horizontal and vertical waves.<br>However the problem of why dexra (right hand) or   levo (left hand)rotation of polarised light occurs through various liquids baffled  the best minds in physics (like Pasteur) 100 years ago. Still to today the best explanation is that normal light is simultaneously  made from the combination of both  a left hand and a right hand circularly polarised wave . Normal light has this so called dual chirality ...<br>Now theres a subject for another Youtube video.or two of three.....CHIRALITY !<br><br>When the circularly polarised waves E fields align vertically, we perceive a vertically polarised wave. Its still actually composed of TWO circular waves.(even after going through the polariser)<br>One circular wave interacts with the substance(s) its passing through  more than the other one and the travel time is DIFFERENT for them .<br>The result is that the position of the E fields peaks alignment is then different, so combined the resultant wave is now rotated with respect to the original polarisation filters.<br>D and L forms of sugars have the same chemical formula yet are mirror images of each other when  3D modelled. The shapes thus interact differently with the different polarisations , despite the fact the molecules are suspended randomly in the solution .<br><br>So  how does an electron changing energy states from one s,p,d orbital shape to another, give off a PRECISE amount of energy ,giving a light  photon a precise wavelength , when those orbitals initially  were  all crazy with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal thing ? Like how the emission from a sodium light is two precise orange spectral lines ..is a still a wonder of an atom . Bolted onto that wonder is now the concept that the photon is both left and right handed in its polarisation while it is at it !<br><br>In fact until mankind can emulate this DUAL chirality of light formation then we haven&#39;t moved on much from Neil Bhors&#39;, clearly outdated , 100 year old model of the atom ! <br><br>Supercomputer 3D modelling of the chlorophyll molecule to find out how it acts like an &quot;antenna&quot; to harness light energy , to solve the world energy demands , is happening as we speak .<br><br>You bumped into a very big subject without perhaps realising ...<br>Anyaway finally... <br>Nice to see some glamour with physics mind you , and hopefully will inspire more  perfectly good female brains out there to get onto the case as well !!!<br>They are better at multitasking is a fact ?!<br>AKA Ada Lovelace , Hedi Lamur and Marie Curie !

I need an explanation for this. So I have very, very powerful glasses. Say that I&#39;m looking at colorful Christmas lights, placed horizontally against the wall, in an otherwise black room. The blue Christmas light appears to visually be above the string, and the red one appears to be below it. And since I suppose pure violet lights are rare, when I look at a purple light, I see a faint purple splotch where it&#39;s supposed to be, and a blue and red one. I suppose it&#39;s because they&#39;re using two light sources and not a &quot;violet light.&quot;<br><br>So my question is, is this due to some sort of prismatic diffraction going on or something? Or how lenses bend certain colors more than others (why does this not happen with binoculars or telescopes)? <br><br>Also why do I see spokes around every light source? I never once have seen bright light without some degree of spokes. Either I see bokeh (no glasses) or spokes. And no matter how much I clean my glasses there are always spokes. <br><br>My diopter is -7.5 and -8 so in extremely nearsighted. My new prescription is -9 in one and I think -9.5 in the other (I went to a different doctor which had a more precise measurement).<br><br> My glasses always have that thing that makes it thinner due to the high index, transition lenses, and something that makes it shatter-proof, which I think may matter due to materials having different refractive indexes. It also corrects for slight astigmatism. <br><br>So please help me answer these questions! Especially the color one!

I love your show.  I use many of your demos to teach my kids about the amazing world of science.<br><br>So here&#39;s a little trick I used to do that seems right up your alley.  Can you boil water ... by adding cold?  Anyone can boil water with heat - just fill a pan and put it on the stove.  But take a clear glass jar with a tight sealing lid and fill it half-way up with water.  Now boil it in the usual way - heat it on the stove until it comes to a vigorous boil.  Then screw the lid on tight while it is still boiling (use hot pads to protect your hands).  Let it cool down to room temperature.  And finally put an ice pack on the top.  before too long, you will get a lazy, languid boiling from the water trapped inside.<br><br>The explanation is simple.  If the vapor pressure of a liquid exceeds the pressure on the liquid, bubbles can spontaneously form and expand.  The vapor pressure increases as the temperature increases.  So if you add heat from below, eventually the vapor pressure at the bottom exceeds the pressure from the surrounding air, and you get boiling in the normal manner.  At this point, the vapor pressure is just a bit above the ambient atmospheric pressure, and pure water can exist as a gas at atmospheric pressure.  So in the jar, the water vapor is pushing out all the nitrogen and oxygen and argon and stuff, until you get pure water vapor.  When you seal the jar, air can&#39;t get back in and when it cools the water re-condenses leaving a partial vacuum whose only atmospheric component at any temperature is water vapor.  When the vapor and liquid are at the same temperature,  their vapor pressure is equal and no boiling occurs.  But if you cool down the top, the water condenses and lowers the vapor pressure, allowing the higher vapor pressure of the water underneath to drive boiling.

Obviously, a primary example of such an individual would be Susan Wojcicki. Her idea of enlightenment is to demonetize a channel out of sheer spite should that channel disagree with anything she has to say. For example, H3H3 productions, Philip DeFranco, etc., etc., to name but a few.
