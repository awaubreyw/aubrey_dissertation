If we assume there are 1e28 electrons in the body, and 2e28 nucleons your mass would be around 32 kg. Plug in muons instead of electrons and you get ~34 kg. So you&#39;d be about 2 kg heavier from just the mass of the muons alone, but you&#39;d also be significantly denser, since the radial orbit of the muon in muonic atoms is ~200 times smaller than that of an electron. And ever more than that, much of our mass is generated by binding energies of molecules, and since the binding energy of muonic hydrogen is 200 times larger than the normal binding energy, I suspect you&#39;d quickly surpass the additional 2 kg needed to make a 4 kg difference in the mass. To do a back of the envelope calculation, let&#39;s consider the molecule O2 which has a mass of 32 amu or 5.31e-26 kg, meaning there is an additional binding energy mass of ~ 2e-29 kg, or ~ 1.2e-28 kg per electron. If we then take this additional mass per electron from binding energies our normal mass comes out to 33 kg, but if we replace that with a factor of 207 from muon binding energies being so much greater you&#39;d likely end up being 280 kg, and you&#39;d be quite a bit smaller. Let me know if you object to my calculation, but I stand by the mass being significantly larger than a 4 kg difference, and it could be as large as 280 kg.", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T19:40:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "General Awareness", "comment_text": "This is why the idiots who keep saying to follow the science should never be listened to because science, and what we know, or don&#39;t know, is ever-changing not some concrete fact.", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T05:35:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jimmy Brannan", "comment_text": "I think you should either have guests to talk to or talk to the audience.

So I did and I do see the beauty of the standard model and theories by Einstein and other great scientists. A renowned scientist, Carlo Rovelli, writes books for us, the pop-science crowd while doing his real work. I don&#39;t remember in which book he compared our current knowledge of the Universe but the point of the story was that the ancient Greeks and Romans created a system to explain and predict the movements of planets that was based on a geocentric system. It was gears within gears within gears but it worked for them. We might be doing the same with the Standard Model and other things while we can&#39;t grasp quantum mechanics.

Unfortunately it was canceled by the Clinton administration. I worked there for three years in Project Management. My role was in the Magnet Division. We were responsible for building the huge magnets that would guide the particle beams around the 58 mile ring three hundred feet underground. I gathered data in many status meetings of different groups of scientists in order to incorporate their progress and problems into the master schedule. It was amazing to see these scientists from countries around the world, Poland, India, Italy, England, Russia, Germany etc. work together to build this colossus. Often at these meetings solutions to problems emerged because their varying backgrounds brought different insights to problem solving that none might have achieved on their own. I was so proud of the work they accomplished and so devastated when the project was canceled. On the day the project was cancelled I was at lunch at a small diner near the Magnet Test Laboratory. The diner was full of lab workers commiserating as we knew the project was gong to be canceled but were awaiting the final fall of the sword. We saw the announcement on a small TV in the diner. Soon there were reporters interviewing us about our reactions. I said some words to one of them along the lines of what I have written here. Later that evening at home having dinner I got a call from my youngest daughter Stacey, who lived in Annapolis Maryland. She shouted at me &quot;Daddy, I saw you on national television&quot;.  My three minutes of fame. <br><br>To this day I believe that the cancellation of the project was a blunder of colossal proportions. We had a gathering of some of the best minds in Physics from around the world. They were learning to coordinate and collaborate at a furious pace. I would not be surprised,  if the project had been continued, that we might now have cold fusion or other mystical forms of energy in our lives. What a shame that we are now relegated to using windmills and sheets of glass to provide us energy. At this point I see that I&#39;ve not mentioned the engineers who put the ideas of the physicists into reality. They were coming up with new ways to build this giant machine that were generating more patents than I could count.  <br><br>As I reread what I&#39;ve written so far I just let out a heavy sigh and feel so sad that we let politics prevent us from accomplishing what could have been a watershed moment in the development of our country. Oh, if I recall correctly, our Estimated Cost To Complete at the time of cancellation was 9.6 Billion. Also at that time 20% of the tunnel had been dug. The Linear Accelerator was up and running and we had just passed the Acceptance Test  of the Magnet Test Facility that was capable of testing ten magnets at a time. This was important as the test facility had to re-liquefy helium and nitrogen gas to run through the magnets. No small feat. The test lab was a jungle of doubled walled vacuum sealed stainless steel piping. When you pump and control the flow of liquid gas that&#39;s -450 degrees,  you have to know what you&#39;re doing.<br><br>OK, enough.

Does a photon transfer spatial curvature from one location to another? Wrap a piece of wire around a pencil and it can produce a 3D coil of wire, much like a spring. When viewed from the side it can look like a two-dimensional sine wave. You could coil the wire with either a right-hand twist, or with a left-hand twist. Could Planck&#39;s Constant be proportional to the twist cycles. A photon with a higher frequency has more energy. (More spatial curvature). What if gluons are actually made up of these twisted tubes which become entangled with other tubes to produce quarks. (In the same way twisted electrical extension cords can become entangled.) Therefore, the gluons are actually a part of the quarks. Mesons are made up of two entangled tubes (Quarks/Gluons), while protons and neutrons would be made up of three entangled tubes. (Quarks/Gluons) The &quot;Color Force&quot; would be related to the XYZ coordinates (orientation) of entanglement. &quot;Asymptotic Freedom&quot;, and &quot;flux tubes&quot; make sense based on this concept.  Neutrinos would be made up of a twisted torus (like a twisted donut) within this model.  Gravity is a result of a very small curvature imbalance within atoms. (This is why the force of gravity is so small.) Instead of attempting to explain matter as &quot;particles&quot;, this concept attempts to explain matter more in the manner of our current understanding of the space-time curvature of gravity.   If an electron has qualities of both a particle and a wave, it cannot be either one.  It must be something else. It must be something else. Therefore, a &quot;particle&quot; is actually a structure which stores spatial curvature.    Can an electron-positron pair (which are made up of opposite directions of twist) annihilate each other by unwinding into each other producing Gamma Ray photons.", "comment_date": "2022-01-04T00:44:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manos Kallis", "comment_text": "I just love your enthusiasm!!!", "comment_date": "2022-01-03T22:27:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shkvorrel", "comment_text": "4kg...

No I want you to do is take your basic idea of what you assume or what you have remembered a cup of water weighing and then forget about that entirely because you need to go onto a mountain and realize that the cup of water weighs less. Because the cup filled with water actually has less water in it. And if you had gone to the Mariana trench were atmospheric pressure and density or greater that cup would be filled with a lot more water. Similarly at the top of the mountain you\u2019re getting a smaller amount of interactions from stellar winds and you\u2019re getting a smaller amount of found  Bozons than dense lower or closer to core part of the earth. Even the air is thinner on the top of the mountain versus down at the base and it\u2019s more likely to freeze up at the top versus down at the valley. Physics works differently in different pressures. And the actual bozon is a particle that went through space it finally into right with something gave office energy in the form of a flash and that flash has a certain amount of energy to give so it\u2019s short-lived flash from a long lasting traveller that finally bumped into something. Well if you took a Mariana trench bozon test you would get an insane density if the bozon could get down there in the first place. Because they\u2019re more likely to run into the lake depths and not have much more to give off at the depths of the deep. Am I wrong?

The truth is much much simpler than any physicists realise, the inequality that solves the double slit experiment is explained in 4 sentences and illustrated in an experiment diagram right at the start of the Theory of Everything that works, it shows that it is always waves travelling through the spacetime fabric/dark matter lattice that is alive and communicates with us.

Even if the measurement is not a fluctuation, even if our theories are right, this measurement does <b>not</b> necessarily mean we are seeing signs of undiscovered forces or particles. Making the g-2 theoretical prediction is a very very complicated procedure. There is a lot of room for there to be mistakes or unrecognized imprecisions in the process. So the number we compare the experimental result to is about as likely to be the source of the discrepancy as the measurement itself is. It&#39;s certainly an intriguing outcome, and either way we will probably make progress - either by discovering something new, or by improving our ability to make precise predictions based on our theories. But I wouldn&#39;t place my bets on this being an actual sign of new physics just yet. Also, there is a good reason why we apply a 5 sigma threshold. Statements like &quot;there is only a 1 in 40,000 chance this is a statistical fluctuation&quot; sound like it is almost certainly not. But you need to take into account that we make many many measurements of various quantities. And if we measure many thousands of parameters, then a couple of them are bound to fluctuate as far out as this one. It&#39;s perfectly normal. Of course only the large fluctations get discussed in public, but you won&#39;t be surprised to hear that we have thousands of measurements that are <b>not</b> deviating from the Standard Model this much.", "comment_date": "2021-04-27T14:09:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Walker", "comment_text": "Ah, so when scientists scoff at the idea we could accidentally destroy ourselves by turning the Earth in to a hot gray goo by accidentally creating strangelets, or that we could create a blackhole that they dismiss as self evaporating, they actually don&#39;t know what the F*** they are talking about.  There is now so much more they do not know than they do that anything is possible.

When the entirety of mankind and the whole of the planet is the wager one does not bet it all on unknown physics.  The standard model turned out to be wrong on the atomic scale when they confirmed quantum mechanics, and quantum mechanics does not work at higher scales, and now we know there is a lot more to the laws of the universe than previously even dreamed of.

It turned out that there was a more distant planet acting on Uranus. Not so happily, a few men calculated the new planet&#39;s trajectory, but neither could get any astronomers to look (they were busy). Finally one did (in Germany) and he found it in 10 minutes using the calculations. Particle accelerators are like inverse telescopes, taking us further into the unknown of the inner universe.<br><br>THE PHILOSOPHICAL (NOT SO HAPPY HERE)<br>Second, let&#39;s say that another particle or force IS discovered. Two philosophical questions arise: &quot;Why did you bother?&quot; and &quot;Now what?&quot; Right now, since philosophy is lagging far behind science, the answers will be feeble. clownish, and clueless (as any reply to this will illustrate), and thus ultimately suicidal (sorry, current humans - cluelessness destroys everything). Adequate answers DO exist now (see the Philosophy of Broader Survival), but they are most likely not for current humans, who are stuck in their current weak philosophical frameworks.<br><br>I was also going to mention that once a new discovered is made by scientists, then the engineers go to work (&#39;a&#39; What&#39;s Next, but not THE &#39;What&#39;s Next&#39;). But since they are all clueless (philosophers having failed them), it doesn&#39;t really matter. does it... humanity is doomed on its current path (enter A.I.)...<br><br>A MISUNDERSTANDING<br>Third, someone at work misunderstood things, since he was telling me that they figured out how to EXTEND THE LIFE of the muon by some magnetic force or other. I notice that such a leap in technology actually frightened me, given human cluelessness (cluelessness justifies the fear), and I could see why in the past, people feared and even opposed new discoveries - they had a vague notion that something was seriously wrong with humanity, and more power simply meant more trouble (the Philosophy of Broader Survival pinpoints what is seriously wrong with humanity, just to note, and what the remedy is). I also saw how people can perceive things wrong and draw hasty conclusions based on spotty information, and, worst of all, that I could not tell him that he was in error.

The additional force allowed for is that which couples to baryon minus lepton number. Under it, matter would be positive charges, with right-neutrinos negative (both characteristics opposite for anti-matter).

As you add nothings, it literally becomes a probability equation.  What&#39;s really interesting is that all of these points of nothing can be perceived as different phases of the same point of nothing equally as infinite points of nothing.  It&#39;s a singularity from one perspective and an infinite expanse from another.  The points can only be observed indirectly by how they observe one another.  This was revealed to me in a dream and I was able to place my conscience into one of the points and then two points and then 3 points and so forth.  When a point acknowledges another point, both points only understand that the other point is everywhere around them like they are the nucleus of the other point.  Once a third point is introduced, the magic of comparison and contrast begins and physics is born.  These points are indeed points of nothingness.

A muon hydrogen atom has a smaller diameter than a normal hydrogen atom. Lightning strikes can charge electrons so much that they reach a metastable state that can shrink the diameter of a hydrogen atom to that of a neutron, thus lightning creates free neutrons.

However, within your speaking patterns you have a habit of trailing off in level of volume on text that I think you may feel is only ancillary.  However, for the rest of us, every word you speak is important.  So when you trail off in volume, sometimes that volume is so low that it becomes difficult to hear.  And if we don\u2019t hear those, supposedly ancillary, bits of information, we don\u2019t get the full picture.  And we\u2019d really like to get the full picture, at all times, from you.  You are sharing words of wisdom and making things more understandable to the lay person; us.  I was a freelance realtime court reporter for 22 years, so my job was not only listening to people talk 8 hours a day, but taking down, verbatim, every single word they uttered, and at high speed, and punctuating it so that the attorneys in the room could see the spoken word appear as a written word, instantly on their computer screens.  So, being a person with high listening skills, I just wanted to let you know that if you want to increase your subscriber ship, don\u2019t trail off at toward the ends of your sentences regarding information you feel may just be ancillary or not as important, because from my perspective, every single word you speak is very important!  :-).  Keep up the great work!  I\u2019m listening!  (And learning, because of you).

I don\u2019t believe we will ever hit the \u201cbottom\u201d or the \u201cfundamental building blocks\u201d I think there will always be more to discover forever and the only thing stopping us from seeing that is the precision of our instruments, and our progress down that infinite hole of particles and forces. <br>The idea that well one day rap it up in a neat little bow an go \u201caha I know all!\u201d Is ridiculous. <br><br>We are but tiny humans playing with a relatively small portion of the infinitely small and thinking we have done it all. We haven\u2019t even seen the larger  infinite universe so why would we ever see all of the infinitely small?

Onto of that, its a hypothesis, that we cannot understand the universe without going in and out to collect more precise data, from systems/ sectors that are wildy different in magnitude; i.e. gravity, pressure.. Find such enviroments would make gathering data more relative to how they are produced.<br><br><br>Funny thing this came up in my feed and my buddy and I were hypothesizing a flying device, that for now we stated using magnetic waves. First model was simply based on a two engine systems, and the later was based on singular engine.<br>The engine would produce, Like magnetic lattices that are of the same polarity. (We were thinking of can&#39;t remember but it wasn&#39;t magnetic it was like using mass gravity, but the concept is the same) So the flying shape would produce a cushion of an eletromagnetic field so that it could lift itself. While the craft itself is also charged of the same field. The engine utilizes energy proportional to the mass it needs to move. If you created an envelope of that energy of polarity you could accelerate the object like squishing a white jelly bean between your fingers. So to propel yourself you could squish a side of the aircraft with the same polarity as to repel yourself. We were thinking that charging the air, to producing neutrons as the source, but then we went into gravity design and how a wood table could be pulled by a strong enough magnet... so the conversation went off the rails for while about the design and the lift.<br><br>TO create a stable cushion. The flying object I guess for purposes it would sort of look like a saucer, The field would be at an angular motion ( can&#39;t see it) and it would spin the field rather  than the object. Of course then we talked about neutralizing the field of a human to lessen its mass so a human can accelerate at near light speeds and then return their mass to them, which reducing the mass of a persons would be altering the field of which is the mass, IE making it temporary inert, like... when you have a battery, there are types of switches where you can have it on where the circuit is inner because the current can&#39;t be produced in the current condition, On or off.

It is my understanding that all that &quot;IS&quot; arises out of consciousness and the physical world is derived out of layer upon layer upon layer of mathematical and geometric equations with each sub layer making the subsequent layers possible. <br>If this all seems impossible just contemplate how a series of &quot;1s&quot; and &quot;0s&quot; of a binary  computer system can create rich colorful 3D interactive world with sounds and physics. Why is it physicists seem to ignore what many call chi/life-force dual vortex energy which is the driving force of matter and subatomic particles. You may have seen experiments where this vortex energy can get an item to spin using magnets and then when taken away it continues to spin and remain in motion while being propelled by some invisible force other than magnetism. The same energy that creates the nondecaying movements of subatomic particles.  This is like using a blender to mix a smoothie and then you take it off the base and it continues to spin, you set it on the counter and go to work and when you come home it is still spinning so on until you actively stop it. <br><br>It seems very clear that underneath all of our physical world of particles and known physics there is an entire other world of physics that  makes it all possible. And then likely another sub set of physics that makes even that possible. <br>Just pondering the visuals of the Mandelbrot set  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD2XgQOyCCk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD2XgQOyCCk</a>  can give you an idea where all of this is coming from and where it is going. <br><br>And as complicated as it may all seem it also is simple and easy to understand how and why &quot;All that is&quot; at its core is consciousness. This is how and why consciousness must be present in all matter. From a grain of sand, to a human mind, galaxy or universe. <br>(Putting on hard hat and protective armor for the insults and accusations to come)<br>I can&#39;t pretend to know everything Its just that when the news of a whole new layer of physics has come to light. People who have studied the occult have operated on that assumption for thousands of years. My guess is top level physicists know far more than they are letting on.  Stories of top physicists not being allowed in the labs of other physicists because their devices would always break says it all.

A re-statement I suppose. I am passionate about science communication.<br>Please let me know of any misunderstanding or mistakes I have made: :)<br><br>Let&#39;s say you have a spinning top. You put the top in some apparatus to control its environment.<br>You know the spin rate, the mass distribution, and the strength and direction of gravity. You know of any electromagnetic properties and effects. You know the surface finishes of components and the air density, etc, allowing you to calculate resistance and damping. You control and characterise any additional forces you can. You take into account earthquakes and the spin and orbit of the earth and moon and account for every disturbance.<br>You calculate the reaction (to within some known precision that depends on the precision of your knowledge of the system) of the top to every force that our understanding of physics predicts that it will interact with. You calculate the error/precision that you expect to be able to measure with your equipment setup.<br>With this, you can calculate the state of the system, i.e. the paths, positions, orientations, velocities, accelerations, etc, over time for the duration of the experiment and the error, i.e. how precise your calculation is. The error of your system depends on many factors, like how precisely you know the initial state of the system and the strengths and directions of the forces, and on the precision of your measuring equipment. But the important fact here is that you have an estimate for the outcome of the experiment, and you know how closely your results should match that estimate.<br>You expect that every measured outcome will fall within the range that you calculated, and you [usually] expect that the results will have a &#39;normal distribution&#39;. <br>That is, the likelihood of any arbitrary result sample being some particular value increases the closer that value is to your expected value, so, when you record the results of many experiments, you expect that most of the results will be close to the estimate, with fewer and fewer near the maximum and minimum of the error range.<br>But when you run the experiment [many times], you find that the results are unexpectedly skewed (the average of the results is &#39;significantly&#39; different to the estimated value). <br>This is not uncommon. In some cases, experimental results can even lie outside the expected range altogether.<br><br>Usually, this sort of discrepancy is because of:<br>a) mistakes or equipment failure during conduction or analysis of experiment,<br>b) incorrect assumptions/estimates of precision of equipment and/or initial state of the system <br>or c) disturbances, or forces either unconsidered, or considered but incorrectly assumed insignificant.<br><br>You seek fresh eyes, take critiques on your methodology from other scientists, double check assumptions and equipment, and consider every force and effect known to man, but the discrepancy remains.<br><br>Another team attempts to recreate your experiment more carefully and with different, possibly more precise equipment in another part of the world. They account for anything you may have missed and implement tighter controls. <br>The error range is now tighter because of the more precise controls and measurements. If the anomalous result was caused by some environmental factor or some experimental mistake, the new results will likely disagree with the initial experiment.<br>The results of the second teams experiment agree with the initial experiment. <br><br>This suggests that there might be some force acting that is not known or predicted by our current knowledge of physics.<br><br>This is similar to the actual &#39;almost discovered&#39; discovery, except the forces that affect the system come from phenomena less commonly understood by the layman such as the quantum vacuum foam, and the precision involved is mind boggling.<br><br>Confidence in experimental results and conclusions is complex and can depend on many factors and can be represented in several ways. Generally, more data points, less experimental error, and a lower spread (data points are closer together), the more confidence there will be in the result. <br>One standardized way of quantifying confidence is measured in &#39;sigma&#39;, with 5 sigma usually being required to announce a discovery in the field of particle physics.<br>A 5 sigma result that indicates some conclusion means that, if the conclusion is false, the chance of getting that or any more strongly indicative results (i.e. the chance of a false positive) is about 1 in 3.5 million.", "comment_date": "2021-04-11T11:25:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Owens", "comment_text": "This was really hard to listen to... can&#39;t stand girls with that false croaky voice.", "comment_date": "2021-04-11T11:24:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Twisted", "comment_text": "i think i have a crush on her...", "comment_date": "2021-04-11T11:24:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pat Garner", "comment_text": "That was so fun, thank you!

You have a certain number of variables each of which can interact with the others in certain ways,; the reference frame being all possible interactions.   Things that are discovered often fit reliably into the current reference frame.  When we discover something that definitely exists but our reference frame can&#39;t explain or account for it, that is a strong indication that there are variables in play that we don&#39;t know about.  Which means the entire reference frame can change.  My personal opinion is that contemporary physics (and science overall) is nearing the end of empirical reduction as the optimal logic model that serves as its core set of organizing principles (philosophy of science).  That doesn&#39;t mean empirical reduction is obsolete or in any way &quot;wrong&quot;,  but that as a logic model it defines the limits of what can be known and these limits have been put to the test over the last several decades.

The good thing is that this value can be measured from an experiment AND calculated from the theory. Another interesting property of G-factor is that G-factor of one type of particle depends on all other possible particles and interactions in the theory. And G-factor for an electron was calculated a long time ago and its theoretical estimation matches experimental one with extreme precision. However, it can also be calculated for a different type of particle, the muon, and the experiment has shown that the value is ever so slightly different from theory. Since its theoretical value is based on all other particles in the theory, it means that either the theory is wrong (unlikely) or that there&#39;s some particles in it that we don&#39;t know of(more likely).", "comment_date": "2021-04-10T03:26:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TimeAndChance", "comment_text": "May the Forces be with you", "comment_date": "2021-04-10T03:25:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Sannikov", "comment_text": "how come your editors don&#39;t know this? particle mass spectroscopy is the standard university course.", "comment_date": "2021-04-10T03:20:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryan BSA", "comment_text": "What your saying is the &quot;standard model&quot; is a work in progress.<br>Wait until they find out the standard model particles are themselves made of many much smaller particles.<br>Science is the process in which we find out just how much we don&#39;t know...   ad infinitum.<br>Girl, I would really like to talk to you about something I&#39;ve given about 50 years of thought to.

You have cosmic rays coming through our atmosphere and on the high side where the atmosphere is thinner at the top of the Mountain where you have less muons. Then at the base of the Mountain you have more muons. You also have thicker atmosphere giving more particles to interact with the cosmic rays in order to produce more muons. You could consider this from a point of view of the northern lights. How often have the citizens of Florida commented about they saw the northern lights? And yet citizens of Alaska see them on a very regular basis. Why is this? The earth is a giant magnet and so the cosmic rays, drawn by that magnetic force, which tend to rain down on the North Pole. Now as that it is these cosmic rays that create the northern lights the people living further north tend to see them regularity. As for those further south, who\u2019s view is blocked by the curvature of the earth, never see them. We know that cosmic rays coming from all directions so why don\u2019t Floridians see the aurora borealis being generated in the atmosphere above them? The answer is not a high enough concentration of cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere. That\u2019s showing that the magnetic energy surrounding the earth can affect cosmic rays but it doesn\u2019t prove anything about altering time based on speed. So for those cosmic raise that rain down and are not affected by the magnetic field of the earth they would have the same effect of hitting a more dense atmosphere at a lower elevation as a higher concentration of cosmic rays hitting a less dense atmosphere at a higher elevation, more interaction.

Anyway, plugging this in yielded 1.7*10^-3 which makes sense considering our initial values were about 10^4 apart. Then multiplying this by the average humans mass in kilograms gives us .108Kg.
