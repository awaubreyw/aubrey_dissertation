I think. I may be wrong. Infact I&#39;m probably wrong.<br><br>The only way I can think that the boat would move up or down is if the more dense liquid water leaves more space for air to fill into the bottom of the boat (to fill up the volume deficit created by the solid water becoming liquid water).

Long answer, yes with a but.<br><br>Any of the changes due to the process of dropping water are small forces that have less &quot;impact&quot; than common forces such as those caused by waves and even ripples in the water. Very tight experimental control would be required to measure the changes. <br><br>First, the actual drip. Frozen water in the cube has a downward force transmitted through your body and into the boat. The boat displaces a mass of water equal to the mass of the cube, in addition to other water displaced. At the moment of the drip less force is transmitted through the body witch could cause a slight rise of the boat.<br><br>While in free fall, the drop will displace air molecules, which in turn displace other air molecules. As the force is transferred through the air, some force is lost to air motion and a slight temperature rise due to the mechanical work of moving the air. Some of that force transfers to the deck of the boat, causing it to go back down, but not as much as it rose initially. Very sensitive equipment is required to measure this change, and other movement in the air will mask these readings.<br><br>Next, the drop impacts the deck. This is an impulse force that pushed down on the boat. The dip caused by the impulse of the impact is determined by the mass of the drop, the velocity at the time of impact, and the viscosity, which affects the duration of the impact and the force transferred into the deck and the energy lost to changing the shape of the droplet. This pushes the boat downward, but only while the impact takes place.<br><br>Now, the droplet of water is on the deck. The boat, with some buoyant motion, returns to the original height. But the ripples from the changes may reflect back to the boat and prolong the time needed to reach equilibrium. <br><br>We also need to consider the environment. The cold ice, depending of the humidity of the air, will cause water to condense from the air and add to the mass of the water in the cube and on the deck. This would result in the final position of the boat being lower. However, depending of the thermal characteristics is the deck, it will take heat energy from the sun and air and raise the temperature of the water causing some to evaluate. This will result in the final position being higher.<br><br>Early on, condensation will win, but if we let the experiment go on long enough evaporation will win and no water will be left, leaving the boat higher.<br><br>Edit: spelling", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T17:48:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrey Shmotyev", "comment_text": "Me at 3 pm:<br>Nah, the level won&#39;t change<br><br>Me at 3 in the night rewatching this video:<br>Well, technically, the &quot;water dripping to the bottom of the boat from the ice cube in your hand&quot; thing, globally, the boat will not move up or down because the mass doesn&#39;t change (unless the water evaporates after melting, so it will go up, but that&#39;s a different story).<br>But, the very moment the droplet leaves your hand, the boat will go up a little, as the drop is mid-air,\u00a0<br>and on impact, will go down a little, further than initially, because of the shock delivered by the drop.

When the droplet hits the boat the boat winks back to the point it was before, because the water droplet had gained momentum, the law of conservation of momentum kicks in and the boat sinks deeper and then buoyancy pushes the boat back up. Bouncing back and forth like on a  spring. I just exaggerated the droplet to be extremely huge and heavy hence my conclusion. Thank you for making these videos they are really fun to watch.

The way I see it there are a few phases and variables to consider. <br><br>First, when the ice is completely solid, the mass of you and the mass of the ice are contributing to the overall mass of the boat. So let&#39;s suppose there is no bobbing at this time. <br><br>Now we get to the first drip. Once it drips, the moment it releases from the boat, there is less mass in the boat!  So, in theory, it will experience an tiny acceleration due to the buoyant force being unbalanced, and it will rise. In practice I&#39;m not sure what would happen since the droplet is so tiny the effect might be negligible. BUT if we take it to the extreme and imagine you&#39;re holding a boulder (this is a special boat that wont sink in imagination land) when it is released the boat will definitely respond and rise!<br><br>However!  Once the droplet (or boulder if you like) lands again in the boat its mass is now accounted for again in the overall mass of the boat. But we&#39;re not done. It wont return to the original equilibrium position because a) the boat gained momentum during that interval where its mass was lessened and b) the droplet gained momentum while falling. So if the boat was initially completely at rest, it is now has some imparted momentum. (This isn&#39;t energy for free BTW, it came from the work gravity did on the droplet/boulder and the work buoyancy did on the boat)  So at this moment, not only is it not at equilibrium, but it has some momentum. This means oscillation, and that means bobbing. <br><br>So we&#39;re done right? We can easily describe the motion now as a simple harmonic oscillator, right? Heck no. Not even close. <br><br>Another droplet will fall some time later, which depends on the heat exchange between your hand, the ice, and the environment. This will also change the droplet size (which is basically the mass change of the boat AND is proportional to the imparted momentum of the droplet). Furthermore, how tall are you?  This will effect the imparted momentum as well. Higher height correlates to more momentum (not linearly though: it&#39;s related by the square root of the height).  It will also change how long the droplet is subtracted from the mass of the boat.  Also, what&#39;s the mass of the boat?  That will affect the acceleration it experiences and therefore its change in momentum. Also, what is the shape of the boat? The buoyant force is proportional to the volume of water displaced, not the height.  So the change in height will depend on the geometry of the boat. ALSO, are you in seawater or freshwater? This will effect the buoyancy force which is proportional to the density of the water, which in turn (you guessed it) will change the momentum of the boat. <br><br>All of this is just to say that thee most likely will be some very slight bobbing, but the exact nature of the bobbing is incredibly complex, dynamic, and dependent on quite a few parameters. It will very likely not be a simple sine wave. <br><br>Sorry for the very long response, and if you got this far, thanks for reading. ;)", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T04:37:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pranav Rk", "comment_text": "Diane opens purple laser:<br>Mace windu had entered the chat", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T04:36:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Casey Handmer", "comment_text": "Olive oil also fluoresces nicely.

Water molecules constantly lose and gain hydrogen atoms.

At what point is the water molecule no longer the same molecule? If it has replaced one of its hydrogen atoms? Both? Maybe we should just track the oxygen atoms then?<br><br>When water goes into a living cell, all kinds of weird stuff can happen. In photosynthesis the water is broken apart and used to build sugar molecules. But even in animal cells, the process used to burn those suger molecules for energy uses water to break the sugar into smaller parts. Parts of these water molecules become part of the new smaller molecules, while some of the hydrogen atoms are carried of in NADH; one of the energy carrying molecules in your body.<br><br>But even in the ocean, water can react with CO\u2082 from the air to form to form carbonic acid (which gives fizzy drinks a slightly acidic taste). Then, after some time the carbonic acid turns back into water and CO\u2082, but it might not be the same oxygen atom that turns back into water.

Here it goes. When a drop of water is hanging on to the ice cube, its mass is acting on the boat, but when the drop leaves the ice and starts its freefall to the deck, it is weightless and its mass is no longer acting on the boat, so the boat would rise a drops worth. When the drop hits the deck, its mass is once again acting on the boat and the boat would not only go back to its original position, but the energy being stored up in the drop from its freefall would, for a moment, make the boat drop lower and then rebound to its original position before the drop left the ice cube.
