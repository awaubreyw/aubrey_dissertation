To produce electricity, the only thing you have to do is to make the magnet pass through the coil. <br>What I&#39;m getting at is that you don&#39;t need weights at each end. The force required to move the magnet does not have to exceed the required force you need to move the mass of the magnet, or in other words, you don&#39;t produce double the electricity by doubling the weight of the moving part. <br>With the design Diana made, you&#39;d have to move the mass of the magnet AND the mass of the dumbbell (which is made to be tiresome after a certain extent)<br>I am proposing a &quot;spray can&quot;  design where the magnet sits inside a lightweight tube with springs attached to each end (the springs helps to conserve some of the kinetic energy by converting it into potential energy and thereby save some of the energy that would be lost due to thermal energy by the magnet slamming into the walls)<br>and then, of course, have the coil sitting on the outside of the lightweight tube. <br>This design only fixes the weight problem but if you think about it, you can shake an almost empty spray can a lot longer than a 5 lbs dumbbell. Other minor fixes could be having a coil with a lot more wiring spun around it and for example having  two magnets put together on a small stick (like a mini dumbbell) which makes two magnets pass the large coil - which means double the energy per shake (plus the factor of the times the wire is spun around the coil)<br><br>These thoughts are only meant as inspirational and as a positive critique.

What I mean is that it didn&#39;t look like most of the effort and work that you put into shaking the shakeweight went into electricity in the coil, ie. it wasn&#39;t very well tuned for it. I know that would add a lot of more difficulty to the project but in the end, the numbers you gave at the end would have been a bit more accurate. In my opinion it should have been a shakeweight-like device that produces all of the resistance that you need to work out from the magnet moving through the coil. But there is a thing that does that: an exercise bike! A lot of them rely on magnets and copper to produce the resistance to turn that you need to work out, so using one  could also have been a lead to some more interesting trivia. I don&#39;t know if shakeweights also function this way, but if they do, it&#39;s a shame that you couldn&#39;t use that instead of the tiny coil.<br><br>Still, just some minor criticism.

Windmills kill more bats per year than any other man-made object, and actually cause damage to the weather and climate around the windmill farms, because they stifle the movement of wind (like a forest, but without any of the benefits of tons of trees). Solar Farms use tons of cleaning chemicals to keep the solar panels free of dust, bird poop, and so on. Also, during hot days, they can reflect so much light and radiate so much heat that birds flying overhead can burst into flames and crash down on the solar panels.

If the resistance is lower, it just makes you work harder to maintain the same voltage across the resistor. So, when you talk about a power plant or a generator, it maces more sense to talk about its capacity instead of its instantaneous output.<br>2)The shake-weight is hardly a renewable or green source by any means. You grow corn and use a lot of fossil fuel and other chemicals or processes that use a lot of fossil fuel to do it. Then, you eat the corn or feed it to a cow and eat the cow. You burn that energy to move your arm and force a coil through changing magnetic field. If scaled to power a house, this whole chain would only leave devastation in its wake at every step.

I agree with you and I strongly believe that we have to think more responsibly about our sources/use of energy.

Just because we tend to be very lazy. &quot;Why would I bother installing a solar panel on my roof, if I already get all the power I need? I just need to keep my bills paid, and that&#39;s it&quot;. I know this sounds non-optimistic, but there are so many people thinking that way, and I think that we aren&#39;t able to change that conscience in our lifetime, unfortunatelly.<br><br>But let&#39;s change to a hypothetical scenario and consider that if I install a solar panel on my roof, I will start paying 35% less on my electricity bills (or maybe more, who knows). I guarantee to you that many more people who originally didn&#39;t bother about sources/use of energy (just because of laziness) would now start to consider using it because it would bring a benefit to the &quot;human&#39;s most sensitive organ&quot;: their pocket.<br><br>From my point of view, we are currently evolving at a rate that we had never done before, and that&#39;s amazing.

I find the figures of 2016 and in regard to electricity, it was 31.5%. In regard to heating (13.1%) and transportation (5.2%), we&#39;re also still at low levels. Regenerative electricity percentage grew steadily since Fukushima, and it may play a role our Chancellor Angela Merkel is a physicist that our &quot;Republican&quot; party CDU took a topic of the &quot;Green&quot; party. Of course, protests played a role, too, and it all goes less steady as it may be possible. There still is much dispute about coal and much more to say, there is overall progress, though. In the long term even if energy consumption rises drastically there is a theoretical abundance of solar energy available to harvest in many forms. Even just the tiny amount of sunlight hitting earth has an energy of 1.5 billion TWh per year, whereas the energy consumption worldwide is only 100,000 TWh.
