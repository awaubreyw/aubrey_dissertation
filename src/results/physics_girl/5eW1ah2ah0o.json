Such a shockwave won&#39;t be very large in space and won&#39;t propagate very far, but if a conventional missile detonates just outside an enemy vessel, the pressure difference should be enough to breach the hull. This is because vessels made for travel in a vacuum are made to hold an atmosphere in/ to keep pressure in from a low pressure outside.

What you failed to consider is that the fictional space vehicles where pressurized and in most cases these fiction space vehicles were exploded from the inside out. In this case the pressurized vehicles would had an atmosphere to create an explosives blast wave within the vehicles themselves. The question would be what would happen to the blast wave once the outer hull of the vehicle was destroyed. If the destruction of the hull contained enough blast wave force it would be reasonable that the sound of the wave would be carried in to space. Just how far would depend on many factors, size of the vehicle, size of explosion within the vehicle, strength of the hull  and amount of pressure created before the hull failed. The list of factors are almost endless with so little to no information about a fictional space vehicle. So what could or could not be heard in space and how far would such sound carry is an unknown.

Every one that comes to mind used projected energy weapons like laser beams. Those that used missiles typically scored direct hits to destroy an enemy. Galactica also used some kind of projectile weapons that also required a direct hit. In fact, the majority of ordinary jet fighter war movies usually show missiles that score direct hits, because it looks way cooler to the audience to see the missile hit the plane instead of blowing up nearby and using shrapnel to take out the target.Come to think of it, pressure wave damage is going to be minimal because the amount of explosives you can carry on a missile are going to be small, and at high altitude the air is so thin it might as well be in space. Most jet fighter missiles use metal rods in the warhead to create shrapnel, and don&#39;t rely on the pressure wave for damage.
