[{"comment_by": "Physics Girl", "comment_text": "As promised, I\u2019m posting my solutions to the magnet riddle and looking through your solutions (holy moly, lots of comments.) Breaking the magnet in half could work! But there\u2019s the possibility of demagnetizing the metal by hitting it too hard. (It\u2019s possible to MANGETIZE some metals by hitting them hard in a strong external magnetic field and DEMAGNETIZE them by hitting them hard. I don\u2019t know how hard\u2026) So I\u2019d break bar A, test whether it sticks to bar B, if it does, then break bar B, and try sticking the A pieces to themselves and the B pieces to themselves. If none of them sticks, it was bar B. If A or B sticks to its own half, it\u2019s that one.<br><br>Other solutions I thought of that may or may not work: Similar to above, hitting the bars one by one and seeing whether they still stick (also thought up by Banane Dollar and others). Shaving off some pieces of iron, and seeing which bar they stick to. (alsothought up by +Wynchesster and many others) Moving a loop of wire connected to an ammeter near the magnet to see whether any current is produced. (If so that\u2019s the magnet.)<br><br>Ruven Pinkhasov thought of the traditional (and my fav) solution to this riddle because it uses NO tools: move the bars orthogonal to each other forming a T shape. The non-magnet will feel a change along the length of the magnet, which have a weaker pulling the middle, and stronger toward the ends. This solution assumes the bars have a simple long-ways N-S configuration, but no matter the magnetization configuration, this method could work somehow. Also pros to Krekker Recer, Nipun Wahi and others!<br><br>Ravi Sharma thought of hanging the bars from a string and seeing which aligns with earth\u2019s magnetic field. I don\u2019t know if this would work in practice because it depends on the strength of the bar\u2019s magnetization and the weight of the bars relative to torsional forces in the string. But in theory, it should work with a strong enough magnet in a strong enough external magnetic field. Props to Dan Kennedy, Abi Rozario and others for thinking of this.<br><br>Adam Pearce, TANGENT PROPELLER and Kenny Maccormac and others would try heating the bars, then touching them (presumably after they&#39;ve cooled again?) to see which one becomes unmagnetized after heating. They\u2019d have to get pretty hot: beyond the Curie temperature of iron<br><br>Creativity award goes to Valtteri Huuskonen who would use a phone manometer. Borderline cheating\u2026<br><br>Thanks for SO many comments answering the riddles! If you have suggestions for other riddle guests, best to leave them in a channel comment.
