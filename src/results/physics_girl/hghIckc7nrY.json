If they could get these hydrogen power car prove with cheaper filling up 5 minute does not bug me where the pump doesn&#39;t freeze and the point where I can get more than 270 miles to the next fill up 500 miles would definitely make me think about getting one of these vehicles. They want to get more people on board they need to make Improvement type of vehicles and there&#39;s a lot of people in California that make a long commute to get to work and make it possible so people can also make long road trips for vacation cross country Drive if more of these stations to become very common to get people to move away from the combustible engine. The majority of people think more about convenience than anything else therefore you got to make these vehicles with way more miles per fill up and the stations would be as common as gas station on every corner.

Batteries get hot when you&#39;re using them as hard as you would in a race, and that decreases their efficiencies. Plus, refueling time matters in racing, another major drawback to BEVs. FCEVs obviously solve every one of those concerns, so they should be better for racing than both BEVs or ICEVs. The only potential drawback to FCEVs is weight, that fuel cell is essentially one big block of very expensive metal; but as long as you have a better fuel (and hydrogen is a much better fuel than hydrocarbons), you&#39;ll still leave ICEVs in the dust.

I figured out his setup too cause the circular plates has to be very close to together but not touching each other with using direct current from inside smaller circle to the bigger outside circle metals and I also think he used a magnet on the outside circular metal to realign the extra electrons to it so the electrons are facing upwards so when the current comes into the center circular metal that it will automatically discharge instantly to the outside circular metal so the water inbetween will seperate the hydrogen and oxygen then will also both will collect to the outside circular inside part so you have to shake them off from the bottom so the hydrogen and oxygen will float to the top of water then to be exstaked outward to be used safely then to car !!!

To do so, you look for clues that help you work your way toward the solution. In his inspired Word, God provides the needed clues with regard to the number 666, the name, or mark, of the wild beast of Revelation chapter 13.\r<br>In the Bible, we learn four main lines of reasoning\u2014vital clues\u2014that will reveal the meaning of the mark of the beast. We will consider (1) how Bible names are sometimes chosen, (2) the identity of the wild beast, (3) what is meant by 666 being \u201ca man\u2019s number,\u201d and (4) the significance of the number 6 and why it is written in triple digits, namely, 600 plus 60 plus 6, or 666.\u2014Revelation 13:18.\r<br>Bible Names\u2014More Than Just Labels\r<br>Bible names often have special significance, particularly when given by God. For example, because Abram would become the father of nations, God changed the patriarch\u2019s name to Abraham, meaning \u201cFather of a Multitude.\u201d (Genesis 17:5, footnote) God told Joseph and Mary to call Mary\u2019s future child Jesus, which means \u201cJehovah Is Salvation.\u201d (Matthew 1:21, footnote; Luke 1:31) In harmony with that meaningful name, through Jesus\u2019 ministry and sacrificial death, Jehovah made possible our salvation.\u2014 John 3:16. Accordingly, the God-given number-name 666 must symbolize what God sees as defining attributes of the beast. Naturally, to understand those traits, we need to identify the beast itself and learn about its activities.\r<br>The Beast Exposed --- The full text of this information has about 1700 words and I would gladly send you the full transcript by email. --- Please note this very carefully; Matt <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hghIckc7nrY&amp;t=24m14s\">24:14</a> And this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. --- This prophecy has been fulfilled, but the work continues up to the beginning of the Great Tribulation. There are now more than 8.6 million persons walking in Almighty God\u2019s Holy Name (as I do) and doing this work by witnessing for Almighty Jehovah God to anyone who will willingly listen. Please read Exodus 20:7 in your own Bible to learn that Almighty God will not permit His Name to be used for a worthless purpose, which is why the \u2018churches\u2019 are not allowed to use His Name. For the first time in history all persons alive on this earth knows God\u2019s Holy Name and this work is the reason for that. If you want to know more, please ask.

The amount of energy lost through hydrogen production, transport and filling is crazy. It is also extremely expensive to produce and store hydrogen for standard filling stations. The fuel cell only extracts 40-60% of the energy from the hydrogen which comes from electrolysis (which is also only around 80% efficient). After all those steps the final energy efficiency is actually very low and even approaching internal combustion engine numbers. An EV lithium-ion battery is around 99% efficient when the energy is extracted. The only real benefit of a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is that it&#39;s quick to fill-up compared to current EV charging times.

Still have to run everything same as an ice powered car.  Is this any real difference than a diesel running on used cooking oil?  Not really it is still the same 100 year old technology.

HFC is DOA! \ud83d\udc80<br><br>\ud83d\udcad Hydrogen for cars is DOA \u2620\ufe0f because of the cost of the vehicle compared to \ud83d\udd0b BE (battery electric) and the required infrastructure that has to be built. That said I think larger transportation systems that travel long distances might benefit from hydrogen fuel cells as the infrastructure needs are smaller. Point A to point B and return. Semi-trucks and ships would see an advantage as they have fixed routes mostly. But... as I mentioned, cheaper will always win out. <br><br>The first autonomous container ship isn&#39;t powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, it&#39;s 100% BE. Why? Because it&#39;s a short-haul to many ports where they just can plugin as needed and it&#39;s lower cost than HFC. I&#39;ve seen a few BE-powered ferries that have rapid charging systems (RCS) built into the docks by ABB. A computer manages the power connections upon arrival and departure. <br><br>What about using HFC? Well, what they have learned is there is an issue with HFCs, and it&#39;s called &#39;Throttle Lag&#39;. While that could be supplemented with batteries to pick up the slack, why not just use batteries in the first place? With increased complexity, there are increased costs. The second-largest ferry system in the world is going all on BE. The routes are set in stone. The infrastructure is cheap to build. Plans to move to BE ferries are already underway.<br><br>Aviation would be the only major beneficiary of HFCs. Batteries are very heavy. HFCs make a lot of sense for long-haul aviation applications. Airline and cargo aircraft need to keep the weight low. There is fierce competition between HFCs and BEs. With small short-haul flights, BE wins. A few companies have done their testing and have orders for BE airplanes. Long hauls it&#39;s a different story as major airliner builders are making plans to prove their chosen tech will work. I think HFC will win out for long-haul routes.<br><br>As for Toyota... It&#39;s a fool&#39;s errand. All this brainpower is going to waste. If Toyota was using their HFC for marine use, then I would happily install one in my boat. The longer range that takes up less space would out weight the use of BE. But there is a problem. I would have to get hydrogen trucked to all my ports of call. Why not just plugin or use Solar, Wind, and Hydrogen to recharge my batteries? Megayachts are already being designed with these other techs. <br><br>Yeah, HFCs are DOA. I wish they could work right now but we are a very long way from making them viable. Had they been invented and used in the 1980s then it would beat out BE. It&#39;s like VHS vs Betamax. Betamax is better, but cheaper VHS won out. \ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2021-08-15T19:06:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mixima101", "comment_text": "Ugh. this is seriously cringe", "comment_date": "2021-08-15T18:52:10Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "geirha75", "comment_text": "What about heating inside a hydrogen car?

Thanks for sharing your thoughts and adventures visiting Toyota and reviewing this car.

As nice as this car appears it would be a shame for it to fail to thrive because of required infrastructure. This new technology requires very little infrastructure as delivery could be as close as your Amazon delivery or sold at any local retail shop. The best part is it can also be refilled many times and when it needs to be recycled you would get a payment from the recycler in addition to the core fee.

A few very general tips that I have for those wishing to produce a high quality production like this one, follow:  Do not over-crop the sound track because breaks are needed between words, phrases, sentences and paragraphs, for the listener to fully absorb what is being spoken.  Likewise do not speed up the audio-video, for the same reason.  It is also important to use speech intonation carefully, only to enhance communication and avoid arbitrary variations in intonation,  which can be as distracting as long ums, ers and aahs.  Avoid filler phrases.  If speech flourishes are just that then a silent space would better serve the listener.  Listen to some of the great orators delivering their finest speeches, especially those from the mid twentieth century.   Their sentences are rich with meaning, carefully spoken and well spaced.

The one thing I heard that makes sense, is her comment, &quot;We can&#39;t get there by batteries alone.&quot;  I&#39;d really like to dig at that.  Hydrogen, for the reason she cited at the beginning of the video that hydrogen is highly reactive and is not found on Earth as H2, means, that unlike fossil fuel, that is really stored solar energy over millions of years, conveniently compressed by geologic processes over that same period, hydrogen must be &quot;mined&quot; - in the same way that copious amounts of electricity is required to melt, then electrolyze bauxite, to produce all the aluminum that we use in modern industrial society, so too must some starter material, such as water, have a great deal of energy input in order to separate the hydrogen.  A childhood demonstration is to take a glass drink container with a narrow neck, and put a few strips of aluminum foil in the bottom, add a couple of tablespoons of lye (sodium hydroxide), then take a ballon, fill it &quot;lightly&quot; (no need to expand the ballon), fasten the mouth of the balloon around the mouth of the drink container, and upend the balloon, dumping the water into the bottle.  The resulting reaction is highly exothermic, and will inflate the balloon.  This is pure hydrogen (plus some water vapor) and will float the balloon nicely for a short time.  As pointed out by the Toyota lady, and Diana&#39;s dad, the molecules are so small, the balloon (a typical latex one) will quickly deflate.  And we all know there are NO perpetual motion machines, so the energy required to produce the hydrogen, to compress the hydrogen, to transport the hydrogen, to dispense the hydrogen, then factor in the inefficiency in the electric power chain, and the motive energy to move the car and occupants will be far less than the input.  Of course, if the hydrogen production can benefit from otherwise waste energy, and renewables, and fusion when that gets here - that&#39;ll be another story.

Currently, Lithium is still the number one sought after resource for manufacturing high performance and long lasting batteries. And the more car manufactures turn to sourcing these batteries, as they increase the number of EV models in their ranges, the more pressure is put on the Lithium resources available in the world. While Lithium needs to mined and can only be obtained from certain areas in world, Hydrogen is basically available everywhere. Yes, it may be a costly process to obtain Hydrogen and store is safely in volumes, but the fact that the pressure on Lithium is increasing, due to increased demand, makes Hydrogen propulsion a potentially viable alternative still!<br><br>Here is in an interesting observation. Petrol fuel, which is highly flammable, maybe even more so than hydrogen, is stored in a &quot;plastic&quot; fuel tank in your car, while Hydrogen has to be stored in an armored tank... Which means, driving a Hydrogen car these days is far safer than a normal ICE car, if safe storage of the energy source is a concern! <br>I think, somebody clearly did not like that, simply mixing Oxygen with Hydrogen to produce water while providing propulsion, was a good idea... Perhaps somebody (or somebodies) with a HUGE interest in the mining sector??? I clearly remember the &#39;activists&#39; about the safety concerns of transporting Hydrogen, just a few years ago.

They are desperate to get hydrogen adopted widely because they know that it will be impossible to supply hydrogen from electrolysis in industrial quantities. Then they (the fossil fuel people) will step in and say reforming methane is the only way. Reforming methane produced huge quantities of CO2.<br>2) Water vapor, produced either by burning or via a fuel cell, is actually a <b>worse</b> green house gas than CO2. It just doesn&#39;t stick around as long as CO2.<br>3) Electrolysis of water takes a lot of electrical energy but far more energy is needed to compress and cool it to make it transportable and usable. For fuel cells, the hydrogen needs to be compressed to 700 bar - that&#39;s the same as the pressure at 7000 meters (23,000 feet) deep in the ocean. It take&#39;s a lot of energy to do that compression.<br>4) Hydrogen oxidizes explosively. A leaky hydrogen tank in your mirai (and they all leak because it&#39;s impossible to store hydrogen in any container because the atom is small enough to seep through metal) will fill your garage and house with hydrogen and with a small electrical spark - like a light switch being turned on - and your house and you will be destroyed.<br>5) For fuel cells the hydrogen has to be very pure otherwise the very expensive rare metal catalysts will be ruined.

In order to make Hydrogen you have to use electricity and a lot of it.  6. In order to store enough hydrogen in a vehicle it has to highly compressed. 7. Storage both in car and at a fueling station is exceedingly expensive. 8. None of the other car makers setting the &quot;standard&quot; are even investing in Hydrogen Fuel Cell cars 9. BEV Costs are rapidly closing in on parity with ICE. 10. BEV&#39;s have (several) nationwide networks of rapid charging stations. 11. BEV&#39;s can charge at home or at their destination or anywhere there is an electrical outlet. 12. People can and do generate their own electricity at home to run their BEV&#39;s.

Plug in stations are not as complex to expensive to install, and I can see a future where drive in restaurants (like Sonic and A&amp;W) will have plug in stalls where you hook up your car, order lunch, and by the time you&#39;re done eating the car&#39;s ready to go. While Hydrogen Fuel Cells fill up speeds are on par with traditional gas and diesel tech, there are very few places currently that offer Hydrogen. Stations are going to have to commit not only to new tanks and pumps, but they may need to decide if they are going to commit to onsite production as well.<br><br>Where I see Hydrogen winning out over plug in&#39;s is the commercial fleet sector. This is busses, delivery trucks, municipal vehicles, etc. It makes more sense to build a hydrogen fueling center with stalls, tank, and hydrogen production equipment in a corner of a motor pool yard. The refueling time per vehicle means that you&#39;d need far less hydrogen pumps over EV plug in stalls for a motor pool. Likewise, Hydrogen makes a natural replacement for the diesel generators in all of the locomotives used by both freight and passenger rail service. (By the way, did you know that rail was the very first transportation sector that used hybrid technology when GE introduced the first Diesel-Electric Locomotive back in 1917?", "comment_date": "2021-08-10T12:32:33Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "supersmashsam", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sorry, but this is just a big advertisement for Toyota.

It&#39;s sad to see that in the comments, many people seem to be missing the forest for the trees. Massive scale green hydrogen production is inevitable for ammonia and methanol production, the former of which is necessary to support agriculture. There are 250GW of green hydrogen electrolysis projects currently in the works, so pearl clutching over where the hydrogen comes from seems a bit shortsighted, for the exactly the same reasons that criticizing BEVs for the source of their electricity would be. Green hydrogen isn&#39;t a choice, it&#39;s a necessity if we want to feed everyone without using fossil fuels.<br><br>The comments on the relative efficiency of fuel cell vehicles versus BEVs are similarly misguided, given that every year, California alone already curtails enough electricity to charge 25 million, 100kWh battery electric vehicles, and no one bats an eye. When VREs like wind and solar provide the backbone of our energy generation, we&#39;re not going to worry about the well-to-wheels efficiency of fuel cells, because we&#39;re going to have far more than enough to go around. Denmark already produces 40% of its electricity demand on average through wind, but this spikes up to 140% during periods of overproduction. If Denmark wanted to meet even 80% of its electricity needs through wind with some level of statistical confidence (say, 80% confidence) it will <b>average</b> more than 100% of its demand every day. At a macro level, this also applies to larger regions like the EU or the US, because they&#39;ll still want some level of statistical confidence in their ability to provide X units of power from variable sources.<br><br>And this is before getting into other issues with BEVs, like coupling between charging times and generation: to charge a BEV with a 100kWh battery in 3 minutes like you would a normal ICEV would require a 2MW charger, which is non-trivial. You can avoid this if trickle charging is everywhere, but then you still need extensive grid upgrades on practically every street corner for those who use on-street parking. The point is: fast charging is only partly about the technology in the battery -- the rest is up to the grid to either be able to produce MWs on demand from variable sources, or to pursue extensive upgrades so that people in apartments don&#39;t have to sit at a fast charger for an hour every week, because they can charge on any street corner. Hydrogen decouples this whole process, since you have massive, steady demand and don&#39;t need to provide instantaneous changes in power, and it&#39;s a source of energy that can be shipped around. It&#39;s not clear to me whether hydrogen is necessarily better for transport than ubiquitous chargers, but it&#39;s 100% clear to anyone who&#39;s paying attention that we&#39;ll be making and shipping a huge amount of hydrogen around anyway, so it almost certainly has a place somewhere in the transport equation.", "comment_date": "2021-08-10T11:16:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Edgewood", "comment_text": "More climate change NONSENSE.

Generating that amount of energy - if a country doesn&#39;t have any nuclear reactor for generating electricity - may polute the air at the same level as a conventional engine though the pollution will concentrate in reduced and specific areas.<br>My point is that as long as countries are using conventional ways to produce electricity, they should stick with conventional vehicles.<br>What do you think?", "comment_date": "2021-08-10T07:26:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dave Turnbull", "comment_text": "Firstly - really great to see Dianna looking a bit better and the old enthusiasm back.<br>Secondly - I&#39;m no scientist and (according to my bank manager at least) struggle with even basic math.<br>Thirdly - I enjoyed this video and while it is at least partly sponsored by Toyota I do trust Dianna to at the very least not include anything she knows to be innacurate.<br>Until I watched this I was under the impression that the energy was produced by burning the hydrogen.

You really must ask Toyota HOW H2 will be produced?  If H2 is from fossil fuels, then FCEVs are a terrible idea for obvious reasons.  If H2 comes from water electrolysis, then this is a poor idea due to poor overall conversion efficiency.  I did an &quot;Musk-like&quot; first principles estimate and found that BEVs are significantly more efficient than FCEVs even when assuming best conversion efficiency for electrolysis, pressurization, and FC electric conversion.  I&#39;d really love to hear what Toyota has to say about this.  My feeling is that Toyota will be very cagy about this aspect of FCEV technology because there is really no good answer to this question.  Until H2 can be produced, distributed, and used in an FCEV at lower cost than BEVs it is doomed to failure due to competition with ever decreasing costs of batteries in particular and BEVs in general.  The only good thing about Toyota doing an FCEV is that at least they are making an electric drivetrain to operate with the FC.  That will save them some time to develop a BEV drive train once they realize their unfortunate choice.

Last I heard the platinum energy catalyst that recombines the hydrogen and atmospheric oxygen is a wear item and it&#39;s very expensive. That means it&#39;s fine for a spacecraft where cost is less important than reusability, but in a car that&#39;s more problematic. And then you don&#39;t want to talk about the cost of platinum.<br><br>Good news, hydrogen is the most plentiful element in the universe as well as on earth, but here it&#39;s never found as raw hydrogen. You can find it in hydrocarbons (fuel) which was thought of as a potential way of getting it to your fuel cell, but water, being 2 parts hydrogen, is relatively simple to separate into it&#39;s elements, except for it&#39;s very energy intensive, and then consumes water which is actually most of the time better used for food or drinking than it is to be converted to oxygen and hydrogen.<br><br>And then as others have mentioned there aren&#39;t any places where you can readily pick up some raw hydrogen, it&#39;s not like all the gas stations in the country are going to start installing hydrogen pumps. This is where battery electric vehicles absolutely destroy hydrogen, EVERYONE has electricity, or if they don&#39;t it&#39;s relatively cost effective to build a solar array at home just to recharge your car.<br><br>All told these are the reasons why Hydrogen Fuel Cell cars have always been 20 years away for the last 50 years, and it&#39;s not likely that Toyota will recoup their investment in it anytime in the next 50 years even.
