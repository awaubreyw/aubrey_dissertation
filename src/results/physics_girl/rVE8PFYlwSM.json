Anyone can see the videos on this with an app that shows you all of the videos that YT has Shadow Banned for a onetime fee of $2.99 That&#39;s two dollars and ninety-nine cents. You can try to type in the exact titles of the videos that contain the truth but they will not come up. This app is incredible. It has dozens of videos on any question about the Earth NASA and space and every subject those bring to mind. It even has a page that has every question you can think of on it. All you do is click the Question mark and dozens of hidden videos come up. The app is at the app store by Blue Water Bay called The Sun Moon and Zodiac Clock app. Or you can just go to Dave Wiess YT channels and the link is in the description of all of his videos. Plus you can listen to Dave do a presentation to a Globe believer at YouTube channels &quot;Flat Earth Dave Interviews&quot; or DITRH Deep Inside The Rabbit Hole&quot;. The Earth is not spinning.

lunar eclipse but joining the total phase she didn&#39;t say that moon doesn&#39;t disappear or she didn&#39;t say that some of the sunlight reaches the moon during the  total phase mainly orange or red which why the moon turns red or orange during a total lunar eclipse and depends on how clear the earths shadow is it can change to yellow or gold or blue and turquoise or a coppery brown , orange or red every eclipse is different from one to the next she also didn&#39;t explain there 4 different types of solar eclipses partial solar eclipse part of the sun is blocked by the moon. total solar eclipse the moon blocks all direct sunlight, annular eclipse is where the moon on the far side on its orbit when it passes in front of the sun completely it can&#39;t block all direct sun light cuz the moon is smaller than the sun during annular solar eclipse so the sun looks like a ring with a dark centre and hybrid solar eclipse are rare they are annular-total as the moon shadow moves across the earth some place on earth will see the annular eclipse and others on its path will see a total solar eclipse before near the end of the eclipse path it changes back to a annular and it possible it can end as a total solar eclipse as well  3 different types of lunar eclipse penumbral lunar eclipse is where the moon passes in to the faint outer shadow these eclipse are very hard to see cuz the earths penumbral shadow is so faint to see about 70% of the moon has to be in the penumbral shadow for you to notice anything happening. a partial lunar eclipse is where the moon passes partly in to earths dark umbral shadow and the full moon looks like a bite been taken out of it  and a total lunar eclipse is where moon passes completely in the earth dark umbral shadow some of the sun rays make it threw mainly orange or red sunlight which why the moon looks this colour during a  total lunar eclipse it as possible for the  moon to turn a blue and turquoise or a yellow or gold or grey or even brown or a coppery red or orange colour depending on how clear the earth dark umbral shadow is and also during total phase of a lunar eclipse or from one total lunar eclipse to the next eclipse total lunar eclipse the moons appearance changes all the time so they are always different same with solar eclipse.", "comment_date": "2018-05-15T11:41:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesse the
