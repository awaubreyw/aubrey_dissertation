Will fill first by fractions of second. The reason I state it so certainly is is two things. First and the main one is Bernoulli&#39;s principle  the second is the Venturi effect. Fluids are basically react the same, while liquids are non compressible  they can compress so ever slightly when passing through a Venturi the fluid on upstream side backs up while passing through the venturi causing a minute increase in pressure according to Bernoulli&#39;s principle as the speed of the fluid increases thru the Venturi the pressures drops in the Venturi (how a carburetor pulls fuel into the engine)  then as the fluid leaves the venturi it goes to it&#39;s previous pressure that it was before the  Venturi minus the friction loss which keeps the outlet side at a slightly lower pressure until the flow stops. So all things being equal their will be a minute buildup of fluid in front of the tube between C and D and combined with the friction loss while traveling thru said tube there will be a minute pressure drop in the friction meaning that C will fill a fraction of a second before D.<br> I&#39;d rather not dig out dusty books to do the math but I can.

You change the pressure of the fluid (while the filling process is happening, at the point where the fluid is dropping is where the pressure is higher) therefore compressing it. Due to the way your test is, you allow the fluid to release that pressure by taking more space, therefore, increasing its volume.

One of the more important pieces of info needed here isn&#39;t necessarily the rate of flow from the hose into container 1; but rather the rate of flow from the hose into container 1 RELATIVE to the rate of flow OUT of container 1. So not really any hard, precise data needed there, just need the relative rate of flow in/out. Also-assuming each tube coming out of the containers are all the same measurement-knowing the diameter of the tubes that allow the water to flow from one container to the next would be very important. Also concerning the measurement of the tubes, the length of the tubes is very important to know, as it dictates how far the water has to travel before it starts to fill any one container...and again, not necessarily the exact measurement but the length relative to the ones before and after it.

The ball will not roll down in the box until the box gets 90 degree angle and will fall down after getting a certain height. In this way the input energy will be very minimal.
