If the energy value is increased ( e.g. by heating it in a flame ) the coin will expand (the atoms have moved further apart) . When the electromagnetic field is applied a massive shock is produced that displaces a portion of the energy within each atom. The reduction in energy causes the distance between each atom to diminish, the coin is smaller.

At the same time the large current also induces a huge magnetic field around where the wires used to be. The vaporized wires are now in a plasma state and the same inward force (the JxB force) causes this plasma to fly inwards towards the fuel pellet.<br><br>When the ring of plasma hits the pellet it crushes and heats the D-T fuel until the density and temperature is high enough for nuclear fusion to take place. The D-T fuse together and the pellet explodes outwards, releasing many extremely energetic neutrons (~13.7MeV iirc) which can be captured in a water bath sorrounding the reactor.<br><br>The water heats up and when expanded into steam it can drive turbines to produce energy.", "comment_date": "2016-08-19T21:26:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ookaookaooka", "comment_text": "How strong a magnetic field would Magneto need to levitate and would it harm him?", "comment_date": "2016-08-18T18:54:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RedGopnik", "comment_text": "So the mass of the quarter is still the same?", "comment_date": "2016-08-16T19:40:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daaloul Chiheb", "comment_text": "&quot;There&#39;s one more side to this... coin, oh yeah I did.&quot; xD", "comment_date": "2016-08-16T15:17:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LandoHitman", "comment_text": "How would a pure silver quarter (pre-1964)\u00a0react to the coil?", "comment_date": "2016-08-16T08:34:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kirk Prior", "comment_text": "is the coin still spendable?", "comment_date": "2016-08-15T10:46:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "colleen lancaster", "comment_text": "i think im in love shes just fknA", "comment_date": "2016-08-15T07:09:53Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Nick Justice", "comment_text": "I HAVE AN ARCH ATTACK SHIRT<br>thats like 4 years old", "comment_date": "2016-08-15T00:26:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jess Hull", "comment_text": "can you further shrink a shrunken coin? or will it just explode?", "comment_date": "2016-08-12T21:29:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Kelly", "comment_text": "I calculated the speed of the shrinking of the euro.
