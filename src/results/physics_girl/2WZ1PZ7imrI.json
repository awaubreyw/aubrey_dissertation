The reason water seems to move forward to the motion of the water pipe is not due to increased speed of water to maintain the same angular momentum. If that was true, then in around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WZ1PZ7imrI&amp;t=16m12s\">16:12</a> where the water almost curls back to the same radius it would return to the same spot too. When water leaves the pipe, water droplets start moving in a straight line and won&#39;t continue rotating with the pipe. And where they end up in a few moments related to the nozzle makes you think they went ahead, while all of them were just moving straight. An animation would explain it more clearly! So what we see is an illusion of water moving ahead of the spin while it is not.

Just as an example let&#39;s think about not radial but the tangential speed. For a simplification we have two water particles. The first water particle will have a tangential speed when it leaves the pipe and goes forward. Then, the second water particle also goes forward but it will leave the pipe after the first one. Because pipes are turning, the second particle will leave the pipe from a further position. As the two particles just goes on a straight path, the second particle will have a path near to the front compared to first particle. As we think about all particles this way, first left particles looks behind and it seems like while the pipes are turning, water curls back.\r<br>\r<br>As a result, this is the reason of illusion why water just goes on a straight path but not curls back actually.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>And also in order to avoid from some misunderstood: \r<br>The pipes that has water output to the middle works in the same way. Water particles follows straight lines and as the pipes are turning, they are seems to behave like they are approaching to front and turning outside. There is no words to explaining them with using angular momentum. It is already correct. As it is mentioned in the video, angular momentum is conserved. Also, as I mentioned here, water particles will follow the straight path and they will not curl anywhere, so it is normal that there is no reason to have change in angular momentum.\r<br>\r<br>So also just think about this way.\r<br>\r<br>Have a nice day :)", "comment_date": "2021-01-06T15:53:23Z", "likes_count": 28}, {"comment_by": "Eccentric Orange", "comment_text": "1.
