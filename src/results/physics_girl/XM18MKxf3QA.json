Jesus died on the cross as an atonement for all. Fully spiritualized, He ascended to heaven. Since then our Almighty GodJeus has been spiritually with everyone and eagerly waits for recognition, exclusively in his own heart! See Matthew 7: 7 God is very much alive, He knows every heart, He knows that every person will create their trials on earth, he always holds fast to Jesus, whatever happens !! Our Almighty God is spiritually and spiritually we have to want to find him and that only happens in ourselves in the heart. He loves us very much and longingly patiently waits for every responsible person (all those in need of protection are God&#39;s children anyway) to communicate with him mentally and spiritually. Trust in God&#39;s presence, repent, repent, also pray for your loved ones ...... go into your heart !!! According to the Bible, we live at the end of the end times. Sodom and Gomorrah in the most violent measure can no longer be overlooked in our world! This time the ark is Jesus himself and if you don&#39;t ascend, you will perish ... amen", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T15:31:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sam kes", "comment_text": "In other physics girl video diana said energy is not always conserved in expanding spacetime", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T14:59:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Signature Meme", "comment_text": "When I see Dianna&#39;s face, I decide to just see how is my crush doing.
