Read another book girlie.<br>AND I don&#39;t get why people keep on wanting to look for solidity or mass or the physical when they are NEVER going to find it. Physicists says that everything everywhere rotates, spins, oscillates, coils, vibrates and beams. Solidity is an illusion, just like evolution, time, space. Since quarks spin super fast, that means atoms spin super fast. That means IF you want to call 7 trillion atoms spinning super fast (that is our bodies) SOLIDITY you are free to do so, but this concept has led to all the tortures in the world. <br>Since we pulsate so fast, we are gone as much as we are here. There is no such thing as death. Read the book &quot;Hands of Light&quot; written by the NASA physicist Barbara Brennan. There are several pictures in this book of what we look like as energy/light beings BEFORE we enter these bodies and AFTER we leave them.

The down quark is the first compound particle and is composed of an up quark and an electron.  A proton and a neutron both have three up quarks where each up quark makes up 1/3 of a ring structure.  The proton has one electron associated with the up quark ring structure and the neutron has two electrons associated with the up quark ring structure.   An isolated up quark exists only in two dimensions and has the shape of a cylinder where its energy is along the radial direction of the cylinder.  The energy field of the strong force is aligned along the axial direction of the up quark&#39;s cylinder and can generate a force strong enough to bend the up quark and join another two similarly bent up quarks so that each up quark would form 1/3 the arc to constitute an up quark ring.  The up quark (in isolation) essentially has a 2/3 charge because it creates its charge in the radial direction which is 2 out of the three spacetime dimensions.

Amazing Vid.! Very interesting and simple!<br><br>However I do think that this might not be totally E = MC^2. The thing is, I don&#39;t know if the characteristics of mass are really &quot;convertible&quot; to energy. And I can say so by @PBS Space Time vid. &quot;Real meaning of E=MC^2. <br><br>And from there you can get to Veritasium&#39;s Vid on GFF (Gluon Field Fluctuations). And I think this is what this. <br><br>Plus there is no problem in &quot; more energy&quot;, Sean Carroll wrote:<br><br>++&quot;The point is pretty simple: back when you thought energy was conserved, there was a\u00a0reason\u00a0why you thought that, namely time-translation invariance. A fancy way of saying \u201cthe background on which particles and forces evolve, as well as the dynamical rules governing their motions, are fixed, not changing with time.\u201d But in general relativity that\u2019s simply no longer true. Einstein tells us that space and time are dynamical, and in particular that they can evolve with time.\u00a0When the space through which particles move is changing, the total energy of those particles is not conserved.<br><br>It\u2019s not that all hell has broken loose; it\u2019s just that we\u2019re considering a more general context than was necessary under Newtonian rules. There is still a single important equation, which is indeed often called \u201cenergy-momentum conservation.\u201d It looks like this:<br><br>VT = 0<br><br>The details aren\u2019t important, but the meaning of this equation is straightforward enough: energy and momentum evolve in a precisely specified way in response to the behavior of spacetime around them. If that spacetime is standing completely still, the total energy is constant; if it\u2019s evolving, the energy changes in a completely unambiguous way.&quot; ++<br><br>And if there is energy there by uncertainty and mind boggling physics, it can be there! <br><br>So a summed up version: There is not much of E=MC^2 but rather GFF and some energy which is created by free energy. So there actually no need of saying that energy is conserved.<br><br><br>I don&#39;t want to say that your vid is wrong, or offend you in any case, rather I want to point out that this party can have free beers :) <br><br><br><br>Happy Physicing! :) <br><br>Sparsh.", "comment_date": "2015-06-28T05:51:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soham Zemse", "comment_text": "Thanks for clearing a misconception again !", "comment_date": "2015-06-28T05:48:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WWLinkMasterX", "comment_text": "What about mass?<br><br>Evidence suggests that antiparticles have POSITIVE mass.<br><br>Thus, unless the non-valence &quot;quark soup&quot; inside a hadron is uniformly numbered/energied, hadrons like protons and neutrons should have VARIENCE in their rest mass.<br><br>I suppose that&#39;s believable, do protons and neurons have predictable RANGES in their masses, or are they constants like we&#39;re taught in school?
