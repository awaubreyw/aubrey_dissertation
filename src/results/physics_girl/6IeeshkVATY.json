It&#39;s easier to look at quantum entanglement and spin comparing it to a pliable (elastic) bar magnet where for example spin up would be a north pole and down south pole along with &#39;i&#39; (sphere). But, this is a spherical bar magnet. No matter how small the sphere or large the magnetic sphere, the north, and south pole are forever ENTANGLED. You stretch it or squash it down to a Planck distance to the size of the infant universe, the magnetic pole will react instantaneously based on the inverse square, and not the speed of light because of they&#39;re intangled.", "comment_date": "2019-08-21T15:06:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434", "comment_text": "Bless  God  you  my  sun  &lt;3  :-* :-* :-*", "comment_date": "2019-08-20T04:07:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jaydeep Vipradas", "comment_text": "Are fields smaller than electrons?<br>If so, can we use fields to take pictures of minute objects?", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T12:15:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "forestsoceansmusic", "comment_text": "&quot;We didn&#39;t know until 2009...&quot;   I remember seeing an electron micrograph (electron-microscope-photograph) of protein molecules in my high school science text book in 1972.

Let me explain. Electrons are mostly empty space. When an electron is in space, the volume of space it occupies gets dense. So all matter can be represented by the magnitude of  &quot;space density&quot;. Equal density space volumes repel each other and conversely, unequal  space density  volumes attract each other. And that&#39;s the basis of gravitational pull .  For more go to: <a href=\"http://ournewscience.com/research\">OurNewScience.com/research</a> and examine the Universal Space Density Continuum graphic  in the first paper.  Two types of entities: 1. those that occupy space (matter) and 2. those that don&#39;t need space to exist  (mind, thoughts, consciousness etc.). This model is complete, as it includes properties of entities unique to living cells (type 2).  That&#39;s why I call it The Living Grand Unified Field Theory.  Now you&#39;re ready for the second paper. The best way to understand  the universe including &quot;living cells&quot;. There&#39;s no such model in &quot;science&quot;. My model leads to a supply of unlimited energy, because it&#39;s based on space-motion or Dynamika.

By smashing two at each other near speed of light will give you  fragments of phone, but will give no information of circuitry or inner structure which you call a Mobil phone.

Below that there is no &quot;finer&quot; substructure which suggests that each quark is somehow made up of pure energy that &quot;condenses&quot; to form the quark.  When you break up a quark, it&#39;s mass is just released as pure electromagnetic energy.  I sometimes wonder, however, if most of the zoo-like collection of subatomic particles contained in the &quot;standard model&quot; actually exists in the real universe.  Maybe those particle physicists are slamming protons together with energies that are actually exceeding anything that naturally occurs in the cosmos or even existed during the Big Bang.  If that&#39;s the case, then basing theories upon these particles and saying they apply to the real cosmos might be a HUGE error.  Well, time will tell.

And do please forgive the criticism. It is truly meant to be constructive.<br><br>My biggest gripe is that you implied that we need string theory to model fundamental particles, and ignored that fact that we actually don&#39;t use string-theory in mainstream science. String theory is a very interesting and promising and may one day be our most fundamental description of the universe. But right now, it isn&#39;t exactly science yet. There is no experimental data which supports it.\u00a0<br><br>The generally accepted model of fundamental particles is based in quantum field theory and is called the standard model. The reason fundamental particles &#39;have no size&#39; (as you put it) is because particles are manifestations of vibrations in fields, and vibrations (waves) don&#39;t exist with a well defined edge.\u00a0There is an electron field, and quark field, etc, and particles are quantized excitations in those fields, and because those vibrations are quantized (that is, have characterizing quantities which are tied to integer numbers), we call them quantum fields. Those integer numbers are the &#39;particles&#39;.<br><br>In fact, you hailed the discovery of the Higgs, which was introduced as a theoretical quantity---a mathematical workaround---in order to allow the standard model to work. This is why many people were so surprised to find it! The predictive power of the standard model is incredible, and is the standard basis on which we model the fundamental constituents of our world. I know string theory is the bigger buzz-word, but in the interest of an accurate portrayal of the state of scientific thinking, I think you should have at least mentioned the standard model.", "comment_date": "2015-06-16T15:40:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neel Modi", "comment_text": "How would we be able to tell if the laws of physics changed over time?", "comment_date": "2015-06-16T04:35:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "glen rigby", "comment_text": "where are women like you hiding in real life?", "comment_date": "2015-06-16T04:29:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cal H", "comment_text": "When they smash particles together in a particle accelerator it&#39;s very counter-intuitive.

Nature is so fascinating and so strange at the same time. I have just 2 thinks that perturb me : 1) I know that it&#39;s not the aim of this video, but when you speak about the Higgs boson, I hoped you add to your comment that this is not a proper name for such a discovery because it seems like Higgs is the only guy who works on it but as you know, the nobel prize was given to Robert Brout, Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Peter Higgs. So a more correct name should be the Brout-Englert-Higgs Boson. I&#39;m no saying that you should say all of that XD. But just use a more correct name for people to have the true story. 2) I understand your\u00a0enthousiasm\u00a0at the end, it&#39;s the same for me but we have to be clear that it&#39;s a task way more difficult than for the LHC. I think a more\u00a0humble conclusion is to say that we are very very very far from being able to see such a distance as the planck length because it requires to have (in comparison) the energy of a TGV (high-speed train) concentred to a single collision process while now we are only at an energy comparable to the energy of two flying mosquitoes concentred to a single collision process (which is already a very great achievement).", "comment_date": "2015-05-23T00:30:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Czeslaw Coombe", "comment_text": "quarks make my noodel hurt", "comment_date": "2015-05-23T00:19:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spectral Sequence", "comment_text": "Amazing video !!", "comment_date": "2015-05-23T00:16:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "holnrew", "comment_text": "So the best way to measure one&#39;s genitalia is too smash it?
