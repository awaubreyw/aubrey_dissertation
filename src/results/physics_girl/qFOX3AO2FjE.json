Not filmed <b>from</b> there, so I&#39;ll put it to not thinking through that line completely.  Even then, it&#39;s a mistake.  Also wrong is the twice-a-year line in the case that\u2014on the Tropic (either end of the zone)\u2014, this technically corresponds to a boundary where L\u0101hain\u0101 Noon is once, and it is on summer solstice for that particular Tropic.  <br><br>Being super exact, that latitude is technically only capable of meeting that definition at a single point.  As the Earth reaches the position of solstice in its orbit on a given year, there will be a particular point on that Tropic latitude that is, in fact, &quot;facing the sun&quot; (sun perpendicular to horizon if we ignore terrain features and elongated equatorial diameter).  The rest of the points along this line (Tropic) miss it, and the one L\u0101hain\u0101 Noon, <b>very technically,</b> only falls slightly Within the Tropics if on the same side of the earth (That Year); whereas they get two on consecutive days at the night-side spot exactly equivalent, Mod 180\u00b0, in longitude but of slightly less latitude from the points perpendicular to the sun.  For all the other longitudes in nighttime during that solstice, the L\u0101hain\u0101 Noon comes effectively twice per 6 months, two in the Northern Hemisphere and, alternately, a pair in the Southern, but the latitude is differentially lowered depending on how many hours&#39; offset there is between noon and the solstice going forward vs. backward the periods I shall call super-supplementary (adding up to a full revolution of earth).<br><br>By that restricted, full-on-frictionless-vacuum metric, a funny thing is true: in about 183 days, the sun-earth axis spirals out a path of these perfectly high noons up and down the summertime half of the tropics, but the latitude experiencing them has an analog point, not line, actually facing and giving it a high noon which is perfectly high.  Since a point cannot be tiled to cover a surface, you could wait an arbitrary amount of time, and the area receiving L\u0101hain\u0101 Noon (tropics) would never be perfectly covered as to having even one at each point.<br><br>Anyone who read that far, \u2b50 of pedantery to you.", "comment_date": "2022-06-22T14:19:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aluzky", "comment_text": "Yea, my country has those. twice a year.", "comment_date": "2022-06-22T13:53:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Whirl Wind", "comment_text": "Edward  Leedskalnin ...Polaris telescope ...

It took a few years to fully understand the concept.<br>I seem to recall that it has something to do with the difference between net incoming solar radiation and net outgoing infrared radiation.  For the atmosphere to cool down, the amount of outgoing IR radiation needs to surpass the amount of incoming solar radiation.  During the spring and summer months, from late March until late  September the sun is in the sky longer.  So there is more daylight.  However, just because there is more daylight does not mean that the incoming solar radiation will surpass the outgoing IR radiation.  It is only during that period of time, between mid May and mid August, when the angle of the sun increases to a point where incoming solar radiation will outpace outgoing IR radiation, that the atmosphere will start to heat up more than it cools down. As long as the net amount of incoming radiation surpasses the net amount of outgoing radiation, the atmosphere will continue to heat up...even beyond the summer solstice, which is the longest day of the year.", "comment_date": "2020-08-02T23:00:09Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "Bob Diaz", "comment_text": "A rather fun experiment is to have two identical sticks stuck into a board.

They may come off as confusing so bare with me :)<br>1. Ok so we know that photons are composed of a quanta of light. And these photons can be viewed as either a wave or a particle. So why is it that photons are just composed in the way that they are? Like how is it that what makes them up is only a small amount of the electromagnetic spectrum? I may have the wrong concept, do photons also contain ultraviolet rays, x-rays, infrared rays etc. or is it just a weird phenomenon that visible like can also be a particle while the other wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum are not?<br><br>2. Ok so this question is a little more theoretical. So gravity is warping of space-time which causes masses to be attracted to each other. Well according to Einstein this force is cancelled out when an object accelerates. Well isn&#39;t that the whole point of gravity? To accelerate something toward it? If that&#39;s the case then does gravity even exist when as soon as an object feels gravity then that gravity is cancelled out? <br><br>Sorry for such a long comment.

Living closer to the equator, by mere degrees of latitude, and it happens twice per year.  The shortest gap between Lahaina Noons grows exponentially the closer you get to the equator; from blink-and-you&#39;ll-miss-it at the Tropic line to a perfect half-year at the equator. <br><br>Another interesting fact, because our off-center elliptical orbit and the tilt of the axis, and our imperfect 365.25 day calendar, (some wobble, blah, blah, blah) the time of day for your two Lahaina Noons will also vary by greater and greater amounts the closer you are to the equator.<br><br>If you&#39;re in a jet going ~1000mph and maintaining a precise latitude a few seconds below a Tropic line, you can intersect Lahaina Noon twice in the same day.
