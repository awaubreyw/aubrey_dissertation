Angular momentum causes Io to rotate at a constant rate. The difference between these two rates means that the tidal force vector points at Io at different angles throughout its orbit. 3) and now there is something to do with the orbital resonances with Europa? I would like to know more about this 3rd option. Also, between 1) and 2) which is more important? i.e. does the tidal force vector changing magnitude have more or less influence than the tidal force vector changing direction (relative to Io)?", "comment_date": "2017-03-02T17:14:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rick Brown", "comment_text": "(: \u026fnln\u0254\u1d09\u0279\u0279n\u0254\u02d9\u02d9\u02d9\u0254\u1d09\u0279o\u0254\u02d9\u02d9\u02d9\u029e\u1d09\u0279\u0279\u0250\u0254 loo\u0265\u0254s \u0254\u1d09lqnd ll\u0250 \u025fo \u0287\u0279\u0250d \u01ddq plno\u0265s \u028e\u01dd\u0265\u2534 \u02d9\u0265\u0254n\u026f \u028e\u0279\u01dd\u028c os so\u01ddp\u1d09\u028c \u0279no\u028e \u0279no\u028e \u028eo\u027eu\u01dd I", "comment_date": "2017-03-02T17:09:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deathpony698", "comment_text": "sexy alien cat girls", "comment_date": "2017-03-02T16:55:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "clan:rewired", "comment_text": "Ooo, Skypeconference!
