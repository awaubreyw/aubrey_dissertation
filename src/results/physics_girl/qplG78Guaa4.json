It&#39;s probably in the other 3/4 that I did not look it.  I saw explanations that fit my knee-jerk intuition, but applied backwards as an explanation or applied forward with the question of why it is not the left handed screw on the right side.  The knee-jerk thinking would be to put the left handed screw on the right pedal, as having the foot, pedal, and bearing on the pedal screw would drag on the screw as the pedal is cranked by the foot and attempt to turn the pedal screw out of the crank arm.  The logic behind that thinking is that the top of the crank moves forward, and resistance from the foot on the pedal moves it back, encouraging a right handed screw on the right side to slip that out, like using a wrench to turn it, but with much less force.  However, that force, due to bearings and other considerations, this is a very small force as we look at the whole system.  \r<br>\r<br>The best way to understand is to think about the model with extremes.  Get rid of the threads, and increase the gap between the shaft (would be the screw, but we got rid of the threads) through the center of the pedal, and the hole in the crank, or to think of a large tube with a thin rod in the middle as a substitute for this thought experiment.  Now, without turning the rod, move it around in a circle so that it wobbles in the tube.  You will see that it settles in with only two points of contact and is allowed to roll round inside.  Now, recognize which way the rod turns as you wobble/roll it around.  The rod turns the opposite direction to the motion of the wobble.\r<br>\r<br>Now, as you add the threads back in, and close up the tolerances, giving it a better fit, you will recognize that the turning action of the rod will be less, but still present as the fit is not perfect and never will be for a wrench fit application.  Move this thought experiment back to a pedal and you will see that each time you turn the crank you have given one full rotation of wobble without any noticeable force to turn in the direction of that wobble.  The closer the fit of the threads and the screw to the hole in the crank arm, the more times you will need to pedal before the right handed screw comes out of the left crank arm, but it will come out.  So, we switch it to a left handed screw and the problem is avoided.  The right handed screw on the right side will try to wobble in the direction of tightening as you work the pedals, so no need to switch that to the less conventional left handed screw.", "comment_date": "2019-07-16T00:05:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roy McLean", "comment_text": "Ummm... \u201chi\u201d...?", "comment_date": "2019-07-15T19:38:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Scott", "comment_text": "Physics Girl: What happens if you have an immovable object acted upon by an irresistible force?", "comment_date": "2019-07-15T15:12:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manmeet Singh", "comment_text": "Hi", "comment_date": "2019-07-14T20:13:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George Khouri", "comment_text": "Hi", "comment_date": "2019-07-13T06:04:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cenomhss", "comment_text": "The iron ball", "comment_date": "2019-07-12T12:36:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KAILASA\u2019s Jesse Plank", "comment_text": "Simone TURNED A TESLA INTO A TRUCK A TRUCKLA!

OOOooo\u2026 tricky...<br>I would argue the metal one, but I admit I&#39;m having trouble wrapping my head around why.  If they&#39;re perfectly the same size, same shape, and same surface consistency, their terminal velocity should be equal, since gravity acts the same on all things.  But, being more dense, and &#39;wanting&#39; to go faster (because metal spheres are people too?

So basically when you are normally pedaling, assuming the pedals have no spindles, they should unscrew. So in all technicality, I am pretty sure it does not matter what way the threads go on a pedal, because the spindle makes it negligible (ever pedal backwards on a bike? The pedals remain in! Boom, point proven! Haha) so I have a different theory.<br><br>The reason the left pedal is reverse threaded is for production! As a bike builder, I found it to be MUCH faster to screw on a reverse threaded left pedal than a right hand thread pedal. All I had to do was put my pedal wrench on it and twist the crank! Where as if it was right hand thread it would go much slower because it would have to turn the whole wheel assembly. Plus I always worked with the right side of the bike facing me, and having a fast, freely spinning wheel right next to my face is sort of scary when I want to tighten a pedal. <br><br>So I hope I nailed this, but otherwise, I am excited to see what the real answer is!!", "comment_date": "2018-06-16T18:33:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Wong Kim Siong", "comment_text": "Fun fact, on some bikes, there are 2 reversed screws.

This is an issue because not only is it extremely difficult to remove then, but it&#39;s also dangerous to the rider. If your pedal seizes mid pedal, you could hurt your ankle but would also lose control of the bike because all of the weight is applied to that point. It&#39;s better to have the bearing seize and begin unscrewing itself because then at least there is warning (it feeling loose) before failure.

If it&#39;s an electromagnet, the iron will fall when I turn off the electrical power. But what gives a permanent magnet the power to seemingly do it indefinitely? Does the magnet start to lose it&#39;s microscopic domains individually, one by one, until the iron falls. Does it &quot;spend it&#39;s magnetism&quot; over time depending on how much work it is doing? Something must power the field. Your thoughts are welcome.

Now imagine we are people walking along the flat inner edge of the tire.

When object reaches its terminal velocity, it experiences no more acceleration. According to Newton&#39;s 1st law of motion that means that the sum of all the acting force vectors is equal to zero. By extension that means that forces acting in opposite directions (like drag and gravitational force) are equal, meaning that:<br>Fd = m\u00b7g<br>where Fd - drag (force of air resistance), m - mass of an object, g - gravitational acceleration<br>In other words at terminal velocity air resistance is proportional to the mass of an object, meaning that heavier ball would encounter higher drag.<br><br>2. Brute force method - just plug it all in equations. You can calculate terminal velocity of an object with an equation:<br>v = sqrt(2\u00b7m\u00b7g/(\u03c1\u00b7S\u00b7C))<br>where v - terminal velocity, m - mass of an object, g - gravitational acceleration, \u03c1 - density of fluid/gas the object is falling in, S - cross section area of an object, C - drag coefficient<br>We can deduce that terminal velocity is proportional to square root of an objects mass.<br>Now let&#39;s check out what the equation for an air resistance is:<br>Fd = 1/2\u00b7\u03c1\u00b7S\u00b7C\u00b7v^2<br>where Fd - drag, v - velocity of an object, m - mass of an object, g - gravitational acceleration, \u03c1 - density of fluid/gas the object is falling in, S - cross section area of an object, C - drag coefficient<br>That means that drag is proportional to velocity squared.

Since they have the same size, the denser object will have more mass. If we assume that we drop the objects at the same height and at the same location so that any variance in the gravitational force due to the distance will be changing at the same rate, and as long as the height is high enough for the objects to reach terminal velocity we should be good only considering the differences in their masses. If they are both the same size, I&#39;ll assume that they&#39;re the same shape, and any dependency of the drag force on the object&#39;s size can be ignored. For the object to be at terminal velocity, the force of gravity acting on the object must be equal to the force of the air resistant acting on the object. The gravitational force, F, is given by GMm/(r^2) where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, m is the mass of the object, and r is the distance between the centre of masses of the Earth and the object. Since this equation must equal the force due to air resistance, and since everything is the same except the mass m of the objects, technically the more massive object will have a greater force of air resistance. Since I haven&#39;t learned fluid resistance in physics yet, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m neglecting any important variable. I do know it depends on the shape and area of contact but I&#39;m assuming that they&#39;re the same. So it should only depend on their masses if we assume everything I said above.
