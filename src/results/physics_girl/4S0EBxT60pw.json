The reason you get zapped by your car most of the time is NOT due to friction between you and the car seat. It is due to the friction of the air against the car itself which charges the car body. Engineers already SOLVED this problem: carbon black in the tires. The carbon in the tires usually is conductive enough to discharge whatever charge builds up during driving. However, when the electrical resistance of your tires is too high, or if you have very old, non-carbonized tires, the body of your car can build up an amazing amount of charge. The instant your feet hit the ground, they are at earth potential. If you then touch the car: it will discharge through you.<br><br>Anyway: for anyone who has problems with getting zapped by their car: you can buy special rubber flaps with steel wire inside that drag over the road, called grounding straps, thus creating a nice grounding point. It will still be possible to get zapped by your car due to friction on your car seat, but that should be a very minor issue.<br><br>Also: if you get shocked by your car from friction between you and the seat, you should be able to shock yourself when you are inside the car and charge yourself up by wiggling heavily in your seat. If you&#39;re only able to shock yourself when your feet touch the ground: you need a ground strap.<br><br>+Physics Girl: I think you didn&#39;t do the story justice by not including the air friction explanation, as it is far more likely.

However no one seemed to think about the fact that EVERY rainstorm leads to a large charge difference between the cloud and the ground. The voltage is usually not high enough to create lightning as the charge must be very high to pass through the 3000 to 5000 feet of air between the ground and the cloud.<br>   When a bolt of lightning strikes it is so hot that it ionizes the air, making that column of air much more conductive. This then allows the cloud to discharge most of it&#39;s voltage which is why lightning tend to flicker.<br>   In the rain storm that was over the launch pad at the time of launch the charge wasn&#39;t great enough to overcome the resistance of non-ionized air. But lightning isn&#39;t the only thing that can ionize air. A Saturn 5 rocket can to it as well.

I was on a moving car next to a friend who was also on a moving car, and we had to exchange some object(can&#39;t remember what it was) so we reached our hands out of the window and touched each other. The result was SHOCKING. We both experienced a significantly stronger shock than those you see when two people are electricly charged, and we were both isolated from the ground by the wheels and other factors, so the explanation I came with was that we were both electricly charged from the friction with the air, but since my car tended to move faster (and it had worse aerodynamics than the other car (looked less like a drop)) my car built more electric potential than the other. When we touched each other the electric charges on both cars rushed towards an equipotencial and we got zzzzaped .\u00a0<br><br><br>My point is that, theoretically, both cars would have the same electric potencial, and we only touched each other, so the flow of charges only happened within our bodies. That means that, before and after the exchange, I had the same potencial as the car, meaning I was electricly charged. And even though the car and I were on the same potencial, wouldn&#39;t that change the outcome of getting off the car and touching it? Maybe the exchange of charges wasn&#39;t complete, and the car still ended up with a different potencial.
