The angle is 90\u00b0 so sin(90)=1 and we can discard that part, because it is T = F*R*1.<br><br>You have T=F*R. To have balance you need torque to be the same on both sides. So if you have a constant, that is T, and that constant is product of a multiplication (F*R), then F is inversely proportional to R because if you have a higher R, F needs to be lower to give the same result (T), so if the distance is shorter, gravity has to pull harder, and if gravity pulls harder it means that the part weighs more.", "comment_date": "2018-08-17T01:39:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan O'Farrell", "comment_text": "Add something with a lower density?", "comment_date": "2018-08-17T01:39:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "astro guy", "comment_text": "Spin the bowl artificial  gravity", "comment_date": "2018-08-17T01:35:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim Cline", "comment_text": "Oh now you define the rules after we guess.

Now, we can say the same for the torque of the sweepy bit, where the torque is rs * gs where rs is the distance from the center of mass of the sweepy bit to the pivot point. Now, since we know the torques equal out, rh * gh = rs * gs. Expanding out gh and gs, rh * mh * g = rs * ms * g, where ms and mh are the masses of the sweepy bit and handle respectively. Canceling out g on both sides, we get rh * mh = rs * ms, and since we know rh &gt; rs, that means that in order to compensate for the difference, mh &lt; ms.

There are infinitely many ways for the broom to have weights closer and further from the &quot;center of gravity&quot; that once described the whole object so that the handle part was heavier, the bristles part were heavier, the same weight, etc., even if the bristle part is shorter.<br>Example:<br>- - 0- - C - - 0 -<br><br>In this example, the 0&#39;s mark the center of gravity of the separate pieces, and the C stands for the center of gravity for the whole broom.

At that point the room almost erupted with everyone including the professor saying that I was wrong and that obviously they were balanced, so they were the same. When I tried to explain why they weren&#39;t the same the professor basically told me to shut up and just look at the next slide where it would obviously show me where my thought process was wrong. When the next slide showed that infact I was right, everyone looked at me like I was some kind of freak, and then asked how that could be that way.

The requirements for this balancing act to work is that the force of gravity pulling the two ends down must be equal. Think of it this way: if you have a seesaw with two similar kittens on each end, gravity will have the same effect and thereby make the seesaw rest in the middle state. if you then replace one kitten with a cat, the force of gravity wouldn&#39;t be the same - the center of gravity has changed. you can make the seesaw rest in the middle state by moving the tipping point (in this case the finger) towards the heavier cat. this is called the seesaw theorem and was presented in 1954. my answer is that because she changed the center of gravity towards the heavier side, the force of gravity must be the same - but there&#39;s just one more thing to consider which is the leverage. leverage is when you apply pressure or weights to a seesaw contraption with a non centered tipping point. the problem with this idea is that the forces or weights are placed at each end of the seesaw (the weight of the seesaw doesn&#39;t count into the math) to put it into perspective, the broom IS the seesaw.  this makes me believe that the two sides are equal weight.", "comment_date": "2018-08-16T19:12:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "felpshehe", "comment_text": "The broom side is heavier cuz there&#39;s lever physics involved making us &quot;feel&quot; the handle side the same as the other", "comment_date": "2018-08-16T19:12:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NoName", "comment_text": "Of course it has not to be the same weight.

The broom is 1.5 m in length, the lower part has a width of 0.5 m and p is in (kg/m) then is the center of gravity is at 0.5625 m =(0.75m *1.5m * p + 0m *0.5m * p) / (p *0.5m+ p*1.5m) from the lower part away . When you look then for the weight of each side you make: first side: p*(0.5+0.56)m = 1.06m*p and the second side: p*(1.5-0.56)m=0.94m*p. So the torque is at both sides the same: g*0.5m*p*0.5625m+ g*0.5625m*p * 5625m/2 = g*(1.5m-0.5625m)*p*(1.5m-0.6525m)/2 = 0.439m^2 *p*g. So the first side, where the lower part is, is heavier.

However, when one balances a stick or rod or whatever, you are finding the point where the gravity is pulling on both sides equally. That would mean that both sides would weigh the same. At least this is how it works out in my mind. This is why balance points in knives and swords are so important. You need to be able to manipulate the sword/knife in as efficient manner as possible. Having the balance point further out from the handle (or the balance point somewhere inside the handle) would put different stresses on one&#39;s arm/wrist/hand. As far as this broom goes, the bristle end does have more concentrated mass. That is why the balance point is so close to the bristle end. Essentially, at that point, the two weights are the same. Same principle as when you use a set of scales (like the ones Lady Justice is holding). It doesn&#39;t matter what the material being measured is made of. What matters is how much mass is on each side of the scale. A pound of wood is the same weight as a pound of plastic, no matter what. Let me put it another way. Let&#39;s say, for the sake of argument, that the broom weighs 2 pounds. If you were to cut it exactly at the balance point, each half would weigh 1 pound. Acceleration isn&#39;t a factor here, because when the broom is placed at its balance point, it isn&#39;t moving. Nothing but potential energy. If acceleration due to more mass was a factor, if the center point was suddenly removed, the bristle end would drop quicker.
