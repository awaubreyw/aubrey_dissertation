Therefore it uses pulse width modulation to fake different brightnesses.

After a decade or so it seems the eye ignores what the damaged area sees (just like it does in the blind spot in the center of your eye where the optic nerve connects to the retina). Now the only way I see the blind spot is if I pick a small point like a light or sonething small in the distance and change where I&#39;m looking untill the light disappears.

If you move your eyes across a flashing image or light source whether it&#39;s a different frame of a movie or a blinking light such as an LED tail light, or in this case separate colors alternately flashing, moving your eye exposes a new, fresh patch of retina to the second flash, and it will not be blended with the first, thus tracers are seen, separate colored tracers, or separate images that look jittery. It&#39;s because the fresh part of the retina is getting the next image, not the same patch of retina that just saw the previous image so your brain cannot merge them. I notice this terribly with LED tail lights, because LED lights cannot be dimmed. Instead they simply begin to flash the light so it&#39;s just as bright, but on only half the time, giving your brain the impression that the light is half as bright.

The light is filtered through a colour wheel. The wheel is made from red, green and blue light filters, and some times more colours are used to help generate more precise colours in the final image. These colours could be yellow, dark green and white. As the red-filtered light hits the DMD, the little mirrors are adjusted to the levels needed for the red sub-pixels, then as wheel turns to the green filter, the DMD switches the mirrors to the levels needed for the green sub-pixels, and then the blue...<br><br>LCD and LCOS based projectors, are usually outfitted with three imaging chips, splitting the light into its primary colours using stationary filters or prisms. Each chip is then used as dedicated red, green or blue imaging chip. The output light from these chips are then realigned optically using prisms. With these projectors the effects is not present, since all three colours hit the screen simultaneously. <br><br>In the industry/hobby of home theatre, the effect in the video is referred to as Rainbowing.
