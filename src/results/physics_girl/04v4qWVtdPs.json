I have a comment about the explanation for tides. I have been unable to accept the explanation for tides that has existed since ... forever, and I&#39;m not comfortable with yours either. I can&#39;t see the Earth moving so quickly towards the moon that the ocean water can&#39;t keep up. After all, the depth of the oceans is miniscule relative to the diameter of the Earth. The average depth of the ocean is a mere 2 miles while the diameter of the Earth is 8000. I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s possible for a tidal force to create a measurable elongation over that last 2 miles, which is only .025% of the total. I would also think that the cohesion of the water molecules would overcome any such effect. Imagine this too: a balloon filled with ferrofluid sits around a globe in the center, representing the ocean around Earth. Now imagine swinging a magnet (representing the moon) around the balloon. What happens? I imagine that the balloon would become elongated, and that bulge would rotate around the globe. But there would be no matching bulge on the other side, would there? Instead, the balloon would be tight against the globe opposite the magnet. It should be that way with tides, but, of course, it isn&#39;t. Why? Where is the water&#39;s cohesion? I invite you to watch a third explanation on YouTube: &quot;What Physics Teachers Get Wrong About Tides.&quot; I&#39;d be curious to know what you think about his explanation.", "comment_date": "2022-03-13T17:52:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Robert Johnson", "comment_text": "I totally missed the football.

This maximum height for a given splash varies across the radii of the disk, as a function of the velocity and its mass as well; basically the kinetic energy of the droplet, 1/2(m)(v)(v). Ie. near the start of the video, the droplet&#39;s maximum splash value was closer to the center of impact for the droplet. Near the end of the video, the droplet&#39;s maximum splash value was near the fringe of the splash. (Ie. There is a point in time, when the droplet&#39;s splash height will be a single value across the disk&#39;s radius). The strength of the magnetic field across the disk can be shown in terms of the droplet&#39;s mass and velocity. This field strength seems to vary across any given radii for the disk, at impact (except the case where the droplet&#39;s splash exhibits a uniform height or when the peaks of the formed, &quot;splash needles&quot;  have the same height. The variance in magnetic field&#39;s strength could therefore expressed using differential calculus. The measured values for the experiment would be the height where the droplet was released and the mass of the droplet, or it&#39;s kinetic energy. Note: should this result in a physic&#39;s breakthrough, I would like the resultant equation to be named &quot;The Packwood Magnetic Field Equation For Free-falling Ferrous Liquids&quot;. LOL.

However, I do have to insert a criticism about how tides on Earth were presented in this video - they aren&#39;t as analogous to the tidal forces near a black hole as is often taught. The earth&#39;s tides actually work more like a hydraulic press.

It&#39;s not just the moon that affects the tides. The sun does too and also to a lesser extent the planets do - we get super tides if the moon, sun, and planets are all aligned. There are two extremes of tides. Neap and spring. Spring tides occur during full moon and new moon when the moon and sun have maximum effect. Neaps happen at half moon when the moon and sun have the least effect.

It felt much colder than the normal air in the surrounding, so I thought to myself &quot;hmm, there must be some weird fluid dynamic effect that cools the whole thing down, and does so more when you put your hand onto it&quot;, because the plate felt colder with my hand than without.

Along the earth-moon axis, the gravity pulling down just becomes lower at the moon side and higher at the opposite side, but the tide happening at these two places has not to do with that effect, but with the effect, the distortion has around the earth at the sides. The normal vector there does not go straight to earth core anymore, it&#39;s slightly rotated or rather tilted and thus water flows to build the tide &quot;mountains&quot; and it flows towards the still normal vector, but that much more depends on the changed orientation of the gravitation normals than their magnitude. If you look at the differential field you get when subtracting moon from earth gravity, you can see the difference vectors go horizontally to earth surface at four angles around the earth. These are contributing to the cycle of four tides you normally have per day, at these four places water flows away and later arrives in the places where the differential field has no reorientating effect. There is an obvious lag time water needs to flow.<br><br>The sum of gravity fields mainly influences the geometry of the field and changes where &quot;down&quot; is and then this change lets water flow. The effect of gravity along earth is very small. The earth is so far from the moon that it doesn&#39;t go through such a high gradient and difference as the magnetic field strength, so that can&#39;t explain earth oceans acting like a giant drop of water, but you are right about the much stronger gravity gradient near a black hole.", "comment_date": "2017-12-27T14:19:17Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "James Baird", "comment_text": "What is a f &#39; fluid?
