However, in regards to linear wave theory I actually think it was poor science - how can you ignore huge ships going missing and some- when found- actually showed signs they were impacted by a huge force. And then the eye witness accounts from mariners. Not seeing the woods for the trees springs to mind.

With so many technicians in the Navy I would have thought that someone would have previously experienced it and recorded it.  I&#39;ve spent about 280 days at sea on commercial fishing ships in the North Pacific and the Gulf of Alaska.  While the rogue wave is rare, I did once experience a surprising wave that was unusually large and it nearly capsized our ship, a sword fishing vessel based in Hawaii.  Four of us were on deck picking gear in rough weather somewhere between Dutch Harbor and Hawaii.  The ship was riding the trough when the wave suddenly appeared and broke. I became completely submerged from the head down, and fortunately trapped against the ship as it listed well past our comfort zone.  After the wave made initial contact, throwing the first mate and I against the pilot house, I found myself completely under water next to the ship for a few seconds as the ship righted itself. Other crew members were also lucky and got stuck near the stern&#39;s bait shed.  Our vessel had about 4 feet of freeboard, and the pilot house roof was nearly two stories above sea level, a ship with about 89 ton displacement, 20 foot beam, if I remember correctly.  The top of the wave hit the pilot house windows.  After 37 days of fishing our hold was mostly full, holding about 40,000 lbs. of fish and ice, well packed in bins.  The extra mass may have helped to kept us from rolling over into Davy Jones&#39;s Locker.  As far as I am concerned, rogue waves are real.
