But then,  it is incredible to think that the Universe is filled with unimaginably huge clouds of hydrogen. It is even more incredible to imagine that those massive, massive clouds of hydrogen are absolutely quiescent, in terms of signal activity, when just picking up a pencil displaces trillions upon trillions of electrons.  Venturing further along this path is the strange coincidence that the CMBR almost exactly matches up with the hydrogen emission spectrum. The CMBR was never the faint relic radiation that is described, in fact it often set up a howl on old radio sets, it was a brawny, strong signal that was incredibly hard to get rid of. Today, radio reception is so sophisticated that the CMBR is hardly ever heard in any of the communication devices that we use. So there are two main questions arising from the concept put forward in the video. The first is why does the CMBR radiation so strangely mimic the hydrogen emission spectra?  The second question that comes to mind when watching this video is this;  when matter is made up of 99.999999999999%  of empty space and believe me that percentage is important when calculating the mass in the Universe and when every act from walking to being stopped from walking through walls is governed by electromagnetic interactions, how is it possible to ignore emissions that these hydrogen clouds might (must!) be emitting?  The CMBR is not relic radiation from the Big Bang. The CMBR is very much an indication of the present distribution of matter in the Universe.

The images of the eyes and mind of all living creature are jettisoned into outer space by these electrons. Like fiber optics and light wave transmissions. The earth is a giant magnet and our soil has salts and minerals that are conducive to this type of transmissions. The Bible says that God &quot;spread&quot; out the universe . I have a problem with the theory presented there is red shift and blue shift ,wouldnt they cancel each other out. Regardless of how eloquently this is discussed it is theory and is no way provable. There is no big bang and the universe is 6,000 years old , if there was a big bang then why do we have red shift and blue shift ?

That, in fact, contradicts the very premise that CMB is visible to us because it&#39;s been &quot;all around&quot; the cosmos and back, by following its curvature.

According to an observer on the station, Einstein&#39;s Theory of Relativity hasn&#39;t been violated since each ship is only going 55% of light speed, but the two ships pass close to each other at 110% of the speed of light relative to each other, and according to an observer on either of the two ships, the other ship passes at greater than light speed.  It seems to me that even if the theory of relativity hasn&#39;t been broken, the time distortion due to motion of either ship relative to the station is different from the time distortion relative to each other, and how can that be possible?  When they stop and return to the station, what do the three clocks read? I can only conclude that either Relativity must be wrong somehow when it says that it is impossible to exceed light speed in relation to anything else, or it is impossible to travel at more than 50% of the speed of light in case you happen to meet something going more than 50% of the speed of light in the opposite direction.

It&#39;s filtered out of nearly every CMB image you find and is rarely mentioned. It&#39;s the closest you can come to a lower bound on an absolute velocity but really it&#39;s a 4-vector normal to the 3-dimensional surface of &#39;now&#39; assuming there were no significant large scale flows prior to the last scattering.<br><br>It&#39;s easier to drop two dimensions and think about the normal to a circle drawn on the complex plane where the radius is time, t=||\u03c4+ix/c||=\u221a(\u03c4\u00b2-i\u00b2x\u00b2/c\u00b2) with i\u00b2=-1 and c is the speed of light in the same units as x/t. Gravity makes it a slightly lumpy circle so the normal won&#39;t be perfectly radial near massive objects. Note that this means anything stationary with respect to its view of the CMB that is \u00b190\u00b0 or more from your position on the circle necessarily appears to be moving away from you faster than the speed of light. That&#39;s just Hubble flow, though, not &quot;real&quot; velocity. Relatedly, the circle necessarily expands as t increases so position of a stationary object would be better defined as an angle rather than a distance. Alternatively, you can use comoving distances (popular with cosmologists) which also factor out the expansion. I find it easier to use an angle as you just multiply by the time to get the distance at that time. This is a very simplified model compared to FLRW and the various inflation models but it matches Hubble reasonably well and gives a possible geometric explanation for the cosmological constant as an alternative to dark energy. Also, if you treat your 4-velocity vector as your arrow of time and use that in place of 1-dimensional time and 3-velocity to describe a particle, then everything beyond \u00b190\u00b0 is also indistinguishable from antimatter\u2014something that would be true no matter where you are in the universe with no need to explain separation of the two or the supposed matter-antimatter imbalance as it&#39;s an expected continuous velocity gradient not a sign flip.", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T12:55:55Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Carolyn Nunes", "comment_text": "You are fun! <br>You make learning fun.", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T12:55:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aztechguy76", "comment_text": "I&#39;m very glad to see that this was reuploaded.

From our &quot;viewpoint&quot; or ability to measure any signal beyond a star that far away is not possible so we have no idea how large the universe is.  I have heard we understand the size or age of the universe by reversing our detection of the expansion of the universe by determining how fast stars at a known distance are moving away from each other and reverse this expansion to conclude upon a beginning.  Also that the rate is increasing but that takes into account the theory of two leaps of expansion of the universe from the initial big bang, but that is just a theory.  How do we really know there were two or three or even more specific leaps of expansion of the universe except that in order for our cosmological universe expansion theory is designed to fit those parameters.  I think astrophysics takes a considerable amount of poetic licenses to scientifically explain the universe expansion.  The bottom line is the fact we can not measure past a certain point of the universe.
