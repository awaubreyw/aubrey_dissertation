The Bible tells us that this realm is just a small part of what exists. The angels enjoy at least one dimension more than we do.

They would not be able to know anything about us if we choose to remain beyond their realm. The same thing goes for the angels and the heavenly realm. Of course, the natural objection to my argument here is that we would have a hard time avoiding the plane of flatland if we need to get to the other side. But I said that the angels enjoy &quot;at least&quot; one dimension more than we do. If they enjoy two dimensions more than we do, that would be somewhat similar to a place that we would have to call Pointland. We would have no trouble at all navigating around Pointland without ever intersecting with it. By the same token, if the angels occupy 5 dimensions, plus time, they could move all around us, at will, and never be detected by us, other than their effects on gravity.

Gravity is the consequence of the curvature of space-time when mass is present.  It may be possible that the structure of space-time itself could be warped without the presence of mass.  So, how did this warping occur?  We believe this warping of space-time occurred during the extreme conditions present during inflation. Space-time has been shown to react like a fabric by warping, twisting, and propagating independent of mass. These properties have been proven with observations of gravitational lensing, frame dragging, and now gravitational waves. Fabrics can be stretched, pressured, and/or heated to the point of deformation. Such extreme conditions were all present during inflation, so it is plausible that space-time\u2019s elastic nature could have hit its yield point and permanently deformed. Therefore, if gravity is the consequence of the warping of space-time, and fabrics can be permanently deformed, then a deformation could create a gravitational effect independent of mass. Thus, the unidentified dark &quot;matter&quot; that seems to be so elusive to modern science may not be matter at all but merely warped deformities causing gravitational effects.  We have a prediction using gravitational lens mapping to prove Dark Matter isn\u2019t a weakly interacting massive particle, but instead is a floating fixed pocket of warped geodesics in space-time geometry causing gravity wells.", "comment_date": "2018-04-05T03:56:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hector Nonayurbusiness", "comment_text": "How can you even trust your estimates of how much mass something has based on what it looks like.

It is certainly not in my interest to betray confided secrets, as I really only wanted to talk about the fact that there are not only the four natural powers known to the terrestrial physicists, rather also the remaining three which are still unknown to them, which exist as certain tiny and ultra-tiny particles, as related to the gravity, the electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear power. Also the dark energy and dark matter are included in the realm of particles, whereby certain of these particles, which are indeed also energies with powers, are to be discovered in the foreseeable future, as you have said recently. Although it will still take a while, the success is to be understood \u2013 indeed according to your explanation \u2013 as a prediction. Additionally, I may certainly say, these \u2013 let us say, the normal or simple elemental particles \u2013 in turn contain, in sevenfold wise, still tinier particles, which, as I learnt from Sfath, can be designated as a kind of ultra-tiny, ultra-elemental particle, so to speak. Even when I note, with this statement, that a fundamental seven-fold chain of natural powers exists and that other particles exist among the known and unknown elemental particles and that only begins among that seven-series, whereby originally everything evolved from pure spirit energy \u2013 I thereby betray no secret, because all of that corresponds to the spiritual teaching, in which I indeed also mention these things openly. And since the terrestrial physicists, especially the particle physicists, lack the inner and fundamental knowledge about the actual spirit-energetic structure of these things, they cannot do anything anyway, with that of which I speak. There would certainly have to be exact statements and explanations in order for the physicists to get any use out of it. Among the physicists, the physical knowledge in relation to the true and basic structure and the exact interrelationships of matter, still indeed remain in the material realm of matter, because they have currently still not become so smart that they would have arrived at the idea that the origin of all matter, everything which exists and the entire universe, cannot be explained simply from the perspective of the purely material realm. The elemental particles, as such \u2013 in spite of their energetic tininess and inconspicuousness \u2013 are also purely material and not immaterial, because the immaterial is of pure spirit-energetic nature, and that energy alone is absolutely the one and only origin of all things and all matter of any kind. And thereby, belonging to matter is everything which is solid material, liquid and gaseous, which can also be perceived by humans and measured in the most various ways and demonstrated, as your father explained to me according to your physics. However, that which is fine-matter, and high-fine-fluidal matter, consists of pure spirit energy, and this is not graspable for the human being. And alone this spirit energy is the origin of all the existence of any of those things which could be registered, proven and measured in any manner by human beings, while, up to the present time it is not yet possible, nor will it be possible for a long time into the future, for human beings to provide evidence for, and measure, the creational-natural spirit energy. But since those terrestrial physicists \u2013 who deal with the origin of life, and therefore with the solid, liquid and gaseous matter, and who attempt to explore everything in this regard \u2013 lack even the most minimal knowledge regarding the spirit energy from which everything in its absolute origin has emerged and is created, they are still very far from being able to research it and gain knowledge about how the process of coming into material being results from pure spiritual energy.<br><br>Like children poking with displeasure at their food and not finding what tastes good to them in it, so the terrestrial physicists poke around in an area where they cannot find the real source of all things. Naturally, it is necessary, with the research related to this, to recognise the purely physical aspects of the matter and then properly utilise the findings so as to do no harm with them, but if the real origin of all things is to become recognised, then finally the cognition must mature that this lies in the spirit energy. However, this has nothing to do with that which is erroneously designated as &quot;spirit&quot; by the human beings of the Earth, which, as such, is meant to embody that which is the human consciousness.

I&#39;m a noob. However, wouldn&#39;t the phenomenon of matter in a galaxy seeming to move faster than it should the further you get from a center of immense gravity (the center of the galaxy) be explained by the fact that the further away from the center you get, the less the pull of gravity upon the light, and the faster the light seems to move?\u00a0<br><br>For that matter, does intense gravity really increase the density of space, hence making the light seem (from outside the system) to take longer to travel and making space seem to &quot;bend&quot;, or is space actually consistent in structure and gravity actually has a palpable effect upon the travel of light? From what I&#39;ve seen, people talk in terms of the density of space being dependent upon gravity, but I&#39;ve been suspicious that that&#39;s just a result of people relying too much on over-simplified mathematical equations to explain the behavior of light rather than an intuitive hypothesis of the effect of gravity upon light in space. Nobody has ever been able to convince me that unwillingness to admit that the speed and direction of light is not constant is not simply an established perspective that people are unwilling to call into question. I&#39;m suspicious that we should acknowledge the interconnectedness of light, space, and gravity, and not rely so much upon explanations that break it down into simpler terms which tend to be accurate only on smaller scales. And we must compensate for this by inventing a source of gravity which we can&#39;t detect other than to satisfy these explanations.<br><br>In a nutshell: Somebody who knows this stuff explain to me why it can&#39;t be that the matter further from the center of mass is actually orbiting just as fast as it should be, it only seems to be moving faster than it should be in relation to the matter towards the center\u00a0due to the fact that the gravity toward the center of the galaxy is much denser, so its light takes much longer to reach us.<br><br>It&#39;s like, which is more farfetched, that we have an unexplainable form of matter that permeates the universe especially near centers of mass, or that we just can&#39;t explain how gravity could possibly slow down or alter the course of light?<br><br>Remember, I&#39;m not a physics major, so if you can set me straight, try to explain it in simple terms or you&#39;re probably wasting your time.

So dark matter could move in the fourth dimension? Acording to the field theory gravity bends the three dimensional space in the direction of the fourth, right? There would be the bowl in the field created by the matter. What if the dark matter cuts the bowls bottom open pointing to the fourth dimension, xD The mass would be sucked in with greater force, because its like a bottomless pit of doom. Light would be effected the same way. Even though light travels at the speed of light, it does not travel in the fourth dimension. So if the matter, like we know it, moves in a space of m^3, dark matter moves in a space of m^4 and could only interact in the tiniest part of it which exists in the m^3 space.

Gravity is by far the weakest of the four fundamental forces - or the Fources, if you will (buh dum tss) - and is the only force to not be explained in the Standard Model. It seems to me as if we are about as prepared to tackle the task of explaining these gravitational effects as Le Verrier was when he decided that the planet Vulcan existed. Isn&#39;t the similarity striking? Then, our computations for gravity worked out until we put them to the large scale of our solar system, at which point some mysterious, invisible entity had to exist to compensate. Now, our computations work out until we put them to the large scale of galaxies, at which point, again, some mysterious, invisible entity must exist to compensate. Honestly, I think we&#39;re probably wrong about the whole dark matter thing, but I have no better ideas, so I suppose I&#39;m not entirely qualified to make that critique. This isn&#39;t to say that we shouldn&#39;t continue exploring the subject though, just because we&#39;re ill equipped at the moment - we&#39;ll figure things out as we go, and soon enough we&#39;ll have another revolution to the scientific community, just like good ol&#39; relativity.", "comment_date": "2014-12-06T05:40:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dancingintherain", "comment_text": "Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.", "comment_date": "2014-12-05T21:29:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Corranhorn122", "comment_text": "Hahaha, so entertaining.
