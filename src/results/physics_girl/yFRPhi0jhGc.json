I majored in physics and math, got my BA, went to work at Grumman Aerospace just 2 weeks after Graduating,  started working on the A-6A, the Navy&#39;s  bomber Weapons systems.  Sure used my General Physics on that job.  Did bombing runs at Patuxent River Test Range in MD.  God it was fun seeing gravity at work. Got to fly a helicopter 3 times as part of that job too . Even more fun. You&#39;d like it, and it&#39;s harder than flying a plane by LOTs, to do it well. Physics is the best degree to get . I also got to see the Collidors at Brookhaven Lab on Long Island, and the one in Chicago as well.  More fun. You&#39;re one of the few girls I&#39;d like to have worked with. I led (managed) a neat group of 30 Systems Engineers (25 M/5 F) later in my career,  Made group leaaders out of three of them, women, cause they were really smart.  I always tried to hire people smarter than me &#39;cause it made my leadership job soooo Much easier. <br>Thanks for showing and solving the sliding rocks problem, I was there and it was always dry at the time.

Imagine a plane as driving a car, but you want to hover you must rotate the axis to an imaginary axis, or for a better way of describing it, you want to drive the plane diagonally.  Once you hold full rudder ( this is to make the unstable aircraft more stable but rudder control is something else that must be carefully managed, too much or too little can upset the balance very quickly), you must manage the other 2 axis simultaneously along with managing your throttle to stay going in your intended direction of flight.  What Ive been doing in the flight sim in recent days is seeing the planes I fly as cars, with the shock absorbers front left on the left wing tip, front right on the nose or prop, and rear left shock on the rear elevator and the right rear shock on the right hand wingtip.  Its a little difficult at first to grasp this concept but once you get it its so easy.  Just learn to balance the plane and all the concepts are the same as this skateboard or anything else where you must smoothly balance and manage the x, y, and z axis.  The other thing that comes into play is inertia and momentum.  You need to know when exactly you can safely try something and this point is critical, you need to build up speed well in advance or else you will stall and fall or fail.  Thats what I have learned about it so far.  Im still learning as I go and each aircraft handles different because of the different shapes.  The main takeaway here is that the control of an axis of any type requires balance and knowledge of when you can safely release that build up speed for a trick or stunt - safety is critical.  The last part is practice, keep practicing and get the long hours in to know and understand and let it all sink in.", "comment_date": "2022-04-02T12:37:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "President Elect Tommy John", "comment_text": "Rodney Mullen was a God put on earth to elevate skateboarding to unseen heights", "comment_date": "2022-04-01T23:33:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dud3 itsj3ff", "comment_text": "Rodne mullen...

And it is not just because the front of the board goes higher when its tilted like a seesaw.

And the only way that works is because you create the lever counterweight by having some of your bodyweight on the other side of the lever. You don&#39;t like jump off the ground at the instant it touches the ground, the board is already separate from your foot before it touches the ground and you are already going up and the (back of the) board is going down.<br><br>Simply friction from the front foot is then enough to literally drag the board up into the air after you&#39;ve jumped yourself.

You can get the ground off the ground completely without it smacking the ground by just dragging it up with friction and your feet and the lever action, but 3 - the friction with your feet also isn&#39;t totally necessary, it&#39;s possible to use only the lever action to get the board up and it could theoretically be done on a totally frictionless surface.

A lot of it comes down to muscle memory and knowing/understanding the physics of rotation. I think it&#39;s the perfect match of athleticism and brains. It&#39;s one of those sports where size, weight and seniority in a sport mean little, well, within limits. An 8 year old and s 40 year old can be equal in ability when it comes to performing their art. <br><br>That Rodney is still able to knock tricks out consistently that most top skaters can&#39;t even do, is testament to both his raw athletic ability and his knowledge of physics. There is no-one that comes even close to creating as many tricks as Rodney, and there are some of his tricks that only 2 or 3 people have ever caught on film, despite skateboarding being a constant presence in the twenty plus years since he invented Primo, Casper and Darkslides, all of those also considered impossible until he found the key to the physics that made it work.<br><br>I&#39;m grateful that you chose Rodney to work with, because he is so self effacing there have been times he has almost faded out of the scene entirely, to the point where few of the next generation had heard his name prior to the release of Tony Hawk&#39;s on PlayStation, and where he was doing a management job he detested and hardly getting to skate. Although he much prefers not being on camera, his name needs to always be covered with lights. If not for Rodney skating would have progressed differently. There&#39;d have been no primo, dark or Casper in the Tony Hawk&#39;s game, bare minimum lol. He&#39;s an amazing man, a humbling skater and such a great teacher. Every minute of time Rodney spends teaching is a minute worth watching. Unbelievable skill, imagination, persistence, athleticism and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge of what boundaries can be pushed. A genius on a skateboard and not much less of one off it.<br><br>I&#39;ve been a fan of Rodney since the Animal Chin days, where he had a small part doing some freestyle including a little pogo and a half cab flip of some sort, and the videos in the early nineties he did for Plan B and later Globe, as well as the Daewon Song trilogy of videos are all worth watching if you enjoy physics, whether or not you&#39;re a fan of skateboarding. To me riding a skateboard is one of the best demonstrable applications of physics. There&#39;s so much that can be taught using skateboarding for your examples, and it makes dry dusty physics accessable to those who wouldn&#39;t be interested. Showing that Rodney has a great understanding of physics will hopefully inspire all skaters to study physics to some degree to squeeze the most out of their performance. With it now being an Olympic sport as well as a counter culture, I&#39;m sure physics will become an ever growing part of competition skating.", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T16:44:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dom Terreto", "comment_text": "Well you\u2019ve done it.

This obviously relates to plane landings verse helicopter landing. I\u2019ve always wanted to talk with someone who knew physics on a deeper level, because I feel like math and physics can give us an idea of what the highest drop of impact a skateboarder can take would be\u2026 And how fast they would need to go in order for the impact off something extremely high to feel equal to that of say, a 10 stair going normal speed", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T21:25:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N/A", "comment_text": "Rodney Mullen has a real-deal god given gift!

So many times I have found myself unable to land a trick only to take a step back and look at it through a more scientific lens and I immediately see exactly what I am doing wrong. It&#39;s trial an error, and even if some skaters don&#39;t see it on the surface they are scientists, testing different forces every time they try a new trick and when they finally master it they are basically mastering control over the forces they exude. It&#39;s exercise, fun and science all rolled into one and I&#39;ll never stop skating because of that.

Serious question... Does the Intermediate Axis Theorem apply to the Earth&#39;s core?<br><br>I believe most would say &quot;NO&quot; as the assumption is that they believe the Earth&#39;s mantle, outer core, and inner core are spherical. The Earth&#39;s actual shape is an oblate spheroid (i.e., it&#39;s flatter at the poles and wider at the equator). This leads me to believe that the super-dense inner core, an oblate spheroid, could move about it&#39;s intermediate axis and, therefore, obey the Intermediate Axis Theorem, which would explain the shifting of the Earth&#39;s magnetic poles.

You even mention this when you say &quot;then it hits the ground hard&quot; - this is where the physical properties of the deck come into play. Over time when this property of the deck is lost, ollies become increasingly difficult to perform. The seesawing movement only amplifies the force with which the pop reacts and alone is not enough to lift the skateboard sufficiently off the ground. A simple way to confirm this is to make a deck out of a material that rather than being hard and &quot;springy&quot; is instead impact absorbent. This will make ollies with the skateboard almost impossible to perform. So yeah - maybe not springess in the sense of a spring that shoots the skateboard in the air, but definitely springness as the ability of the skate to bounce back when it hits hard surfaces.", "comment_date": "2018-08-26T10:15:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tdog yew", "comment_text": "Ight you can&#39;t just leave out zero flips", "comment_date": "2018-08-26T08:48:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hunter Callaway", "comment_text": "Hey I&#39;m a skater and to bring the board off the ground we drag are foot up it when after we pop the tail down", "comment_date": "2018-08-25T21:20:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shorty\u2019s TSGP", "comment_text": "It&#39;s amazing you got Rodney to film some skating.

As a long time avid skateboarder who grew up wearing out VHS tapes of Mullen&#39;s skating, I can confidently say that he was and is the most important and innovative street skateboarder of all time. Many of the flip tricks that are common today amongst skaters were wholly conceived by Rodney, and there are still many unnamed tricks that he&#39;s done that have not been duplicated by anyone. Way back in the day, I was sponsored by my local skate shop in Corpus Christi, TX, and when Rodney and the rest of the Enjoi team came down to put on a demo, I got to spend quite a bit of time talking with him (as well as a much goofier than expected Eric Koston), and he was such a genuinely humble, down to earth guy. I must admit though, I definitely never expected to see him on a PhysicsGirl video!", "comment_date": "2018-07-10T21:08:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Julbe", "comment_text": "love it \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "comment_date": "2018-07-10T20:40:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jona312312", "comment_text": "The skater is cool^^", "comment_date": "2018-07-10T14:17:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dirty Bay Adventures", "comment_text": "jeez this was good.", "comment_date": "2018-07-10T03:10:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "0m3n", "comment_text": "Dude seems like a genuine good guy with an awesome heart.", "comment_date": "2018-07-10T02:44:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mo Smith", "comment_text": "Skateboarding is more of a puzzle and less of a sport", "comment_date": "2018-07-10T00:51:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Fister", "comment_text": "Nothing is impossible only improbable!", "comment_date": "2018-07-09T23:35:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kasper Larsen", "comment_text": "still sitting here trying to flip the damn phone.", "comment_date": "2018-07-09T21:33:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drew Charpentier", "comment_text": "I guarantee there&#39;s at least 50 min of mullen left on the table.

I&#39;m really sad to say, there are some really big/ incorrect leaps here throughout the video regarding the physics. First, the intermediate axis theorem doesn&#39;t really seem to apply because there&#39;s a force (the scooping foot) acting on the board through the entire rotation to create the spin. This isn&#39;t so much a flip in the same sense as a kickflip is because it&#39;s more like spinning a banana around your finger as opposed to freely flipping it in the air and then catching it upon completion of the flip. Notice how the tool in the space station is not acted upon by another force in this way while it spins. It is also much easier to see why this is not an intermediate axis flip when viewed in someone who hasn&#39;t been doing them for decades as it commonly results in an accidental 360 shuvit - a full long axis &quot;flip&quot; - when your foot doesn&#39;t act as that force (especially true when regular rather than nollie because as Rodney says, nollie &quot;goes with the grain&quot; ). A more accurate intermediate axis flip does exist and is called a Monster Flip which flips along the intermediate axis and does so free from the feet. This trick has been done plenty of times (on youtube), but it&#39;s not a very popular trick which is why you may have missed it. Also when he does the other trick that &quot;starts like an impossible&quot; (which is actually a casper 360 flip) he is flipping it in large part with the flick of his feet as opposed to it just happening like that up release. Lastly, when you pop your board there is more going on physically - part of why it seems to spring up and not just tip up like a seesaw is because you are transferring kinetic energy from your feet to the wood around the fulcrum and at the tip of the tail that is then released in the opposite direction as you snap the tail against the ground and lift your feet so they are no longer acting against the board. In a way it&#39;s more like a pogo stick than you let on because the tensile strength/ stiffness of the wood acting as a spring (think diving board). If you just step onto the tail fairly hard you&#39;ll notice that the board tends to bounce a bit before settling instead of just stopping, similar to holding a steel ruler down at the edge of a desk with a bit hanging off (to create the fulcrum) and making it spring to make sounds - the difference here being that not only is this happening but it&#39;s combining this with the pivot around the tip of the tail after it hits the ground along with the drag of your front foot. The front foot plays a much bigger part than what you let on too as it shifts the fulcrum towards the origin of the intermediate axis in the air and levels out the board around it. Side note: It&#39;s also possible to ollie without your tail even touching the ground because with a little practice you can generate enough upward movement just with the friction of your front foot as you drag it against the grip tape to level out.  PS: Research on skateboarding physics is totally the coolest and that was a little offensive to the skatenerds of the world (there&#39;s alot of us). :/", "comment_date": "2018-06-24T09:57:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pedro Dayrell", "comment_text": "She said that is impossible to flip 360 degrees in the mid axis with total stability, but there is a trick called monster flip that does exactely that", "comment_date": "2018-06-24T08:36:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Dow", "comment_text": "And he doesn&#39;t even mention that he is the one who invented the flat ground Ollie.", "comment_date": "2018-06-24T06:22:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "espltdm155", "comment_text": "yeah impossibles require human intervention of intermediate axis rotation but forward flips relies on that intermediate axis instability", "comment_date": "2018-06-24T06:03:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Candice", "comment_text": "Why does sticky tack fail in different ways depending on how fast you pull it?

If you stomp down on the tail, it will bounce up in the air. That same thing happens in an ollie.<br>Using mostly their upper legs and some of their calves, the skater gives their body an upward velocity. Once their body mass is already heading up, they can kick the tail down to get the board to bounce up after them. From there, it&#39;s a matter of sucking their legs up, and guiding the board&#39;s ascent, mostly with the front foot.<br>Now it&#39;s also true that the front foot applies some leverage to level the board out once it&#39;s in the air, and even gain extra height, but that&#39;s not the main thing that gets the board off the ground. The board mostly just bounces.<br><br>The &quot;foot drag&quot; that a lot of skaters talk about has basically nothing to do with it. You don&#39;t pull the board up with you.

A physics video with Aaron Kyro on the easiest way to 360 flip would be awesome!", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T19:46:05Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "ParkieL", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFRPhi0jhGc&amp;t=8m42s\">8:42</a> her face \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T19:45:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "midnite thoughts", "comment_text": "Christopher chann Can do the impossible without a guidning foot.

The upward momentum you create by pressing down past a pivot point that is not the com is what makes you keep going up.

Although the long axis has a small moment of inertia, it has a small distance to cause a torque so it&#39;s unlikely to cause significant rotation.  The middle axis, however, has a medium moment of inertia with significant distance to cause the instability torque.

He would go to every freestyle competition he could and be exponentially better than the last time. Eventually they even stopped giving him first place because he was so ahead of the curve the judges got tired of him beating everyone every time. He is my favorite skater and I&#39;m glad he&#39;s still on the board and looking great while doing it as he gets into his elder years.

So imagine that you somehow use your hands to flip the phone using exactly the same amount of force. Undetected by you, the phone&#39;s interior is actually a landscape of diverse components that each have different mass and different/chaotic placement of that mass. The phone is going to flip. Given the inequality of your flipping technique, AND the inequality of the weight of the phone, it would be amazing to flip it without it doing something interesting. But notice that there&#39;s no special physics going on. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFRPhi0jhGc&amp;t=3m52s\">3:52</a> When the part in space is spinning, it is WOBBLING. It too flips because of these two factors. And also the spinning becomes kind of continuous again because of a gyroscopic effect. And also, it is not &quot;spontaneously&quot; flipping, but actually flipping with somewhat predictable regularity. It flips when the wobble somewhat overcomes the spinning and quickly wobbles to the other side, which then lets the main piece keep spinning around (This wobble might even be slowing down the spinning. I&#39;d like to see how the thing is moving in 5 minutes). But notice also that it drifts away, further indicating that the movement is not simple like one straight line might represent. There are many directions of force, and when you acknowledge those different, unintended directions of force, you&#39;ll understand this. What&#39;s even cooler, is that the motion of wobbling from one side to the other creates another force! That force might be the main reason for the drift.<br><br>Though I still don&#39;t get how he gets off the ground.", "comment_date": "2018-05-31T18:41:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leah Long", "comment_text": "That was so fascinating.", "comment_date": "2018-05-31T18:40:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NetAndyCz", "comment_text": "I am interested about the science and durability of trousers with premade holes.", "comment_date": "2018-05-31T18:38:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Flora Hay", "comment_text": "this is the BEST crossover EVER &lt;3", "comment_date": "2018-05-31T18:38:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Dashney", "comment_text": "I&#39;m 41 and have been a giant Mullen fan since I was a little kid growing up around the industry (he&#39;s a really nice guy, as you found out).
