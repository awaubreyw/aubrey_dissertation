Is like we are measuring with a constantly changing rule.<br>I&#39;m not academic and I don&#39;t have access to college or a physicist, and I tried to find in internet some paper or theory that similar to what I&#39;m thinking I couldn&#39;t find it, I&#39;m might be mistaken somewhere.<br>I have a thought experiment about this one, I imagine LIGO, just in the moment of the gravitational wave passing through one of the legs of ligo, Imagine that we could pause the gravitational wave and let for a moment a piece of space expanded. In that expanded space, from outside that expanded bubble we will see the laser beam red shifted, as in that bubble the amount of energy used to create the laser beam didn&#39;t change but the space has stretched so that same energy needs to be spread across more space, and if the observer enters in the stretched bubble will see the laser beam blue-shifted. So this would mean that speed of light keeps constant ~300.000km/s regardless of how stretched is a meter, but the energy to generate a specific wavelength/frequency is not you need more work to generate blue light in expanded universe than in compacted one.<br>Hope you read my comment.", "comment_date": "2020-07-08T20:46:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheFeeneex", "comment_text": "Cosmic redshift will only occur if the space is expanding.

The fact that complexity interferes with that path has no bearing on the ultimate return to void.  That new particles come into existence all the time also has no bearing on this except as creation from the void.  A new particle doesn&#39;t always get annihilated by it&#39;s own twin immediately, but together as a sum of energy, they represent the void, having come from the void.  Though having the appearance of being anti-matter like, they are not anti-matter in the classical sense, they are true opposites.<br><br>The ultimate return to void of light energy appears to be ultimately returned to the cosmos by the creation of new particle twins out of the void.  Conservation at its finest.  if we think of new particle creation of wavelets, in that all things can be described as a wave function, then new particle creation is simply wave interference constructively being expressed by the void. (By nature, all things are connected to the void at zero point.  In our 3D space-time, zero point is the great projector of the 2D holographic plate, which is the 2D boundary of a zero mass virtual black hole.)  If we think of the void as a zero point in space time, similar to a black hole but with no mass.  Then all zero points in space are connected to every other zero point in Space time (a fractal black hole).  The primary parametric which separates one wave from another is it&#39;s phase.  Where constructive, particle pairs are created, ultimately destroyed but that destruction is separated by space time, and is phase dependent outside of zero point. This phase, bound parametrically in all manifestations of energy, all particles, and all wave functions, is constructive and de-constructive by its nature outside the black hole, virtual or otherwise with, or without, mass.<br><br>Black hole zero points, having mass, exhibit as a 1D point in space-time but have a 2D effect at what appears to be a surface in 3D.  But, if the gravitational boundary of the Schwartz-field radius is examined, we discover that it is curved and there is no 3D space-time &#39;inside&#39; this 2D surface boundary, all 3D space is observed outside of it (the lens effect).  To define the &#39;area&#39; inside a black hole would be the same as defining a void.  This is why all zero points are connected in a dimension higher than zero, because outside of space-time or inside(sic) there is only void.<br><br>As light approaches the Schwartz-field radius of the cosmos (the cosmic limit), galaxies appear much like they would an object falling into a black hole.  Forever on the surface, but giving the appearance of being stretched out as they approach that boundary until they wink out, all light of that galaxy, all matter, all wave function, now a part of the void (a true collapse), contributing to the continual creation of the cosmos, emanating from zero point, continuously expanding, the point of it&#39;s creation, particles continuously winking in and out of the zero point (returning to void), or continually existing separate until it returns to the void (true entanglement), each possessing a phase relative to zero point, each other, and all matter and space-time.<br><br>Two twin particles coming into existence from the void either return immediately to the void, or they escape to be attracted by the Schwartz-field boundary of the cosmos, among other phase related effects (magnetism, gravity, etc.).   It is only natural that in time, as galaxies existing as a time-relative boundary of the cosmos, appear to speed up, until they reach the speed of light, at which point they hit the boundary and forever join the void, only to be returned in twin particle formations at what appear as random points.   This process is one of continual creation.<br><br>From this the only question that remains is, what is defined by a black hole that exists within a black hole?   The answer seems obvious once one realizes, that all reality as we observe it as a type of holographic projection with zero point, the void, connecting everything existing as a great projector.  A simulation of this would exist in concept as memory in a computer, that could not be observed by the contents.  Each point is connected to every other point.  Each point has a value determined by one: the phase, and two: an energy level determined as 1 at maximum such that  its relative phase and value is determined by the constructive and deconstructive sum of all phases at that point in space-time in which the entirety of it&#39;s phase exists and having a potential value to return to void.   In the multi-dimensional aspect, all points in space-time are both uniquely differentiated, and yet simultaneously relative to the same point (zero point, or void).  The ether of the cosmos which is simultaneously noether, is the void.   All physical science is derived from illusions created from the interaction of phase construction and de-construction, much like and similar to moire&#39; effects seen in 2D moire&#39; images, and holographic plates.    It is not lost on me that I&#39;ve just said, we actually exist inside(sic) of a black hole which contains the entire mass of the cosmos.  Indeed there is much to be considered how that mass may appear to exist, from our perspective, outside of the black hole itself.<br><br>I remember reading of an experiment to be done at one of the Super-Colliders where scientists were to attempt to discover the 2d surface of the active phase boundary at zero point.  I know I bookmarked this (along with thousands of bookmarks) this experiment; but I&#39;ve yet to locate it.  I kept waiting for news of this experiment,  and eagerly await results but have neither seen nor read any news of it.  I would be surprised if that level could be resolved, nevertheless I remain hopeful.  I suspect it will encounter the typical measurement problems to the extreme.  The results could simply produce twin particle creation and immediate annihilation unless it existed in an environment that allowed them to escape each other.  I do not know what that would be; :-/  a virtual black hole with a very small mass?  <br><br>Bottom line, while we may not think energy is <b>always</b> conserved; from my perspective it <b>is always</b> conserved, we just don&#39;t understand why that is true... yet.", "comment_date": "2018-01-31T19:51:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vardaan mongia", "comment_text": "I find this reasoning flawed.

Light looses energy as it climbs out of a gravitational well.  This it true for light leaving the earth, the sun, the galaxy or from near a black hole.  The light shifts toward the red.  Energy lost by objects or light leaving a gravitational well decreases the space time curvature of that well.  A big blob of energy creates a deep well.  Energy leaving the well reduces the depth of that well, thereby reducing its gravity.  The energy lost by the object is absorbed into the space time, reducing its curvature.  This acts like a kind of friction.  Time ticks faster.  If the object leaving the well on a ballistic trajectory had mass as specified by by special relativity based on the object&#39;s rest mass and velocity, it would shed that mass as it slowed down while leaving the well.  Time ticks faster.  Light does not have mass to shed, so as it loses energy to space-time, it shifts toward the red in proportion to the energy being shed.  This is exactly what happened to the Cosmic Background Radiation.  The CMB energy lost was absorbed as the tightly curved space-time relaxed as the universe expanded.

Amazingly some cosmologists have become confused by the fact that the universe is expanding so that they think Noether&#39;s theorem does not apply. This is wrong. Noether&#39;s theorem only requires that the equations of the theory are unchanging, not the solution. The universe may change as it expands but the way in which it expands is the solution to equations that do not change with time.<br><br>The first formulation for energy conservation in cosmology was given by Einstein in 1916 shortly after formulating the theory of general relativity. Other formulations have been written into well-known textbooks including those by Landau and Lifshitz, Dirac and Weinberg. All these formulations for energy are equivalent. They can also be found in Wikipedia under pseudo-tensors. For people who don&#39;t like pseudotensors there is a covariant formulation due to Komar. There is no excuse for anyone who works with general relativity not to understand how the law of conservation of energy works in cosmology.<br><br>The equation for energy in the standard cosmological models for an expanding universe including radiation and dark energy as well as ordinary matter can be derived from these formulations and is as follows:<br><br>E= Mc^2\u00a0+ \u0393/a + (\u039bc^2/\u03ba)a^3 \u2212 (3/\u03ba)a\u02d9^2a \u2212 Ka (= 0?)<br><br>E is the total energy in an expanding region of volume a(t)^3.This always comes to zero in a perfectly homogeneous cosmology.<br><br>a(t) is the universal expansion factor as a function of time normalised to 1 at the current epoch. It started as zero and increases with time as the universe gets bigger.<br><br>a\u02d9 is the derivative of a(t)\u00a0with respect to time, in other words it is the rate of expansion of the universe.<br><br>M is the total mass (momentum)\u00a0of matter in the region<br><br>c is the speed of light<br><br>\u0393\u00a0is the density of cosmic radiation normalised to the current epoch <br><br>\u039b\u00a0is the cosmological constant also known as dark energy, thought to be positive.<br><br>\u03ba is the gravitational coupling constant. In terms of Newton&#39;s gravitational constant G\u00a0it is \u03ba=8\u03c0G/c^2<br><br>K\u00a0is a constant that is positive for spherical closed space, negative for hyperbolic space and zero for flat space.<br><br>This equation tells us that the positive energy in matter, radiation and dark energy is perfectly balanced by a negative quantity of energy in the gravitational field that depends on the rate of expansion of the universe. As the universe expands the length scale a(t) increases. The amount of energy in ordinary matter Mc^2 is constant in an expanding volume. The radiation energy \u0393/a\u00a0decreases due to cosmic redshift and the amount of dark energy\u00a0 (\u039bc^2/\u03ba)a^3\u00a0increases as the volume expands.

It is the laws of physics which govern spacetime expansion and the effects it has on light waves in the first place. Those laws aren&#39;t changing, the parameters are simply changing. You have to distinguish between which physical laws are fundamental, and which are merely consequential of those fundamental laws. For instance, the laws of chemistry are all consequential of more fundamental laws such as electromagnetism. Spacetime expansion follows physical laws. It simply changes the variables <br><br>Second, we don&#39;t yet know enough about what spacetime is or why it is expanding to say that energy is actually being lost here.

IE: what they call &quot;dark energy&quot;. Perhaps this &quot;lost&quot; energy is what is causing this expansion in the first place. That is speculation, of course. Either way, with spacetime expanding and some form of energy causing it, you clearly have an opposing force which could explain the seemingly lost energy.

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;ll be more illuminating, but let me try to explain it anyway. It is, of course, consistent with everything Dianna said, it&#39;s just a different way of putting the same physical concepts into words.<br>Even in non-relativistic mechanics, the energy of an object depends on the reference frame you are considering. Let&#39;s say a ball is at rest with respect to me. It&#39;s kinetic energy will then vanish. Now consider another observer, moving with respect to me with speed v. From the point of view of this observer, the kinetic energy of the ball will not vanish. Indeed, it&#39;ll be mv^2/2, where m is the ball&#39;s mass. So, it only makes sense to compare the energy of two different systems or of the same system at different instants of time if we use a single reference frame for both.<br>When we consider photons in an expanding Universe, something similar happens. The energy of the photon at different times is changing, but not because it&#39;s losing energy to something, but rather because we are looking at it from different reference frames. Now you might ask: why don&#39;t we fix a single reference frame once and for all and use it to study the motion of the photon at all times? Well, because we can&#39;t. This is one of the surprising facts about general relativity, that reference frames cannot, in general, be defined globally. Each reference frame can only be used to describe events in a limited region of spacetime, that is small enough for its curvature to be negligible. So, if we want to study a photon that has been travelling for billions of years, we actually have to choose a different reference frame to look at it at each instant of time. Since the reference frame is changing, the numerical value of the energy is changing. This shouldn&#39;t be more mysterious than the example of the ball that I gave first. In particular, I hope it&#39;s clear that it makes no sense to speculate about &quot;where the photon energy is going&quot;. It isn&#39;t going anywhere. If, from the point of view of a single reference frame, the energy of an object diminishes with time, then OK, some other physical entity must be receiving this energy. But this is not what is going on with the photon. The energy changes because the reference frame changes, that&#39;s all.", "comment_date": "2016-03-16T05:37:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bhargav Pabbisetti", "comment_text": "If you want to understand GOD, you need to learn physics.

But that doesn\u2019t mean energy isn\u2019t conserved; it means that the energy goes into the Universe\u2019s expansion itself, in the form of work. And if the Universe ever reverses the expansion and contracts again, that work will be done in reverse, and will go right back into the photons inside. It is possible that in a fuller (i.e., quantum) theory of gravity, a stricter definition of energy will emerge, and we\u2019ll be able to truly see whether it is or isn\u2019t conserved.

Yes, photons lose energy, but that energy doesn\u2019t disappear forever; the amount of energy loss (or gain, for that matter) adds up to exactly what it should in the expanding (or contracting) Universe.&quot;<br><br>Source: <a href=\"https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/ask-ethan-when-a-photon-gets-redshifted-where-does-the-energy-go-9b97d9b49d5c#.z2cmabo73\">https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/ask-ethan-when-a-photon-gets-redshifted-where-does-the-energy-go-9b97d9b49d5c#.z2cmabo73</a>", "comment_date": "2016-03-16T01:17:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guillermo Rodriguez Cabo", "comment_text": "I have a question.
