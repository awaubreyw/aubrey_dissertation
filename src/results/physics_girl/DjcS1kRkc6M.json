Desert animals need silence.  We need silence to perform the experiment.  Could we really not have worked together?  We&#39;re clever monkeys with clever hands, but the mind boggles at the number of tranquility-seeking animals we shove to the margins with such quests.  I&#39;ll start the bidding with a million.  Do I hear ten million?  Anyone?  I can&#39;t help wonder if the quest isn&#39;t undone by such sloppiness.  I speak here as a man very aware of the charms of this girl as she presents the quest.  But perhaps, hmm, she is good-copping something voracious in our knowledge quest, something possibly fatally flawed in the quest itself.  Are there none among us hairless apes with the wisdom or even cleverness to match form and content here?  Could we not find twenty square kilometres elsewhere?  Our species cannot stop fidgeting so we kill the animals who have figured it out?  I thought the desert was the place our species might go for wisdom.  Perhaps a wiser species would have found tranquility first, then reached for the stars.  I write here deep in the basement of the internet, invisible, silenced by the weight of the 5,798 comments above.  But that silence, too, might have about it something of the lineaments of wisdom.

For instance, this energy wave could be caused by the planetary-wide physical pulsations of the Earth itself [1] ; or it could be caused by pulsations in the Earth&#39;s lower ionosphere synchronized with solar flare emission [2] ; or it could be caused by quantum fluctuations, a kind of churning of transient particles and fields that occurs even\r in empty space [3] ; or by the harmonic and dissonant resonance of multiple wave sources. Gravity waves are still theoretical until we can include and then eliminate some more variables, even get some off-planet data.  Perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be too difficult to set up another gravitational wave detector on the moon. Afterall, the vacuum is already there so there would be no need for the metal tubing... just the laser, splitter and detectors. Unfortunately, that would still not discount quantum fluxuations, cosmic radiation fluxuations, variations of solar emissions caused by: the pulsations of the sun, solar storms, flares, solar wind, and/or a plethora of other non-constant energy-wave emissions. <br><br>[1] <a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/the-earth-is-pulsating-every-26-seconds-and-seismologists-dont-agree-why\">https://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/the-earth-is-pulsating-every-26-seconds-and-seismologists-dont-agree-why</a> <br>[2] <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01725\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01725</a> <br>[3] <a href=\"https://scienceandtechblog.com/quantum-jitter-lets-heat-travel-across-a-vacuum/\">https://scienceandtechblog.com/quantum-jitter-lets-heat-travel-across-a-vacuum/</a>", "comment_date": "2021-01-17T14:55:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BruceD1776", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjcS1kRkc6M&amp;t=3m30s\">3:30</a> Wonder why the wave isn&#39;t stretched or compressed the same as space-time.", "comment_date": "2021-01-15T01:05:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Per Nordin", "comment_text": "All of what I have read, seen on video presentations / lectures / explanations / visualizations, I can&#39;t see them as Gravitational waves but rather as Shock waves traveling through the Space-time &quot;fabric&quot;.", "comment_date": "2021-01-14T18:29:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Thomas", "comment_text": "So it&#39;s a 9 billion dollar potato heater?", "comment_date": "2021-01-14T14:35:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manish Kumar", "comment_text": "Right madam, I observed when I was very young and at winter time when I   touched steel material I felt it was so cool comparison to other elements.

Space-time isn&#39;t a thing, and a gravitational wave is only affecting gravity, it is not affecting time. Space is a vacuum, and time is the measurement between to moments that don&#39;t exist anymore, so it is only a concept so, by multiplying space by time to get space-time makes no sense. Time cannot be bent, at all. All of the effects of time dialation can be explained by the properties of light and the time it takes for light to travel from one point to another. Gravity is not light, light is travelling from one point to another, and gravity is pulling from one point to another, so the idea that the Earth would magically keep orbiting a Sun that is no longer there is ridiculous.

Wow. <br>You can try and explain the complexities of gravity and call it science  till you are blue in the face. In other words you are still a billion light years from understanding a fraction of it. <br>Let me explain gravity that a child should be able to understand.<br>God is the Creator and Author of gravity. When Jesus ascended to heaven, it took him less than 24 hours to get to his destination, the throne of God His heavenly Father. He didnt need a spacecraft or a space suit or oxygen to survive the trip or anti gravity matter to assist Him in His travel through space a billion times faster than the speed of light. He simply revealed by His ascension that all matter whether animate or inanimate and the laws of the universe are subject to Him because He created everything. God created the universe through His Son Jesus Christ and appointed Him &quot;heir&quot; of everything that was created. Hebrews 1:1,2<br> Didn&#39;t Jesus say that if you have faith as a mustard seed, you can move mountains? Didn&#39;t the storm obey His voice?Didnt He defy gravity by walking on water? Wasn&#39;t time named after Him (BC or AD)? Didn&#39;t he cure every disease? The greatest physician in history? Didnt He perform the first surgery by putting Adam to sleep and took out Adam&#39;s rib and created Eve from this? Didn&#39;t  He raise the dead to life? We call these phenomenal works a &quot;miracle&quot; and yet science refutes it and tries to duplicate it. It is an impossible task.

In the US at least. Apparently in Britain it&#39;s 54 zeros, (or 54 noughts) which actually makes more sense because 54 is a multiple of 9 and 6 (non in nonillion meaning 9, like oct in octillion meaning 8) and they just divide the number of decimal places by six to determine the prefix.  The US system for super big numbers is weird but the prefix stands for how many sets of 3 decimal places you add to 1,000. So bi being a prefix for two, you add two sets to 1,000 and you get 1,000,000,000 or a billion. Tri = 3 so add three sets (each set being 3 zeros) and you get 1,000,000,000,000 or a trillion. If you think of 1,000 as your first set, just add whatever the prefix calls for, so with a decillion you add ten sets to your existing set giving you 11 sets of zeros. After decillion it gets weirder but you can still make sense of it. Un is French for one, so an undecillion is a decillion with one set of zeros added to it, giving you 12 sets (almost arrogantly confusing, I know, but it&#39;s consistent enough to remember) so the next number is duodecillion which is 13 sets of zeros, giving you 39 zeros. At this point the British system still makes MUCH MUCH more sense in that a duodecillion is 12 x 6 zeros or 72 zeros. <br><br> I only took one semester of math in college, so if I got something wrong, feel free to correct me. this is just something I&#39;ve been thinking about a lot lately because until I realized why the US names numbers the way it does I found the system to be completely nonsensical. I mean.... I still find it nonsensical but at least I can translate it now. I&#39;m sure this is old hat to Physics Girl and probably most of the people who watch this channel.<br>EDIT: apparently the British system I mention is no longer used? if so, that&#39;s a shame, it makes so much more sense, but I guess it&#39;s better to have one single system than two that contradict one another.

I&#39;m a layman, not a fancy schmancy physics guru like you and a lot of your followers, so i just randomly pulled these thoughts together based on what I&#39;ve seen on PBS, COSMOS, How the Universe Works, Big Bang Theory, Family Guy, the Simpsons, South Park, Stargate SG-1 &amp; Stargate Atlantis, over the years. Samantha Carter, Dr. Weir &amp; Rodney always said there&#39;s tons of stuff floating around in space, so it&#39;s not as empty as we&#39;d like to think. Am i wrong in thinking.saying this stuff? Although a space-LIGO would be uber sensitive, I think ultimately, space is just too full of stuff to build one out there and expect it to be any more sensitive than one on earth. Too many considerations, and unless Xenu/Xemu and the Galactic Confederacy left us some pretty wicked tech laying around and we just haven&#39;t found it yet, i&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s something we could EVER build. You&#39;d have to build a vacuum tube, in the vacuum of space, which is why you&#39;re building it in space to begin with... to take advantage of the &quot;natural&quot; vacuumness of space.

Spacetime is only an analogy or model that helps describe the way things in space behave, not what space itself actually is, and therefore LIGO isn&#39;t measuring changes in &quot;space&quot; but changes in the way things in space like the LIGO detector behave when affected by forces such as gravity acting on it. In this case, so-called gravity waves aren&#39;t &quot;waves&quot; in space. Rather, they are fluctuations in the gravitational strength of systems such as orbiting neutron stars or colliding black holes. <br><br>So when you hear people equating actual space with &quot;spacetime&quot; you&#39;re hearing someone who is confusing an abstract geometric model with reality. When Black holes collide they don&#39;t &quot;convert energy to gravity waves&quot; they convert mass to energy and the reduction in mass creates a change in the gravitational strength of the system, which in-turn affects other systems, including LIGO. <br><br>What is space then? That is a more complex question that it seems, but in simplest terms, space itself is simply a 3D realm and time is the change that happens to stuff in that realm; hence time as a &quot;dimension&quot; is synonymous with the words &quot;factor&quot; or &quot;facet&quot; or &quot;variable&quot;, not as another spatial &quot;dimension&quot;.

It has to be taken by faith. How then is it that light bends towards objects with higher mass considering light has no mass? If you put two balls, with different mass, on a stretched hot air balloon then whatever you put on the surface of the balloon (after the two balls) will roll towards the ball with higher mass, it&#39;s being led there because of the &quot;warping&quot; of the stretched balloon rather than being &quot;attracted&quot; to it. I have my faith in God and just as Moses told us man is made from the dust of the earth and yet had no way to prove this, I also believe what God says about the earth. God has no time. He is outside of time and created it for us. Since He is outside of time and the bible says He holds all things together then there&#39;s no need for gravity. It&#39;s all held together by God&#39;s ELECTROMAGNETISM (like Tesela discovered). Gravity cannot be proven.

Thumbs up from me !Thanks for the video <br><br>\u00a0Interesting point...The term gravity ...I think...is a misnomer. Gravity is an unproven theory. It does not work within any algebraic formula. It can  NOT be used as Force in any equation.  Matter bends spacetime, and the effect of that bending of spacetime is to create a generalized kind of force that acts on objects. However, it isn&#39;t a force as such that acts on the object, but rather just the <br>object following its geodesic path through spacetime.<br>When light passes through an electromagnetic field, it is split into different spectral lines. That electrical phenomenon is what astronomers mistake for gravitational redshift. <br><br>Electromagnetics ,on the other hand,are the only force that exists,and can be defined in realtime computational modeling. We are pushed onto earth by the electromagnetics of electrons/proton phasing , as opposed to the theory that gravity holds us to the earth the closer we are to it. An excellent example is the Saturn moon Titan.<br><br>When using surface gravity as a function of mass and radius (and sometimes speed of rotation).  Density is relevant, but it&#39;s not a complete answer. Most of the matter in the universe is in the form of plasma.<br>\u00a0A plasma is formed if some of the negatively charged electrons are separated from <br>their host atoms in a gas, leaving the atoms with a positive charge. The negatively charged electrons, and the positively charged atoms (known as positive ions) are then free to move separately under the influence of an applied voltage or magnetic field. Their net movement constitutes an electrical current. This can explain why gravitational computation shows  (*gravity* misnomer) is stronger on the mountain peaks of the moon Titan,and much weaker in the lower valleys of Titan.", "comment_date": "2019-09-06T10:03:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "andrew j reading", "comment_text": "mind-boggling, when you think that something took a billion years to get here, just how big is this thing that we are all apart of, of course, we are all important to our family friends and loved ones, but overall so insignificant it the scheme of things. what a wonderful thing.", "comment_date": "2019-09-06T09:46:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ANDREW BERGERON", "comment_text": "the real sun been out for  quite awhile?", "comment_date": "2019-09-06T04:52:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray Legg", "comment_text": "How does benefit mankind?", "comment_date": "2019-09-06T04:41:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "imystery man", "comment_text": "what a bunch of BS", "comment_date": "2019-09-06T02:19:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bombastic Buster", "comment_text": "Well, if gravitation is a wave and can be detected , then the wave can theoretically be controlled, i.e. anti gravity, taking gravity away from a body.", "comment_date": "2019-09-06T02:18:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alexbald12", "comment_text": "Gravity is billions of times faster than light.

Blooper in the opening remarks. If gravity arrived at earth in 8 minutes at lightspeed the  earth would be flung out of orbit in a few thousand years. Its been shown.

It seems likely that this would happen frequently over time spans of years.<br>2) How do they know the gravitational wave came from the colliding black holes? The source cannot be triangulated with fewer than 4 detectors and the error over such a large distance and narrow detector must be massive.<br>3) Bouncing the laser 300 times along the tube length is trading accuracy for precision. I understand they need better precision to detect such small deltas but how do they account for the lost accuracy?<br>4) How do they know gravitational waves move at or near the speed of light? Correlating with a coincident astronomical observation is backwards reasoning. If gravity waves were slower then the astronomical event might have happened before recorded history. And if gravity waves are faster then we would not see it yet.<br>5) Why would waves dissipate in magnitude like light? If spacetime is expanding then wouldn\u2019t the gravity waves dissipate faster?<br>6) how do they know the distance to the blackhole? Parallax has error. Standard candles have error. Red shift has error. Black holes do not emit. Inference of distance based on other objects behind blackholes has error. Is all that error accounted for in the gravitational wave analysis?<br>7) how do they account for the orientation of the detectors? A gravity wave parallel to one of the shafts would have a much larger distortion than a gravity wave perpendicular to the shaft.

This is an experiment done with a regular plasma ball, being spun at 2000 RPM&#39;S. It creates its OWN magnetic field. You can see the definitive north and south pole, as well as tropics and an equator. Now this is being created by regular gasses inside a plasma ball you buy off a shelf. It&#39;s VERY plausible, that at our earth&#39;s core, the different metals of our core being compressed by our lower mantle creating heat, combined with the rotation of earth at 65,000 MPH creating even more heat, would turn our solid core, into a molten liquid core. The faster the Earth spins, WELL past 2000 RPM&#39;s would further transform it into a super plasma state. The FASTER it spins, and instead of basic gasses like in a plasma ball, and having metal properties instead, would still create magnetic fields, but COULD actually also create gravity. <br>Here is the link. It starts at the 5 minute mark. Mind you, this is just basic instruments using a battery, and a motor. Using proper equipment and liquid metals, you could theoretically not only create gravity, but reverse it. Meaning instead of gravity pulling, you could create a field that could PUSH it, using it for interstellar travel. The sun would charge these devices, the same exact way our Earth&#39;s plasma core gets its sustainable charged energy from the sun, at the poles. Our government already knows this, but implementing this technology into vehicles, would eliminate the need for fossil fuels, in which they get rich from. <br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/i1J5HF1yUAw\">https://youtu.be/i1J5HF1yUAw</a>", "comment_date": "2019-08-26T23:13:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M Goudsmits \u91d1\u9a6c\u6865", "comment_text": "lol space is the stiffest nothing there is !", "comment_date": "2019-08-26T23:08:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "quest 77051", "comment_text": "NOT IN A SINGULRITY......gravitational waves travels much faster in past the event horizon. be well.", "comment_date": "2019-08-26T23:05:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KG Bear", "comment_text": "Nope.....

Ie one directional aerial over a multidirectiinal aerial, or multi cell towers linking up.     Maths example, Philips CD  16bit numbers scanned once, of four times, or 1bit at a time scanning 16bit numbers 256times, in the same time period.   the 1bit x 256 oversamplimg wins (1x256), 16x1, 16x4,   looking a  1bit 256 times for 16 of them has less looking errors then scanning a glub of 1bit 16 of them at the same time, as you only looked once and have no compare if it was a 1 or 0 error.    Here they are multi returning the laser manytimes in 4km, but that would mean still looking at a 4km wide gulp and miss any information in the other 100km as you not looking at that.    Taking a 30cm ruler and rubbing of 5cm to 30cm markings keeping 1cm to 4cm.  Its still 30cm long but you are only seeing 1cm to 4cm many times and nothng else if it lands at 21cm as you wont get that data as you not looking.   Here 4km is just oversampling the same data, giving sensativity and average out error.    Issue in this video he said it was the same as a over 100km lengh, sorry no it is not.

That makes it possible to see things twice as far away or four times less energetic.<br>If you quadruple the arm length of LIGO, you reduce the amplitude of the smallest detectable wave by 4.

Washington state west of Spokane (most of the state) was built up by land accumulating at the edge of the continental plate as it drifted westward, and the Pacific plate pushing land northward along the coast that originated at the latitude of Mexico. The geology of Washington state is among the most complex and accessible anywhere. For more information, look up Nick Zentner at Central Washington University. He&#39;s got videos at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCreGha0P8WvoMSJ2i09qHQ\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCreGha0P8WvoMSJ2i09qHQ</a> Probably easiest to look for geology playlists. Most of Louisiana is merely delta deposits from the Mississippi River, geologically speaking that&#39;s a bowl of jelly. Also, they do a lot of drilling for oil and other industrial misadventures like salt mining in Louisiana.

So even if you have the luxury of owning an arsenal of 10^20 Tzar Bombas, you&#39;d need to increase your stockpile substantially to get a detectable bang.  On the other hand, if I understand astronomical distances correctly, the nearest GW source seen so far was at a distance of about a half a light year.  If you set off your bombs at a safe distance - say, about 1 AU or 10 light-minutes away, you&#39;d reduce your stockpile needs by a factor equal to the square of the distance ratio, or (.5LY/10LM)^2, or 10^9.

I don&#39;t buy it.  I personally believe that LIGO can only detect large &quot;gravitational waves&quot; to the extent that LIGO is good enough to sense them.

In another video I saw however, that the LIGO laser is an infrared laser, ie it&#39;s wavelenght is longer than that of visible light. How can it then measure such small vibrations? Would it not have to have smaller wavelength to be able to measure such tiny vibrations?
