There are many SERIOUS SYMPTOMS. Make no mistake: it has a number of flu-like symptoms, but It is NOT the flu. Doctors tried to treat it LIKE THE flu. They tried to do protocols like those for serious S.O.B., intubation, and breathing machine treatments, but found that doing these things often did more harm than good--totally the opposite to what they were used to. They found Pt&#39;s w/ super low O2 sat levels being fine--saying they were feeling fine--but in all their training and experience told them that a pt w/ THAT low a score should be in crises.  current protocols would say if your Pt&#39;s O2 sat lvls fall bellow  a certain lvl,  you need to intubate. And at another lvl put them on breathing  ventilators. Do that&#39;s what they would do w/ Covid Pt&#39;s--and those actions made things worse---not better; again just the opposite of what their experience taught them. Lots of things weren&#39;t making sense. They would have people seem to get better, so they would be released, then days later,  Pt&#39;s would crash; Pt&#39;s would have strokes &amp; heart attacks who had no business having those things. Doctors were very confused and realized they need to treat it like a new  disease. There are apparently cascade like effects during  severe episodes of the disease--especially w/ Pt&#39;s w/ underlying co-morbitities like  diabetes, obesity, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and other respiratory diseases, kidney, heart disease, hypertension, and who knows, possibly other inflamatory related diseases--they DONT know.  But the bottom line is that many Pt&#39;s w/ other probs like these are at serious risk if they catch Covid as the virus may speed-up or exasurbate the irritation and inflammation of infected tissues that are effected by said comiebidity.  Clotting mechanisms can be triggered--thus the heart attacks and strokes,   Cytokine storms give way to irritation and inflammation of tissues affected by asthma / bronchitis---triggering pneumonia for example..Although I have a little training in allied health,   I am NOT a doctor, so I may have gotten my facts wrong in some cases. Do NOT take what I have said as Gospel. Understanding of this disease is changing by the day--which is a good thing. The other good thing is that many people dont have bad symptoms at all. Some, no symptoms at all. The bad news is they can easily spread the disease to you and me while not knowing they are actively shedding the virus.

I know I am late getting to your video.  Part of me was tired of COVID, also, but I knew deep down that you would have something useful and hopeful to say.  You need to do an interview with Dr. Fauci.  On a side note, I am so glad to see that you are still doing these videos after 8 years.  I will not pry into the &quot;Life of physics girl&quot; but I hope other than quarantine, you are doing well and feel that you are a success.  I think you are and congratulations on all the hard work.

That means cases/deaths rise and rise, reach a peak, then plateau for a time, then go down and down until there are only a scattering of cases/deaths, have a lull, and then the rise starts again. The US is at one of two places, either the plateau stage or it has not yet reached the peak. And the weight of the evidence is leaning heavily towards the latter. And if the US continues to push opening up, there will no longer be any question that the US has not yet reached its peak and almost guarantee a second wave will never happen. If everyone gets the infection in the first wave there won&#39;t be anyone left for a second one. Provided of course that long term immunity is acquired after recovery, which is not exactly certain at this point.  It seems to me that years from now when people look back at the graph showing the course of the infections, May 2020 will just be a teeny tiny insignificant sideways movement near the bottom of the graph, less than a tenth or twentieth of the way from the ultimate peak.

However, I think we need to take the next step to positive and negative predictive value, i.e. if the test is +, do I have the disease and if the test is -, do I not have the disease.  This is what patients and doctors really want to know.   So what is the link between these related #&#39;s?  Prevalence, or in Lab Medicine we often use the term &quot;pre-test probability.&quot;  What does this mean?  If we test people who are not likely to have the disease, then most of the + test results will be false-positive and conversely, if we test people who are highly not likely to have the disease, then most of the - test results will be false-negatives.  Here&#39;s Dr. Hannah Fry and Matt Parker explaining this concept to school-age children at the Royal Institute <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vBPFaM-0pI8\">https://youtu.be/vBPFaM-0pI8</a>  In the end, test results are only as good as  the person who actually interprets them.
