This is because our eyes are round in shape.  The angle of the incoming light can be measured by where it hits our retina.  This gives us information which is not available when looking at a television screen.  The light from each pixel simply goes out in all directions equally and does not contain the kind of angular information that we receive when looking at a three dimensional object.  Stereoscopic vision provides us with additional information and improves our ability to judge distances, but it isn&#39;t the sole or even primary source of information for 3D vision.  When looking at the objects on my desk with only one eye, I can clearly see that they are not 2D, and I can also judge distances.  Just not as well as when using both eyes.  If the pixels on a television screen could alter the intensity of the light they produce depending on the angle it is emitted at, the image would look 3D without the need for silly glasses.

From personal experience I can add an additional wrinkle on the topic of this excellent video.  When I was 16 years old I lost the sight completely in my left eye (due to an accident).  At first, as you point out, the world appeared &quot;flat&quot; to me.  However, over time, my brain compensated and I re-developed depth perception; not based on stereoscopy but, instead, based on experience and the known relative size of objects (the human brain is pretty amazing!).  I am now 65 years old and the world definitely does not look &quot;flat&quot; to me.  In fact, I played minor league professional baseball in the early 1970s for 3 years and did just fine (I was an outfielder).  The doctors told me that had I been much older when the accident occurred my brain may not have been able to compensate quite as well.  So, my youth at the time worked in my favor.  The main downside to having only one eye, as I see it, is that I am very well acquainted with the right-hand side of my nose.  Most people don&#39;t even see their noses unless they cross their eyes.  I see mine all of the time!  Have a wonderful day and keep making these wonderful videos.

Also, the easy way to create 3D movies is to use two cameras. However many 3D movies are made 3D in post-production. The editors move the foreground in front of the background different amounts for the two images to create binocular parallax. The post-production will give some depth to the images, but will not be the true 3D you see when you look outside, unless they really went all-out in post production. The same is true of 2D to 3D conversions. There are some 3D TVs that can convert regular 2D images to 3D using the same technique.
