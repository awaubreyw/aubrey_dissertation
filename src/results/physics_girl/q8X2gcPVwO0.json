When you open a faucet connected to a hose, you expose the water in the hose to pressure. It pushes the water making the current flow, the more pressure the more energy the water has. Voltage is ELECTRICAL PRESSURE and like water pressure it goes nowhere, it only pushes the electrons through the wire. It forces a current of electrons (measured in amps) to jump from their orbit on one copper atom to the next atom, all the way through the circuit. The voltage is created by the attraction force that the - negative charge of the electrons in the battery have for the + positive side of the battery, just like north and south ends of magnets are attracted. If you connect a light bulb to + and - battery terminals the electrons will flow through it.<br> The material a light bulb filament is made of has higher resistance to electrical flow (measured in ohm&#39;s) than wire has.

Try dropping the flat battery and full battery from a given height and witnesses how they bounce differently too... <br>Take it from me!

( I don&#39;t know ! ...LOL) ... one may put attention on water, ice, and steam because they can store  (heat) energy... but could this be done having fun and not in a too serious way ? ... the weather forecast also involves talking about &quot;probability&quot; ....

Physics is an interesting subject, although it&#39;s not my favourite. I really like to learn about this new perspective of seeing things, but it&#39;s so hard. I do put in alot of work to achieve good grades. I watch a ton of videoes, read through the textbook and other textbooks aswell, but i still don&#39;t manage to understand and do all the tasks in the book. I know it means that i haven&#39;t fully understood it yet, but it&#39;s just very frustrating... I try to learn from my mistake. I tell myself that &quot;next time you&#39;ll get it.&quot; I try to look at other tasks that can help me to reflect and describe other phenomena&#39;s with what i have learned. Still, it feels like i&#39;m not getting anywhere. I don&#39;t know what to do anymore. I don&#39;t want to give up. I have considerd to get a tutor, or perhabs take extra clases. If you have any advice, i would be happy to hear. I love your channel btw. Your videoes have helped me alot!
