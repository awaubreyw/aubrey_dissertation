You explained it in a very vague manner in that you don&#39;t spepcifically enbrace the narrowing down of all the possibilities thrown out by mainstrezm &quot;science&quot; which is more of a modern science than the science of Newton and kelpler,  the recent observations from JW images prove there was no &quot;big bang&#39; as definded by the modern theory.  Although you were able to conceed that notion by analysis of the constant expansion of the heavens.  I like that you did that and how you presented it in this video.  The truth is that at this time, as Dylan says &quot; where we were born in time&quot;, the revaltions of the universe,  will be excelled due to the significant leap in technology, with greater &quot;before our eyes&quot; findings that just enielates the silly theories most would like to belive in.  GENESIS 1:1.  EVERY WORD WRITTEN IN THAT VERSE IS what the findings point too as the most probable begging more so than any other theory, all of them now do not fit as a solution more so than GENISIS 1:1.<br><br>Ahh but this is not to say this is a scientific proof of GENSIS 1:1.  For with additional information in the Bible, the word says &quot;But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&quot;.  There will not be a scientific method that comes now or in the future that will prove that the Lord is the I AM as recorded in the ancient  Hebrew text nor will there be a scientific method to proof that there is not, one HOLY CREATOR.  Nor any physical evidence debunking any event in history recorded in the Bible as from never occurring.  GOD IS SPIRIT. The spirit realm is not where our scientific method occurs.  But we do have a built in doorway to the spiritual realm  by faith in God through the redemption of Jesus Christ .  The doorway is by faith in Jesus.<br>Look at the heaves, the universe and see the creation of your CREATOR,  and know he is God.  There is no doubt of his wonders, simply perfect.  Remember all the modern science tangents and failed theories, how they come and go but the truth has never changed nor altered,.  GOD is everlasting, He is infinite.  If you want to visually see what the shadow of infinity IS go look at the Mandelbrot set.  Also look at the code in DNA.  There will not be an excuse for anyone to conclude that all of us. All before, present and to come, no more can one be in doubt, tto think that universe is by chance.  Those who will still hold on tight to any  theory,  always by which is carefully constructed to pointing away from what is written to be true in the Bible , they do so evermore today without realizing they are soon going to have to abandon the scientific method for some sort of revised reasoning - if there heart is hardened to God.

We all know our universe will end some day, time will become meaningless, our bubble has popped and even if every bubble in a dough popped, the bubble the dough baking people are in, hasnt popped yet.

Imagine for a second, we as humans are bacteria, living on a fish, that&#39;s moving in a pond. There is no running water, and it&#39;s still. Each ripple that carries water around, moves the objects around it. So IE dropping a stone into the water, moves the water, and everything in it. I see that like the expansion of our universe. We&#39;re everything in it, so in that case, using this example. We could not see nor observe the water, as we&#39;d never think to look at the space that surrounds us. I know it&#39;s a little more complex, and far fetched.

Lets be honest, if &quot;something&quot; came from another dimension it wouldn&#39;t have any height or width so we wouldn&#39;t know it was even there!

Heaven is spaceless, timeless, and infinite. <br><br>Then came the fall of Lucifer and the angels that followed him. Which we gleen from Revalations 12 that a 3rd of the angels fell from heaven.  Now think of what it means to fall from heaven? Would that not also mean to become separated from light? Lucifer and his fallen angels became darkness, and it was spreading throughout God&#39;s infinite heaven.<br><br>Now to stop this dark and corrupted heaven from spreading for all eternity He first separated it, dividing pure heaven and corrupt heaven. Then began to compact the darkness. Think of what happens when you compact a gas. It first would turn to into liquid, then after further compaction would turn to solid.  This compacted, corrupted portion of heaven, would become all that we know of as space and time. I say time, because it has a limit, it will be destroyed one day. Remember though, a 3rd of infinity is still infinity. Thus, from our point of view, all of space and time is infinite. The more our technology increases the further out we see and also the smaller things we find. Because it&#39;s infinite! Lastly, He created man and put him in charge of it, and when know what happens after that. <br><br>This space and time will continue to HAVE place and time, thick and thin, contract and expand, until God fills this place fully again, extinguishing all the darkness and turning it back again into purified heaven.  The Bible refers to this as &quot;the day off the Lord.&quot;  <br><br>Where &quot;The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.\r<br>II Peter 3:10 NKJV <br><br>Furthermore, I want to expand on God&#39;s love for us. Because He forknew that all of space and time would be destroyed one day, and that His children (sons of Adam) would be destroyed and forever be cast out of heaven with lucifer and his fallen angels. So He sent Jesus to save us.  Read John 3:16-17 with all this in mind. <br><br>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

We&#39;re still trying to make sense of the physics and the math outside the border of our understanding while perhaps we should just take a step back and look at a bigger picture. Space expanding: yes, that explains what we&#39;re observing (great analogy with the rising bread). Big Bang pass\u00e9: probably makes sense. Everything starts some time, some how. Something from nothing is wrong. In our scope it may seem like the expanding universe &quot;suddenly&quot; started from nothing, but from the &quot;outside&quot;, our universe could just be a thought or - watch it, I&#39;m gonna say it - a program. Before the Big Bang, there was no program, then the &quot;outside&quot; started the program (called for instance &quot;universe test version 503.027&quot;) and there we were an algorithm filled with a physics engine and some random mechanisms (read &quot;quantum&quot; mechanics). While our universe slugged through the billions of years and developed into what we experience now, from an &quot;outside&quot; view, the program may have just spent a few minutes getting to this point in our simulation (yes!). So are we expanding into something? yes and no. Say our universe (from our perspective) is an expanding bubble (bread). What&#39;s outside of this universe bubble has simply not been defined yet. There is no data yet. So, the word &quot;nothing&quot; comes pretty close, but once a bit more time has passed, more of that nothing has been &quot;filled&quot; with data (as the bubble expanded some more). So, from an &quot;outside&quot; point of view, we could say, our universe is expanding into &quot;computer memory&quot; of the &quot;outside&quot;.<br>So where is &quot;outside&quot;: anybody&#39;s guess. Could be a computer on an &quot;outside&quot; kid&#39;s desk or the mainframe in some &quot;outside&quot; university&#39;s simulation lab.<br>Parallel universes: Sure, why not. Given enough computer power, our &quot;outside&quot; kid can run 5 simulations at the same time (or a hundred...)<br><br>Quantum level physics and discrepancies with common sense: <br>Take the double slit experiment: nobody observing, there is no need for the simulation to follow each photon. The program applies the wave logic. Some of us observing the photon, now there is a reason to calculate that kind of resolution, so the photons behave differently. Solved!<br>Information between entangled quantum particles travelling faster than the speed of light (like instantaneously): Why not: When the simulation is programmed to entangle information, it is only a matter of the &quot;outside&quot; program to determine that the state of one entangled particle has changed to then instantly change the state of the other particle. The information does not actually need to travel from particle to particle. <br>Get it? Take a step back - outside.<br>What I am interested however, is how can we stirr up enough of a mess to get the attention of the &quot;outside&quot; so we can interact with them and find out more about the outside?

We see only a small part of the expanding universe. Slivers of the universe may not all expand. Some slivers may contract. We see objects now 50 billion lightyears away. That is older than the universe itself. So we either have miscalculated the age of the universe or the distance of the most far object we see. If the universe is like an orange, our observable univers is like one part of the orange. Our part of the Universe may be 14 billion years old and its width also 14 billion lightyears. Opposing parts of the orange universe would be at least 28 billion lightyears apart, unless we look at the far objects in a curved way and not a straight line. I myself believe that every part of orange universe behaves differently, like the fragments of an exploding handgranate travel at different speeds and directions. Some shrapnel may travel in curved ways, some in straight trajectories, sometimes colliding with each other. So, one day suddenly stars and galacties may suddenly appear or disappear. This solves the age of the universe and two objects travel at double or three times the speed of light because of trajectories and the existing of dark matter is explained because we can&#39;t see the objects from other parts of the universe while they still interact with our part of Orange Universe.  Orange Universe may explain a lot of inconsistencies in the standartd model. So dark matter is matter that travels faster than light. Just like a fighter aircraft first passing us and only then we hear the boom. In Orange Universe objects pass us by but we don&#39;t see them, unless they collide with something.

Perhaps the closer galaxies are giving us a truer reading of how fast galaxies are moving today.

Also, to say the Universe was just there, but closer together sounds like creationism. Personally I think there were Many Big Bangs from different parts of the visible universe at different times.

Therefore our understanding of changes in consciousness and not the material world should be a higher focus of the natural sciences. For example, what causes the exponential growth in humans that leads to our memory?  Science needs to work harder on, what is consciousness and less on, what is the material world. Essentially, we wake up in this existence and start asking: Where we are?, but never, Why we are? or What we are? By ignoring this, science leaves it to the realm of religion and  mystery when it should be a main focus of science. Perhaps we are the cause and the universe is the effect.  Because for all the ways we dress it up we are still talking about an expanding ether that was proposed by the Greeks 1000&#39;s of years ago.

This theory is also based on the assumption that light travels at a constant speed for enormously long periods of time. But how do we know this for certain? Some call this the &quot;Tired Light&quot; theory, and it is largely ignored, but as far as I know, it has never been dis-proven. Is it not possible that over a period of billions of years, light does not travel at a constant speed? Space is not empty, it is full of energy in every nook and corner. Photons, and other elements of the electromagnetic spectrum are everywhere in space. All moving in every direction simultaneously. <br>Is it safe to assume that visible light travels at the same speed all the while bumping into, and passing through, all manner of other wave energy, over very long periods? I find this assumption difficult to believe. In other words, our universe may APPEAR to be expanding while in fact it may not. Rather it might be endlessly and dynamically stable, without beginning or end.  <br>Another argument against the idea of an expanding universe might be this. Since motion is relative, one body in relation to another, and there is no known center, AND if there are very distant galaxies moving away from us at greater than the speed of light, that would also mean we are moving away from THEM at greater than the speed of light. Correct? How can this be true. There must be another explanation, and that explanation lies somewhere in HOW exactly we are making astronomical observations, and what conclusions are drawn.

The big bang theory is ridiculous, but how is it possible to imagine the universe without a beginning or end? <br>I don&#39;t know, but imagine our vision of objects in the world. We know objects have 3 dimensions, but our eyes only see 2. Our eyes can only see 1 side of a bowling ball, but we assume there is another side, therefore we assume the bowling ball has 3 dimensions. Now look at a pencil a foot away from you. Our eyes can actually see a little of the other side of the pencil, so even though it does not mentally register, we are actually seeing a miniscule part of the 3rd dimension. Vision is a physical attribute, but our mind lets us imagine the concept of 3 dimensions. Our mind is way more complex than our eyes. Our mind can conceptualize the idea of the 3rd dimension even if we cannot visually see it. If our imagination is able to identify that 3 dimensions exist, is there a way to envision something (let&#39;s call it the 4th dimension) that will enable us to expand our mental capacity to see a miniscule part outside of our understanding of the 3 dimensions, to imagine something with neither a beginning nor end.", "comment_date": "2022-04-04T19:34:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mdanov", "comment_text": "The only way I can wrap my mind around this is imagining our universe as a blob expanding into emptiness.

So space endlessly expands and, when it spreads everything out thinly enough, new stuff just starts to appear to reconcile the instability. Then, it starts to collect and condense, and it starts forming matter which eventually becomes massive enough to form hydrogen gas, which coalesces into stars, which starts the process of forming galaxies.

However, on the scale of millions of light years (where individual photons are now stretched to cover an area greater than the wavelength of light) then the individual photons must lose energy as they interact with matter in space. Since a spec of dust millions of light years from the source is not going to cast a shadow light years wide (because the light rays are nearly parallel) the photon in the vacinity of the spec of dust loses energy (wavelength increases, frequency decreases) because there are not enough photons around to say some fraction of them hit the dust as in particle-wave duality experiments. It is a quantum effect on an intergalactic scale that creates the illusion of red shift of distant galaxies. The particle nature of light degrades on a cosmic scale when the effective distance between photons approximates the wavelength of those photons. There is no need for dark matter, dark energy, or cosmic inflation. The Big Bang, dark matter, and dark energy hinge on red shift which can be explained away by a much less complicated mechanism.

If you got this far into the comments, I&#39;d like to point out that there are NO physical real examples of actual infinity - period.  &quot;Potential&quot; infinities are not actual infinities. For example, if you start counting in whole numbers starting at 1, you could potentially continue forever and never reach the end. But as soon as you stop counting, you arrive at a whole number that is not infinity -- far from it. This will be true for anything you can name or imagine. Count up to a google plex to the power of a google plex to the power of a google plex to the power of a google plex -- which would be more atoms in the entire known universe -- yet is still nowhere near infinity. In fact, you haven&#39;t even started on the road to infinity. This is because infinity is not a large number. It&#39;s a concept and nothing more. Infinity shares the same paradoxical properties as &quot;0.&quot;  <br><br>The universe cannot  be infinite because it would require infinite energy. Since the universe is expanding, it would require ever greater amounts of energy. And if there is no beginning,  the universe would require infinite energy both infinitely back in time as well as forward in time. An infinite universe creates unsolvable paradoxes in logic, time and energy. <br>Such attempts to revive the concept of an infinite universe are resurfacing in videos such as this one, and in papers and books on physics and astronomy for only one reason: Current serious scientific theories have run into a brick wall when they attempt to see beyond the big bang. Understanding breaks down with no next steps. Since they cannot explain what they are being told by their own numbers and observations, they can go no further. So, they retreat to a concept that no one can prove exists. See, even if infinity actually existed, you could never prove it. There are no concepts, maths, or mechanisms either now available or even conceivable to do so. This is not an opinion. This is just a fact. Other actual/real/existing universes/realities outside of ours are nothing more than conjecture, wishful thinking, or religion. That is not science.<br><br>The disturbing thing is that Dianna/Physics Girl knows this. She took the same math classes you and I did. Of all the sciences, mathematics is the only one that provides something called a proof.

Now at some point we keep modifying this understanding as we learn more.<br>Few things to consider when answering the question what is our universe expanding into? Ans: We are still crawling at an amoeba&#39;s pace on this issue.<br>There are some prerequisite questions to 1st consider. The analogy of your baked bread or cake is a good simple analogy. However, that analogy does not hold water<br>because in a baked bread and/or cake density of stuff it consists of between the raisins in terms of distances and/or space-time may not be uniform. Question is whether this density of <br>space-time uniform in the universe? To talk about velocity/speed and distances this assumption is again in error, because we are not considering that we are actually measuring momentum.<br>And here is the real rub: Is Momentum relative? And how does it react in differing densities. The problem we have is that we see things in terms of humancentric viewpoint. And may be that is all we can do. But the real answer lies at the galactic level. If the universe was even an infinite singularity at time=0, right after zero when it exploded/expanded who is to say that certain particulates portions of the infinitely small singularity was traveling at different speed than other particulates? Does an explosion in pure vacuum expand in every direction equally? Answer no. Only if the singularity explodes/expands uniformly from within with a uniform density.<br>Then the next argument is well, we don&#39;t have a singularity, we had something close to it which is not infinitesimal but actually has some volume. This does not prove that the stuff is uniform still.<br>One other miscalculation we do not consider, is once a particulate of the singularity splits at some point in time would some of these particulates explode again at different rates and veracity resulting in different momentum of expansion? Unfortunately, we are not at time 0, and we are not at end of time either.  We are somewhere where this so-called expansion is still happening and that is why we lack the relative points of reference so we theorize as best as we can. Let&#39;s assume that volume of space is a glass Jar. The issue of it being finite or infinite is irrelevant to us because we are so infinitesimally small to it in comparison. Now assume at the center, universal expansion happens. Irregardless of space-time or relativity we know certain laws of mathematics that are the axioms Irregardless of the universe or its different contents. These 2 laws are: Laws of diffusion and equilibrium. Even in quantum physics these 2 laws are the most probable answers. The issue is how diffusion proceeds and ends and how the equilibrium proceeds, and ends based on the environmental boundry conditions in question which are unknown and can only be theorized as best guesses. Some people like to replace law of diffusion with law of entropy; however, this is inaccurate. Because entropy is actually a subset of diffusion and does not quite explain diffusion law in its totality or entirety again based on boundry conditions.<br>One issue that I would like to touch base on is that I haven&#39;t seen any in-depth considerations on the issue of Matter, Anti-matter total annihilation. Which should shed some light (excuse the pun) that from somethings  result in nothing and the reverse should also be true that from nothing suddenly you have somethings that are opposite of each other. We as humans really need to clearly be able to comprehend these relevancies  of subject matters.

It&#39;s essentially this: The doppler effect. When speaking of the universe, the red shift.  That is, if the source of the light is moving away, the frequency of the light will appear lower than it would if the source was stationary, because the wave is being stretched out over space. It&#39;s just like when the train passes you it sounds like the train&#39;s horn lowers in pitch. The thing is, the claim that the universe <i>is expanding</i> is a <b>HUGE</b> assertion that cannot be proven.  When dealing with space, we do know that we are dealing with vast distances; distances so vast that we cannot observe in real time the motion of other stars. The nearest star outside our solar system, Proxima Centauri is 4.26 light years away. So, it would take over four years to <i>directly observe</i> that it <i>is</i> moving away from us without extrapolation. Distant stars&#39; motion can&#39;t be directly observed within a lifetime, or much longer. So the best we can say, if we&#39;re honest, is that the universe either is expanding, or at some point did expand. I think that&#39;s an important point. If we were standing by a train track and the train passed us traveling at a constant speed and sounding it&#39;s horn constantly, during it&#39;s approach we would hear the horn at a higher pitch than it&#39;s actually putting out. Right at the moment it passed us, for a split second, we would hear the true pitch of the horn, and after it passed and was moving away, we would hear a lower pitch. If we could still hear the horn when the train was a mile away from us, we would be able to tell if the train sped up or slowed down or stopped by the change in pitch, but we wouldn&#39;t be able to detect it for a full 5 seconds after it happened. because it took the sound that long to travel the mile between the train and us. It&#39;s the same with the stars, but on a much larger scale. Icarus is the farthest star we&#39;ve seen, and it&#39;s 5 billion light years away.

If it is let&#39;s say a bubble among many, from our viewpoint the &quot;space&quot; they inhabit may be completely irrelevant to our science here as, being outside the boundaries of our universe, every physical law can be completely different. This might mean that we don&#39;t ever need to take it into account for any calculation ever within our universe. Taking it further you&#39;re asking what is the fabric of our space expanding into but this is funny no? I mean the analogy is the bread expanding into our space but our space can be stretched and expanded. What&#39;s to say the &quot;space&quot; where the universes lay, doesn&#39;t have this function? Or that it is what is actually expanding and causing ours to expand by proxy? <br>Then there&#39;s the whole infinite thing. Not necessarily, this presupposes some kind of all encompassing homogeneity existing throughout this reality and the reality that holds this reality, which doesn&#39;t seem correct. Our universe with our current laws may have started with a big bang, be expanding into another &quot;super&quot; reality, and the &quot;super&quot; reality could be infinite while ours is finite. There&#39;s also the possibility that trajectory lines or space work different in the super reality than it does in the &quot;sub&quot; reality. Our universe existing in that reality would then mean the formation of it could follow the laws of that reality while we inside it can only perceive based on the laws inside. Imagine string itself is your universe right? Well here in the &quot;super&quot; reality the string can be folded bunched up balled up or stretched out perfectly and it wouldn&#39;t make a difference to you living within the string universe. Now lets say theres a glass bottle and the bottle has inside of it, its own physical laws, I start putting string in the bottle slowly feeding it into the bottle, as the string goes in, it creates the string &quot;sub&quot; reality. Now the beings in the string sub reality they experience the bottle but don&#39;t know they do because it is constant unchanging background not just that but the perception of the bottle requires the physical laws of this reality, which the inside of the bottle does not have. To them, the real universe is the string itself. Now i can keep feeding string into the bottle and first it might be straight before it touches the borders of the bottle but eventually it touches the border and begins bending folding bunching up. To us it&#39;s bent and bunched up, to them, it isn&#39;t, because their entire reality exists within the string itself once the string is within the border of the physical laws that the bottle has inside. They would notice their universe expand and wonder what it&#39;s expanding into, and relative to them, that could be nothing. The string can be bunched up more and have more string within the same volume from our super reality perspective, but they would just see their universe expanding as more string is put into the bottle, even if its bunching up and compressing itself from our perspective. This could be how our universe expands. Imagine what to us is intangible space to a being in a super reality above ours is let&#39;s say a physical item that can be infinitely bunched up and folded in on itself. We would not have the ability to perceive that, living within this reality and subject to its physical laws.<br><br>Oh, there you go, right at the end touched on just about all of this.

The knowledge about the Universe has under this time increased enormously, which has made the BBT theory even more difficult to explain and defend. Example 1: When it was discovered that the speed of light as a maximum velocity for transportation of energy and matter was insufficient to explain very distant galaxies, Guth invented the &quot;Inflation&quot; period during which energy and matter could attain velocities many times exceeding that of light in vacuum. Example 2: When Vera Rubin discovered that BBT wasn&#39;t followed in the arms of spiral galaxies an easy way out of her problem had been to say: BBT theory is false, spiral galaxies are expanding. But no, she and others found it more convincing to invent a strange matter, the so called &quot;dark matter,&quot; which to this day is undiscovered after a cost of 100ds of millions dollars of research. Example 3: Instead of researching &quot;tired light,&quot; which by an extremely dubious argumentation was declared to not exist, &quot;dark energy&quot; was invented, as  being more probable to exist than a damping of an energy oscillation according to the Einsteinian Theory of General Relativity (see Jian-Miin Liu).

Nothing is faster than light though, right? This has been proven many times to be absolutely correct. So this proof should give you the clue you need to come to the correct assumption about distant galaxies moving around. <br><br>It is not the distant galaxies that are going faster than light, rather it is the light from those galaxies that has slowed down, at least in our point of view. Remember that nothing does work for free. A photon is no exception to this rule. And so a photon does not travel such large distances without losing some of its own energy, and it gets &quot;tired&quot;, and so looks red to us here. The farther it has to go the redder it looks. Other things getting in the way add to this effect too: eg, dust, atoms, assorted other radiation and forces bashing into the photons as it travels to our eyes here. However, this redding is not measurable except in the most extreme galactic distances since it takes a lot to slow down a photon in &quot;empty&quot; space.<br><br>This is what Hubble and his pals saw but did not understand in the early 20th century.

Halton Arp\u2019s work showed that redshift wasn\u2019t conclusively showing objects moving away but was actually showing us the youth of an object. The bluer the shift, the newer it is, the redder the shift, the older. His work was rejected out of hand because an influential scientific periodical declared it \u2018exceeded\u2019 his \u2018imagination\u2019, and effectively ended Arp\u2019s career. The notion of a \u2018big bang\u2019 makes absolutely no sense. \u201cGive me one miracle and we\u2019ll explain the rest\u201d simply doesn\u2019t cut it. The universe doesn\u2019t require an geocentric explanation. Lemaitre was a Catholic Priest who said the universe was an egg, and Einstein said it was \u2018elegant\u2019 and thus the \u2018big bang\u2019 was born\u2026 from a PRIEST. Big Bang is pseudo-science. Would be far more intellectually and scientifically honest to say \u2018we don\u2019t know\u2019 rather than perpetuating this religious nonsense. All this \u2018Big Bang/expansion\u2019 or \u2018started from a singularity\u2019 to \u2018it was just very small and magically expanded\u2019 without any explanation as to HOW is NOT science. It\u2019s adhockery up one assumption, upon a miracle. Hubble towards the end of his life was not convinced by the Big Bang or expansion and deferred to his colleague\u2019s, Halton Arp\u2019s discoveries that showed the the universe was static, and the far distant quasars were actually a lot closer, just younger. If only Arp was as recognised as Hubble, we\u2019d probably stop this utter nonsense that has diminished the Queen of the sciences for the past one hundred years.<br><br>I\u2019ll end on this. If the universe is expanding \u2018into something\u2019, then it\u2019s not a \u2018UNIverse\u2019, or we expand what the universe is, and that the \u2018observable\u2019 universe is expanding into the rest of the universe. But without being able to see that far, let\u2019s stop with the assumptions. Is the Universe infinite? No, I think that\u2019s a cop out. If the universe has form and that form has geometry within it, then the universe itself must be stable to the point that it has balance and form, meaning there must be a centre and therefore a shape, and therefore a geometry to it.

Now that doesnt mean we are expanding at the same speed.

So my question is, if space is expanding or is it an explosion and we as particles are like fragments of a grenade,going out from the point of blast?

After some period of time, the universe has expanded. Are they now more than 1 kilometer apart, or are they still 1 kilometer apart, but that kilometer is somehow bigger than it was originally? When I hear about space expanding or stretching, I think of the latter, with the lines on a Cartesian coordinate system growing ever farther apart, but since those lines represent fixed distances between points, it suggests that the units themselves have somehow changed, but that seems like it&#39;s probably wrong, maybe?<br><br>Another question I have is what sort of effects this expansion has at very small scales.

The expansion of the Universe, as I understand, is a relative phenomenon that is created not so much by an actual expansion but rather by the increasing of a scale factor a(t) in the definition of distances.  Essentially, space-time is &quot;expanding&quot; because the measurement of distances between two points in space-time is increasing due to this scale factor.  Say we have a ruler, and the edges of the ruler never move; however, the definition of how much distance the ruler represents continuously increases over time.  So, when we measure distances with our ruler, the region subtended by the two ends of our ruler measure a continuously increasing distance.  Since the laws of physics are parameterized by this distance measurement, we will observe phenomenon that is consistent with objects being forced further and further apart, even though they may not actually be moving.<br><br>So, as I understand it, the Universe is not expanding in the real sense that we think of expansion (that is, the cartoons of the expanding balloon or the expanding loaf of bread with raisins are mis-representations).

It&#39;s starting to look like Y, but in fact what it really looks like is that we are far from understanding the universe.  That makes the process of learning about it no less exciting, but you will push our learning outward more effectively if you don&#39;t freeze your thinking with presumptions of knowledge.  Speaking of which, another way to stunt one&#39;s thinking is to use concepts that have no basis in reality or no relevance to that which one is thinking about.  Two concepts which it would be fruitful to examine in this regard are:  &quot;infinite&quot; and &quot;into&quot;.  &quot;Infinite&quot; should be questioned because it has no basis in reality.  Not in the same sense as it has application in mathematics, where it has a specific meaning.  What concretes could you possibly hold under the concept &quot;infinite&quot;?  There are no examples, it is not a knowable quality in reality.  If you think with such a floating idea which is disconnected from reality, how can you hope to arrive at the truth?  &quot;Into&quot; is different.  We have referents in the real world for this relationship.  The only problem with applying it to the universe&#39;s apparent expansion is that any border of the universe is completely outside of any context we have access to at this time.  We have no way of applying the concept of &quot;into&quot; to what is going on outside what is currently knowable.  So if you build &quot;into&quot; into your thinking about the expanding universe your are putting a limitation on your thinking which is completely unjustified.  Yes that leads to the need to consider the concept &quot;expanding&quot;.  It may need a specialized definition in astrophysics (which it probably already has somewhere), or it needs to be replaced with something more precisely tied to the evidence, which once again would free one&#39;s thinking to ponder actualities unencumbered by unjustified conceptual baggage brought in on a word borrowed from our day to day experience.", "comment_date": "2022-03-13T17:26:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carl Defoe", "comment_text": "If everything is moving away from us, how come the Andromeda galaxy is due to collide with us?

No, that&#39;s <b>not</b> what the Friedman solution (actually, the FRWL solution) says or is! The universe at time 0 is <b>still</b> a 3-dimensional space, not a single point.<br><br>In particular, only a <b>subset</b> of the space at time 0 lies within any past light cone (i.e. the visible sky); which precludes any notion of space being a point at time 0. The whole idea of &quot;space expanding into&quot; anything or &quot;space being a point&quot; at time zero is based on this bogus visualization of the Big Bang as a Cosmic Egg.<br><br>It is <b>not</b> a point at time 0. It just happens to be a 3D space on which distances between points are zero ... which is completely different thing. And another way to say that &quot;the universe is expanding&quot; is that distances between points are getting larger with time. All that can be made to make perfect sense with a perfectly clear understanding, if you remember that in Relativity, spatial distances are in light-speed units. So, another way of saying the same thing is that you have a King&#39;s Thumb Problem with light speed, itself. &quot;Spatial distance is 0 at time 0&quot; = &quot;Light speed is infinite at time 0&quot; (i.e. the time zero 3D space is what&#39;s referred to as a &quot;null 3D hyper-surface&quot;); and &quot;spatial distance increases over time&quot; = &quot;light speed is slowing down over time&quot;. And the &quot;Big Rip&quot; is where light speed goes to 0.<br><br>You can see this most graphically, by plotting all spatial points (i.e. all comoving geodesics) vertically on a space-time graph, and plotting instants at equal &quot;cosmic time&quot; (which is a thing in FRWL models) horizontally, and suppressing a spatial dimension. Then light cones get more and more narrow as time goes on; and light speed geodesics become more and more vertical, while at time zero, they become asymptotically horizontal. For a Big Rip, the light cones would become vertical lines.<br><br>For any version of FRWL that is initially &quot;radiation dominant&quot; as time goes to 0, the growth factor starts out as linear in time. For such solutions, the light cone actually splays out at time 0, but lands on the time 0 surface at a <b>finite</b> radius and ... (surprise!) actually proceeds to the other direction back toward the future and outward to spatial infinity. It&#39;s shaped like a sombrero with a pointed tip. In the vicinity of time 0, the light-speed geodesics curve parabolically and reflect off the time 0 surface.<br><br>For these cases of FRWL, the metric is continuous at time 0, and there is a continuation of the solution for t &lt; 0. In the t &lt; 0 side, the time dimension is a spatial dimension; and the 3 + 1 dimensions of spacetime become a 4 dimensional timeless space. That&#39;s an example of a &quot;signature-changing&quot; solution.<br><br>It&#39;s known that for signature-changing solutions that have a null surface at time 0 (i.e. where light speed goes to infinity), that the 3+1 dimensional and 4 dimensional sectors can only be fit together consistently, if there is inflation in early times. That&#39;s something Mansouri discovered a while back. Consistency conditions, in general, for signature-changing solutions are called &quot;junction conditions&quot; and inflation is <b>predicted</b> as a junction condition for such solutions.<br><br>The whole visualization of some kind of &quot;cosmic egg&quot; is nothing but folklore myth and is a totally bogus and wrong visualization that has little or nothing to do with the FRWL solution! Never mind that it&#39;s the visualization that many people have grown up on - including those (like you) who entered the field. In fact, in case you forgot, there is actually no covariant concept of &quot;spatial length&quot; at all. Instead, the &quot;metric&quot; measures space <b>time</b> distance, which is an entirely different concept (and it may be best thought of as &quot;proximity to the light cone&quot;). The Cosmic Egg visualization came, originally, from the Vatican (who was involved in all this, because of the L in the FRWL - Lema\u00eetre).

This is the opposite of the scientific method. We should try to disprove it, and if it stands that test, it is a good theory.<br><br>You see, we have then assumed that redshift is only the speed of galaxies moving either towards or away from us, and we have ignored sane scientific evidence to the contrary (remember, we&#39;re not trying to disprove it!). The esteemed astronomer Halton Arp, in his book &quot;Catalog of Discordant Redshift Associations&quot; showed that not only are there dual galaxies that are connected, but with vastly different redshifts, and not only that redshift seems to be quantized (meaning the Earth is in the dead center of the Universe, a return to the Middle Ages in scientific thinking), but also that quasars in the centers of huge galaxies spit out companion galaxies axially, whose redshift starts off very high (3+) and then reduces as the newly emerging child galaxy ages. This would indicate that redshift has an intrinsic component, something that has more recently had evidence for - it appears to be linked to the concentration of hydrogen.<br><br>Then we looked at Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) to determine if there was a residual trace of the big bang, but unfortunately every single probe sent to measure this has had failures.

As kinda odd as that sounds hear me out. Everything in the material universe is filled with electromagnetic energy and matter produces electromagnetic fields from the atom upwards, as above so below Essentially because even our planet created this bubble and is itself inside of a bubble we call an atmosphere. The sun also has an electromagnetic field and also creates a bubble of radiation around our solar system. The galaxy, the Milky Way, that we inhabit is also in a field of it&#39;s own and is expanding outwardly just as our universe is expanding. What&#39;s interesting is new stars and star systems form on the edge of our Milky Way Galaxy all the time and we will eventually expand or appear to be on a collision course of expansion with our neighbor Andromeda. So essentially our universe is full of galaxies constantly expanding into each other as well as outwardly too which begs the question if our solar system is expanding also since the sun itself is also expansive. Food for thought!, we imagine that the sun will grow to consume Earth eventually billions of years from now but what if as the sun expands and grows in size it&#39;s bubble and field of gravity also expands with it which allows room for the planets and their distances from the sun to also expand leaving us with a prediction of our solar system billions of years into the future with a much larger sun but Earth pushed far enough away that it is neither consumed nor heated up to temperatures we can&#39;t survive. So essentially in my mind I envision an ever expanding multiverse of ever expanding space with ever expanding universes and ever expanding galaxies with ever expanding solar systems with ever expanding sun with all new sun&#39;s, planets, solar systems, galaxies, and universes ever expanding out of the space between much like a fractal which is based on the idea of Phi as seen in all of the Universe.", "comment_date": "2022-03-03T04:09:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pons Cardinal", "comment_text": "It sounds smart.

But when you exist within those differences your experience of perception doesn&#39;t match that description.  No matter how many times scientists try to deny it, an average layman would still say that if the universe is expanding faster and faster in every direction at the same time, then there is definitely a point at the universe would have its slowest possible expansion..and that would be the center point.  You can&#39;t escape that.  If you could eventually draw a line from where we are in the universe to that center point, and then continue the line to the same distance on the opposite side of that point.. (forgetting that we can&#39;t actually see it because of the distances and speeds involved) we should perceive that a galaxy that is there is moving away from us at a squared velocity.   Even if you argue that the edges of the universe are not uniform, you can model concentric circles from the center to just about the edge of the universe.   At the &quot;big bang&quot; a huge amount of mass was suddenly here.  And after a moment of cooling expansion began.  At that moment, the universe was roughly the size of a volleyball.  The way I tend to think of it is that there was a huge amount of mass that suddenly sunk the shape of the universe to a giant parabola (in terms of there suddenly being gravity).  And every second since, a little bit of the gravy gets dumped out of its tureen to just outside the edge of the tureen.  As new gravy gets dumped, the pre-existing dumped gravy gets pushed out.  The further you get from the bowl, the thinner the gravy is, and the faster it expands.  My guess is, the heat death of the universe will occur at roughly the same time in which all of the scoops of gravy that got dumped are equal in mass.  PS.  everything I just described is extremely over generalized.  Further more, I already know that there is a certain aspect of my description that cannot be correct.   However, my statement is only off in terms of math, and not mechanics. And for the purpose of my description, the math doesn&#39;t really need to be accurate.  The fact is, the gravy drops can&#39;t all be the same size.  Because if that were the case, all of the concentric circles I described would be mishappened, and not expand evenly.  As the universe expands, something has to be providing some kind of feed back to the center of the universe to tell it how much matter to release.   Because each time it grows, you need more material the next time to keep the edges round.  So the universe follows an automated process that ejects mass from its center, measures how much more it needs for the next concentric circle, and then ejects that amount.  Just sticking to the first 4 or 5 years of expansion, If the first year was pi amount of space, the second year would need another 2pi worth of space, 3rd year would another 3pi worth of space and so on.", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T19:32:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bashar Rony", "comment_text": "But why??????

If the universe is infinite and expanding, then there is no beginning. You can think of it as the source for a river where the starting point of the river is really small but as it flows away, the river gets bigger. This means that even though galaxies are moving away from the source, an endless supply of galaxies is still coming out of the source, just like an endless supply of water leaves the source of the river.

When a balloon is being inflated we can see that it&#39;s expanding in relation to its surroundings; it is expanding into a surrounding space which (in relation to the balloon) is not expanding. But if the universe contains all the space there is, there can be no relatively stationary environment surrounding it, consequently its expansion cannot be discerned. The early universe contained, or was, all the space there is; however, the same can also be said for the later, supposedly &quot;expanded&quot; universe. But how can &quot;all the space there is&quot; be larger or smaller than &quot;all the space there is&quot;? Nonetheless the redshift must indicate something real and universal, even though &quot;expansion&quot; doesn&#39;t really describe it. Could we say instead that the universe, rather than getting bigger, is actually attenuating, thinning out? And that the &quot;edge&quot; of the universe is the point at which the galaxies, or whatever form matter takes at that point, begin traveling away from us at the speed of light, which means we can no longer receive any information from them, making them effectively non-existent for us? If the galaxies are traveling away from us at a uniform rate dependent upon their distance, then the distance at which they are receding at the speed of light would remain constant for any point in the universe, or any velocity of the observer. Therefore, the universe is not expanding. And this would hold true even if the rate of attenuation is increasing. If the galaxies are receding from each other at X speed, then the universe has a lifespan of X, the time before ALL matter is receding from all other matter at the speed of light. And if that speed is constantly increasing, this would simply mean that the lifespan of the universe is decreasing, which is true of ANY physical reality as it ages. If we could stand OUTSIDE the universe and observe its rate of attenuation, we could assign a fixed lifespan to it. But since we are INSIDE the universe --- given that the universe has nothing outside it --- its lifespan appears to be constantly decreasing due to the increasing speed of the attenuation. This, however, is no different than our own experience of aging, since we can&#39;t (in material terms) stand outside our own lives either: as we get older we experience the passage of time as speeding up, and our lifespan as shrinking. A child of 10 will experience a future lifetime of 70 years as an immense period, while a man of 70 will look back on his past life as if it were no longer than the twinkling of an eye.

Redshift CANNOT explain a Universe expanding faster than the speed of light, the speed of light is constant, if it is redshifted it does not affect its speed as i explain in my video on the expanding road paradox.

Pre the &quot;Big Expansion&quot;, space and matter didn&#39;t exist, and all energy was in a field state too high for excitations to interact.  Fluctuations in that hyper-dimensional energy field caused some of the energy to drop state into a lower energy level, allowing for the first field excitation interactivity (fundamental particles) to occur, triggering a &quot;cascade&quot; of new space formation and displacement.  The Big Expansion happened &quot;everywhere&quot; because this energy transition literally CREATED spacetime through the newly possible particle stability and subsequent interactions.<br><br>This energy transition is still happening in a cascade of entropy, which is what is driving Cosmic Inflation.  Dark energy is just energy emergence at lower field states, increasing the number of field excitations in overlapping quantum fields, and forcing the creation of more space to accommodate them.  <br><br>As a result, gravity itself may simply be the result of stable mass essentially being entropically inert and due to its innate stability, taking on a property akin to a sort of &quot;resistance&quot; to Cosmic Inflation.  As new space is made, space occupied by stable matter doesn&#39;t expand (or at least, not at the same rate), creating an acceleration gradient proportional to the amount of mass resisting the expansion, rather than to the rate of space creation.  This also explains why gravity is so weak relative to the other forces, but cumulatively powerful in its effects on spacetime.  Earth has enough mass to resist Cosmic Inflation and create an acceleration gradient equivalent to 9.8m/s^2.  Antigravity would work by equalizing or neutralizing the local amount of inflation.  Furthermore,  if warp travel ever became a reality, it would be extremely dangerous technology due to the nature of uneven inflation gradient distribution left behind by moving warp bubbles.  <br><br>Lastly, the reason a quantum theory of gravity doesn&#39;t exist is that gravity is a characteristic of an energy state that emerges BECAUSE of the emergence capability of matter in the formative hierarchy of matter and energy formulation. Spacetime and energy don&#39;t exist in the same way we experience them on the macro, hyper-interactive, classical scale.<br><br>Here&#39;s a Fun Fact as a side-note:  It is just as impossible to move backward through space as it is to move backward through time.  You are always moving positively along a dimensional vector, and your orientation is irrelevant.  If you walk backward, you&#39;re not actually MOVING backward, you&#39;re moving forwards while facing backward.  ALL dimensional movement is positive.  In order to move backward through space, you&#39;d have to also move backward through time.  It&#39;s like this... all movement in linear spacetime is positive in all dimensions/directions because you are moving away from an origin point.  Time and the relative distance from that origin point go up as you move through spacetime.  In order to move backward, you&#39;d have to move TOWARD an origin point.

Put those concepts together. The biggest problem with the science here is a common one. Scientists often only see things within the bubble of the dogmatic perspective of their field and can&#39;t see simple truths in front of their noses even when they&#39;re pointed out by someone else. It&#39;s like Egyptologists/archeologists when experts from other fields tell them straight up facts like &quot;this is water erosion&quot; or &quot;this couldn&#39;t have been made with the tools you say it was&quot;, and they&#39;re like &quot;Nope. It&#39;s the way we say it is.&quot; Well, here are some simple truths: 1) Every structure on a cosmic scale is turning out to be roughly spherical. Our solar system seems kind of flat until you include the OORT cloud. Our once supposedly flat Milky Way (along with other galaxies) is gradually inflating from flat to round like a Mylar balloon as we discover more about it. And every spheroid has a center. So, then our &#39;Big Expansion&#39; likely has a center, and thus an &quot;origin point&quot; of some sort. 2) Spacetime is obviously elastic. If it weren&#39;t, objects/structures that passed far behind but near the &quot;wake&quot; of something like our sun would be tossed around like it was still there. You can pull a round sheet of spandex taut enough to roll some balls around on it and still stretch the sheet further and the balls will still make dimples in it. But elasticity still has it&#39;s limits, and our &quot;universe&quot; may eventually snap back whether we think there&#39;s enough mass to cause it to or not. Extra) I still have yet to hear that we&#39;ve observed something disappear at the edge of our observable universe. 3) Spacetime is likely not the ultimate medium for existence. Draw a circle to represent our universe on a piece of paper; doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s so tiny it looks like a dot or it goes to the very edges. Now get rid of the paper; burn it, crumple it up and toss it, whatever. No paper, no universe. Non-existence is just an abstract concept, like zero. If our universe was condensed, then there was/is still some place/thing outside of it that it exists within.<br><br>And, don&#39;t even get me started on that too heavily leaned upon colorblindness test called the Cosmic Microwave Background.

It\u2019s easy to get a moving mental picture but difficult to explain as a snapshot. It all forms time via the movement. And, is it actually moving? If space just grows, then everything is proportionally right where it was. So, entropy becomes like gravity. It seems like there is loss, but everything is self contained. Entropy is born of gravity. If time were to stop, and space stop expanding, then everything would explode. No motion, no mass. It is resistant to motion. Mass and gravity create nothing. They are mere consequences of motion. When we see different trees expanding, it\u2019s actually only one tree at different instances.

I hope someone has the courage to address my points. So\u2026..;\r<br>The universe is not and cannot be infinite. The nature of existence is finitude and there is no aspect of it that can be infinite. To exist is to be delineable\u2026 quantifiable. So, you state that the universe expanded and is expanding still. This is the belief of all physicists and cosmologists as far as I know. So what is expansion? It is the progressive increase in number, value or measure by quantifiable increments. So what would that last measure of expansion have been just before the very next one was infinity? As you can see, infinity is merely an abstraction. If you can explain this away, please do. If not, stop saying that the universe is infinite.<br>\r<br>Additionally, the universe could NOT have always been for the same reasons as that above. If the universe expanded then it was once considerably smaller. Why was it smaller (so small)? What then made is suddenly expand? Or do you propose the cyclical universe theory? I can easily destroy that piffle in about 6 sentences. Please explain.<br>\r<br>You claim in the video that it was infinitely dense. That is not possible. It could have been extremely dense but not infinitely dense. That is like saying that something was infinitely small, which would mean literally that it did not exist at all. The concept of infinity cannot be paired with concepts of finite values or measures. Take a lesson from the Einsteinian understanding that nothing can achieve the speed of light for were it to do so, it would require that infinite energy be applied, etc., WHICH CANNOT HAPPEN, thus the speed cannot be reached.<br>\r<br>Physics defines the deterministic, objective nature of reality.

At T=0 there was nothing, no curvature, no time, nothing. From Wickipedia: &quot;The basics of the theory are fairly simple. In short, the Big Bang hypothesis states that all of the current and past matter in the Universe came into existence at the same time, roughly 13.8 billion years ago. At this time, all matter was compacted into a very small ball with infinite density and intense heat called a Singularity. Suddenly, the Singularity began expanding, and the universe as we know it began.&quot; Hence all matter diverged as it was created and expanded so nothing could ever converge to form anything. Obviously, since this was a one-time event, there would be a void at the location of the singularity. All of the planet, star, galaxy formation theories would be impossible. So tweaking begins, how do we make it all work? So the theory, and it is a theory and always will be, began to evolve into the convoluted conjectural mess we see today.

Simply because with the concept of &quot;infinity&quot;, anything and everything becomes possible and nothing has to make sense any more.  I submit that the concept of &quot;infinity&quot; is in itself nonsensical.  When applied to cosmology, &quot;infinity&quot; becomes as absolutely useless as saying &quot;Gawd dunnit&quot; and is about as meaningful.  \r<br>\r<br>I propose a better way of thinking about it.  Presuming a pre-existing &quot;infinite space&quot; then declaring space started expanding for no apparent reason is a contradiction.  Einstein taught us that there is no space alone or time alone but that only the union, spacetime, has any reality.  He also taught that it is meaningless to speak of spacetime devoid of matter, thus, matter emerged along with spacetime at cosmic t-0.  \r<br>\r<br>Hawking then came along and actually proved, via a reductio ad absurdum argument, in his doctoral thesis that time must have had a beginning - which counters any notion of any pre-existing &quot;infinity&quot; of something, including &quot;space&quot;.  He also pointed out that the emergence of the positive energy matter along with the counterbalancing negative energy spacetime meant that the net energy of the cosmos is zero.  \r<br>\r<br>Therefore, one is forced to conclude two things:  1) The cosmic spacetime manifold is an emergent feature of physical reality, that requires the concurrent emergence of matter, and 2) The cosmos is <i>closed</i> and <b><i>finite</i></b> in terms of both extent of spacetime and amount of matter.  So what is it expanding into?  I posit that the cosmos is temporally finite (13.8 billion years so far) with a finite closed topology that is expanding in overall volume into the future.", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T19:48:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mowby One", "comment_text": "This is what Happens when you read a lot about Astrophysics and think you are a scientist.<br>Bad Science.", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T19:45:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aditya Bhaiya", "comment_text": "Her cute hats and the way she speaks passionately explaining all the physics! \u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T19:42:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Adams", "comment_text": "Cute Hat!", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T19:41:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Emanuel's Workbench", "comment_text": "Great video -- French names can be hard to pronounce:  Lema\u00eetre would be pronounced kind of like &quot;Le - MEH - tre&quot;.

Since everything was so close together, the forces of the bonds made the push away from each other, just like having two of the same polar facing each other with magnets. As such, in the beginning of the big expansion the forces were so great, due to proximity, that those in the outer layers got push out with such a forces than those in the middle that they are still moving away faster than those closest to us, since there&#39;s more space between now and the past as compared to the beginning of time (big expansion).<br><br>&quot;If&quot; everything is moving away on all directions, into infinity, then the known universe is just accelerating faster as there are no forces to keep it in place.

If universal distance is relative to its age, eg, 14 billion years ago we can theorise that space at that time and only at that time was moving at such a high speed. Since then, in the range of a few billion years, galaxies are moving away much slower. My theory is that it is all connected to the heat death theory and the region we are in is much colder now", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T08:35:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "avhuf", "comment_text": "Nice, but you butchered Lema\u00eetre&#39;s name...", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T08:34:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brady Hubbard", "comment_text": "Does the strength of space\u2019s vacuum increase as it stretches?", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T08:33:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mogenar", "comment_text": "&quot;Le &#39;meh&#39; tre&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T08:30:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Philonoist", "comment_text": "(my DP \ud83d\udc48 is my comment) lol", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T08:24:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FJ 4plae", "comment_text": "why is space expanding?", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T08:23:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GodMode_On", "comment_text": "It blows my mind to see how excited you are about Science, absolutely love your videos even though we all understand so little about the universe(s)!", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T08:23:28Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "scribebat", "comment_text": "LOL, i&#39;ll bet the &#39;Big Bang&#39; didn&#39;t happen where <b>you</b> think it did either. i&#39;ll bet you think it&#39;s something from the distant past that we&#39;re racing away from, don&#39;t you?

It is expanding into the Neebert. As for the infinite bit, the Neebert doesn&#39;t seem to have time, time only exists in space time so I can&#39;t comment on that. Things very far away are not moving faster, it just looks like that as space time is being created between us, as space is created in-between the light waves they appear red shifted. The big band is very interesting but to understand it you must first understand how space time is created. The laws of physics are the same at the big bang as now. The mass was not infinite in the <br>Neebert but as there was no space time I will give you that one. It&#39;s not hard to conceive, lot&#39;s of space time was created within all the mass/energy in the universe, nothing moved. Hubble was sort of right but there not actually moving, space time is being created between us and the other galaxies. If they were moving away a clock there or here would run at very different speeds. My ideas are about as far fetched but I have an experiment that I might reveal later than resolve this. Fantastic! You said new space is being created between galaxies all the time?!?!?!  You are 100% right, maybe it&#39;s not such a far fetched theory. Yes they are moving away faster than the speed of light!

Can you (or anyone for that matter) take this challenge? <br>Speaking of higher dimensions, can time itself be multidimensional?  I mean think about it.

(Not in terms of a pedantic mathematician&#39;s perspective but in terms of how a physicist ponders what happens as you transcend into more degrees of freedom)...<br>My actual question is that I have heard all along many physicists (maybe all of them) talk about so and so n dimensions of space and 1 of time and out of all general possibilities in general relativity, our fabric of spacetime happens to be 3 dimensions of space and 1 of time. Good. Now, why is it that &quot;we&quot; think of time as still a one dimensional thing in more degrees of freedom ( in higher dimensional spacetime)? Why not consider that ok space is multidimensional and so is time! ? Are we biased to think that time is only one dimensional no matter what higher dimension you&#39;re in? Do we think of it like this because we perceive entropy (randomness) as a quantity which either increases or decreases (which according to 2nd law only increases) but can&#39;t be anything beyond the mentioned possibilies? <br>PS.  I got this question quite a while ago when I started getting into the core ideas of general relativity (well, beginning with the ideas of special relativity first) when I would always see 3 spatial axes and 1 time axis and I began to wonder: if we were to add more dimensions to our analysis (adding more and more axes on our paper and imagining them to be orthogonal to each other), then why would we never consider more axes for time?

We can determine if a galaxy or star is moving toward us because the hydrogen line will be blue shifted a bit.", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T23:22:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J Dog", "comment_text": "I like to think that maybe there was always a universe, infinite in size.
