Across the top, running horizontal with the ground, is a shaft. The shaft gets 6 three or four ft. Magnets, like 6 inches in diameter each. The magnets are on bearings so that they spin free. Attached to the magnet array is a 1/4 revolution &quot;over the hump&quot; motor winding powered by a battery.  This generator will require either a separate starter motor,  or you can hand spin it to get it started.  Once running,  the drive will fire at the point where the magnets would need a little help getting over the top. As the drive fires, or hits the contact plate, the battery gives a little push over. This generator will produce 1000x the energy needed to charge the battery and keep it running. It will run until you break the circuit.  Every cabin in the woods needs one.  Salt vats with iron rods can be used to store the energy.  This generator can produce whatever energy it&#39;s wired for.  It&#39;s already been tested and proven,  but the inventor was ridiculed and denied patents until it drove him crazy. He&#39;s dead now.  There&#39;s a documentary about him and his generator.

Each is unique in and of itself repeating in 3-dimensions.  Time is 4th dimension.  Now you have time within time.  That is where I think there would be different dimensions of time created as there are repeats of 3 into a 4th dimension called time.  Time within time.  Then you would be everywhere in all dimensions and not everywhere in all dimensions all at the same time or times.<br><br>I think there is like you say, time crystals, but I also think there are times crystal and then multiple crystals of times.  Times crystals.<br>I believe a time crystal would really be a times crystals consisting of dimensions.  Note the plural.  No longer one dimension repeated into repeats of 3 which would give you time, the 4th dimension.  Time within time, the 4th dimension of time of times would create different dimensions that you could slice into 3s.<br>I also believe times crystals exist and not exist at the same moments.<br><br>If you truly have a multiple dimensionals crystals, <br><br>(Yes, I worded it that way on purpose as I believe it is true.) (Do crystals not have crystalline structures which make up larger crystalline structures which then make up the larger crystal, which is only limited by the given size of which you are working or is limited by the given physics in the given dimension?  Now you would have a 4th dimension which is time itself and that is made up of repeats of 3 times which makes 3 dimensional form. <br><br>the structures that make up the dimensionals crystals (or rather dimensionals times or moments) would be unpredictable and predictable because every way a human could come up with and not come up with would be present in terms of &quot;atomic structure&quot; which times crystals are not made of &quot;atomic structures&quot; but of moments of times of moments of time <br>which would be multifaceted and infinite <br>and each moments would be multi-dimensional. <br><br>All possibilities would have to be present and not present at the same moment of moments in times and in all dimensions in those times to really make it work or exist and not exist.  Time is relative in a given dimension.  Time must be relative in each times in the &quot;moments in times&quot; because you would have to be dealing with relative times in dimensions.<br><br>This things (times crystals) you are trying to measure or see cannot and can exist all at the same &quot;time&quot; = &quot;moment&quot; of moments in all dimensions at the given &quot;moment&quot; within the dimension you are in to actually record or measure or prove those times crystals really do exist and not exist.<br><br>Can multi-dimensions exist in a single dimension in which you exist?<br><br>As far as physics goes, physics of physics is relative to its given dimension and dimensions which would be physics of physics when referring to dimensions.  Therefore although physics exists in one kind of dimension, physics of physics exists in its own way by the given dimensions or limited by those dimensions you are working with.  There is a limit to physics if you are in or stay in one dimension but no limit to physics when working with dimensions which you would have to be doing if a times crystals could be measured to prove it exists and does not exist all at the same times.  <br><br>A times crystals would have multiple physics present at the same times or moments in times.  A times crystals would have multiple dimensions and multiple physics and multiple moments and you would have to coordinate all of the infinite moments at the same moment to record it or see it or measure it.  And then it would and would not be able to be measured all at the same time or given moment of moments.<br><br>What I question is the 3 dimensions repeating in time.

I love to listen about cool things like this from time to time, or something to do with space or our world. This particular discovery seems to push the boundaries of what everyone understands to be possible, and for me, it speaks to the very heart and soul of what science is. It&#39;s not about discovering a set of perceived rules and seeing how everything adheres to them; it&#39;s about discovering what <i>doesn&#39;t</i> fit those rules, and coming to understand how and why. I&#39;ve always wondered why there are so many scientists throughout history that have discredited ideas and theories because they didn&#39;t fit with the current rules of the time, only for these ideas and theories to be proven years later. True the proving usually happens after said scientists have already passed, but still. In my opinion, approaching science as something set in stone that can&#39;t possibly ever change is so limiting. It could ALWAYS change! We are discovering newer and weirder things every single day! Time crystals are just one of those things! If we approach science with the mindset of &#39;this is how it&#39;s done, these are the rules, that&#39;s impossible because of this rule&#39; then we could miss out on huge discoveries, or be humiliated later when something previously discredited turns out to be real. <br>Basically I wish that the subject of science as approached by professionals was more open-minded and interested in pushing the limits of what we know by looking outside the box.", "comment_date": "2022-07-07T02:14:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Game City Savior", "comment_text": "I want to make out with a girl while she is talking like this.

All of us are only apart of this wavelength of energy the universe as we can call it. We are all apart of an infinite song.  Anyways. I&#39;m terribly describing what I talked about with this lady. Because it was so many years ago. But I blew her mind about what she thought and new to be true. Anyways she started doing research about what I was talking about and is finding that we are infact all apart of a time crystal.  An infinite energy that we cant fathom yet because we haven&#39;t become apart of the dimension in which we understand it yet. Our perception and thought on our universe holds us back from the un-phyisical universe.  The only reason we are physical is because of our one thought of time and physical body&#39;s. When we die we become part of or realize that we are apart of the universal sound of everything.  Our infinite energy is released into the cosmos.  We are beings of light. The frequency in which we perceive life is a physical perception. God I can never explain this correctly. Lol I was so high on acid when I talked to her about this. Lol it was just flowing through me like I was tapping in the the universal language. \ud83d\ude05  anywho I blew her mind so much with what I said that it changed her thoughts and studies about what she believed to be true.  I wish I remembered her name and what I said to her exactly. But a year later she came to me and told me she had been studying what I told her. And had wrote a thesis about what I described to her.  I wish I could find it and remember her name.  She actually came back and tried to record me and re have me tell her what I did the year befor but I just couldn&#39;t describe it the same way. I know what i said, and I know what it is that I said I just can&#39;t make the words come out to what I need it to be so anyone can properly fathom it.   Anyways everything that we believe to be true will constantly evolve and change as we come closer to the frequency of the universe.  We will someday travel the cosmos with infinite energy.

It&#39;s effect is extremely difficult to measure other than spin, which gives an atom polarity based on the placement of electrons around a nucleus at any instant.  Since the e- charges don&#39;t regularly align, the forces between the particles produce a slightly polar charge with electrons taking different paths and reaching different orbital alignments close or far apart.  The e- of a neutron produces a push, the proton overtakes this with a pull.  Since we can only measure placements of electrons by energizing them and changing that position, most of our understanding is based on observations of a secondary nature.  Most atoms have a neutral polarity in increments of 1s, but at particularly small slices of that second, the polarity changes.<br>The time crystal theory isn&#39;t just from 2012.  In fact, something similar was imagined long before, describing a material whose nature forced it to generate an almost gravitic reversion style energy by very rapidly altering state and temperature, in such a manner that an extreme temperature was sustained for such a short period that the average temperature was slightly above room temperature.  Disney put it into a movie called &quot;The Absent Minded Professor&quot;, the title character of which was keen on using a radiation burst to energize the material in such a fashion that it could make his old model T fly.  Later, Disney reitterated the film with Robbin Williams&#39; genius behind the professor and a T-bird instead of a Model T.<br>Technically, water fits this description. It&#39;s state, dependent on its temperature and the pressure of the system in which it is contained, changes back and forth through time.

I believe that perpetual motion means that a system drives itself and in the process generates energy. Also, I wonder how energy is conserved in a time Crystal when time symmetry is broken.

Thus, even time and charge symetry are broken, and the object that has a phase change behaves entirely different.

And further use those zeros and ones in specific sequences as catalogs to mark colors and numbers. 0000100011 may be the color magenta. where 010001010010010 may be the color green. The processing boards on the computer are filled with millions of nano processors that each have specifications linked to specific yes and no answers. And further your software has it&#39;s own unique address that lets other software on other computers identify it. So you connect to a piece of software on your computer to another persons computer that is acting like a server. It has to program running 24/7 like facebook. With its unique address you computer asks for. And establishes a connection. And they communicate using using the same zeros and ones in a program to understand each other. An example of this is Microsoft using ccc programming under specific principles of zeros and ones standing for specific instructions in the 0100101 sequences programmed into the software. And the software you are getting information from understands the ccc language. Thus, it knows what information you are asking for and how to give you the results.<br><br>so it isn&#39;t a problem at all for a computer to run programs in a sequence pattern.

With sometimes a few neutrons. The neutrons, protons, and electrons push and pull against each other around the &quot;sun&quot;, or center of the atom. And when people exert outer force on the atom. Like shooting light through a magnifying glass. The positively charged protons shooting through the glass make the atoms in the glass release energy. Which is how the glass maintains it&#39;s atomic structure. That glass depending on how you tilt it. Can force the release of the overflowing positively charged energy to burn things. But if the atoms in the glass can&#39;t release the energy fast enough. The atomic structure can change.

Or, an electron could be a point-particle.  We don&#39;t really know which.  But, we <i>do</i> have a measurement of how large it could be, if it&#39;s not a point.

The planet was also surprisingly an anomaly, orbiting a dull dwarf star. Inhabitants discovered the planet was constantly spiraling in a state prior to the star going through a state of eruption during supernova and the most potential energy was absorbed by the planet. It would be suggested that the planet core would eventually wither as over each thousand year triumph by the inhabitants they noticed that years were a few days shorter, and the average weight of each person was reduced by a small degree.<br><br>When harvested, the crystal could be used as stored energy with an incredible half-life, although when not part of the Mother Crystal (the core) it could become inherently unstable. Wars ensued over mining rights. The planet&#39;s inhabitants went into a technological dark age. What happened later was something considered miraculous - the mega bombs created with unstable crystalline structures did not kill everyone. The survivors had immense capabilities of shaping the earth, as if they too were now part of the crystal but able to live out mundane lives. However, conscious thought never went away, old &quot;ghosts&quot; could be visited when a person died. It was believed that the energy of consciousness was absorbed by the Mother Crystal. The story started thousands of years after this, when a struggling alien ship carrying humans crash landed onto the planet and started a technological revolution and then reverted to an equivalent to the Roman Empire, but they were astonished by the World-Movers, folks who could move mountains and shape waters. No, fire and air were not moved as in The Last Avatar, but it was highly inspiring in my story. It&#39;s since been abandoned, but the story still exists in my mind.

Look at a cubic pyrite specimen closely,  and you can see how the crystal is oriented in every feasible direction,  yet the entire crystal merges into one singular structure.

If the threshold is consistent that would also explain the &quot;memory&quot; and reactions at other alignments.   <br><br> Now since we have quantum computers and created a time crystal when can we start doing &quot;Quantum Leaps&quot;   ;)", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T13:54:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rebunked", "comment_text": "The AH-HA moment was &quot;When you push a kid...&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T13:53:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sof\u00e9 band", "comment_text": "random though : <br>if a quantom computer used a laser ta create motion, could we do that for engines ?", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T13:49:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Jacoby", "comment_text": "So we can flip a spin without putting energy into it... kinda...

We have to square the wave function \u03a8\u00b2 representing the radius being squared r\u00b2 because the process is relative to the two-dimensional spherical 4\u03c0 surface. We then see 4\u03c0 in Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle \u2206\u00d7\u2206p\u1d6a\u2265h/4\u03c0 representing our probabilistic temporal three dimensions life. The electron e\u00b2 and the speed of light c\u00b2 are both squares for the same geometrical reason. This theory explain a Mathematical explanation of creation with the mathematics representing a simple geometrical process! This theory is explained by just one equation (E=\u02e0M\u02f3C\u00b2)\u221e. With energy \u2206E equals mass \u2206M linked to the Lorentz contraction \u02e0 of space and time. The Lorentz contraction \u02e0 represents the time dilation of Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity. We have energy \u2206E slowing the rate that time \u2206t flows as a universal process of energy exchange or continuous creation. Mass will increase relative to this process with gravity being a secondary force to the electromagnetic force. The c\u00b2 represents the speed of light c radiating out in a sphere 4\u03c0 of EMR from its radius forming a square c\u00b2 of probability. We have to square the probability of the wave-function \u03a8 because the area of the sphere is equal to the square of the radius of the sphere multiplied by 4\u03c0. This simple geometrical process forms the probability and uncertainty of everyday life and at the smallest scale of the process is represented mathematically by Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle \u2206\u00d7\u2206p\u1d6a\u2265h/4\u03c0. In such a theory the future is unfolding photon by photon with the movement of charge and flow of EM fields. This gives us a geometrical reason for positive and negative charge with a concaved inner surface for negative charge and a convexed outer surface for positive charge. The brackets in the equation (E=\u02e0M\u02f3C\u00b2)\u221e represent a dynamic boundary condition of an individual reference frame with an Arrow of Time or time line for each frame of reference. The infinity \u221e symbol represents an infinite number of dynamic interactive reference frames that are continuously coming in and out of existence.

The main thing that&#39;s getting to me is that they break time-translational symmetry. We know thanks to Noether&#39;s theorem that conservation of energy isn&#39;t a fundamental law, but an emergent property of time translational symmetry. So when it&#39;s broken, energy conservation should also be broken. I have to assume this breaking of energy conservation is highly situational and minor though, like how conservation of momentum is broken within regular crystals but only in the form of phenomena like Umklapp scattering, as crystals break spatial-transitional symmetry, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can break the conservation of momentum whenever we like. But still, I am so interested to know to what extent conservation of energy can be broken in time crystals, even if it&#39;s small.", "comment_date": "2022-06-17T02:22:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doug Kutner", "comment_text": "You are So Wonderful.

Thus, if something were oscillating in TIME, it would be going back and forth THROUGH TIME, along the temporal axis, from the present to the past and the present and the past, etc.  Being as WE continue to MOVE along the time axis, we would be leaving it behind in time....  we&#39;d be moving away in time from the oscillatory event.<br><br>What appears to be getting described here is an energetic oscillation that is independent of requiring energy input.  However, think of a proton, existing for trillions of years of its own accord, requiring no further input of energy to keep doing what it does naturally.  Its spin is a form of oscillation requiring no further energy input.<br><br>And all matter is travelling along with us along the 4D axis; and we can easily perceive that none of it is &quot;backing up&quot; through time, as it would vanish from view into the past.  <br>BUT!!  Perhaps that&#39;s what particles in the quantum foam are doing...  perhaps those particles that appear to disappear and others mysteriously appear (in a quantum vacuum) are the REAL &quot;time travelling particles&quot;...  backing away from our moving perspective point in time and then rapidly sliding forward again INTO it, and perhaps even continuing a short distance into the future (where they would again appear to &quot;vanish&quot; from our temporal frame) and then come sliding back towards us.<br><br>Imagine the entire soup of the universe&#39;s quantum foam being this fuzzy temporal state of bits of matter randomly oscillating in and out of our temporal frame (along only the 4D axis), and only resolving into some sort of &quot;solidity&quot; at the larger scales we exist and perceive at.   Sort of like if you zoom in on physical matter closer and closer, you end up viewing just points of probability where electrons and particles SHOULD exist based on quantum probability, but appear quite solid....  like the floor you land on if you trip.  THAT feels quite solid, in spite of its sub-atomically fuzzy state.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m sure you get the point.  Something truly oscillating along the true 4D timeline would be sliding in and out of our temporal frame, and would appear &amp; disappear as it did so, literally becoming non-existent in the present, and then back to real as it comes INTO our sense of the present moment.  &quot;Time Crystals&quot; are not doing that.", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T16:46:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shubhankar Majumdar", "comment_text": "Can hysterisis of the material can be considered for this type of material.", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T16:45:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Cuevas", "comment_text": "I love this channel and all of the content, yet  the interview/colloquial format  feels weird to me, like the delivery of info and concepts gets limited/wrapped around \u201cartificial exchanges\u201d", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T16:40:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Absurd", "comment_text": "THIS IS SO COOL!

We then use each bit to perform calculations by connecting them up to a circuit which can perform that calculation for each bit of data individually.<br><br>By contrast, quantum computers generally use qbits which are entangled together in a special way. By entangling them, you end up multiplying the number of values you can encode in a single bit. Beyond that, you also get the ability to do calculations where you &quot;try every possible combination at the same time&quot; and whatever you get out should be something close to the right result. This lets you try to solve problems that would require a classical computer to calculate each possible solution and test them 1 at a time. Once you have too many solutions, trying each one, 1 by 1, becomes impossible, since it&#39;s possible to have many more solutions than you could possibly calculate in the lifespan of the universe.

Or what if it was some kind of chemical-based  computer (which this actually might be more applicable to just data storage then processing power but anyways) or the day that is stored similar to like DNA or perhaps the various molecules can be bound around a central molecule like the core of a Rubik&#39;s cube so that the outside arrangement of molecules could store a lot of data because it could be in many different positions. Or perhaps molecules that link in some kind of web or crystalline structure that have different centers to them so say you could have nine different molecules that all have a different central part but bond to one another with the same outside components. Like how Ruby and Sapphire are the same perhaps you could create a structure that alternates Sapphire and Ruby to encode information.

So for example, to store the number 2 you would have to have 2 bits, as 0 is 0 in binary. 1 is 1 but 2 is 1 and a 0. Essentially, how many states a normal computer can be in is 2 to the power of how many bits there are. So, 10 bits is 2^10. However, a qubit in a quantum computer, can be in 3 different positions instead of 2. To leave out spin, then let&#39;s just represent it as 1 and 0. A qubit can be 1, 0 but also 1 and 0 at the same time, which is called superposition. It would be like if you had a coin that could land on both heads and tails at the same time! This means that fewer qubits can represent more states, as it is 3 to the power of qubits. So, 10 bits could be in 2^10 = 1024 states while 10 qubits could be in 3^10 = 59049 states.

What if you had a glass with hot and cold spot compared to one with uniformed heat distribution? You can make something that seem messy and set it up in a way that it would evolve towards a less messy, uniformed state. So while the glass that is half hot and half cold may seem ordered. It no more order in that sense then one with random distribution of blobs of heat and cold.

Space being filled with thermal energy spiraling frequencies around and through space as cold fabric in all mass. Space transferring through mass as mass vibrates through occupational space. Space, repelling thermal energy. Unidirectional repulsion of thermal energy throughput space as a fabric of the quatum field. Entanglement is thermal energy unification of mass cycling in quantum gravitational fields of forced cycling patterns of mass. Like a magnetic field. The host star replenishes the thermal energy that cold resistance is stripping away. If mass cannot retain its gravitational field of forced cycling, then it decays. The greater the mass the greater the amplification of proximity space surrounding mass. Magnetic fields are force fields. Gravitational fields are force fields. Thermal energy is outward pressure of force known as weight. Occupied space is the weakest point of resistance which is mass. Mass vibrating space in and out of entanglement. Frequencies spiraling in solar systems,  galaxies, universes, toilets, tornadoes, hurricanes. Coincidence? Frequencies are spiraling around cold space in avoidance patterns throughout space. In mass they are cycling patterns in gravitational fields of forced flow. Magnetic fields are similar in cycling. The greater area of occupied areas of space with thermal energy cycling, are weaker resistance areas. Counterclockwise vs. Clockwise. Two states as one Unidirectional flow cycling through mass. Negative end stronger resistances. Unidirectional flow, positive outward force. Cycling in on itself in two states at once. Outward force cycles as inward force. One and the same. One force repeating harmonics in cycling. Perpetual motion cycling. Age determines the vibrations lessoning in strength reduction of entanglement cycling patterns. Spacemotion is space not in entanglement. Quantum thermal energy in singularity as a frequency. Frequencies spiraling in harmonics harmonization of cycles is gravitational fields of mass entanglement. Space is both thermal energy singularity and cold resistance to it. Space is the Alpha and omega. Two states as one. Dark energy is thermal energy singularity. Thermodynamics variations makes all outward forces as weight. Hydrogen absorbs thermal energy and expands into helium. Helium occupies more area than hydrogen and increases in thermal energy as outward force as weight. We vibtrate through space. Vibrations have to transfer its energy to energy to relay its force of momentum. So space is both thermal energy and cold resistance to it. Momentum is reinforcement of amplification of Unidirectional force of flow. Both cold resistance and thermal energy retain their values in and out of entanglement. Lead has more thermal energy than iron. Iron has to have more applied thermal energy to melt than lead. Periodic table of elements proves hypothesis. Outward force is thermal energy. Electricity, sound, light, weight, etc...are all degress of different frequencies states of thermal energy cycling in quantum gravitational fields of forced flow in patterns of resistance.
