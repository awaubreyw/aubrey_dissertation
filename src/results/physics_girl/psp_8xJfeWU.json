It got me thinking, how far are we away from someone that lost an eye or if we removed an eye that was damaged and replaced it with a camera lens in a fake eyeball that sees out of the eye. Do we have the technology to connect this lens to the brain so it could see images. It looks like we\u2019re headed that way. Star Trek ahead of it\u2019s time.

While human eye resolution is pretty good at the fovea, it is terrible at the peripheries, and capturing all the details of a stationary scene requires the eyes to scan the fovea over each portion of the image.<br>Second, cameras have the crucial ability to flawlessly record and retrieve images they take. With enough memory, you can even do this continuously, recording almost every instant of time clearly. Human visual memory, on the other hand, is notoriously unreliable. <br>Third, cameras can change their settings at will, and can go from capturing multi-second exposures while stargazing to thousands of fps to track fast objects. The human perception is sort of stuck in a mid-range 20-60 fps.<br>Most important, Human eyes are integrated. We can add some external attachments like eyeglasses or contact lenses to improve them, but they are intrinsically non-modular.

(Oh, and I STILL have Defining Gravity stuck in my head, thanks for that.  No really, thanks for that. It was cool.)   Regarding eyes/cameras, I think it would be cool if we could on-the-fly genetically engineer better eyes from our own DNA (more rods/cones, cat-like night vision, improved cornea) and then transplant those in so they can take advantage of the brain processing, use existing muscular physiology, and avoid all those pesky immune system issues with foreign bodies.
