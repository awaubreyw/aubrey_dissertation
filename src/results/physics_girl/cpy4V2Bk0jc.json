This is wrong, because first of all, to have a circular motion you must have a centripetal force, which means Not all forces must balance out. Second, there is always the right velocity for every angle, except of course for 90 degree angles. That means that there is NOT just one perfect angle as you are implying in this video, but there is a perfect velocity for any given angle. And Thirdly and most importantly, if there is no gravity there is no centripetal force, no matter the angle. Hence, the circular motion does not depend on the angle, but on the gravity, literally. See for yourself, if  Fc=mg x tan then if g=0 the Fc=0 no matter the angle. Angle is only important to adjust the initial velocity with which you enter the ring, that assuming there is no friction will then allow you to continue moving in circular motions. But, you need that centripetal force, nevertheless, and that is due to gravity. So, if in space you try to recreate this model, that won&#39;t work.", "comment_date": "2022-03-12T23:49:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "September Spring", "comment_text": "Dianna&#39;s way of doing it at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpy4V2Bk0jc&amp;t=16m45s\">16:45</a> of the video is TEN TIMES easier to understand than the so called &quot;traditional&quot; way.
