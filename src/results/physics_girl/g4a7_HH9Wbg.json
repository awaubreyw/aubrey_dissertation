Super fun stuff, its like binge watching a show you like. Anyway I am a software dev and the puzzle explanation makes so much sense. My favorite part about the puzzle solving with software is that a lot of the time you create puzzles(word problems basically xD) where the goal is to make this puzzle that once it is completed; it will solve other puzzles for you more efficiently. Which the greatest starting project for beginners is to make a basic calculator, you are creating a puzzle(coding calculator) where the goal is that it will solve other puzzels(the math problems).<br><br>My other favorite part is actually the math. Math has never been my strong suit until i started coding. All of a sudden math became a language to me. Instead of writing the math problem out, then solving it by hand. I could understand what equations i needed for the computer to tell me the solution, then i could enter different values through the software without having to write the problem over and over. <br><br>Not sure if any of that made sense.

One day, i have a task to make a code that would be used to correct some kind of number. I had spend a lots of time for searching the right code at google, after many days i was merely despair. At last I had an idea, tried to included simple mathematics  formula in the code, for my luck i can crack it, we can update thousand of thousand salary in less than one minute.

Another thing I&#39;ve learned, with C++ actually, is how to use functions returning functions to map an output from the main function thru a pipeline back into the main function where all the output is done, while the rest of the program is merely a set of functions that have no side effects.

And environments which do have this &#39;positive&#39; by any means outlook can become very toxic for many programmers. I&#39;m not big fan of programming being portrayed as something so casual. Sure you can do it casually. But you&#39;ll never be the best. And generally the best guys and gals come off as somewhat misanthropic, although they aren&#39;t, they are just busy doing what they are engaged in rather than paying attention to people around them.<br><br>I stand by my belief that introverts make better programmers. And very best ones are a bit less social that common person and that&#39;s not difficult to fathom. Them being less interesting in people left them with more attention and time to spare in their pursuits thus rising higher level of competence. The stereotypes are correct in many ways. :)", "comment_date": "2018-04-19T23:03:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cory Mc", "comment_text": "The earth is flat.

So far, I have not commented to any of your posts because I did not think there was some crucial remark that I wanted to share with you and the World. Thus, I felt it was redundant to write something like &quot;you go girl&quot;. But, not to sound like a hater, before I share my criticism with you, I do want to tell you that you are great and that I hope you will keep on posting videos. However, I was a bit disappointed by this video. Namely, I was hoping for a little bit more insightful analysis or a clearer explanation why you left Physics, especially when you were (are) extremely good at it. I admit, maybe I was looking partially for an answer to a personal dilemma that I am facing and maybe this raised my expectations about this video. Nevertheless, even that point taken aside, I found the video quite superficial and I did not think it really answered the question well. I think everyone who follows you has at least a small understanding of Mathematics, Physics and Programming and thus saying that there is math behind the code or that the code is solving a problem faster than a manual calculation is pretty redundant. You say you left your (Astro-)Physics job at Harvard and went into software engineering which eventually is like solving puzzles. But, if you claim to love puzzles, is really software engineering a bigger puzzle than the Universe in the first place? This all sounds a bit contradictory to me, especially because a major part of your Physics job was programming in the first place. If it was only about loving programming - you had that already before, so why leave? We know that software engineering can be very cool sometimes, but it is not like it is all great or non-repetitive always. You chose 3-4 people who do not fit into the stereotype, but is this really what ALL (or at least, the majority of the) programmers do? I agree that the jobs are more into the software engineering than the hard-core Physics direction, but then did you make this video to inform us about something or rather to somehow justify your decision? I am sorry if this last question sounded a bit personal, but I found the video somehow not honest and eventually I really did not get if it was worth leaving your Physics job and why. This being said, I hope you will understand that I am not trying to insult you or be mean, I just wanted to share my opinion about your video. I am looking forward to seeing many other videos from you and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.", "comment_date": "2018-01-24T17:12:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RotatoR Gaming", "comment_text": "and you are hot", "comment_date": "2018-01-24T10:25:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrSlowestD16", "comment_text": "I like the way the video is aimed at diversity, but diversity isn&#39;t mentioned in the title or details.

Computer science or programming all by itself is a little tastless. Like oatmeal with no cinnamon or fruit to make it interesting. I would recommend you study something  else as your major/masters/PhD, and take just enough programming to squeak by. All you need is a basic understanding of how programming languages work, once you have that you can look up the details for whatever you need to program online as you go. <br><br>The only good reason to study pure computer science is to actually write programming languages, compilers, operating systems and dig deep into the ideas that make it all work. In almost every other case, you will want to be very knowledgable in whatever field the program you are writing is going to be used in. Be it Physics, Chemistry, Healthcare, Biology, Business, Finance, Social media, Engineering, Design, Architecture, etc... you will want to understand the goal of the program more than the actual programming of it.<br><br>Also, be prepared to spend most of your time as a programmer trying to explain things to others, and trying to figure out what the heck someone else was trying to do before they rage quit and left a pile of half cooked sphagetti for someone else to unravel and finish.<br><br>With all that said, I really think basic programming skills should be taught in high school or sooner. the same way we are taught to read and write, add and subtract. As it is more and more becoming neccesary to pursue advanced studies in other fields.
