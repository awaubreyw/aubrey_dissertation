It also states that one should swipe the card SLOWLY.  Running the card through the reader as quickly as the guy at the Farmer&#39;s Market did would cause the card not to read even when in pristine condition.  When one swipes a card, it should take most, if not all, of a second to make just a single pass.  Any faster than that and the reader will report a bad read more often than not, especially when swiping back and forth five or six times in a single second as seen in this video.<br><br>Both of these issues could have affected the results of this experiment, so I would like to suggest that if Dianna et al. would like to test for more accurate results, take both of these factors into account when repeating the experiment.  If the only desire for this experiment was to test whether magnets could affect magnetic stripes on cards, then no need to re-run this experiment since it already proved that point despite the procedural errors.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T19:56:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Green Wave", "comment_text": "She said, &quot;Are you trying to erase my credit card, or is that just a large magnet in your pocket?&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T04:34:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "PEDER STEENBERG", "comment_text": "HOW ABOUT A HARD DRIVE ? <br>AM NOT SURE IF DATA IS ERASED BY MAGNET FROM HARD DRIVE .<br>THE MAGNET IN THE HARD DRIVE IS DESTROYED .<br>BUT NOT DATA OR AM I RIGHT ? <br>A PARANOID STEP IS TO MELT HARD DRIVE FOR SCRAP .", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T15:32:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Walkable Cities", "comment_text": "Soon they&#39;ll be a relic of the past in America, but already have been for years everywhere else, I literally erased the magnet on my bank card after watching this because I have no need for it and it&#39;s a security hole", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T13:38:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucian Tabria", "comment_text": "Hear this.

Some early Samsung smartwatches were equipped with Samsung pay via MST. MST is very much like the credit spoof device used here. The watch is held close to the swipe reader and blasts magnetic pulses that replicate a swipe of the card. There is some suggestion that in Korea Swipe was still King at the time. To be fair, contactless payments in credit cards/smartphones is something that the Japanese and others in the area might be wary of.
