If you study the geology of this planet and forget about the things that you were taught in school and realize that the scientists got a lot of this stuff wrong or someone covered something up for a reason. And you will discover that global warming is likely a huge hoax maybe even politically driven. that being said yes we should still be concerned about pollution on this planet but even if you stop all pollution today the cycle would continue at the same rate is now you cannot change it. If you do not believe me study the gold on this planet how did really get there and why is it where it is and why are the pieces bigger some places and smaller other places what really happened? Now for just a moment think about this what if there was no ice age and glaciers what then would have moved the material. And yes I know there were glaciers and they did move stuff but they didn&#39;t move all the stuff in the way it was a moved and neither did the water from the glaciers receding or melting. There was yet many other huge events besides glaciers some of them involved water but not frozen and it was definitely moving at a high rate of speed. Forget about the glaciers you&#39;re not going to stop them from doing their thing. Lets  figure out what what cause deep water to be traveling at a high rate of speed across the planet and when will it happen again will it possibly happen before the glaciers melt? That seems very likely if you study the geology of this planet. It seems there was a water event then a flooding event then and ice age and this cycle has happened many times more than eight times in North America. Each time it seems to change direction by a little bit.

If he had taken the miniwing in the first place he would have made in 10 or 15 minutes max. This doesn&#39;t illustrate anything, it is no useful information, it just distracts from the urgency of the situation. Now I just want to head over to Red Bull and watch more alpine action sports videos..<br><br>2. Flying a helicopter is setting a very bad example how people should act right now. Or did you compensate the carbon emissions caused by this video production? Of course not everybody watching the video will book a heli skiing trip immediately. But if we want to slow down climate change we have to minimize emissions of green house gasses, so as few flights as possible, driving cars only if there no other option, stop eating meat, etc..<br><br>3. Technically we are still in an ice age, admittedly at the very end of one, but as long as there is at least one polar ice cap is it called ice age. Therefore why not use the proper terms glacial and interglacial period? If we want to take this seriously we should at least be precise when we talk about the things we know for sure. There are still so many questions about climate change to ne answered because it is just incredibly complex, so mixing up terms just adds to the confusion what is really going on here. And as we can do something about climate change we should be aware of the fact that we are trying to preserve a 34 million year old ice age (the cenozoic ice age)!<br><br>And most importantly:<br>4. Next time you want to make us aware of rising sea levels, why not visit some places where people already have to leave their homes and actually move to a different country because of those rising sea levels?

A gold mine on indian lands contaminated the land 80 years ago and still nothing has been done!<br><br>The colorado&#39;s diversion i regard as an ecological crime against humanity devastating livelihoods in mexico. Only two swimming pools? Melt water has less to do with surface temperature (with exception of being covered in soot) more to do with its mass. And then there is an increase in evaporation rates over the past thirty years (though couldn&#39;t be confirmed in the northern hemisphere, claim due to contrails i don&#39;t believe that would be a significant factor), more forest but still a serious disruption of the water table, including european farming methods that caused the sahel. <br><br>We have little influence on the total climate exchange. The best thing we can do is just leave things alone and stop imagining we have enough information to fix what isn&#39;t broken. Our culture is no longer agricultural which is the way of all civilised empires demise! My energy consumption for as long as i can remember has been the most frugal of anyone i know because i had concerns in the eighties.

Glaciers have receded much faster in the past, e.g. look at the historical data for Glacier Bay Alaska, or Jakobshaben in Greenland, which we also have over 100 years of historical data. Likewise the European Alps.   The planet has been much warmer in the recent and distant past.  Look at the GISP and Vostok ice core data.  The period from 600AD to 1750AD  has been the longest cold period in the last 9000 years.  What we have seen in the last 300 years is just a natural recovery from this Little Ice Age, and glaciers with their enormous thermal mass take centuries to thaw out and melt. Look at the map of where the Glacier Bay glacier fronts were in the 18th Century, they recession rate was actually much higher rate in the 1800s and early 1900s, long befiore anthro CO2 emissions could have had any impact (which the IPCC admits  was not until the 1950s).   Yes, the glaciers like Helheim speeded up in the early 2000s, but they have slowed down again since, (but you never hear this).  There are multiple factors for variable glacier speeds and recession rates (cloud cover, precipitation, sublimation etc), but natural cycles like the AMO and PDO are key on the global scale, not surfaces temperatures which are way below zero for most of the year at most glacier termina.    Very dissapointed to see you falling for and pushing this nonsense climate alarmism agenda.

It was too emotionally scattered. Was I supposed to be watching a warning or some sort of action flick? Did the ski accident have anything to do with the glacier melting? I don\u2019t know. If not, why was the accident included? <br><br>Honestly, I\u2019m not sure what glacier skiing is supposed to teach me about climate change. And come to think of it, I don\u2019t think helicopters are \u201ceco friendly\u201d vehicles. So I\u2019m lost both about how I\u2019m supposed to feel after watching this and what I am supposed to do. What is the point of upsetting me without telling me what to do to change this situation? <br><br>The video would have benefited from graphics to emphasize how drastic the change in glacier melt has been. I also think bottles of water would have been better for an analogy as most humans can relate better to a bottle of water. Plenty of us have never been in a pool. Lots of us who have been in pools have no idea how much water they hold. But an enormous wall comprised of bottles of water? (Or jugs) That would drive the point home. Also all of the islands that will cease to exist if sea level rises too high should have been mentioned. A graphic that shows the islands of Hawaii shrinking based on  rise in sea levels would also be quite effective. <br><br>I\u2019m not a climate denier by any stretch, but I do feel like all of these doomsday videos are ineffective. The biggest problem is that they do not have a call to arms. There isn\u2019t any direction given to members of the audience. I have a feeling that many people are like me in that they feel like there\u2019s little they can do and the little they can do they are in fact already doing or trying at least. <br><br>We have a global systemic problem which means that the world\u2019s way of conducting everyday life has to change. Talking to individuals just  isn\u2019t enough. This business of trying to change people\u2019s habits 1 habit per person at a time isn\u2019t going to work. It\u2019s way too slow to scale fast enough to address climate change. <br><br>Essentially what has to happen is that billions of us have to become 1 issue voters (those of us who actually can vote) so that politicians get the push, courage, and political power they need to mandate change on the scale that is necessary and force industries to change. We need alternatives to fossil fuels on a global scale\u2014\u2014not there yet. We need alternatives to all of the petroleum derived plastic containers\u2014\u2014no where near this goal.

But I fear that it is already too late. Our species may have already doomed itself, <br>by setting into motion a feedback loop that will warm the planet more rapidly than predicted, hotter than predicted, and with far worse consequences than imagined. Even if we don&#39;t cut one more acre of forest, we will lose more forest every year from fire than it would take to filter out the carbon that will be released. Even if we stopped burning fossil fuels today, we very well may be looking at temperatures , and conditions, that most life on the surface of our earth are unable to survive. I&#39;m not saying that we shouldn&#39;t try. We should try. But we should also start building massive infrastructure under ground that is able to sustain the diversity of species that we can save. We will need to grow crops underground. Animals may not survive summers. Plants will burn and die from lack of water. Every thing we are used to will be destroyed. We will struggle to have enough oxygen to breathe. I wish everyone the best of luck. If we haven&#39;t run out of time yet, we will shortly. Melting glaciers and sea ice have changed the mass distribution of our planet. This is causing a rise in volcanic activity across the globe, as everything that has been balanced over many thousands of years gets redistributed. At some point in the very near future, storms, droughts, flooding, and severe temperatures will make it impossible for us to keep rebuilding. Holding back the sea would be a monumental task by itself. But rebuilding cities and communities in flood zones and in other areas that get hit by storms will be impossible. Because storms will destroy faster than we can rebuild. Fires will destroy faster than we can rebuild. We will start to lose species, and we will see a collapse of ecosystems around the globe. No economic system is prepared to handle these events. Volcanic activity may add to the rise in temperatures. All the activities that make places no longer habitable will add a whole another level of feedback loops. Species that suffer in the ocean have already started to die out. So many people will become homeless, that civilization will start to deteriorate. Farmers will find it impossible to grow crops in such hot and difficult conditions. Many forests and green areas will turn into desert. Animals will die off. Famine will become unbearable. Disease will strike the heart of every species that ecosystems rely upon to keep them stable. Hunger, Homeless, lawlessness, extinction, these are the things that we are facing. All because we think that God put us on earth to have our way with its resources. We deny the science. We are too arrogant to except and correct our own mistakes. People are too greedy to give up the things that cause this problem. Many people believe that if it is the end of life on earth, that it was God&#39;s plan all along and there is nothing we could have done to change it. People dream about living on Mars.
