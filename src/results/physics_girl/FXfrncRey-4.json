[{"comment_by": "Neil Libertine", "comment_text": "This is alternate view for electronic stability of an atom. The forces that keeps an electron in its orbit are electric and magnetic. From classical view, an electron attracted to nucleus is electrostatic or electric force. It\u2019s possible that there is only one kind of charge and its quantity in comparison defines positive and negative charge. Keeping this matter aside, so due to electric force from centre, a free moving electron tends to orbitting around the centre at a distance where electric force from centre called as centripetal force equals inertial force of an electron called as centrifugal force. <br><br>Though there is no force as an inertial force which keep redirecting it on a circular path, every motion comes to stop in absence of external force. So there is magnetic force develops at centre which also causes electron to spin so its magnetic moment account for orbitting. Due to any reason, if strength of central or electric force increases then an electron comes closer to centre. But its magnetic force also increases that encounters an electric force in opposite direction to prevent an electron to keep falling into nucleus. Speed of an electron remain same for different orbits of different radius, so cause of magnetic force only depends upon radius of orbit. <br><br>This is the mechanisms for an electron to keep orbitting and not fall into centre and also switching to different orbit and remain stable. The magnetic spin cause movement of an electron seen as inertial force and preventing an electron from collapsing into the centre. This explanation doesn\u2019t need quantum theory which only account for result and not underlying mechanism.", "comment_date": "2022-08-29T13:49:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neil Libertine", "comment_text": "When an object falls, it\u2019s subjected to a force called as gravity. For common heights, gravity remains constant, otherwise it obeys inverse square law for distances. <br><br>Initially an object subject to force gains speed or accelerate, but soon it reaches a saturation beyond which it can\u2019t gain speed for given conditions, this speed is callef terminal speed. The cause of terminal speed is entropy. <br><br>Yes, entropy inhibits further energy conversion to work done, which is gain of speed in this case. It is well known before theory of relativity that constant force can\u2019t produce constant acceleration.

This idea is based on: (E=\u02e0M\u02f3C\u00b2)\u221e with energy \u2206E equals mass \u2206M linked to the Lorentz contraction \u02e0 of space and time. The Lorentz contraction \u02e0 represents the time dilation of Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity. We have energy \u2206E slowing the rate that time \u2206t flows as a universal process of energy exchange or continuous creation. Mass will increase relative to this process with gravity being a secondary force to the electromagnetic force. The c\u00b2 represents the speed of light c radiating out in a sphere 4\u03c0 of EMR from its radius forming a square c\u00b2 of probability. We have to square the probability of the wave-function \u03a8 because the area of the sphere is equal to the square of the radius of the sphere multiplied by 4\u03c0. This simple geometrical process forms the probability and uncertainty of everyday life and at the smallest scale of the process is represented mathematically by Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle \u2206\u00d7\u2206p\u1d6a\u2265h/4\u03c0. In such a theory we have an emergent future unfolding photon by photon with the movement of charge and flow of EM fields. This gives us a geometrical reason for positive and negative charge with a concaved inner surface for negative charge and a convexed outer surface for positive charge. The brackets in the equation (E=\u02e0M\u02f3C\u00b2)\u221e represent a dynamic boundary condition of an individual reference frame with an Arrow of Time or time line for each frame of reference.

Like, in order to achieve such an escape, this &#39;person&#39; or hell at this point we might as well just say god would literally have to find a way out of the pull of gravity an space time... which considering we only just have barely proved is a thing that might exist its a pretty absurd thought but still. <br><br>Anyway, assuming that this was a thing that could happen, that person would find themselves in a new &#39;space&#39;, something beyond anything we currently can even predict to exist.. which sounds alot like the opposite side of quantum theory.

The mistake Rayleigh and Jeans made was to assume a blackbody exists in classical physics.

But we do see things in reality that look a lot like blackbodies. The conclusion is that the world is not classic. But the mathematical theory is still perfectly consistent. There is no &quot;ultraviolet catastrophe&quot; because in classical physics blackbodies don&#39;t exist.<br><br>This is crucial, because Planck seems to have been the only one that started with a finite amount of energy and then thought of how to distribute it through different vibrational modes to get the observed spectrum. Everyone else was starting with the wrong assumption that a blackbody had infinite energy.
