The time dilation does not happen during acceleration, it is happening for the whole trip. For example, the atomic clocks on GPS satellites are constantly running slower than the ground based clocks (due to relativity) and adjustments must be made to get accurate fixes. The reason that the traveling twin&#39;s clock is the slow clock is because it was the traveling twin who changed inertial reference frames. The twin on earth stayed in their inertial reference frame for the whole time. People tend to associate reference frames with objects, such as the reference frame of the ship, but reference frames are independent of the objects. Earth&#39;s reference frame is a frame in which earth and the two twins are at rest in the beginning. When the ship accelerates, it leaves that frame, crossing many frames until it coasts in another reference frame that is moving with respect to the original frame that the earth based twin is still in. On the return trip, the same thing occurs in reverse. So, there is no &quot;ship reference frame&quot;, there is a ship traveling between reference frames. You cannot say that about the twin on earth. They remain in their frame the whole time. But the real reason that this paradox exists and evolves to a dozen different distortions is that people generally do not understand the math of relativity. They go into it talking about time and time dilation, but the Lorentz transformations deal with space and time, not just time. Thus, while there is no paradox when you actually do the math, there almost always seems to be a paradox when you try to provide a simple explanation. Without the actual math, this paradox (or why it isn&#39;t one) is virtually unexplainable.<br><br>Points for stating the paradox correctly (why Alice and not Bob?) and for differentiating the two based on the fact that one accelerated and the other did not. But the role of acceleration was only to switch inertial reference frames and then switch back.

According to SR clocks further away will also run faster in the other frame if you accelerate, because simultaneity (term vx/c^2) changes during acceleration causing clocks running faster further away (bigger x, bigger change in vx/c^2, bigger timeshift).

Because if the light has to travel longer distance in one clock then the other it&#39;s not exactly that &quot;Real Time&quot; is running slower, it&#39;s just the system that is measuring it (the clock with the tiny light inside it) that is running slower! So there is no actual real time dillation, there is a system who is counting the time differently then other and because of that you see different times in both clocks. Just because I enter a space ship and travel at speed of light and because of that the clock starts to count the time slower because the light has a longer distance to travel from the &quot;top&quot; of the clock to the &quot;bottom&quot; of the clock doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll age slower too, that is ridiculous to me and I don&#39;t understand why everyone keeps saying that. The way we count time is one thing, the time itself is another. <br><br>It&#39;s like saying that if we craft a clock that will count time back when we are travelling at speed of light we will get younger if we travel with it in a spaceship at speed of light. Nah... it&#39;s just physics, the clock is not prepared to deal with the distance of the light inside it if we are travelling at speed of light, the same way it is if we are &quot;stationary&quot;, that doesn&#39;t mean the actual &quot;TIME&quot; changes. <br>If you say, that we don&#39;t get older as fast as someone stationary, because travelling in space at speed of light will affect your body, and molecules or wtv will spend less energy, and because of that you will age slower... OK! That I can buy! Now telling me that because one clock is faulty at counting the time when we are travelling fast (at speed of light) your body will be affected by that, it just sounds absurd to me.", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T17:58:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "torrotorro7", "comment_text": "I still don&#39;t get it", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T11:09:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guarrdian1984", "comment_text": "This is wrong!!!

The light doesn&#39;t have to travel threw the medium of space since the environment on the inside is displaced from the environment on the outside. Like a cup of water on a fast moving object wouldn&#39;t be pushed back (except for that initial burn but would settle as a constant is reached) as the water itself isn&#39;t hurtling threw space by itself.

The planet is allegedly hurtling at x speed constantly threw out the universe, and it&#39;s traveling at y speed in orbit. Which means that any speed your getting up to, is factored into the base speed your already at, right? I guess that sorta applies with sound waves, and a car passing you by. But if the universe is expanding at the speed of light, and light isn&#39;t a measurable constant, it&#39;s always travelling at a constant/variable speed (ie the light generated by your flashlight isn&#39;t the same light that the universe is expanding by) otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be able to see anything, if you went faster then the speed of light?

During this time we see minima happening regularly at their 2.867321 day intervals. However, during August, the Earth is rapidly moving towards Algol at about 107,229 km/hr as explained on my How Fast Are We Moving? page. (The Earth moves approximately 202 times its own size in one day.) So in 2.867321 days the Earth moves about 7,379,039 km closer to Algol. But the varying light from Algol doesn&#39;t know this - its light waves left Algol 93 years ago and are travelling at a constant speed. The result - we &quot;catch a bunch of minima early&quot; during August as shown on Chart 2. Exactly the opposite happens during February - the Earth is moving away from Algol that fast and it takes longer for the group of minima to reach us so we see them taking longer between events. How long? 7,379,039 km divided by the speed of light 299,792.458 km/sec is 24.61382 seconds - this rough calculation explains the deviations we see in Graph 2. So in May and November when we are not moving towards or away from Algol - the period seems constant. It is our rapid movement towards or away from the events in August and February that causes the timing differences.&quot;<br><br>In February, when the earth is moving away from Algol there is an increase in time between eclipses and the light is passing the earth at a slower speed.

The clue is that STR doesn&#39;t consider real objects in its formulation, Einstein just did a space-time relation forgetting their mass. GTR fixed it taking spacetime as a local parameter depending on its energy plus the surrounding influence of outside energy. If you consider this equation E\u00b2 = p\u00b2C\u00b2 + mo\u00b2C^4 = mr\u00b2C^4 (mo = mass at rest, Mr = relativistic mass) and draw a triangle with E\u00b2 at the hypotenuse, kinetic energy at one side, and mass at rest energy at the other side. You can visualize that moving just reference frames will add kinetic energy but it will be at expense of its mass at rest so the total energy won&#39;t change (conservation of energy). In the case of the twins, it is really an energetic increment on the traveler twin so in this case, the youngest twin will be the one that contains more energy.

Time dilation.<br><br>The significant issue to know is this property of waves. The speed of waves, propagating from one point to the other is the same, when over the same media of delivery, regardless the intensity that causes the impulse.  The speed varies only when the media is different . What changes, is the frequency, resulting from changes in wave length and amplitude.<br><br>Then we need to review the doppler effect of sound to be synonymous with light too.<br><br>A moving train bypassing us, will generate sound which varies in pitch or frequency from coming towards, n going away. The frequency getting compressed when coming forward, until at point of intersection, and then expand, when moving outwards.<br><br>Light is moving at a constant speed in space.<br>Adhering to classical physics, we take the presence of aether into account. Hence, its about waves, not photons. <br><br>At stationery position, we are moving thru time at light speed.<br><br>As A takes up speed towards light speed, assuming half of light speed, the distance covered by A, at the moment of a second for the light pulse to catching up will be 300k km plus150k km from that instant. Which is, 450k km of space. <br>And, B, who remained stationery, had covered 300k km of space. <br><br>As speed of light is unchanged. Such that,  A and  B are captured by that instant pulse of light at the same time. How can this be? <br><br>This is so, because, time has dilated within the reference speed frame of A. <br>As distance covered by A is more, while speed of light is unchanged, then, the only function that gave way is Time. <br><br>How and why did time dilate? <br><br>Lets refer to the doppler effect of sound again. Here, the speed of sound remains unchanged, but it&#39;s pitch changes as it passes from the time frame of the moving train to the stationery observer. <br><br>A similar occurrence happened. As A sped away from B, it stretched the wave path of the light impulse of that instance. The length of the wave path of the lights impulse towards A and B are unchanged. But, the wave path&#39;s amplitude reduced and wave length increased creating a changed frequency. The attended observation to be : The widths of the reference frame over the wave paths differ, but not their lengths. <br><br>The width of the wave path represents the moments of time. So, the wave path of A is wider than B.

It was his foremost curiosity. He couldn&#39;t detect it, even to the extent of extreme vacuuming of a vessel. Then, the failed M and M experiment which concluded there&#39;s no aether. Why must it not be assumed, thst aether could not be detected because its elasticity is so finite that it can only be picked up by electro magnetic waves? <br><br>There are many manifestations in quantum physics which can be explained by factoring in aether. Much spookiness will be scoffed off. <br>The photoelectric effect or the duality of light, the erasure phenomenon of the double slit experiment, quantum entanglement, etc. <br><br>The best candidate for aether now, is perhaps the quantum field force. <br><br>If my insight into dilation of time is correct, the best vindication of all, is, it brings back aether into the fold and that the UNIVERSE is not NOTHING.", "comment_date": "2021-02-03T07:53:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Herere", "comment_text": "Don Lincoln of the Fermilab says you are wrong.

They&#39;re still a little confusing but they&#39;re correct and have checked out as such with everything else I can verify is right. He insists it is not acceleration, I did not think it was acceleration. I believe that is right and this is wrong. I do not even think the change of direction of velocity (an accleration) matters either at all, which I&#39;m seeing in the comments. The moving twin would be younger than the older twin if she didn&#39;t even turn around just stayed on some other planet after her journey. There is acceleration involved in taking off and landing, but all that does is separate or realign the inertial frames from/with one another. This is actually completely incorrect and the more I think about it the more I&#39;m quite confident in that. Sorry physics girl, I think you tried to remedy your issues with the paradox incorrectly.<br><br>I believe the solution to the paradox is that what is observed is not the same as what is really occurring, which can be understood pretty well by remembering concepts like &quot;true length&quot;. Consider stationary time &quot;true time&quot;. Gamma accounts for the phenomena of slower aging/slower time passage. So there is true time, and then there is a moving object that only experiences 5 sec worth of time while the stationary object&#39;s (true) time was 8 seconds. (I&#39;m completely making up these numbers.) The paradox insists that the moving object will see the stationary object and believe it is moving and see it&#39;s time going slower. And it will, because you cannot see something exist for 8 seconds if you are only experiencing 5 yourself. You will think that thing/clock experienced 2 seconds, or some other proportionally smaller number accurate to whatever gamma really is. I use my notion of &quot;true time&quot; because I would like to happily remind myself that the stationary object&#39;s true time relative to the moving one&#39;s is longer, as it should be--8 seconds. The 2 seconds is a false time, I do not consider this what is really happening, but it is a very real effect experienced/observed by the moving 5 second object/observer (so good luck trying to convince them it&#39;s not real--they&#39;re seeing it that way! but that is only what they THINK, not what is really happening. There is a difference between moving 182638292 mph and 0 mph that determines gamma&#39;s real effect. But there is an observational paradox experienced by the moving object since it is so impossible to convince it it is not actually stationary. Everything that is really stationary looks like it is moving, so 8 seconds looks like 2. Can&#39;t look like 5, cause that&#39;s the time the moving object is experiencing--they&#39;d be going the same speed, which they&#39;re not. That&#39;s it.

The acceleration itself has almost no effect on the time dilation for the purposes of this experiment.  In fact, you could even make them equivalent as the twin on earth is also in a 1g acceleration field (due to gravity).  And you can also run a slightly different experiment that completely removes acceleration from the entire problem simply by having one observer get up to speed first and then pass Earth at the starting gate, passing by another observer going the opposite direction (also already up to speed) at the target star.  The clock&#39;s timestamp is passed between observers as they pass each other.<br><br>In anycase, what resolves the paradox is that (ignoring things like the Earth&#39;s rotation and the Earth going around the sun, etc, which don&#39;t really contribute anything much)... So what resolves the paradox is that reference frames for the two twins take different paths.  The reference frame for the twin on Earth effectively doesn&#39;t change, but the reference frame for the twin in the rocket ship does because the rocket has to turn around and go the other way (or the message has to be passed to another observer going the other way... who will be in a different reference frame).   And again, the acceleration involved, if any, is not a major contributor to the difference in time.   It is the fact that the reference frames for the paths are not symmetric that resolves the paradox.  The symmetry of the two twin&#39;s motion is &#39;broken&#39; at the turn-around.<br><br>And yes, this actually does mean that while the twins are separated, both can in a completely valid way say that the other is moving slower in time.  The range of the possible difference in time is not infinite... it can be calculated, and it will collapse back down as the twins coordinates merge (i.e. they meet up again), but until that happens neither twin can make make any sort of absolute exact calculation as to relative aging.<br><br>This becomes apparent if you use a space-time diagram to map both twins.  No matter what third-party reference frame you choose, one twin&#39;s space-time path will have a kink in it and the other&#39;s will not.<br><br>This is MUCH weirder than people think.

I came to this conclusion by observing that galaxies spin, planets spin, suns spin and that atoms must spin also. The universe is divided into fractal dimensions, like a series of Russian dolls. These dimensions extend to infinity both outwards and inwards directions forever. The universe is made of only one basic sub-atomic particle.This particle has 3 states - left spin (clockwise), right spin (anti-clockwise) and no spin (black-hole). The left and right spin could be interpreted as positive and negative, while the no spin particle could be interpreted as a black \u2013hole or neutron. These 3 forms make up space and matter. Space is made of alternate left and right spin aether particles which I would call \u2018ethons\u2019. The no spin ethon forms the centre of all matter and atoms (neutrons). Neutrons could be regarded as black holes which attract aether particles into rotation similar to how planets rotate around a sun. Aether particles spin at the speed of light. \r<br>\r<br>The speed of light is a dimensional signature of the sub-atomic world. In the sub-atomic world, things happen very fast and don\u2019t obey our laws of time and space. Light is a product of the sub-atomic world and travels at light speed because the ethons are naturally rotating at this speed and are thus conveyed like a conveyor belt. The ethons in space are not attached. They only engage one-another when light passes or they are united by a no spin ethon or neutron. When light passes through aether the ethons engage, as do the cogs in a clock or watch and cause the wave to move at the speed of light. Thus, light is two dimensional. It has both spin and wave energy.\r<br>\r<br>The universe is energy rich. Aether particles spin at the speed of light. When 2 aether particles approach a large body like a sun, they are pushed together and stop spinning. This releases their energy. Thus \u2013 E=MC squared.\r<br>\r<br>Using this concept the forces of the universe can be unified.

What I mean is that does the added acceleration due to the turn-around of the non-Earthly reference frame compound the additional velocity components that are connected to the new acceleration components onto the (let&#39;s just say for simplicity-sake) one dimensional velocity component which is initially equal to 0.5c?<br><br>For instance, in a car on a freeway, when you make the winding turn on the off-ramp, you experience centripetal acceleration, thus causing you to experience time in a VERY SLIGHTLY dilated manner in comparison to someone moving at a velocity which is in the neighborhood of the velocity experienced on the off-ramp (we assume here that both velocities are relative to the Earth). Say that my speed was between 35 and 40 mph on the off-ramp, and someone nearby was traveling at 37.5 mph (for a nice average). In this situation my clock is ticking EVER more slower than his due to my acceleration, and he would have to agree to this fact just as the Earthly twin had to when the other twin turned around.<br><br>So, my question summarily is: does this absolute time dilation due to acceleration become EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED when one is already traveling at a ridiculously high speed, such as 0.5c?<br><br>In addition to this question, I am lead to ask: does it matter if the centripetal acceleration can be described as a deceleration, i.e. the spaceship slowed down slightly in its turn-around, even if the moment it commits to its straight line course back to Earth it continues onwards at its original velocity of 0.5c?<br><br>If it is true that the velocity must be extraordinarily high such that the ages of the two individuals involved in the experiment would remain the same until a quick (from the frame of the ship) turn-around off-sets their ages by 4 years, does the berth of the turn affect the magnitude of the time dilation? What I mean here is that if the ship were to make the sharpest turn possible, would the time dilation remain the same as if she made a turn that spans half the circumference of Earth? If this were so, it appears obvious to me that the ONLY thing that would affect the amount of time dilation experienced in motion relative to the inertial frame is the initial speed before acceleration.<br><br>Therefore, if my suspicions are correct (and I would greatly appreciate a physicist&#39;s comment on this) then the time dilation would increase at a higher and higher rate depending on how close one comes to the speed of light. The end result of this would necessarily be that the time dilation whilst riding a light beam heading towards earth would be infinite, meaning you would remain ageless from the perspective of anybody else in the universe (including someone traveling at 0.9999999c), and that if you were riding a light beam that was bent by a black hole before reaching Earth, the result would be exactly the same as if the light had not been bent in the first place.<br><br>Really crazy stuff.

And the point is that any kind of clock or length comparison will always require some kind of interaction between the frames (otherwise the issue would be a purely academic one).<br>It is evident from this thought experiment that the Lorentz transformation can not preserve the physical intergrity of a macroscopic physical object. If one has a spaceship, or any other physical object, then the physical reality of everything that goes on within it can not possibly depend on some observer, in particular not its relative motion. The only thing that would be observer dependent is the relative velocity of the spaceship, but nothing to do with the internal physical composition. And the latter is exactly what the Lorentz tranaformation implies as it simply transforms different parts of the spaceship to different times (i.e. different instances of existence).

Let us using two atomic clocks, one is on the earth and the other one is on the spaceship traveling at half speed of light. From my perspective, the clock on the spaceship runs slowly, r = 1.15. So at the noon of the first day on spaceship, the clock on spaceship shows the time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a> and the one on the earth shows the time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=13m48s\">13:48</a>. Now from the astronauts perspective, the clock on the earth runs slowly with the same value of time dilation. So when the clock on spaceship shows the time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a>, the one on earth shows the time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=10m26s\">10:26</a>. So how can a clock show two different times at the same spaceship time?<br><br>To solve this time dilation paradox, I think we have to use Einstein&#39;s relativity of simultaneity. By using the spaceship space-time frame, the two events, the clock on the space showing12:00 and the clock on earth showing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=10m26s\">10:26</a>, happened at the same time. However, by using the earth space-time frame, these two events no long happened at the same time. Because of the spaceship is travlling away from the earth, so the clock on earth showing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=10m26s\">10:26</a> happened earlier. So when the clock on space shows <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a>, the clock on earth shows a time later than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=10m26s\">10:26</a>, that is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=13m48s\">13:48</a>. Likewise for the two events happend at the time by using the earth space-time frame, the clock on the space showing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a> and the clock on earth showing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=13m48s\">13:48</a>, also no long happened at the same time by using the spaceship space-time frame. Since the spaceship is travelling away from the earth, the clock on earth showing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=13m48s\">13:48</a> happened later. So when the clock on spaceship shows12:00, the clock on earth shows the time earlier than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=13m48s\">13:48</a>, that is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgwVm9qWKA&amp;t=10m26s\">10:26</a>.

Now, imagine the earth wasn&#39;t there as a reference point for each space ship and you woke up in one of those spaceships, peered out of the window to view the other spaceship.  Would you not calculate it&#39;s speed to be 1.5 times the speed of light, since you would have no reference point with which to know you sped away from the same point at equal speeds, in opposite directions?  So even if we maintain the fact that the speed of light is a constant from all reference frames, the actual distance between the two ships is increasing at a greater rate than the distance light covers in the same time period.

Thank you for your wonderful videos. In the present video you imply that acceleration has something to do with time dilation. Although this is true, it is only an incidental necessary condition but is nowhere near sufficient for time dilation. Originally, Einstein was trying to solve the problems of inertia due to acceleration relative to the fixed stars as first presented by Mach. To me and many others, this problem is still one of the most important problem in all of physics. Electro Gravitational forces (nothing to do with electromagnetism) have been generated when a globe revolves around an object at the center of the globe. This tends to confirm Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity. In the twin paradox, it is allowable to say that the earth accelerates away from the rocket. However, you need to include all the rest of all the galaxies and objects in the universe! Now, the rocket will still have to accelerate as it did before to remain motionless while the earth and all the galaxies of the universe will experience absolutely no acceleration whatsoever. Relativity means relative to a local inertial system (probably less than about 100 light years) where the expansion of the universe is not a major factor. In these relatively small systems, the speed of light is measured at 186,000mi/sec (300,000m/sec) as compared to the motionless stars. When you approach light speed, time slows down and finally stops altogether when you reach the speed of light. Therefore, theoretically, if you could take a ride on a photon, you could traverse the known universe without any time passing at all! However, the actual universe can never be detected or reached since the majority of it is moving away from us faster than the speed of light!

And by the same notion, the moving of light from point a to b and back to a is a physical journey f that light. It is not the passing of time. The appearance of that light moving at a slower rate also is just that, appearance. It IS moving at the same rate. Any acceleration or deceleration of that light also is, again, the acceleration or deceleration of the means of counting time. Time itself is not changing.  If were to use a device that makes a ball being thrown at me appear to be moving slower, the ball would hit me when it hits me, not when I see it reaching me.  A year is a uniform measurement of time, so if a journey appears to take 26 years or 34 years or 30 years, it takes however long it takes. In this instance, 30 years. By all means, the clock on the rocket may record only 26 years. But since when does a clock being slow mean time is moving slower?

The fact that special relativity cannot handle accelerating bodies is a common misconception and for this reason the acceleration is usually presented as the &quot;solution&quot; to the twin paradox; however, this is incorrect (please correct me if you spot the problem in my argument). The situation can be described without acceleration at all using triplets (three clocks) instead of twins and the time dilation effect is still present. Don Lincoln presents the discussion and a link to the explicit calculation here: <a href=\"http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive/archive_2014/today14-05-02_NutshellReadMore.html\">http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive/archive_2014/today14-05-02_NutshellReadMore.html</a><br><br>Additionally, the situation can also be described with two twins that experience the same acceleration (but move a different distance) and again the time dilation effect appears. What really causes the asymmetry between the two systems is that the two twins describe paths of different spacetime length. When comparing two clocks, time runs slower in the system that describes the longest path in spacetime, this is a consequence of the way Minkowski geometry works.<br>Please have a look at the Fermilab link above.

I can easily handle time dilation but I really don&#39;t care for the notion that it&#39;s undecided who is the oldest until acceleration or even return. The only way that could work would be some kind of superposition that only collapses by acceleration or proximity. It always felt like the interpretation was wrong. Still does.<br>Iirc concurrency goes out the window in that interpretation. You could be at one point in the universe and just because you rapidly increase speed the whole universe suddenly changes. Maybe I&#39;m just looking at it wrong but it seems very wrong to me. Unless the implication is that the whole universe does indeed change in a sort of multiverse type theory, which would be very ugly.<br>Btw a video about just how wrong Interstellar was would be interesting. Too many pussy foot around that abomination of a movie because Kip Thorne sold out. The planet with the gamma 61300 time dilation was particularly offensive :) A calm temperate earthlike planet with nice sunshine going something like 99.9999999% of the speed of light around a black hole and they had the audacity to claim that the movie is scientifically plausible. It would take one hell of a spaceship to get down in that gravity well let alone back up :) never mind the gravitational shear or the no doubt very funky radiation present or the ferocious accretion disc.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-03-30T15:27:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Po", "comment_text": "LOL ! great one ! there is alot of people reaching for aspirin on this one :)", "comment_date": "2015-03-30T15:26:38Z", "likes_count": 33}, {"comment_by": "illuminati", "comment_text": "what?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2015-03-30T15:22:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "extremelydangerous", "comment_text": "That brings us to ....GRAVITY... everyone talks, talks, but there is still no good explanation of what gravity is, you can explain electric field, magnetic field, but we cannot explain gravity still.\u00a0<br>May be we live in a 3 dimension world, that is MOVING (accelerating) in a 4 (or more)\u00a0 dimension space?? the acceleration is showed as... gravity..", "comment_date": "2015-03-30T15:12:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Simon Jones", "comment_text": "Best video yet!", "comment_date": "2015-03-30T15:01:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Wright", "comment_text": "Another awesome video.
