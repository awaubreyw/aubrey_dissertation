The only support required to stand on the surface is pressure and temperature - Its gravity is human friendly and we can navigate easily on the surface. The other reason might be because just like any mountain, there is technological achievements, and the goal. The MAIN reason should be to discovery evidence of our possible origin. IMHO except for mining, there is NO practical reason to establish colonies because the next leap is OUTSIDE our system. The bringing of contamination to Mars is a natural phenomenon -  everything we do here on earth and on Mars is a natural occurrence.

Perhaps I may had considered it when I was younger but now no. I enjoyed the discussion but I believe that there is a more fundamental question not discussed in your video. What if we don\u2019t go to mars? Mars is our cosmos neighbor and the simplest to visited. Regardless of the perceived difficulties in such a visit with out current technology these difficulties are nothing in the face of not conducting more robust space exploration. Much of the technology we enjoy today was either created or a result of our travel to the moon over 30 years ago. We are a unique as a species here on earth in that only when push do we excel in our problem solving abilities. History is filled with proof that shows that mankind has the ability to find solutions when the need for such is necessary with or without supporting technology. We have got lazy, scared, and unfocused even with the greatest technology advancements mankind has every had during our history. We can got to Mars but do we want to go. As your reply to the caption video question underscores, no we comfortable here. This comfort leave would most certainly change if we were to discovery all life on earth would end in ten years. Space where we all live has the ability to destroy earth as showed in our planet\u2019s history. This history shows that we the human race has came about during a stable time during earth\u2019s history. This stability could come to a end at anytime. Think what earth would be like should Yellowstone massive volcano, life on earth would have far less then ten years find a way to survive such devastating. So go to Mars it not a question but a demand made by the cosmos itself. For any species to endure it must move, as a species the human race stop moving.

It&#39;s easier to access, and could prepare ourselves for how we might deal with Mars. We could set up a lunar base within less than 10 years, but with current technology, it&#39;s not very feasible on Mars, at least with NASA&#39;s current budget. A trip back to the Moon would be far less costly, far more effective in studying the effects of low-gravity, testing out how bases on other planets and moons would work out, and eventually lunar tourism (whereas mars tourism is much more difficult). It takes only 3 days to get to the Moon, while it takes \u22487 months to get to Mars. From this perspective, supplies and people can more easily travel to the Moon and back if necessary. This means that a moon colony will develop much more quickly than a mars colony would, and citizens can evacuate to the Earth in an emergency. Not to mention its easier to land and take off from the lunar surface. Sure, Mars may have somewhat superior resources, heavier gravity, and there&#39;s that possibility of life, but in order to have humans succeed in the future in the solar system, we need to learn how to take care of our own earth life and spread it to other planets and moons. We basically need to practice on the Moon for a much more difficult Mars mission farther in the future. The rest of the globe agrees that we should go back to the Moon. Right now, the European Space Agency is planning it, China has probes on the planet, and the Google X Prize competition is encouraging companies to put rovers on the Moon! In my eyes, it would be alarming if NASA, which currently holds 60% of all space agency funding in the world, did not listen to everyone&#39;s pleas. We can do it, and we should. The capabilities of your smartphone beats the technology that NASA had when they sent the Apollo astronauts into space. And with the rise of commercial space exploration, space companies won&#39;t have their sights set on Mars, but rather the Moon, and that&#39;s mostly because of the cost! (and the time it takes to get to Mars). Some people say we shouldn&#39;t go back to the Moon &quot;...because we&#39;ve already there before&quot;, but I&#39;d say we have unfinished business on the Moon.
