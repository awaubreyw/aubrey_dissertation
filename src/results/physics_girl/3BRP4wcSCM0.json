The same question came in my mind 12 years ago, and I decided to study the topic more carefully. I even made experiments which supported my hypothesis. <br><br>First, the Plants are basically just like any factory which produces something. They use Water, CO2 and sunlight to produce sugar and O2. <br><br>So first we need to find what limits this production. In Ocean it surely isn&#39;t water, and it isn&#39;t sun light either. It&#39;s CO2<br>Notice that when a plant Takes CO2 from air and releases the O2 out, without wind, it would pretty soon be macroscopically surrounded by O2, and the average CO2 amount in air doesn&#39;t help anything. The Plant is out of supply of CO2. <br>As this Wind stuffy happen&#39;s over the time, it&#39;s obvious that The Plants should be using the light which provides just enough energy for the process AND is longest present for the process. -&gt; Blue/lila light is the first and last light of the day due to the Refraction. So basically the Plants are green because the Sky is Blue. But it&#39;s not that simple. <br>Earth saves the heat of the day and radiates it back on the night. And plants use this  &quot;red&quot; ligh too for the same reason. It&#39;s availability over time. <br><br>Now, if this hypothesis is true, then providing more CO2 to plants should change their colour. And this actually is true, just look the grass after you have cut it. The part of grass closest to the ground is more yellow, because the humus supplies CO2, this means the average refleced wavelength might have gone from 550 nm to 580 nm.<br><br>I have observations (fotos) from nature, where even trees change their colours to more yellow, if there is dying tree providing more CO2 in some windshade place in mountains. <br><br>But the most interesting thing I did was the experiment with Sphagnum; I gave them pure CO2, (In a controlled setup) and here I could see how they changed their colour to yellow, and could visually obsorve that they were growing faster.  Due to other interests, I didn&#39;t have the time to make ful scale study with accurate measurements. Bot what I found satisfied my own curiosity. The reason I chose Spaghnum is because it builds a structure, even though every single cell is fully functioning plant. This Structure gives the possibility to have a open structure and efficiently vented gas exchange; to deliver the gas and water directly where the plant can use it.  <br>The algen have the problem with difficult gas exchange, the O2 must get out of water, and CO2 must get in the water. <br><br>btw. It&#39;s commonly known in Finnland that peat moss can change it&#39;s colours during the season, from red to yellow to green  though the different coloured plants have given different names; <br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphagnum#Taxonomy_and_phylogeny\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphagnum#Taxonomy_and_phylogeny</a><br><br>I personally am convinced that this colour is caused by the local CO2 supply, which can vary ie. because of water level changes etc.", "comment_date": "2021-06-08T08:10:06Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "tom", "comment_text": "Wait I\u2019m late but does that mean that our atmosphere is yellow?

In reality the sunlight is more likely to directly burn the leaves (think sunburn) which is why tropical plants are so waxy on their leaves.  They have sunscreen on.   <br>The real answer comes in a question, &quot;Why is the sky blue&quot; and also &quot;why can&#39;t you see the stars at daytime.&quot;   The sky is blue because it is fluorescing in that color which is mostly produced by ionized Oxygen and Nitrogen in UV Light.  This obscures the view of the stars at daytime.   This is also what produces the twilight times.    The primary color here is blue or near blue green.   The sun transmissions to ground are primarily split to red due to scatter which is why the sun appears yellow.   This makes plants center on the red and blue which is what you see in greenhouse lights with their funky purple lights.   If you will notice in those conditions the leaves essentially disappear from view and they are picking up nearly all the spectra.  This atmospheric glow is very influential to all plant life.

It couldn&#39;t have just been &quot;good enough&quot; but actually better than the rest because other pigments of plants do exist as shown in the video, and they are rare, not dominant.

That&#39;s why you can grow <i>_green_</i> plants in full absence of solar light \u2014 just put it under the UV lamp. There&#39;s a theory that chloroplasts were photosynthetic bacteria before plants even existed. There were a primordial soup of unicellular organisms, and some of them \u2014 pre-eucariotic cells \u2014 started symbiotic relations with chloroplasts and became first photosynthesizing eucariotic organisms that used products of photosynthesis to gain energy (ATP molecules).<br><br>So chlorophyll defined our atmosphere to be filled with oxygen. And this is another part of the story.<br><br>When photosynthetic bacteria first appeared our atmosphere had another properties. There weren&#39;t enough oxygen to make it blue. But there were plenty of volcanic gases like SO2 or NO2. And the Earth was hot. NO2 is orangey-red, so I could speculate that it absorbed many of green part of the spectrum from the Sun. UV passed through because of high energy and red part was reflected. And that was all. Photosynthesis uses photon energy to start its reaction cycles. And in such conditions UV seems like the most effective way. And before Earth&#39;s atmosphere was cleared enough from volcanic gases, there already were a lot of photosynthetic organisms on the planet&#39;s surface.

The first problem with it: it contradicts the 2nd law of physics (entropy decreased during the alleged evolution). Second problem: 5 million years is not enough time to evolve even one stupid protein molecule (you would need something like 10^20 years for a 15-amino-acid protein and most proteins have a LOT more aminoacids in them than 15 - usually 100&#39;s). Third problem: the evolution theory was formulated before electron microscopes existed and scientist didn&#39;t really understood what made living things alive. After they got their hands on one of these electron micros and looked on the life with them, it became clear that evolution has a problem. Fourth problem: Nobody ever presented any sensible theory about how exactly evolution created life. Especially after the electron microscope thing. Fifth problem: About 100 years ago evolution was permanently debunked by a mountain of evidence against it yet it is still taught in schools as fact. One little piece from the evidence: chirality (each organic compound has a &quot;left form&quot; and a &quot;right form&quot;, one of these forms (the right form for DNA, the left form for everything else) is okay while the other one is poisonous. When you synthesize any of these compounds, you get a 50/50 mixture of both forms. Separating them without an elaborate, intelligent design driven process is something that no evolucionists could ever explain). Other examples include &quot;irreducibly complex systems&quot; (systems which have many cooperating parts that must all be present and placed correctly for the system to actually work so these cannot be built step-by-step in a competitive survival-of-the-fittest environments because that favors destruction of nonfunctional systems) and stuff like this.", "comment_date": "2018-02-01T22:18:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shirley", "comment_text": "Maybe Magnesium (which makes up the chlorophyll center) is just more abundant?", "comment_date": "2018-02-01T17:16:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shirley", "comment_text": "I like the green backgrounds", "comment_date": "2018-02-01T17:11:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CaliBudds", "comment_text": "If you ate all three to five hamburgers your family would starve.<br><br>Have you seen Matt Stoney?", "comment_date": "2018-01-31T22:50:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tara R", "comment_text": "You remind me of Bill Nye...!", "comment_date": "2018-01-31T15:00:42Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tibees", "comment_text": "Love this video, it&#39;s a question that I had been wondering although I guess the answer wasn&#39;t very conclusive.", "comment_date": "2018-01-31T04:28:51Z", "likes_count": 249}, {"comment_by": "Thijs Radijs", "comment_text": "Can I leafe now", "comment_date": "2018-01-28T20:46:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N G", "comment_text": "Cause racism", "comment_date": "2018-01-28T03:40:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Belen", "comment_text": "halobacteria when she said that i thought &quot;i aint no hallo back... teria&quot;. you know, like the Gwen Stefani song.", "comment_date": "2018-01-27T16:53:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bernhard", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BRP4wcSCM0&amp;t=2m42s\">2:42</a> ... how do you define &quot;knowing something&quot;? If you ask enough why-questions you get to a point where the most-knowing scientist in his field has to give up. :-) Therefore, I personally think that the reason to this question is actually well understood. Leaves are green mostly because of the chemical reactions within chlorophyll that need quite specific amounts of energy to function. Those are: P680 or photosystem II primary doner and works at around 680nm (red&#39;isch) another is called P700 or photosystem I and the soret-peak works at about 450nm (blue&#39;isch). It needs this specific amount of energy to split H2O and get ATP and NADPH. Therefore, the absorbed wavelengths are defined by known chemical reactions. The not usable part or least effective wavelength of the light spectrum for photosynthesis is what is not absorbed but reflected and therefore gives leaves their color.

However, regarding this one, I&#39;d like to raise the issue of the importance of having a reality-based starting point for any scientific endeavor in order to ask the right questions and to avoid prematurely dismissing relevant data. My point is that if your starting point is that there is a design agent/engineer with intelligence, then you might think that this (plants being green) would be the optimum solution to the problem of the sun&#39;s light output and the plant&#39;s energy need. (And not a mistake or sad story.) This reality-based starting point might then point you to the fact that the amount and intensity of light tends to fluctuate and, so, having more than one alternative wavelength and being able to respond to those differentially might allow plants to smooth out those fluctuations. We know that plants use red and blue light - wavelengths at opposite ends of the spectrum.  So that kind of switching from one mode to the other could be what&#39;s going on. In addition, plants do have other accessory pigments, so that seems to fit well with the notion that they are designed to regulate the amount of light they are processing.<br><br>In fact, a recently proposed engineering solution to the problems solar panels have is: to make them green. <br>Historically, science made great progress when people believed there was brilliant design, logic and order, and that these are discoverable. Time is wasted in the scientific endeavor when, out of ignorance, we decide that something is poorly suited to its function and explain it away as an &quot;oops&quot; of Evolution/Biology/Nature. This has been the case in the nonsense written and claimed about things like &quot;junk DNA&quot; and &quot;backwards wired human eye.&quot; We understand more about those and now know that, far from being poor designs, they are actually superior, masterful designs.<br>The same appears to be true for green plants - they are brilliantly designed, responsive, and finely tuned systems. Here are some scientists who are on the right track and asking the right questions:<br><a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2115224-quantum-solar-cells-could-explain-why-plants-are-green/\">https://www.newscientist.com/article/2115224-quantum-solar-cells-could-explain-why-plants-are-green/</a>", "comment_date": "2017-10-14T03:32:48Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Flint Runs Fast Boi", "comment_text": "Because they are racist", "comment_date": "2017-10-14T01:20:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hans Channel", "comment_text": "is my green is the same green as yours?", "comment_date": "2017-10-13T16:40:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "helium73", "comment_text": "OK just because it&#39;s not absorbing green does that mean it&#39;s not using the green light?

What&#39;s more I speculated that the electrons are releasing the photons at a rate of green light.  They are giving off green light because they are vibrating in unison a &quot;resonance&quot; who&#39;s frequency is the same as that of green light.   Which means they could be generating ac current at the frequency of green light.   I know they have spectral lines and that has to do with the color of the photon so maybe I&#39;m wrong but I&#39;m thinking that the green isn&#39;t a spectral line thing but more a black body radiation.

It is called &quot;wavelength&quot;. For instance, there is no such thing as &quot;purple wavelength&quot;. Color is how (human) eyes perceive combined wavelengths. So the color of the sun is, SURPRISE, yellow (yellowish white, see below).<br><br>White is not a (universal) color. Look at an electric torchlight outdoors. It&#39;s white. Now look at it in a lamp-lit room. It&#39;s probably now bluish. White is how we perceive &quot;common&quot; color. Our eyes adjust to whatever light is avaliable to call it white (to a limit).<br><br>Sun emits all kinds of light, including infrared, ultraviolet, and a lot of visible light.<br>Of those, most energetic are greenish ones. But it also emits a lot of redish and smaller amount of blueish light, so the average of those is somewhat-desaturated yellow.<br><br>Plants use red+blue because this is how evolution works.

Or our inability to see ultraviolet or to glow in the dark, like some fish can, or our tendency to get obese because in the early stone age, food was so scarce, and whenever we found something to eat, we ate all of it as fast as we could.

Evolution doesn&#39;t create the best/most efficient organic mechanisms and it also doesn&#39;t kill off the less-efficient-but-still-usable mechanisms. Evolution simply has the tendency to favor the more efficient traits within a population as those <b>generally</b> (not always) lead to fitter individuals within the species.

But then some large-scale bottleneck effect happened and dramatically reduced the number of halobacteria and similar organisms- allowing chlorophyll to overtake it.<br>Or a freak accident of a meteorite knocking up sediment/debris, causing Earth&#39;s atmosphere to change in such a way that it dramatically reduced the amount of red-green light that could reach the organisms, which would harm all photosynthetic life, but it would harm the halobacteria more, allowing chlorophyll to eventually become dominant (this is definitely one of the less likely scenarios, but it is possible).", "comment_date": "2017-06-24T22:44:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Renan", "comment_text": "that would be one cool looking planet", "comment_date": "2017-06-24T10:19:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Starry Poet", "comment_text": "At the begining I knew it was white.

Dusk light has a lot of red and down light has a lot of blue, and this used to be even more pronounced during the early days of the plant evolution, due to a slightly different composition of the atmosphere somehow.

Now, lets look about the idea of saturation. Great, so plants in the shadow should be black (red, blue) to get the dim green light. But they are not. Even black, purple, red or blue plants are just green, if growing in the shadow. So it can&#39;t be the saturation, there must be another argument for plants to be green, and for some to be not green. Heat? Green may be cooler for a plant, than black, but just the sunlit leaves are the darkest, and quite a few tropical and subtropical plants are colorful in dark... Probably, if plants can get enough water, they can stand heat. A lot of. Black may be used even to increase heat, instead of cooling. Definitely some very very dark green to almost black plants - the needle trees of all kinds - are doing that. Another function, probably to reduce too bright light (and UV light) reaching the sensible part of the cells. Temperature burns are unusual in plants, as long as they do not literally burn. But UV-sunburns are frequent, when leafs not used to sunlight are suddenly exposed. Nasty for the hobby-gardener, when the plants get out of the house back into the garden in summer.<br><br>So it helps the plant to feed and protect on sunlit leafs. But why not in the shadow? Lets have a look onto the costs. Most old bacterial colorful photosynthetic pigments have a rather small region of absorbtion. Chlorophyl is a wonder in efficiency, grabbin all from near IR to near UV but just green. One molecule, so versatile, comparably &quot;cheap&quot; to synthesize. Adding more pigments always does increase the cost. A lot. That&#39;s the reason, why green chlorophyl definitely succeeded the bacterial, less efficient pigments, but its also the reasont he plants just stay... green. another pigment? Double the costs. A third one too? triple the costs. These substances need energy to be synthesized...

I answered at least the heat/warmth of the sun, better the infrared wavelength Region (reddish orange and above) and to make this story shorter it was an 2 hour discussion about physics with him and i really enjoyed it, thats what i want to study or maybe technical physics. We finished the green plant topic with the second factor photosynthesis this aquires mostly the most energetic wavelength of light so the short wavelength according to ( E = h*f, Energy equals frequency (1/wavelength) times Planck&#39;s Constant) so it&#39;s more likely the bluish ultraviolet light that is used for photosynthesis. With this just think of the sun&#39;s light as in the video already said it contains all wavelengths all &quot;colours&quot; (white..)and take away the upper wavelength and lower visible parts away look up at the electromagnetic spectrum and here you see green is in the middle, it&#39;s just doesn&#39;t need it to survive so it can be reflected.
