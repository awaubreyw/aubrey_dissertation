I&#39;m surprised it took 99 years to solve this mystery. Just by observation of the tracks, and noticing that the rocks all seemed to move in the same direction, and by observing the shape of the track mark. I can tell the following. The rocks moved in wet conditions. The ground itself was not frozen solid, if  it was, the rocks wouldn&#39;t be able to move because they would be frozen in the ground. The rocks would need to be on top of frozen ice to be pushed, BUT if the rocks were on top of the ice they would not be making the tracks you see on the ground. I do know that wet surfaces can allow very heavy things to easily slide on a smooth polished surface. Wet muddy conditions where the ground is hard enough the rock doesn&#39;t sink into the mud, but wet enough can allow the rock to slide, and given a gentle push from the wind would allow the rocks to move. Even up hill which is stated in the video. By natural deduction one could infer that water and wind played a roll. It is interesting to see ice also played a roll in the moving rocks.", "comment_date": "2022-05-27T03:47:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wayhoo", "comment_text": "Crazy", "comment_date": "2022-05-25T07:45:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "N S", "comment_text": "Yo is this a fkn joke!?

Was the experiment design by design to simply discredit the ice shift theory; to promote their own alternate theory in a different paper? We know the integrity of PEER REVIEW has never been without fail. (Insert sarcasm). It&#39;s hard to blindly &quot;trust the science&quot; when some scientists promote data that is so: sloppy, amateurish, limited, mutilated, manipulated, and simply bad. <br>Fun example... Sailors have been giving eyewitnesses testimony to the frequency of rogue waves for thousands of years; literally thousands of sailors for thousands of years. &quot;Science&quot; dismissed every account claiming: SCIENCE IS SMART and SAILORS ARE DRUNK. These smart scientists even developed computer modeling programs that had &quot;proven&quot; rogue waves were a once in a 10,000 year event. Then something happened... 1995 happened. A rogue wave was measured using precision instruments with precise measurements that science could no longer dismiss. (...twenty seven eight by ten color glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one... (I digress. Great old song tho. I thoroughly recommend listening to the song in its entirety. It commanded an entire generation.)) Science couldn&#39;t dismiss it because they already had evidence of another rogue wave a few years earlier and another just before that. It gets worse for science. Once satellite mapping became available, folks saw something. Ut-oh. Rogue waves were certainly not a once in 10,000 year phenomenon. They can occur daily. They usually did occur daily. Sometimes more than once a day.<br>Drunk Sailors 1, Smart Science 0. <br><br>If we are to blindly &quot;trust the science,&quot; then we need a measure of science that isn&#39;t affected by scientists. Science has a bad habit of trying to prove what science already believes. This gentleman here admitting to falsely believing the previous data is another example of how damaging bad science is. Thankfully, this man continued on with his own research and the raceway mystery has finally been solved. Good science prevailed over bad! YaY! And and and, this YouTube physics-chick gave us a HUGE LEARNING MOMENT.

But a tornado could do it? yeah.. but there would evidence of a tornado and the direction of several rocks wouldn&#39;t be parallel with similar striking directional changes. So ice must be a factor? reduced friction over the surface. Yeah, rocks can be blown over ice much easier because of less friction, but then they wouldn&#39;t scar the soil.

But surely there would be a little twisting (particularly to lift the rock) that would break the ice.  Or is the key point that many of these thin sheets of ice get piled on top of one another by the wind, and perhaps stick to one another, forming a much thicker much stronger sheet of ice?

I recall sailing on keelboats and we learned pretty early on that new sailors and the untrained ones tend to wait to long to reef their sails so as to reduce the surface area because you can really overpower once you get some storm winds. The saying was &quot;When was it time to reef the sails? 20 minutes ago.&quot; <br><br>There is enough power in a 28&#39; keelboat&#39;s main sail to get the heavy thousand(s) of pounds keel up and out of the water if you don&#39;t reef, free the sail to depower, or come upwind to be directly head into the wind (and in a storm wind, you might not be able to hold that nose in position without an engine because the winds hitting your hull will probably have you going sideways momentarily if the pressure is a bit more on one side than the other side. <br><br>I&#39;ve actually been in a 24&#39; keelboat where we got the rudder out of the water (easier than the keel.... usually if you get the bottom parts of the keel showing, you&#39;re going over (capsizing)). On the non-racing sailboats, the natural behaviour is weather helm when your rudder comes up out of the water... your ship naturally turns upwind, somewhat depowers the sail or you let it go (though that isn&#39;t a great idea as it is hazardous and not good for the sail, but in emergencies, you sometimes need an effect right now, not a better one later). When power comes off the sail, the boat comes more upright and you get the rudder back in the water and you have steering once again. <br><br>In some of the racing keelboats (I don&#39;t mention catamarans because they are a bit different), the effect that will occur if you get the vessel too far over is <b>NOT</b> a turn into the wind and depowering... as it is lee helm instead of weather helm (turning away from the wind versus turning upwind). It&#39;s why some of the racing boats need to be handled with very competent sailors.<br><br><a href=\"https://sailing-blog.nauticed.org/weather-helm-vs-lee-helm-%E2%80%93-what-is-it-how-to-use-it/\">https://sailing-blog.nauticed.org/weather-helm-vs-lee-helm-%E2%80%93-what-is-it-how-to-use-it/</a><br><br>There are entire books on sail shapes and advantages and disadvantages and the most expensive racing ships have hulls designed and matched to the sail plan for the ship and a lot of math and fluid dynamics probably apply. <br><br>Anyway, a sufficiently sturdy but not too thick ice sheet could make a great sail and with a bit of water underneath, that would help too as the sail of ice would move a bit faster over ice than if it was directly scraping all the way into the bottom sand.

I wonder if this could revolutionize methods of energy or engineering via manipulating nature in such a way to &quot;capitalize&quot; on high intensity weather or natural events, almost like Natural disaster farming. Imagine huge scale shallow lakes across the north-east and west of the United States and Canada, built in positions that create extremely high wind valleys, but also can maintain quick freezes and melting, to where sheet ice can be formed, and then formulating a method, such as objects, or possibly introduction of other minerals to increase the possibility of these conditions, and adding some method of generating power from such. If you could place the top end of large water wheels where they intersect the pools without heavily interfering with the current, you could effectively run hundreds of water wheels with varying efficiency and generate power that could be significantly greater than some other methods.<br>Of course, I&#39;m not a scientist of the field, and this could all just be babbling, but such an idea is fascinating to me.", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T17:57:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "0ccultus", "comment_text": "The ol&#39; pioneers used to ride these babies for miles", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T17:56:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ruth King", "comment_text": "cool, I&#39;m glad that I came across this video on YouTube", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T17:56:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rogerwa123", "comment_text": "The seiche effect can also be seen very easily on Lake Superior.

The solution to this mystery was very simple, if you used Logic, which breaks things down to the the basic logical cause and effect consequences. 1) The trails had to be made, while the lake bed was wet, because of how they erased the cracked lake bed etc 2) The lake bed did get very wet on occasion because of the cracking effect left behind. 3) The only natural forces that can move heavy  rocks are fast moving water or ice. This is not a narrow river bed, so fast moving water is out of the question. This in not a glacier, so that is out of the question, plus a glacier would not leave behind this type of evidence. So a sheet of ice is the only option. 4) The water in this lake bed never gets deep enough to form rolling waves, so there would not be enough force to break up or to move thick ice. 5) The only option left is a thin sheet of ice, which can be moved by wind, as it partially covers the water surface. 6) As thin ice moves, it can pile up as it meets resistence such as a rock. 7) As the rock is moved in a wet, flat, silt filled lake bed, it will carve a path, especially so, if it is moved very slowly and is 50 to 200 lbs.  8) Anyone who has lived next to a lake, on the receiving side of the wind, for a long time, has seen the ice move against the shore line, pushing over anything in it&#39;s way. You see this more often in rivers. <br><br>You did a good job with this video.  90 years to solve a simple mystery just shows how so many people never really take the time to narrow down the logical possibilities to find the only logical conclusions. We do the same thing with the creation-evolution situation. Life cannot exist with out being fully programmed with all the necessary elements available. You must have blood and blood vessels at the same time, plus a thousand other interdependent functions, with a fully programmed brain instructional center all at the same time. Not one vital part can be left out. There is not room for any vital part to evolve. You must have a fully functioning reproductive system before you can even think about any element evolving ... And then there is no need for something to evolve, if it is already fully functional. Rather, if a preprogrammed life form has a built in, complex mechanism, allowing for minor adoptations, then it can slightly adopt to it&#39;s environment with very strict limitations. But the adoptations never change the programming, except in a defective manner. The programming has to be perfect from the beginning for it all to work. No programming has ever become more perfect. This conclusion is the most basic building block of understanding the logical necessities of life. All the facts support this, except for the dishonest lies and illogical assumptions. The first illogical assumption, is that their is no Creator. Only a creator with infinite power and an infinite mind and an infinite presence can create the complex fully functioning life forms we see in every form imaginable (trees, plants, animals, birds, fish, and humans ... and angels). And there is only room in the universe for one infinite God. Plus all of this is powered by this infinite God, like a super infinite digital movie, which can be edited and guided, even as God has given us a degree of self will.", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T15:02:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kalmar Emeric", "comment_text": "The Chinese, in ancient times, transported huge stone blocks weighting hundreds of tons in winter time on ice roads.

Either during the Southward march of the Ice (this seems most likely) or alternatively the Northward retraction of the glacier, had trapped huge amounts of rock material in the ice and drug the collection along with its movement gouging these enormous trenches in the earth.

We checked out a lot of them, marveling at each one. and then, without even trying, it dawned on us how the rocks moved.    <br>We visited the playa in the summer, but we brought a USGS map with us, which noted the elevation of the valley was something like 4,000 feet.  Being California natives, we knew that the snow in the mountains often reached down to less than 3,000 feet, and stayed there for weeks at a time.  So we knew about the night freezes, and the temporary lakes, and the way the wind could move so many rocks in the same patterns at the same time.  It took us less than an hour to figure out all that is presented in this video.  The only thing we didn&#39;t consider is that the wind also drove the water higher up on the shallow gradient of the dry lake bed, only to have it flow back down after the wind stopped.  That little bit of information is the nicest part of this video.  <br>We figured that many people must have figured this our before we did, and then left the answer for other people, like my brother and me, to discover for ourselves.   So, as interesting as this video has been, the discovery is only one of quite likely thousands.   Still, it&#39;s a great video, and not only checks what my brother and I figured out, but also elaborates on in a new and interesting way.

John called and asked my father if he wanted to go out to the Racetrack Playa to test a theory about the moving rocks. So, they flew out and landed on the playa while it was still wet but not under water. They taxied up to a rock with the plane facing away from it so that the backwash from the prop would push a strong wind onto the rock to see if it would move. They chocked the wheels, or tied down the plane, I don&#39;t remember the details, and revved up the engine to give a pretty strong windy push to the rock.

There are many playas and mountain ranges between it and Death Valley.

What is really weird is the thinness of that substance, which is ice. I knew it had to be ice, but not just 1/8 of an inch thick! But when I think about it now, I see that the rocks simply acted as sails that the wind acted against to move the ice sheet itself. The ice is not moving the rocks!

Story was, that she danced professionally, until her doctors recommend she move to the desert for health reasons. Her and her husband Tom purchssed the run down theater and U-shaped motel and she painted the interior so that she would have an audience, while she danced. When we saw her &quot;perform&quot;....she must have been in her 70&#39;s or more, and danced ballet...doing multiple acts and costume changes that evening. Oh...and when we pulled up to the theater in our big school vans, we were greeted by none other than her husband Tom....in a full Tuxedo...in the middle of this desert landscape....truly a bizarre sight to behold!!).", "comment_date": "2022-04-03T14:22:25Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Monkey Dog", "comment_text": "Dman nature and physics sure are weird.", "comment_date": "2022-04-03T14:22:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pjmtts", "comment_text": "You could have been standing there and never noticed it happen", "comment_date": "2022-04-03T14:21:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Solo Tango", "comment_text": "Giggity!", "comment_date": "2022-04-03T14:21:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ken Pasternack", "comment_text": "This is a mini version of glacial scouring.

Wouldn&#39;t the stakes breaking up the ice sheet have exponentially reduced the amount of force on the stone?

Would that have been enough to move that mass?<br><br>He said that the stones that move are dolomite? Dolomite is an anhydrous calcium magnesium carbonate that can become slightly electrically conductive by ion-hopping. How much of a charge is all that water picking up on its way down into that bed, I wonder? There wouldn&#39;t be much in the way of saturation, so there would be an electric double-layer between the water and the soil, which conceivably carry a very large amount of charge down from the slopes to the lake bed. <br><br>I wonder if that charge, flowing through the water and acting specifically on dolomite, or even other silicate rocks, be enough to electromagnetically drag the stones with the charge flow, at the low end/collector of the lake bed. Not all by itself, of course, but to act in concert with the flow of current-carrying molecules around it (the water and ice).<br><br>Too often we look for one &#39;magic bullet&#39; to explain observable phenomena, when it&#39;s actually many physical forces operating in conjunction.

Long day, no casualties.<br><br>As I learned later, aside from my inadequate spare-tire-&amp;-compressor prep, it&#39;s recommended to drop about 10 lbs. below &quot;street&quot; air pressure when venturing off-road, as it helps with terrain compliance, ride comfort, and puncture-resistance.

I will also say, to anyone who&#39;d like to make the trip, yes, it&#39;s long way, and lots of driving, but it&#39;s well worth the effort and somewhat life changing.  There&#39;s an energy that stays with you, when you see the rocks with their long tracks and also see the Grandstand in the distance.  One tip, which I learned to help prevent getting your tires punctured on the gravel roads in and around the area, is to take out about 15-20% of the air in your tires.  This will soften the tires, and will allow them to flex a bit more when driving over jagged rocks.  This flexing, will prevent the rock from puncturing the tire tread. And once back to Stove Pipe or Furnace Creek, you can refill the tires with air, or carry cans of air, which are easily bought at a car parts store.

John Reid, the first author of Sliding Rocks of Death Valley: What makes them move? was my advisor at the time (1995); the other authors were fellow students.  I was not part of the research team,  but as a student at a collaboratively oriented college , I did participate in discussions and making the calculations presented in the manuscript.  To my knowledge, it was the first time large scale detailed measurements were made and the required wind shear forces were calculated and resolved with the mechanism of wind shear on a large ice sheets and reduced friction of the rocks on wet mud , and the conclusions were fundamentally correct. Notable in that publication is mapping that  demonstrates that rocks moved in groups that would divide into subgroups, an observation that necessitates either ice sheets or divine intervention to accomplish! The contribution of the research by the Richard and James Norris is to irrefutably demonstrate the findings of that research with technology not readily available 25 years ago.  It is important to give all credit where credit is due.  The contribution of the Norris&#39; work is wonderful, and it satisfying to see the phenomenon that we understood 25 years ago so elegantly proven. I think it would be more accurate although perhaps less sensational to say that they provided the unequivocal proof of research that solved the mystery in 1995.

When rain falls on salty lakes, it can form a thin layer of fresh water that gets super cooled and forms ice.  I have seen this effect in a salt water basin near Sooke, BC.

Please consider that the surface of the playa is bentonite (a very active soil that expanses when wet and shrinks when dry). A Smithsonian article several years addressed this matter. I communicated with the author and shared my experience with patio slabs-on-grade moving away from houses when exposed to concentrated moisture on the house side and drying on the opposite side. The author and I agree that the rocks are being pushed along because the soil beneath the surface is wet due to periodic rain and flooding of the surface. The sun dries the surface, but the subgrade remains moist relative to the surface. The rocks protect the surface from drying and allow the drier soil beneath the rock to draw moisture from below. When the sun strikes one side of the rock, the soil on that side of the rock dries and shrinks. The soil on the shaded side of the rock remains moist and swollen. This differential in moisture and corresponding expansion of the soil beneath the rock, pushes the rock toward the dry side of the rock. Note that these soils can exert huge pressures as they expand... in the range of 20,000 pounds per square foot. To test this explanation, one could select two of the moving rocks and shade one to see if that rock remains in place while the other rock moves. I look forward to the next episode of your investigation.", "comment_date": "2022-04-01T13:24:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "forrest crabbe", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udf7b\ud83e\udd18", "comment_date": "2022-04-01T13:22:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "reoproedros", "comment_text": "its probably moisture", "comment_date": "2022-04-01T13:19:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary Morrison", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFFhD5HeByM&amp;t=8m21s\">8:21</a> \u2014 \u201cCopywright\u201d?<br><br>Never mind\u2026<br><br>Interesting video!

A friend of mine was convinced that the apartment in which he stayed at was haunted. During the summer months, soda cans would glide across the coffie table and stop at the edge. He would place the can in the center portion of the table and several minutes later it would begin to glide across the table and then stop right at the edge. He called me up and seemed very concerned about this mystery can. I arrived and as I sat down on the sofa near the table, the can began its trip to the edge. I replaced the can back in its original position and after a couple of minutes it made the trip once again. What I noticed was, the can was nearly empty, sun was shining on the table, condensation had built up on the outside of the can and left a bit of water where the can sat originally. The solution... the sun would warm up the can, the water ring created a seal between the can and table, the dome on the bottom of the can had enough volume to allow the air to expand from the heat transfered from the sun soaked can. As the air expanded it lifted the can just enough to be nearly weightless, the water ring behaved like the apron on a hoovercraft and also provided lubrication. When someone would sit on the sofa near the table it would cause the table to go out of level just enough to get the can to start moving. The surface tension of the water made it adhere to the cans surface and the table top was made of some type of &quot;Formica&quot; which gave it a hydrophobic condition. Thus the water tended to remain with the can, once it reached the edge of the table, the seal would break and the air pressure would drop to ambient thus stopping the can. Once I explained what was going on, he felt a bit of sadness now knowing the place wasnt haunted ( which confused me, for I wouldnt be happy about living in a haunted apartment). So, no ghosts, only a bit of warm air and some water on a smooth surface and a bit of tilt.......", "comment_date": "2022-04-01T05:50:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fano Boss", "comment_text": "RUDY RAY MOORE as DOLEMITE", "comment_date": "2022-04-01T05:49:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stefan Margraf", "comment_text": "If that is so difficult to solve, imagine explaining certain structures on Mars!", "comment_date": "2022-04-01T05:48:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "springflowerblosom norris", "comment_text": "Prophecies are happening the same way.<br>Our conscience is in one word and the events are happening in the other.<br><br>When your conscience returns to the first world you think is the same one.

It does not give the stone force by itself. So, the only souce of the force is the little wind there is. I have seen crawling ice in the Netherlands, meters high and it can damage buildings like lighthouses. But that is ice like 50 cm thick and a sea that is 30 km across where the wind has a lot of &quot;grip&quot; on. This little pond?
