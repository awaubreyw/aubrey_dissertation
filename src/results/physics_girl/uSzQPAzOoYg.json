Here&#39;s my understanding. Yes, the light and the tube would be stretched equally thus no way of detecting it if the tube was one directional, this is why there are two arms at 90 degrees to one another. As he said, if the gravity waves were coming from zenith, directly above or below, it would be null, meaning impossible to detect because both tubes and both sides of the lasers would be affected equally. To detect &quot;vertical&quot; gravity waves, relative to Ligo,  we would need a third arm 90 degree vertical, a Z axis. This is 2d detector only x,y axis, thus only gravity waves traveling in a 2d plane relative to the detector can be detected. <br><br>I don&#39;t know which way those arms are oriented but lets say one is North-South and the other East-West. So if a gravity wave comes from the south it would ONLY affect the N-S arm as it travels through the detector. By itself the N-S arm would never notice the stretching since both the arm and the laser are stretched, BUT...<br>...because there is also an E-W arm, and because there is only ONE laser beam, split in two at the junction, then sent in both directions at the same time and same frequency, after a N-S gravity wave the N-S arm laser would return to the detector with a slightly altered frequency(most likely due to time dilatation), while the E-W laser would have the same standard frequency it left with. Because both lasers started as one, they should always be the same frequency on return. It&#39;s the difference in frequency between the two arms, on the same split laser, that&#39;s the hint that Gravity Waves may be happening. But not absolute proof yet...<br>If it&#39;s a truck or an earth quake both would be disturbed the same, or in almost identically, only gravity waves coming from the South direction would cause the N-S half of the laser beam to alter it&#39;s frequency while not interfering with the E-W. <br> <br>Now to prove for sure it&#39;s gravity waves the source has to be identified. Telescopes are used to look directly South relative to Ligo to so see what could have caused the gravity waves. If a potential culprit is found that&#39;s confirmation that indeed a gravity wave was detected. <br><br>This is my understanding.

If time inside the black hole runs slower than outside the event horizon,  Hawking radiation would evaporate the black hole before enough time has passed inside the black hole for the evaporation to occur.

We already had the preview of Michael Landry talking of Young&#39;s modulus of space. But of course the gravitational waves don&#39;t just stretch the detector arms and thus the mirror positions and change the interference, but also the lightwaves themselves are stretched. I wonder how that exactly depends on wavelength. So you may have the two effects on mirrors and light canceling each other like noise-canceling, but not along the whole spectrum. I never thought down to that level. <br><br><br>I think I get why this canceling fortunately isn&#39;t complete. While the gravitational waves just like light travel with the same speed, the net effect on the light path stretching is at frequencies of a few Hertz only, so you still have something that compares to a high-speed camera recording of a quite normal speed &quot;vibration&quot; of space.<br>I also guess the stretching is along the direction of the astronomical event mainly, and in most of the cases, the effects on the perpendicular arms differ.
