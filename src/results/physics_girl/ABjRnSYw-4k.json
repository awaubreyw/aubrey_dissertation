But where celestial and planetary bodies exist what was a cubic meter is now a cubic centimetre, space having been deformed and compressed by the presence of a body. \r<br>    \r<br>In order to understand the concept it is easier to first visualize this idea in two dimensions. Like a straight, horizontal line on which are placed steel ball bearings. Thus, we have a horizontal line with a few circles resting on top of it. For convenience and to aid this illustration we will refer to these circles as heavy ball bearings. If the line is elastic then it will sag from the weight of the ball bearings. The nature of this elasticity is that the line only sags locally in the vicinity of each ball bearing, but remains horizontal and straight for the remainder of its length. \r<br>    \r<br>Thus, we have a horizontal line with a series of local dips.\r<br>    \r<br>Now, slide an object along the line. This object will continue on its path, moving horizontally and nothing seems to affect it until it reaches a localized dip and it moves downward to the steel ball bearing where it comes to rest. \r<br>   \r<br>Now, consider space along this horizontal line. Imagine, this line representing space comprised of metre squares abutting each other making up the entire length of this line. Visualize this as a line one metre thick. Where the ball bearing is placed it sags, meaning that the one metre squares are squeezed together and the line in this local area now consists of one centimetre squares. The one metre thick line is reduced to one centimetre.\r<br>    \r<br>An object sliding along this line will drop down into the dip and stop.\r<br>    \r<br>Gravity is a flow. That is gravity.\r<br>   \r<br>The effects of gravity are overcome in an anti-gravity device by simulating a one cubic metre volume of space where in the dip its actual size is only one cubic centimetre. If the simulation of space is larger than a cubic metre then the object will rise, seeming effortlessly. When the simulation of space is less than a cubic metre the object will drop downwards, its rate controlled by the degree of reduction of space. Application of the same principle in front or behind enables the craft to more forward and backwards, seeming effortlessly.\r<br>\r<br>This characteristic of space may be expressed mathematically, as a differential equation.\r<br>\r<br>Given that the universe is in a state of vibration, which is sound, then it is a sound wave of particular characteristic that is required to simulate space and overcome gravity. The same principle may be employed to turn heavy solids into lightweight soft material, in which the properties of rock become those of a marshmallow. Ancient drawings depict sound tones passing from base to apex in a pair of cones. \r<br>   \r<br>Two dimensions were employed to illustrate the principle of space and gravity. In reality the process is three dimensional. Objects moving in the metre cubes that make up space flow into the dips, the one-centimetre cubes of space where celestial bodies reside. And there they stop. \r<br>   \r<br>The phenomenon that enables electromagnetic waves seem to travel pervades the universe. It is already there. That is why light, an electromagnetic wave within a narrow band of frequencies, is independent of the speed of the observer. No matter how you measure its speed it will not vary. \r<br>    \r<br>That is until you consider the makeup of space. Outside of the influence of celestial bodies the one-centimetre cubes are restored to their normal one-metre size. Time, as we measure it, then, is distorted. Travel of one centimetre becomes one metre or 100 times the distance. Using the same metre to centimetre ratio bodies that appear to be 100 light years away are only a light year away. Of course, the metre to one-centimetre illustration was employed for easy visualization of the concept. In reality the ratio might be a billion to one. Thus, a celestial body a billion light years away employing conventional measurement, in reality, is only one light year distant. \r<br>   \r<br>Gravity is a flow towards a condensation of space. Outside of this influence light travels a billion times faster and objects are a billion times closer than they appear to be.", "comment_date": "2021-07-31T21:09:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mikheal Posadas", "comment_text": "Thanks!", "comment_date": "2021-07-29T11:07:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CORI", "comment_text": "ca this be at any frequency?

From my understanding, sound waves are actually longitudinal waves that travel through a medium. The description of standing waves uses transverse waves to explain it, but the idea is still the same. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong please, but the nodes in which the material sits in are considered displacement nodes, where the particles of the medium do not move. This is related to pressure, as a place with displacement equals zero is effected by a max or min amount of pressure change. At displacement nodes, it is said to also be a pressure antinode, where delta P is max or min. To explain this concept, imagine the reason why displacement at this point is zero; you either have P_max, where all the particles around it are squeezing the node at both sides; or you have P_min, where the particles around it are being drawn away. You can see this idea at work at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABjRnSYw-4k&amp;t=5m05s\">5:05</a>, where the maximum change in pressure causes the particle to be &quot;squeezed&quot; back into the displacement node.
