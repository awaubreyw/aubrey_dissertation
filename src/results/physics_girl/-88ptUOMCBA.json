Rather than thjnking &quot;move the decimal place left one place&quot; think &quot;divide by 10&quot; .  Where Z is the total.cost, a 20% tip is Z divided by 10 times 2.   [ ($170/10 = $17) X 2 ] = $34].  Moving the decimal point left 1 space is dividing by 10.  To me &quot;dividing by 10&quot; is a quicker and easier way to think of it.  But, neither is wrong.  And if you simplify the equation, a 20% tip really is just Z divided by 5, which is even easier on some totals.  A total of $55.  The 20% tip is $11.  I usually round the dollar value to the nearest number ending in 0 or 5 and divide by 5, which gives either a &gt;19%, 20%, or &lt;21% tip.  I figure close enough.  So, $173 = Roundedup$175/5 = $35 tip, a little over 20%.  $172 = roundedDown$170/5 = $34 tip.  A little lower than 20%.  How much lower?  An exact 20% tip on $173 is $173/5 = $34.60.  The rounded down tip is $34.  So the rounded down tip is 60 cents less than an exact 20% tip.  But its still more than a 19% tip.  An exact 19% tip on $173 = $32.87.  So the rounded down tip of $34 is $34 - $32.87= $1.13 greater than a 19% tip.  So the rounded down tip is $0.60 less than 20% tip and $1.13 greater than 19% tip.  I figure close enough, and also my karma probably averages out between the round-up tips and round-down tips over time.  \ud83d\ude01. Wow!

By my reasoning, base 10 is a perfectly miserable base.  Every time we look at a fraction in base ten,, we normally have to run out to 4 digits or more.  Engineers, metric or imperial, drill bit sizes on either side of the ocean,,,, I estimate that children use the first 5 years of math education digesting how to manipulate base 10,, before they begin doing any real math, geomeetry, algebra, trig, etc.      It is such a shame we do not have 6 digits on each side instead.  Base 12 in numbers is like water is in chemistry (the universal solvent)  base 12 can be used by fractions or duodecimal points with ease.   THAT is why we shall always have, 360 degrees in a circle, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes or 60 seconds, etc. These are all base 12.      Base 10 has been tried for each of these,, and it just does not work.    What is 1/4 of an hour?  1/5th of an hour?   1/6th of an hour, 1/3rd of an hour? 1/2 of an hour?

The moving the decimal place back on that problem is the equivalent of realizing how many tens there are in the number and just multiplying by the 20%.<br><br>Also, when you do 9\u00d7n, instead of using your fingers (I don&#39;t actually know if that&#39;s what you do), at least what I do is that I find what the closest multiple of 9 is for n that I remember, then I do that multiple and subtract off (or add) however many multiples was needed to get the correct answer. For example, 9\u00d713: well, 9\u00d710 is 90 and 9\u00d73 is 27, so 90+27=117. Another would be 12\u00d732: 12\u00d710=120, and there are 3 10s in 30, so 120\u00d73=360 (12\u00d73=36, so add a 0 whenever there&#39;s a 0 on one side), and then we are left with a multiple of 2 leftover from the 30 which means that 360\u00d72=720 (or 36\u00d72=(30\u00d72)+(6\u00d72)=60+12=72, then add that pesky 0).<br><br>Arithmetic is actually pretty easy to do in one&#39;s head after a while, and becomes rather quick to perform given enough practice during times when you have to invent something to do to keep from being bored.<br><br>That trick with multiples of 11 was pure genius though.

It was bothering me and I remembered a little bit of group theory and linear algebra, so I think I have a working explanation, but I don&#39;t remember many of the theorems that support it.<br><br>I started by noticing that 715 % (modulo) 7 = 1, 715 % 11 = 0, and 715 % 13 = 0 as well.  This looked interesting to me because when I originally saw the number 1001 and that its prime factorization was 7, 11, and 13, I wondered if the trick was based on a result in math that allows you to create a vector space or group/ring where each number from 1 to 1001 could be assigned a unique coordinate based on the remainder when divided by each of the prime factors.  Thus, 715 looks a bit like a &quot;basis&quot; vector for the 7 &quot;coordinate&quot;.  I then checked 364, which appeared to be a basis vector for the 11 &quot;coordinate&quot; where 364 % 7 = 0, 364 % 11 = 1, and 364 % 13 = 0.  Lastly, the same pattern held for 924 with 13.<br><br>I then realized that by multiplying each of the remainders by this basis vector we would get a number where it&#39;s remainder when divided by the other two coordinates would still be 0, but the remainder when dividing by the basis vector &quot;coordinate&quot; would match the remainder of the hidden mystery number that we&#39;re trying to figure out.  For example, 3 x 364 = 1092.  1092 % 7 = 0, 1092 % 11 = 3, 1092 % 13 = 0.<br><br>Finally, when adding two numbers we know that the sum % n will be the sum of each number we are adding % n, so adding all of the numbers up at the end gives us a number where such that it&#39;s modulo of all the prime factors we started with is equal to the mystery number, and because this pattern repeats every 1001 numbers, we can take our sum % 1001 to get the original number with the correct remainder &quot;coodinates&quot;.<br><br>If I am correct, this could be expanded at minimum to include any number who&#39;s prime factorization has no powers of primes greater than 1.  I still don&#39;t know if this would work for prime factorizations with powers of primes greater than 1, but my suspicion is that it would still work, except with the divisors being each of the primes to it&#39;s highest power.", "comment_date": "2017-04-12T21:32:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Weekend Scientist", "comment_text": "I like the pipe cleaner trick for square roots.
