It makes me wonder. Why can&#39;t we walk into a mirror, and the part of us that is in the mirror walk into the room that we were standing in, before we walked into the mirror?  Never mind. The answer just came to me. Because if we could. The mirror might only let us do this once. Then we would be trapped inside the mirror. So, the mirror would feel responsible for our stupidity of why, we would even think  that would be possible in the first place. If a mirror is smart enough to copy everything on the outside of the mirror and present it back to us from its point of view. Then there is no way it&#39;s going to take the blame for our mistakes by allowing that to happen. Or is there? I mean, now that I&#39;m thinking about it What if this already happens automatically and we don&#39;t even realize that we crossed over and now we are living in a mirror image of the same reality. Like a revolving door, to another universe every time that we look into a mirror. Oh, stop! Just stop. This is exactly why I never like to post a comment. Anyway. Seriously, my advice. If you&#39;re going to use a mirror stay on your side of it. And if you&#39;re not sure , which side that is, it&#39;s the outside. If you&#39;re still not sure. Never mind.

I can never see you the way you see you, because when you face me I see your left eye directly in front of my right eye, but to you looking in a mirror would show your left eye in front of your left eye. It&#39;s reversed in BOTH the x axis AND  the z axis, isn&#39;t it? <br><br>Okay, you&#39;re going to say that normal viewing flips how we see backwards. But then you also have to take into account how our eyes flip the light coming in vertically. Our brains re-flip what we think we see into its actual position so that we can interact with reality. So, I think our brains don&#39;t manage a &quot;consistency&quot; flip when we look in a mirror, but we have to consciously do that ourselves. <br><br>That&#39;s why dogs don&#39;t recognize themselves in a mirror. You see &quot;doof&quot; in the mirror and you think to read &quot;food.&quot; But a dog doesn&#39;t do that. What the dog with a steak sees in the mirror is another dog with another steak on the other side of the room, separated by some weird force field that neither can cross. <br><br>Mirrors don&#39;t exist in nature. Seeing yourself in a still pool is like seeing a rainbow. The colors are not in the sky, but it&#39;s the refraction of the light. And neither is the &quot;other dog&quot; on the other side of the mirror, but the dog doesn&#39;t understand &quot;reflection.&quot;<br><br>And maybe I don&#39;t either. It&#39;s some kind of weird paradox created by having to consciously flip the image, but not being able to flip how we see it. \ud83e\udd14 The primary way that I recognize that I&#39;m seeing a &quot;reflection&quot; (if I&#39;m not looking at my own familiar face) is by seeing the mimicry of the motion.

The fun is not in the images produced (not only), but to think in what we do (unconciously)  to compare spatial shapes and express the difference in the most simple/intuitive way. First, we know (intuitively) that movement in space (a combinaci\u00f3n of translations and rotations) do not alter shapes. Then our brain mentally move the shapes to be compared to make them coincide, or be as close to coincide as possible (for our intuition) ,  and then we see what other (not movement) transformations are necessary to complete the coincidente (like enlargements/shrinkings in different directions, inversiones, simmetries about a plane,  etc.).  If the objects are complex, they can be divide in parts (head, feets, etc.). In simple cases, like plane standard mirrors images, almost everybody does the same, in complex cases our &quot;autom\u00e1tic&quot; intuitive algorithm could not work or be different for different people.<br>Then we say what is the relationship among shapes according to the transformations after the movement.<br>In the simple mirror case, reflecting a person, the movement that makes the shapes (original vs imaginary reflected object) to be the closest to coincide,  make the planes of bilateral symmetry of human body to coincide, then, the remainder transformation to make the shapes to totally coincide is a symmetry invert\u00edng left and right, and that is finally what reach es our concioussness: mirrors invert left and right.<br>All this to show what incred\u00edble a Mount of calculations and algorithms our brain apply automatically and then it pases just a &quot;conclusi\u00f3n&quot; to our conciousness, that have no idea of the procesos, and that only  can grasp with difficulty a colarse idea of<br> Wich was the process.", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T22:11:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SETABUDDIN AHMAD", "comment_text": "I know you guys are here! <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23men\">#Men</a> of culture.<br>Farewell brother! we will meet again.", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T21:10:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Russel Burgess", "comment_text": "The way that I thought about that meant that I never saw the question presented like this.", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T20:17:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "m m", "comment_text": "this is all very interesting but it doesn&#39;t explain why i see a demon looking back at me when i look in the mirror. i was assuming the mirror does something with polarization or certain wavelength filtering?;-)", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T19:06:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BobTheBassman", "comment_text": "She needs to explain this again from my home I think \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T17:30:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tharosa Rajaratne", "comment_text": "This is a video i shouldn&#39;t have watched. xD", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T05:28:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Shredder", "comment_text": "The laws of attraction states that me=you should hang out sometime \ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T03:38:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "chancho00", "comment_text": "If you write in a piece of clear glass or clear plastic you&#39;ll see that the mirror don&#39;t flip nothing, go ahead grab a marker and a clear plastic bag and write something and you see that the mirror will present exactly what you show it.", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T00:34:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isaac", "comment_text": "All you had to do was watch the 1st few seconds of this video and the last few seconds of this video.

You see, in order for flipped text to appear normal there must also be a corresponding flip in perspective. So if you flip a paper with text on it to show someone, the person sees the text as normal because their perspective is also flipped in relation to your own.

Everything shown by a mirror reflects in a straight line something in front of the mirror, every point on the mirror is connected to a point in the real world by a straight. The only two lines perpendicular to the mirror are those, starting from the center of our pupils, looking at the mirror (we see it as one point between our eyes, because of our stereoscopic view), if we stand in front of the mirror and look directly into our eyes. Every straight line is converging to a vanishing point, which would be far behind the mirror, if the image would be fix like a picture. Actually those straight lines meet on the mirror, as the picture we see changes when we turn our head. So the vanishing point is right on the surface on the mirror between the the straight lines starting from our pupils. Those lines will never cross, not one single time.

Can you please do a video on a common misconception about vision. The eye is said to operate like a camera, flipping the image of the outside world upside down \ud83d\ude43 onto the back of the retina. Common folklore says that the brain &quot;somehow&quot; flips the image back over so that we can see right side up. Fact of the matter is, the brain does not have to flip anything over ; the 180 degree flip is a correct image of the outside world and the brain simply correlates its sensory inputs from touch, sound, and muscular movement, with the  images on its retinas. The brain cannot have any idea that it is seeing the world upside down. In fact no animal&#39;s brain equipped with convex lenses can know it is seeing the world upside down. As far as the brain is concerned, from the very first moment its eyes see first light from the outside world at birth, it is seeing a right side up image, and it uses its other senses in concert with sight to orient itself. You can prove this to yourself with spherical water drop (or any lens shaped piece of glass) that flips the image in front of it upside down - Your eye is like that lens, but your brain can only see what is on that lens. If you move the lens left, up, down, or right, the brain still sees exactly what is in front of its eyes; No need for the brain to reprocess the image and flip it back over. If your head turns left to look at a sound or something coming from its left, say a train with its horn blaring, the brain will observe that  the sensation of its neck muscles turning its head left and the sound from the train entering more loudly into its left ear, will be synchronized with the image of the train it is capturing through its eyes - It can never know it is seeing the world upside down. We are fortunate that the laws of physics have determined that lenses flip light rays over 180 degrees.", "comment_date": "2019-09-22T10:02:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pat B", "comment_text": "But when I look at the letters on my T shirt they look up side down, but not in the mirror they are not upside down?

Firstly, call the mirror the coronal plane. You can rotate in the transverse plane and reflect across the sagittal (the common conception - i.e. thinking of it as left-right flipped) or you can rotate in the sagittal plane and then reflect across the transverse plane (top-bottom flipped).

One can make head and toe   Put a red glove on your right hand, lie horizontally (rotate your self by 90 deg left  head goes left) before the mirror facing it, with left hand below and right hand above. Imagine, right hand is defined up and left hand down. Then your head is left and foot is right. In the mirror image your head is right and foot is left.  in conclusion, the directions defined with respect to the &#39;mirror flipping direction -z &#39;  appears to get reflected.", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T05:57:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jon LaFontaine", "comment_text": "One of the videos you shouldn&#39;t watch while high", "comment_date": "2018-06-02T21:46:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke Slywalker", "comment_text": "The simple answer is that the mirror does not flip you in any way, except off.", "comment_date": "2018-06-02T10:02:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "witwaltman", "comment_text": "Pretty good explanation.  The &quot;FOOD&quot; sign is the best demonstration.  The axis of reversal is the axis we use when we rotate the sign away from our eyes toward the mirror. She clearly shows that you CAN have vertical &quot;reversal&quot; instead of horizontal. Now the part she missed is the reason WHY we favor horizontal rotation.  That is simply a matter of physiology.  When we turn our eyes from what is before us to what is behind us, we turn side to side.  We turn on a heel, turn our waist, turn our neck.  Most of us would NOT get inverted by looking between our legs, or doing a handstand. <br><br>But it also has to do with our bilateral symmetry.  That&#39;s a very good point.

When we see our self we know how we look in the mirror but everyone else sees you the opposite way (I think) and we are all blindly use to that. So if you stand with a friend or family member and both look at the same mirror simultaneously next to each other your friend or familymember can look like different person or be a little harder to regocnize to us bc everything is turned around. When I was a child I often talked to my mother when she was in the bathroom and every time I looked at her through the mirror I spotted that her eye furthest away was unatural smaller than the other. I asked her to look at me strait and what I saw was gone. When she and looked back in the mirror it was there again and I was the only one that could see it too. I thought my visual angle was the cause of this so I tryed to debunk it but no it is still there standing next to her looking in mirror.

May be there are some cool scientific explanations to her question. But, in reality, mirrors are NOT Flipping anything. Its the way our Eyes perceive directions which is flipped. Its the way, we make sense out of left and right is being flipped. If you divide the mirror into 1 Million Horizontal sections and/or I million vertical sections. As if each section is a microscopic Pixel. Then each pixel is just reflecting its own self.\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>The terms Horizontal and Vertical are relative to the Object and the Observer. So, if we are talking about the Mirror, then if the same girl changes her posture in front of the mirror from standing to sleeping, Then Mirror will Flip her VERTICALLY, instead of HORIZONTALLY. Now this Vertical, Horizontal Plane is with respect to the Mirror.\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>But, from her individual perspective, Her body would still be flipped Horizontally Instead of vertical. This happens BECAUSE, HER EYES and OUR EYES are a Pair of Camera Lenses Attached HORIZONTALLY on Our face instead of Vertically. So, our perception while understanding Horizontal and Vertical Flip needs a bit more PRACTICE.\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>If she is lying in the sleeping posture, in front of the mirror. Her eyes are perceiving her Body to be flipped in the SAME HORIZONTAL way, in which they are perceiving it to be flipped when she is standing. But, this SLEEPING Horizontal FLIP is actually a FLIP in the direction which would be considered as the STANDING VERTICAL FLIP.\u00a0<br>And Now when we, as observers and audience are still standing and observing her sleeping posture. HER EYES are VERTICALLY ALIGNED (One on top of the other) With respect to US. So, to us Thats a Vertical Flip, with respect to us. But, to her thats a horizontal flip with respect to her own eyes.\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>Now The MIRROR is not rotating at all. So, the same MIRROR which SHOWED her LEFT Hand to become her IMAGE&#39;s RIGHT Hand. is Showing her FEET and SHOES to be HER FEET and SHOES instead of becoming her FACE in the sleeping posture.\u00a0<br>And her FACE in this posture is at the Same SPOT where her RIGHT HAND appeared to turn into her MIRROR IMage&#39;s LEFT hand while she was In her Standing Posture (Which is the posture in which WE as AUDIENCE also Are)\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>So, This does not mean that HER FEET and FACE do not switch PLACES in the sleeping posture in the same manner HER LEFT and RIGHT hand switched places when she was standing. (As if through some magic in the mirror).\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>This means that MIRROR is showing Everything to be in its OWN PLACE. PIXEL by PIXE, POINT by POINT, COORDINATE by COORDINATE.\u00a0<br>The reason we get confused with the title of the video is because OUR PERCEPTION of LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN is also governed by the ALIGNMENT of both our eyes and the bilateral symmetry of our body.\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>Bilateral Symmetry makes BOTH the LEFT and RIGHT halves look similar or almost same. So, that Similarity adds to the confusion. If she paints her body and shirt in a way that her LEFT Side is Blue and RIGHT is YELLOW.\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>Then the Mirror reflection will Show Her RIGHT side to be BLUE and LEFT Side to be YELLOW&gt;\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>In this scenario the confusion will reduce a lot, As we will wonder how COME the MIRROR is KEEPING the COLOR same (That is Not Switching the COLOR). But, switching LEFT hand to RIGHT hand.\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>This Image and its Mirror reflection will Not REGISTER in our minds with the same confusion as the confusion of our BODIES in general As We wear a T-shirt of same colour and we are 99 Percent SAME in our Left and Right halves of the body.\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>The Physics, the physics girl is talking in this video is more about the physics of Perception of our MINDS.", "comment_date": "2018-01-19T18:06:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kimo El sabban", "comment_text": "This video is just not what I expected it to be I don\u2019t like the way she explained her new theory (lol) to us.

The people who find this to be common sense, or prefer the idea that there is no question at all (&quot;it&#39;s a reflection; nothing flips&quot;) are either Feynman-level geniuses or being willfully obtuse. When you are watching TV or a movie with someone else and they complain about what a character did, do you explain to them that you are not really watching people at all, just photons emitted from the TV screen? What fun that must be. <br><br>What PG is talking about is the perception--that I would have thought almost anyone has experienced--that if someone were, like Alice through the looking-glass, to inhabit the person who appears to be them behind the surface of the mirror, their &quot;right hand&quot; would be on the left side of their body, etc., but their head would still be on top and their feet on the ground. (I am assuming a vertical mirror looked at directly, the overwhelmingly &quot;normal&quot; situation.) <br><br>So the question, which I think PG explained well, is why that fictional person in the mirror appears to be you &quot;flipped&quot; horizontally, but not vertically. One way to get at this might have been to talk about standing on mirrors, or looking at mirrors on the ceiling, as some commenters have indicated. In one way I can see how this gets more directly at the idea that the &quot;flip&quot; is not necessarily horizontal, but I would suggest without proof that if PG were to have done either of these she would have ended up with more sexist comments than she has already, and who needs that? <br><br>Including a friend with an R and L on her hands was a good technique, as was the arrow. The commenter xeno rama helped me think about this further by their suggestion that turning 90 degrees from the mirror (and, crucially, turning your left-right frame of reference at the same time, so that &quot;forward&quot; is parallel to the face of the mirror) causes the left hand (with the L) of the &quot;person in the mirror&quot; to appear on their right. In this case the image-person has truly been left-right flipped. This shows that the key is distance from the mirror. (Or position along the z-axis, as PG would probably say.) So what I would suggest that PG add would be a shot where she moves her say, right hand closer to the mirror, perhaps in front of her left hand (both straight in front of her). Then she could talk about how her real right hand is further away from her body, while her mirror-image right hand is closer to her (real) body. Maybe something like that could help illustrate that the nature of the mirror image is front-to-back, not horizontal.", "comment_date": "2017-11-12T23:57:03Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "JackstandJohnny", "comment_text": "This is what happens when smart people cant get outof their own way.", "comment_date": "2017-11-12T16:33:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jim dela Cruz Vera", "comment_text": "&quot;Reflection&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-11-12T13:27:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Delashaw", "comment_text": "It&#39;s amazing how many people need to go onto videos and say things like &quot;did this ever need explaining&quot; or &quot;how could no one understand x,&quot; to pretend to be all knowing.", "comment_date": "2017-11-12T09:16:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anau Naga", "comment_text": "Ill answer this question instantly, they don&#39;t flip at all they reflect XD.

They merely show exactly what is directly in front of them, at every given point on their surface. So as far as vertically, your head is not seen where your feet are, and visa versa, because they reflect directly in front of where their location it, in the reflective surface. Yet your right hand is on the reflection&#39;s left side, because that too is exactly where it is before the mirrors surface... there is no real vertical or horizontal in reflections.<br><br>{Over-thought explanation}Think of a mirror/reflective surface like a wall, and the light that carries your(or a) images as a series of balls.

Reflection is about light: no light = no reflection. We all know what a shade is in that a shadow is merely a darkened patch where an object is blocking its sunlight. Apart from the fact that a shade is a continuous dark tone, its properties are consistent with a mirror reflection (the left hand is raised when the sun is behind the person, but the shadow raises its right hand). A reflection in a pond is exactly the same but here there is more detail which enables you to distinguish some colour thereby seeing your teeth which the sunlight reflection prevents you from doing. Therefore, in a lit up room within a house, a clean mirror&#39;s reflection should produce identical colour and detail - but those colours are merely chunks of shade cast upon the glass.

When you look in the mirror your eyes see the rays that reflected off it, which actually came from another direction, which got reversed (probably can think of it as the z direction), but you see an image as if it were really behind the mirror, the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front. So if the mirror is at zero and the objects in front of it have positive z coordinates, then the image&#39;s objects have negative z coordinates. This is a flip and left and right are reversed.

I&#39;d like to add just one thing: Gravity. That&#39;s why we flip things &quot;horizontally&quot; (around a vertical axis). When we walk and turn we do it about a vertical axis, resulting in horizontal &quot;flipping&quot;. Turning things upside down is much less common, and so stands out more. And the <i>vertical</i> bilateral symmetry is why a vertical flip of yourself, reversing top and bottom, looks so much different than a horizontal flip, reversing left and right. Gravity also has more consequences for turning things upside down than it does for turning them horizontally (about a vertical axis), making the two seem rather different. (For example, you might get dizzy being turned upside down, but not from turning left or right.) But as for just the reversals, they are just equivalent things done in different directions.

So when we want to reverse \u201cback and forth\u201d, the dimension we turn in is always right or left. As the video mentions, we have a symmetry in this free dimension, but not in height, where our feet and legs are on the bottom to stand on, and our heads are on top. We could \u201cturn around\u201d the second way (like a half somersault), but that would mean standing on our heads (or hands).<br>Up and down are the same for everyone, where left and right are not. So we end up totally geared toward width, like in reading and writing.<br><br>With a mirror, the light from left, right up and down heads straight from you, to the mirror, and then bounces back to you, in the same position. This flips back/forth without flipping any of the other two dimensions. So we end up with a negative image, (one dimension reversed). Like multiplying positive or negative humbers, an odd number of negatives is negative, but an even number is positive.<br><br>If we lived on a vertically oriented &quot;world&quot; (like on the side of a vertical surface and gravity still pulled &quot;down&quot;, but we had a way of clinging onto this surface and moving around it, like insects), and had freedom in the vertical dimension, when &quot;turning around&quot; to see someone else, we would always see words upside down and reverse from our perspective. So looking in a mirror, we would still see the same negative image, but expecting it to be upside down and backwards, we would only see it as backwards, so that width seems normal, but height seems flipped (i.e. to what we&#39;re used to seeing).", "comment_date": "2015-10-27T13:57:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lajijiga", "comment_text": "Thanks, I have a very different explanation for this but the video showed me that there are many ways to answer a question and this one is very interesting.

Confusing if i must say.<br><br>First of all, mirrors can reflect images not just horizontally but also vertically and diagonally and even, an uneven trajectory. How? as the video fails to mention, it depends on the shape and placement of the mirror. There is no actual 3d space in the mirror as we see it, hence there is no strict horizontal and vertical values of it. it&#39;s an illusion. and the illusion is different if you place a mirror ball on the ground and looking at it with different angles. you get the idea.<br><br>To simply explain what happens; a mirror like properties redirects photons according to their trajectory, velocity and the angle that hits the surface. What you see in the mirror is a ray of redirected photons that are specifically reaching to your eyes. Hence you see the virtual visual of reflected surface which happens to be on your reflected looking angle. In this case, yourself and your surroundings.\u00a0A ray of light that hits the mirror with a 90 degree angle is redirected with a 90 degree angle. Other one that comes with a 45 degree is redirected with a 135 degree angle. and so on. When combined, the extends of a form of rays of light would seem flipped to our eyes as they cross each other when they are reflected. Basic Optics.

The angle at which the incident ray meets the mirror (angle of incidence)is equal to the angle which the reflected ray leaves (angle of reflection). &lt;---- If you don&#39;t understand what i said here, Google it.\u00a0<br><br>A ray diagram (again, Google it) shows that the rays reflected off the mirror are diverging and look like they come from &#39;behind&#39; the mirror. This is the position of the image produced by the mirror, and it is called a Virtual image (because light rays dont come from behind the mirror, they are reflected from the surface. They only look like they come from behind the mirror where the object is).<br><br>\u00a0An accurate scale drawing, diagram or even an experiment \u00a0shows that the virtual image is the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front, and a line joining the object and the image is perpendicular to the surface of the mirror (perpendicular means that the angle between the line and mirror surface is 90 degrees [right-angle]. This better explains how the arrow points backwards in the mirror.<br><br>So, as explained, the virtual image is :<br>-Upright (not vertically inverted)<br>-Points of object are as far &#39;into&#39; the mirror as it is away from it, so the virtual image is the same shape as the object.<br>-Laterally inverted (So if I raise my right leg, the virtual image looks like it raises its left leg)<br><br>TL;DR: Mirror doesn&#39;t do any flipping, it&#39;s just light rays being reflected from the surface, which produces a laterally inverted image.<br><br>I&#39;m happy to answer any questions as long as they&#39;re polite.

In the mirror, it&#39;s clearly reading backwards, but not because you flipped it.
