They even coined the word buoyant from him. He created a perpetual motion machine that was very powerful. It\u2019s turning was effected by the gravity of the sun and moon if that helps validate it\u2019s probability. It had a sealed room around it and nobody got to see how it worked. The government, I think, didn\u2019t believe him and he tore it to pieces. Fragments are all people got to see. I mean, if you cut a hole in the side of a fish tank and plug that hole with a wooden ball with an axle through it, one side is always trying to float and one side\u2019s always trying to fall. The principles are there. Water is 8.8 pounds per gallon, very heavy. As we know water only rises to it\u2019s own level, but if anything sits on top of the water it now goes higher than it\u2019s own level. So, it would all drain on top of itself and that\u2019s it. BUT, imagine you had a cylinder full of water and a straw out the bottom that goes to the top and &quot;only rises to it\u2019s own level. Then you you put this disc on top of the water so it\u2019s like a piston and it\u2019s weight pushes the water level up the small tube higher that it\u2019s own level. This disc has a cylindrical shaped piece of styrofoam glued to it\u2019s top so the disc and the cylindrical styrofoam piece look like a hat. Once the weight of the hat has pushed the water in the piston up the little tube and all of the water is now sitting mostly on the top of the hat you open a valve in the rim of the hat. The small body of water underneath the hat is &quot;now connected&quot; to the body of water above the hat and the now &quot;one&quot; body of water senses the hat is buoyant and the hat will rise through the one body of water. The valve need not be any more than a ballon thin hose that is pinched by 2 wheels. Close the valve in the rim of the hat and the small body of water on top of the hat becomes weight to push the hat down the piston once again and push the water on top of the hat as weight again. It\u2019s the valve that turns the 2 bodies of water into one. The hat completely under the water floats upwards but the weight of the hat, plus the weight of the water filling up on top of the hat makes the water go up the tube and fall on top of the hat. Now, realistically, there would be too much friction in a piston but instead of a piston you could use a collapsable spring coated in balloon rubber. Now, if you did build one, out of say, a washer/dryer hose it should go up when you open the valve, and down when you close the valve. If it does do this then you have the basic principles for gravity and buoyancy to produce energy and make them have to re-write the laws of physics. Just a logical thought experiment. Feel free to prove it out. The cool part is that once you get it producing power by gravity you put it on an arm so it travels in a circle getting faster and faster. Centrifugal force outweighs gravity and the thing gets faster and stronger until it breaks into fragments. Like seagulls fighting over a piece of bread James Buoyant saw what would happen and did not rebuild it. All he saw was greedy pigs that would kill over a nugget of gold.", "comment_date": "2021-09-06T15:38:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soufiane F", "comment_text": "But thought the world is created from nothing in nowhere?", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T15:43:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Peter Axe", "comment_text": "FIRST VIOLATION OF THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY (MECHANICAL VERSION)\u00a0\u00a0<br>---------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>ANSWER THE TWO SIMPLE QUESTIONS BELOW!<br>---------------------------------------------<br>ASKING OUR TWO SIMPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE 4TH TIME!<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>1) Consider carefully and thoroughly (and many times!) the link\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY%C2%A0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY\u00a0</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 .<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>2) Having in mind the link\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY%C2%A0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY\u00a0</a>     assume that:\u00a0\u00a0<br>a) Ma = 1 kg;\u00a0\u00a0<br>b) Mb = 4 kg; the value of Mb can be either increased or decreased as many times as you want;\u00a0\u00a0<br>c) V1 = 1m/s = const;\u00a0\u00a0<br>d) Ffr. = force of friction inside the zigzag channels = 0.0000001 N; the latter can be further decreased as many times as you want;\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>e) N = number of zigzags = 10; the value of N can be either increased or decreased as many times as you want;\u00a0\u00a0<br>f) Shapes of the zigzags = sinusoids; the latter can be replaced by any other curve patterns.\u00a0\u00a0<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>3) It is evident that if V2 = 0.6 m/s and if V3 = 0.1 m/s, then (a) the law of conservation of linear momentum is valid and (b) the law of conservation of mechanical energy is invalid.\u00a0\u00a0<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>4) It is evident that if V2 = 0.8 m/s and if V3 = 0.3 m/s, then (a) the law of conservation of linear momentum is invalid and (b) the law of conservation of mechanical energy is valid.\u00a0\u00a0<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>5) It is evident that both (a) the law of conservation of linear momentum and (b) the law of conservation of mechanical energy are invalid simultaneously in this special particular zigzag case, which is described in the link\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY%C2%A0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY\u00a0</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 .<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>SO\u00a0\u00a0ANSWER THE TWO SIMPLE QUESTIONS BELOW!<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>QUESTION 1: V2 = ?

The laws of thermodynamics allows for the conservation of energy. At the moment I am trying to recreate a design from the 1700&#39;s which shows potential.

As for the amount of energy the wheel from the 1700&#39;s would generate, 1,000 watts from a 12 ft. diameter wheel would be possible. I&#39;ve done the math. As for the design, I am increasing the disc size and if that allows it to generate much more torque then I&#39;ll be in busy.

And this design is based on Johann Bessler&#39;s work from the 1700&#39;s. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MtlhoIOkRkA\">https://youtu.be/MtlhoIOkRkA</a>", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T00:44:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XDAVEX", "comment_text": "You were right but sorry i already know on how to make a fricition less perpetual motion", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T13:12:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DEV KUMAR", "comment_text": "they are looking at the wrong definition.", "comment_date": "2021-09-02T11:32:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Axe", "comment_text": "FIRST VIOLATION OF THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY (MECHANICAL VERSION)\u00a0\u00a0<br>---------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>ANSWER THE TWO SIMPLE QUESTIONS BELOW!<br>---------------------------------------------<br>ASKING OUR TWO SIMPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE 3RD TIME!<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>1) Consider carefully and thoroughly (and many times!) the link\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY%C2%A0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY\u00a0</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 .<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>2) Having in mind the link\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY%C2%A0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY\u00a0</a>     assume that:\u00a0\u00a0<br>a) Ma = 1 kg;\u00a0\u00a0<br>b) Mb = 4 kg; the value of Mb can be either increased or decreased as many times as you want;\u00a0\u00a0<br>c) V1 = 1m/s = const;\u00a0\u00a0<br>d) Ffr. = force of friction inside the zigzag channels = 0.0000001 N; the latter can be further decreased as many times as you want;\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>e) N = number of zigzags = 10; the value of N can be either increased or decreased as many times as you want;\u00a0\u00a0<br>f) Shapes of the zigzags = sinusoids; the latter can be replaced by any other curve patterns.\u00a0\u00a0<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>3) It is evident that if V2 = 0.6 m/s and if V3 = 0.1 m/s, then (a) the law of conservation of linear momentum is valid and (b) the law of conservation of mechanical energy is invalid.\u00a0\u00a0<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>4) It is evident that if V2 = 0.8 m/s and if V3 = 0.3 m/s, then (a) the law of conservation of linear momentum is invalid and (b) the law of conservation of mechanical energy is valid.\u00a0\u00a0<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>5) It is evident that both (a) the law of conservation of linear momentum and (b) the law of conservation of mechanical energy are invalid simultaneously in this special particular zigzag case, which is described in the link\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY%C2%A0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY\u00a0</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 .<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>SO\u00a0\u00a0ANSWER THE TWO SIMPLE QUESTIONS BELOW!<br>--------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0<br>QUESTION 1: V2 = ?

The fact is that if we can figure out how to do one of 2 things a perpetual motion device is absolutely possible. Option 1 is we harness the power of gravity as a power source. Option 2 is that, since energy can not be created or destroyed, we would need to find an energy that we can use in both its natural state and its altered state so long as when the altered state is used it returns to the natural state or another state that can be used and eventually converted back to its natural state to create a closed loop of various energies.

Because it&#39;s continuous action. The difference between the temperature of the water and the temperature of the room can be utilized in this fashion. And if you had a very large amount of these very thin tubes I think it also works with Rags or something you can bring water up. The problem is upscaling these functions of continuous use of existing resources it doesn&#39;t matter if you call it Perpetual or not period is continuous based on its surroundings. If we can use pressure if we can use gravity if we can use magnetism for I can certain amount of time that&#39;s a heck of a lot better period and the supposed perpetual part of anything is that all matter will Decay regardless of what it&#39;s made out of. A lower standard for perpetual motion machines would allow science to progress instead of shunning ideas that are possibly good. If you had a bunch of those birds you could tilt and sway a bridge of a massive size that was built improperly. So what can the bird do? It could pull a very lightweight string. It could cause a certain small amounts of power generation. Also yes but there is flywheel which may not be Perpetual but they sure last a lot longer and that&#39;s the point. The hydroelectric Dam at waterfalls is using gravity and take advantage of the types of energies required to make lightning and they&#39;re not even take as much as they could be taking from that area and because the water continuously flows yes that&#39;s perpetual motion also. Your body&#39;s a constant source of neurological tiny frequencies which technically could be used to activate sings all the time and create power if you had an energy suit on. And I personally don&#39;t feel like it matters how much power you create with that suit. But you don&#39;t even need a suit you can have implants. Imagine every time you want to move your arms or your hands that energy can be used towards something period and given power upscaled is not fake science. I heard someone giving flag to somebody who was able to take radio waves and make energy out of it. Yes we put radio waves into the atmosphere to make that possible but we could utilize the energy instead of being inefficient it&#39;s the same difference and buildings could be hot-wired to be a gigantic antenna generator but we don&#39;t do that because we lack the scope of how much power we could get from that. If you think of in entire cities and the whole building then it&#39;s not a complete waste of uses. Except of course the main concern there is all wires could overheat and everything to burn.

You can easily carry out these simple experiments in your garage as many times as you want. <br>And here is the link: <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY&amp;ab_channel=PeterAxe\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY&amp;ab_channel=PeterAxe</a><br>---------------------------------------<br>IMPORTANT NOTE 1. It is highly recommendable that the above mentioned experiments  are evaluated and realized by a highly qualified expert (Ph.D.) in theoretical and applied mechanics.  Otherwise nothing will come of it (most probably). <br>----------------------------------------<br>IMPORTANT NOTE 2. The key question in the above mentioned experiments is how to reduce standard friction (where necessary) to a certain minimum limit, beyond which the experimental error (due to friction) is small enough and can be neglected. The answer is simple. You can use for example permanent magnet slides as shown in the link <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoW0A8hYs5A\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoW0A8hYs5A</a> . (Permanent magnet slides reduce friction practically to zero and the measuring devices do not register any force of friction.) Alternatively you can use hundreds of other methods for reducing of friction (as much as necessary) as modern technologies allow this feat. We live in 21st century after all.<br>----------------------------------------<br>Looking forward to your comments after repeating the above mentioned simple experiments.", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T14:43:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B-612", "comment_text": "Einstein priced it is impossible \u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T01:36:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nasse \u30ca\u30c3\u30bb Sweden", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t we just scale up the bird 1 miljon times?

A space craft can increase it&#39;s speed by a gravitational assist from the Earth.  But this doesn&#39;t violate any law of physics, because there is a difference between something that is perpetual in theory and what is perpetual in practice.  In theory, if you took enough kinetic energy from the Earth, it&#39;s orbit would deteriorate and it would fall into the sun.  But in practice it would never happen in any reasonable time scale.  So in practical terms, it&#39;s perpetual motion.  If you could figure out how to run a power plant off from it, you could supply our energy needs indefinitely.  So a real life perpetual motion machine would be something like that.  A system that has so much energy in it that it would be impossible to drain it in any reasonable time scale.

In the electrolysis of sulphuric acid solution, 100 mg of hydrogen is liberated in a period of 20 minutes. The resistance of the electrolyte is 0.5 Ohm. Calculate the power consumed. Electrochemical equivalent of hydrogen is 1.044 x 10 -8 kg/C.<br>Solution: The power consumed is equal to 31.86 W.<br>-------------------------<br>PROF. S. L. SRIVASTAVA STOPS HERE HIS CALCULATIONS.<br>(The related solution&#39;s set of equations is not given here in order to save time and space. This set of equations however can be found in the book or in the link above.)<br>--------------------------<br>The above solved problem has a potential which can be developed further. And here it is. Here are our additional calculations.<br>1) Let us calculate the inlet energy, that is, inlet energy = (31.86 W) x (1200 s) = 38232 Ws = 38232 J.<br>2) Let us calculate the current I. The current I is given by I = (m)/(Z x t) = 7.9 A,<br>where<br>m = 0.0001kg of hydrogen<br>Z = electrochemical equivalent of hydrogen<br>t = 1200 s<br>3) The Joule&#39;s heat, generated in the process of electrolysis is given by<br>Q = I x I x R x t = (7.9 A) x (7.9 A) x (0.5 Ohm) x (1200 s) = 37446 J = outlet energy 1.<br>4) HHV of hydrogen is 142 000 000 J/kg. Therefore the heat H, generated by burning/exploding of 0.0001 kg of hydrogen, is given by<br>H = (142 000 000) x (0.0001) = 14200 J = outlet energy 2.<br>5) Therefore we can write down the equalities:<br>5A) outlet energy 1 + outlet energy 2 = 37446 J + 14200 J = 51646 J<br>5B) inlet energy = 38232 J.<br>6) Therefore COP is given by<br>COP = 51646 J/38232 J = 1.35\u00a0 &lt;=&gt;\u00a0 COP = 1.35\u00a0 &lt;=&gt;\u00a0 COP &gt; 1.<br>------------------------------<br>Constant pure water and cooling agent supply could keep constant the electrolyte&#39;s temperature, heat exchange, mass and ohmic resistance, respectively.<br>Besides 0.0001 kg of hydrogen (and the related amount of the already split pure water) is small enough and can be neglected as a factor influencing the electrolyte&#39;s temperature, mass and ohmic resisitance.<br>-----------------------------<br>And one more interesting fact.<br>Literally the same solved problem can be found in an old Russian (still from the Soviet times) book &quot;\u0421\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447 \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0435&quot;, 1986, p. 130, solved example problem 71. The authors of this book are \u0420. \u0410. \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 and \u041d. \u0418. \u041a\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f. In the Russian version the data is a little different, that is, time is 25 minutes, the amount of generated hydrogen is 150 mg, Ohmic resisitance is 0.4 Ohm and the calculated power is 37 W.<br>Russians also stopped their calculations at 37 W.<br>Our further development of the Russian version led to COP = 1.37, that is, we have again COP &gt; 1.<br>-----------------------------<br>Therefore the text above unambiguously shows that it is a matter of exact experimental data which is in perfect accordance with theory. Because I cannot imagine that three highly qualified experts in physics (yet strongly separated by time, space and nationality) would have made one and same mistake three times in a row.

Pertual motion is a concept where initial energy is used to create energy which creates energy and the cycle is infinite. That is the definition on paper. It is impossible because initial energy will be lost to the environment and it won&#39;t have energy to create energy.", "comment_date": "2019-11-03T21:32:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ctrl Gamers", "comment_text": "Couldn&#39;t you make a perpetual machine in the vacuum of space so that the energy doesn&#39;t escape out of the machine?

Couple of personal opinions I have on perpetual motion... First off, the laws of physics are disputable based on the amount of information we have. At this point in humanities maturity cycle- most of what we know is fairly conceptual. Not to say that I don&#39;t agree with them for the most part, but I think it&#39;s important to continually look outside the box the way our predecessors did when they established the laws or &quot;concepts&quot; we have today. There are plenty of occurrences throughout the world and history where the laws of physics a proven to be failable. Again, not that I don&#39;t agree with their foundations... I just personally don&#39;t think in terms of &quot;this is not possible&quot;. Second, in regards to renewable energy, am I the only person still seeing a viable gain here? Sure the Bhaskara&#39;s wheel may not be perpetual motion in its truest form but working models still show that the wheel will, in fact, spin longer on its own momentum and weight displacement than the initial force used to initiate the spin that set it in motion. My point here is that it is, in fact, likely possible that energy could be derived using these attempts at the perpetual motion that only require periodic &quot;kick-starts&quot; so to speak. Could not a scaled up model using contemporary technologies to minimize friction and computer calculated weight displacement increase the returns as far as the duration of wheel spin to a point that someone could simply just give it a nudge every few days or something to keep the cycle going in order to generate electricity?

AS LONG AS IT&#39;S KEPT from rusting.  <br><br><br><b>*CONSIDER ONE ATOM OF IRON*</b> from that 10 pound block.  It has 26 protons, 26 electrons, and 30 neutrons (see www.ptable.com).  Atomic symbol for Iron is &quot;Fe&quot;<br><br>- each constituent part of that single Iron atom has energy -- the neutrons and protons have angular momentum.  The electrons have angular momentum and orbital angular momentum.  There are 26 electrons spread among 4 electron shells humming around that atom&#39;s nucleus as a standing wave.<br><br>- And that one atom is linked in a lattice to other iron atoms that in total make up the 10 lb. block of iron -- they &#39;stick together&#39; through ionic/metallic bonding.  <br><br>Consider this.  E=mc^2.   So how much energy &quot;E&quot; is in a 10lb block of iron?  QUITE OF BIT OF ENERGY.  But how is that possible, since the constituent parts of all the Iron atoms in the block should be losing energy as they vibrate in the lattice and experience angular and orbital momentum and spin.  What allows all those atoms to keep all that E=mc^2  energy?<br><br>ATOMS ARE PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINES.<br><br>The proof is this.  If an atom of Iron could lose all its energy =  in other words, set &quot;E&quot; to zero in the E=mc^2 formula -- <br><br>-- so you have  0 = mc^2.   But &quot;c&quot; is a constant (it&#39;s the speed of light) and cannot go to zero.  Thus, the mass &quot;m&quot; must go to zero if 0 = mc^2,  if the iron atom loses all its energy.<br><br>Now consider the 10 lb.  block of Iron -- set &quot;E&quot; to zero in  E=mc^2:   0 = mc^2.<br>If the 10 lb block of iron loses all its energy IT HAS TO DISSOLVE INTO THIN AIR, its mass <b>must</b> fall to zero =&gt;   0 = 0c^2 = 0.<br><br>ATOMS DO NOT LOSE THEIR ENERGY &quot;E&quot;.  We found a 4518-year-old block of Iron in an Egyptian tomb.

At the top is a big basin of water, as the water falls straight down it spins the water wheels generating electrical current. When it reaches the bottom their is another basin, but this one can be shaped some what like an up side down bowl and is slanted down so water flows into areas that are separate and in these areas the water is evaporated and then travels up tubes and back to the top where water re-condenses and falls back down. In these tubes the steam is traveling up through, there is a smaller tube coming down from the top and small windmill like contraptions protruding from it. The rising steam spins these small windmills and generates electrical current that travels through wires in the center of these inner tubes and can either be used for extra energy output or help to heat the bottom bassins. The energy to keep the bottom hot enough to evaporate water comes from as many of the water wheels spinning as needed. To get more energy output you just make the contraption taller with more water wheels, It will always only take so many wheels spinning to keep the water on bottom boiling so more wheels equals more energy output. The material in the top basin can be designed as a heat sink to help the water re condense into liquid form, if built correctly, so no water/steam escapes, it just keeps going and going utilizing natural forces to function. :) Now just add the proper electrical wiring into its design so all the excess energy being perpetuated can be accessed from plugs on bottom of device and presto you got yourself free energy. :) Please share this Idea with Everyone.", "comment_date": "2018-08-31T07:15:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spencer Roberts", "comment_text": "I gave her a BMW and a house", "comment_date": "2018-08-31T05:22:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spencer Roberts", "comment_text": "She&#39;s funded by big oil companies", "comment_date": "2018-08-31T05:22:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "versorama", "comment_text": "also, we call it unbalanced wheel, yet we build it and try to get it to look and operate very symmetrically...  the center of gravity must constantly be off-center...    we need to simulate it rolling down a hill... ;)", "comment_date": "2018-08-31T04:13:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "versorama", "comment_text": "lets say u get it to spin perpetually...  as soon as you attach anything to it to try and extract energy from it,  it will stop", "comment_date": "2018-08-31T04:06:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roger Freeman", "comment_text": "The unbalanced wheel may not work, but I just have to point out that she was trying to spin it backward.", "comment_date": "2018-08-31T01:45:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abdullah Saleh", "comment_text": "I will try and replay", "comment_date": "2018-08-30T18:08:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Let\u2019s go Brandon!", "comment_text": "The answer to the title of the video, before I even watch it, is no. <a href=\"https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion\">https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion</a>", "comment_date": "2018-08-30T11:36:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BigJyeTV", "comment_text": "can&#39;t get something from nothing... evolutionists might be angry at that statement.", "comment_date": "2018-08-29T18:20:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HBN Infotech - Tutorials", "comment_text": "I am myself an infinite ENERGY", "comment_date": "2018-08-29T17:52:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8d", "comment_text": "i love you !looking gergeous", "comment_date": "2018-08-29T14:28:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Candy Finance (Official)", "comment_text": "Very good explanation.

You have scrubs dictating the limitations of human creativity. Most of the stuff Google comes up with is stuff I came up with 4 years earlier than them. It&#39;s like trying to have a conversation with someone whom has an IQ 30% lower than you - both parties think the other person is crazy except the one that thinks the higher IQ person is crazy is using the higher IQ person&#39;s inventions without realizing it. I&#39;ve had my go at Perpetual motion machines, never got a working one but at least mine span a few time before stopping. This host can&#39;t even get hers to spin once. Nothing is for free and that&#39;s true - that&#39;s why you change your design so you are focusing on improving an existing energy rather than trying to have opposing forces and yet expect a result that cannot occur with equal opposing forces. You can&#39;t get something from nothing but you can bring something back that you didn&#39;t have by creating receptors to catch what is already there. <br><br>Antennas, Solar cells etc - these will always be the path of least resistance in regards to easy energy because the energy already exists - you just have to create something that can conduct with the energy and then connect the conductor to a battery. For example: You can create small antennas to catch 5G energy, setup kinetic rods inside balloon batons to convert wind energy into kinetic energy, you an take advantage of river currents, you can create small batteries out of citrus fruit etc etc, there are lots of ways to get energy from nature. Nature already is moving everywhere so rather than try to create a perpetual motor - take advantage of the perpetually moving nature. <br><br>The real interest in perpetual motion machines is that we know they will never work. And this is great because it gives us a base-line. Now, what is good about these useless devices is that we can make improvements to the designs until they have less friction than the last, or if they have a non-symmetrical weight distribution across the axle - these are ways you can mitigate resistance and thereby increase the number of times they cycle. So why are these important? Because they are ways of making motion more efficient and can be applied to actual mechanisms that we do use, such as car engines and axles, windmills etc where the focus is on increasing efficiency.<br>So to summarize -for all those low IQbies, perpetual motion will not exist however they can be used as control systems to compare to modified systems so we can work out ways to make mechanics more efficient.", "comment_date": "2018-05-11T15:12:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "L.

(Well, maybe it wouldn&#39;t be considered perpetual because it would need to be refilled with water, but that&#39;s it.) Meaning, let&#39;s say I put 100 ping-pong balls in a fish-tank, then I put a thin layer of sturdy plastic over the ping-pong balls, if I were to hold them under-water with my finger, it would be pressing upwards with a certain amount of Newtons. So, that&#39;s energy source one, a buoyant force infinitely pressing upwards (assuming you refill with water.) However, it would have to be very balanced, because once the ping-pong balls reach the TOP of the water, then the potential buoyant force is gone. But, whilst they are submerged it&#39;s a nearly infinite amount of force.Then, you have another infinite force, gravity, pushing DOWNWARDS, the opposite direction. So, for example, you could use the buoyancy force to press two magnets closer together than they would be other-wise. And, this could be used in various ways.

Physics has fallen into a bad state, theories dominate and are spread as facts, while you have people like this girl that completely dismiss a possible free energy source, it may well be fruitless, however if the great scientists of the past were convinced by their &quot;teachers&quot; as children that certain things were impossible, they said  it was impossible to fly, lets thank the wright brothers for not listening to lesser minds and actually achieving the impossible.<br><br>Hopefully someone can achieve the impossible, nobody knows if the conservation of energy is universal, we may have different dimensions, so ruling out anything when physics comes up with such absolute rubbish is a joke, the theoretical nonsense that people spout is insane, you will say absolutely that perpetual motion is impossible, but you believe in other theories and defend them like a god. Who on earth knows what gravity is or if it exists at all, even Newton thought it absurd, no one understands it, yet it is spread as if we knew everything about it, we can&#39;t even prove it exists yet we base science and our universe and our lives on it, yet it may not even exist, it doesn&#39;t exist in the quantum world, the quantum field deals with the orbits of protons neutrons and electrons, so why can&#39;t there exist a macro field?

Even although the structure of the system will eventually break down as its made of glass, if replaced, will drink forever (theoretically). So, if we made a machine using 64 birds (as an example) and replaced the ones that broke down, the entire system should never break down, itll just become 63/64ths as powerful until the fault is fixed.<br>The point to a perpetual motion machine is that &quot;we&quot; dont put in more energy than we get out. This can be looked at from two different sides though. <br>1) Are we physically adding energy to the system? ie are we expending our own energy (ie thats pointless) or, <br>thanks to the fundamental laws of physics regarding air pressure etc<br>2) are we getting energy out where we dont have to physically input any?<br>Yes, a perpetual motion machine that takes in no energy but outputs anything more than abolutely 0 energy is (probably) impossible (and is definitely impossible with our current tech) but that isnt the goal. The goal is to make use of these systems that surround us anyway and get that to create energy and basically do the work for us. We (people) are effectively inputting 0 energy but energy is still coming out that could be usable by us.<br>The 2nd most recent state of energy production was to use coal, gas and nuclear. These came with problems though 1) coal and gas isnt going to last more than a few hundred years 2) it needs to be taken out the ground, processed and transported. Hence why these types of energy are expensive.<br>The newest state is using wind and water power. &quot;We&quot; arent putting any energy in (after installation) but we are getting energy out. Transportation is still an issue with these, or at least for the decent versions that could power a home for example. Basically, these things are huge.<br>The newest/next step is to be able to create cheap and efficient energy that is easily portable. So called &quot;perpetual motion&quot; systems could do this if we could simply look beyond the silly and completely pointless mis-understanding of where the input energy is coming from.<br>Theres always going to be an input cost to something thats perpetual, but whos paying for it is the point?", "comment_date": "2017-08-19T02:31:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vaibhav Patel", "comment_text": "Your r very hot dear", "comment_date": "2017-08-18T10:32:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "English Poems", "comment_text": "hahahhaaa. very good", "comment_date": "2017-08-18T08:36:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "michael loges", "comment_text": "Think of it like this, you need a machine with over 100 percent efficiency", "comment_date": "2017-08-18T01:41:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PES MOBILE", "comment_text": "SHUT UP WOMAN AND GO COOK SOMETHING!", "comment_date": "2017-08-17T20:30:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R.R.N.

Just a thought. Why not use these ideas as an assistant rather than a dependibility. Assist vehicle engines that could balance perpetually with a sporadic fire of the engine rather than a constant, by simply using the spring and forward motion perpetual motion idea. Build water dams to use the fluid/weight balance method to enable a smaller river, I perform larger duties. I think as the balance of these machines is never going to work in theory, with natural readily occuring phenomena acting as only an aide, we can really begin to lower our dependence on fossil fuels, nuclear, etc, and use this discovered ability instead of choking our future generations. I wish I had the money to show the world how my perspective just makes sense. Especially if cost is the only thing holding the world back from moving quickly to a solar dependency. Big money has a huge play why these things aren&#39;t used as of yet. Less fuel used, smaller bonus checks for the big CEOs of major oil companies. Which happen to have the best lawyers and bankers working side by side to flatten any such proposed idea. Since it&#39;s not perfect? Move along? Bull crap ideology in my opinion. We have one earth.

People in the comments below keep talking about &#39;the laws of physics&#39; and &#39;thermodynamics&#39; but that&#39;s needlessly theoretical. The overbalanced wheel isn&#39;t doing anything different from any ordinary wheel. Yes, it&#39;s kind of true that the wheel of an upside down bike won&#39;t just start turning on its own &quot;because of the laws of thermodynamics&quot; but the more intuitive explanation is simply that there are no unbalanced forces acting on it. There&#39;s nothing to make it turn. If you sum up all the forces creating torques, they add up to zero. The movement of the parts that move - the sliding coins, the sloshing water - is distracting, but all they do is move around. In the overbalanced wheel set-up, the idea is that leverage will create a larger moment on one side than the other. This is the result of the coin with the longer moment arm - the greater leverage - falling further than the coin closer to the axis. It uses more of its potential than it gives back to the coin that is being lifted. That means the coin being lifted doesn&#39;t gain back the potential it will need when its turn comes to do the same job. Having more coins moving around masks this balance, but you can&#39;t make energy from 3-card monte. <br><br>In simple terms, the overbalanced wheel relies on the intuition that a teeter totter &#39;creates energy&#39;. The person sitting further out can lift the person sitting closer in. But once the person out at the end hits the ground, he can&#39;t get closer to the center without climbing, and the person up in the air can&#39;t get further out on the beam without also climbing. After they&#39;ve both invested this energy then it&#39;s ready to do work again. In the overbalanced wheel the motions and work of lifting the falling coins from their &#39;expended&#39; positions back to their &#39;potential&#39; positions is hidden by spurious hand-waving. But the physics of the system is no more complicated than it is in a piece of plywood nailed to a wall. There are no unbalanced forces at work.

Such machines always fail precisely because forces are not energy, and you can&#39;t extract one single bit of energy from a force itself. For instance, a &quot;free energy&quot; machine could consist of a ball that rolls down a hill and hits a paddle, which turns a wheel. The problem with this machine is that the ball has to be returned to the top of the hill for the process to continue, and the amount of energy you have to put into your machine to put the ball back at the top of the hill equals the energy you get out of your machine from the spinning wheel. Actually, the amount of energy you get out of your machines is always\u00a0less\u00a0than the energy you put into it because some of the inputted energy is wasted to heat energy through friction. Free energy proponents devise ever cleverer ways to get the ball back to the top of the hill (or the magnets separated again, or the rubber band stretched again, etc.), hoping that just one more extra gear or wheel will somehow magically create energy out of nothing. But they can never get around the fact that forces are not energy and you can never get more energy out of a system than you put in.<br><br>What about hydroelectric plants that extract energy from the falling water in rivers? Don&#39;t they extract energy from gravity for free? No. The water in the river is no different from the ball that you have to haul up the hill. The water got its energy not from gravity but from some external agent that placed it high up in the mountains against gravity, so it could fall down the river bed. The external agent in this case is sunlight. Sunlight warms the ocean, causing the water to evaporate and float into the sky. The energy contained in the photons of sunlight is converted to the potential energy of the water molecules that are lifted high in the sky. These water molecules then rain down to the ground, form rivers, and flow back down to the ocean, converting their potential energy to kinetic energy, heat, and (in a hydroeletric plant) electricity. Ultimately, therefore, hydroelectric plants extract solar energy from water.", "comment_date": "2017-04-10T08:32:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Movein Maldives", "comment_text": "you just left out magnets altogether.. govt sponsor", "comment_date": "2017-04-10T05:22:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Movein Maldives", "comment_text": "Magnets work", "comment_date": "2017-04-10T05:19:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hank Hammer", "comment_text": "So we COULD have sipy-birds powering energy at the equator....", "comment_date": "2017-04-10T01:50:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gnawk Nas", "comment_text": "Put the PMM in a vacuum and that solves air friction but that just conserves energy not make it", "comment_date": "2017-04-10T00:37:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Soto", "comment_text": "&quot;Designed with a little help from Kyle Kitzmiller&quot; Yeah right, we know he did all the work", "comment_date": "2017-04-09T22:52:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alpik Gandhi", "comment_text": "Your hair\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2017-04-09T11:21:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GirubaShankar Saminathan", "comment_text": "PMM is possible", "comment_date": "2017-04-09T10:21:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DarkSyner 76", "comment_text": "Challenge accepted", "comment_date": "2017-04-09T01:39:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Florian Offterdinger", "comment_text": "EHHMM NO", "comment_date": "2017-04-08T23:21:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ricky aragon", "comment_text": "Ok first off all it works your just spinning the wheel the wrong way spin it to the left not right", "comment_date": "2017-04-07T21:13:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Ren", "comment_text": "i have a &quot;perpetual&quot; motion machine: a solid block of plastic. the trick is that i&#39;t powered by the hype of morons believing in it <b>really</b> being a perpetual motion machine", "comment_date": "2017-04-07T19:44:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arun", "comment_text": "please tell me where you live where is that place I am literally having a high amaze chemical running through the brain", "comment_date": "2017-04-07T16:13:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jon Smith", "comment_text": "a model that can barely spin twice, proof now and forever  of absolutely nothing.", "comment_date": "2017-04-07T03:54:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bomguy999999", "comment_text": "She said climate change!!!

Instead, it uses hyperbole by its creator or promoter to make up for solid analysis? So, all I have to do, or anyone else for that matter, is be able to explain why something &quot;appears&quot; to be a perpetual motion machine, but actually isn&#39;t, merely because it doesn&#39;t defy any Law of Physics (such as the Dunking Bird example), because it can readily be explained in terms we already know from having studied Physics, Thermodynamics, Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, etc? So, this use of the term: &quot;perpetual motion machine&quot;, by Physics Girl, helps me to understand why so often this term is used in my face by (sometimes) not very friendly people whose patience has worn so thin, that any discussion of &quot;apparent&quot; perpetual motion machines never gets started, or maintained for very long, simply because no one has thoroughly, nor accurately, analyzed any candidate machine for either debunking it or explaining it - and so, consequentially, it does not exist as a true machine, but merely exists as an artistry of magic and imagination? Whew! I feel much better, now, because I understand that just because some machine is called &quot;perpetual motion&quot; does not make it so. In fact, it is our collective misuse of language that perpetrates this dilemma. So long as a machine can&#39;t be explained, so long is it a <b>candidate</b> for perpetual machine, but still not yet a perpetual motion machine. In other words, a non-perpetual motion machine is a definitive machine while a perpetual motion machine is not. All we&#39;ve managed to do is define what a machine is and exclude everything else which lies outside of our collective ability to define.

If you definite it as creating new energy, of course not, but if you define it as something going forever without the input of new energy, that is possible. Something will go forever until a outside force works to change it, it is another basic law of physics. So all you would need to do is remove all interference of motion and something can go forever. Like a wheel on a absolute frictionless axes in a true vacuum environment could spin forever. Now how such could be created would be incredibly hard and probably outside of current technology. And of course would only serve as a novelty anyway. No work could be created because any attempt to harvest work would work against the momentum. <br><br>Another example of a perpetual motion &quot;machine&quot; that we can actually do is, shooting anything into space. It will continue to go forever till it reaches gravitational or physical interference. Another might be, anything in orbit, if the distance is right, should continue to orbit forever till something interferes with said orbit. So many of the moons and planets in our solar system are quasi perpetual motion.

In addition it is more accurate to say that matter and motion are both conserved, but that motion can most likely never be converted into matter and matter never converted into motion. Beyond that we live in a totally rotten age of physics- since the rise of the transverse wave theory for light- then the very unlikely theory by Fitzgerald in 1895 that space contracts depending on the motion of material bodies. How much better a message to encourage people to try to design and built long-running motion machines.

That bird toy defiantly fits this definition.  If you are suggesting that it is no &quot;perpetual&quot; b/c eventually the sun will burn out and the atmosphere of the planet will be gone then that&#39;s just pathetic.  Everything thats energy to start.  The point of a perpetual generator of any kind is that once the initial energy is provided it supplies its own power from then on.  No intelligent person has ever suggested that a perpetual generator would never need additional power after its activation.  Again the point is that it gets that additional power from itself.  After all.  If we knew that people would still be around for billions of years and someone designed a light bulb that required a nuclear bomb to go off to start it giving off light but then that light would run for the next 5 billion years.  That would be a good investment.  It would cost less to build a nuke and set it off that to pay the light bill on that one bulb for the next 5 billion years.  Instead there are many &quot;perpetual motion generators&quot; today which require the initial input of someone starting it spinning with their hand.  Or even simply flipping a switch to release an imbalance.  You would say that this isn&#39;t perpetual motion b/c it requires energy input.  Clearly you don&#39;t understand the concept.  I sincerely hope there are no would be inventors out there who see a video like yours and buy into your ignorant unenlightened perception of the world and say &quot;oh i guess i&#39;ll give up on inventing that b/c its apparently impossible.

Am I saying the wheel will spin for ever no that is not what I am saying, but i expect something like this to at least properly explain the process. Try reanalyzing the wheel. as balanced with no balls in it. make the slots in a manor that the balls on one side are as far from center lets say that is the side will less balls only 2 there. the rest are on the other side but most of them are directly against the HUB. Take the force of gravity 9.8ms2  then use mechanical advantage of one side having 2 balls a far distance away and the side having 3 balls against the hub and 2 more approaching the HUB with one atleast 50% on the distance returned to center, or half the furthest distance it could be away. Once you have figured out the force of each side then ask yourself if it enough to break the resistance at the hub to movement. if not then ask how do we make it where it does? larger object to have more force? or frictionless(potentially magnetic) barring?&lt;---Fair warning when you try and run the math even if it did work it wouldn&#39;t spin fast enough to be in any way cost effective for generating power.", "comment_date": "2016-05-22T16:28:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "theBabyDead", "comment_text": "But, what if, with the energy created by the wheel, you have a device pushing it to go faster every once in a while so the friction won&#39;t win?

ALL energy we use is the result of entropy.  <br><br>In a nutshell, entropy can be stated as energy will always move from a state of higher energy to a state of lower energy. Period. You can slow it or change its form in some cases, but you can never stop it. Heat dissipates to cold. Light emanates to darkness, or is attenuated to heat. The thing that is up high, falls down. Complex chemical compounds decay into simpler compounds, giving off radiation, expansion or heat (or all). Large atoms decay into smaller atoms, until they stabilize. <br><br>The only time energy is not moving from high to low, is where everything is equal. At that point, for all practical purposes, there is no more energy. There is a great old scifi story about this, I think by Asimov.

Not to spoil the story for those of you that might read it, but the end explains the beginning, and gives a nod toward the futility of opposing entropy. <br><br>On the other hand, we can be thankful for entropy. Entropy is the reason that the complex nitrogen/carbon compounds in wood like to combine with oxygen in a reaction that gives off light and heat (we call this fire). Entropy is the reason that the hydrocarbons in your gas tank let you take your favorite girl to cruise night.

We have created some really efficient devices that spin for a very long time, but if we were to use their spin to create energy, we would still find it generates less energy than was used to spin it.  <br><br>The other problem is once you try to tap energy from any spinning motion machine, it will slow down because you are literally stealing energy from it.  Even if we were able to overcome friction, the issue would still be there because friction is what causes/transfers the energy in the first place.  If you were to transfer energy another way, it would still result in a loss of total energy from the machine.  This is why even in the vacuum of space and in a zero gravity environment, you still wouldn&#39;t be able to make perpetual motion.

If we were to for example, be able to reverse or remove gravity in a localized field, we could use that to keep a wheel spinning like a waterfall.  Of course, if the energy it takes to do that is greater than the energy we get from the wheel, then we&#39;re back to square one.

But working with nature you can come close for all practical purposes, and the key is understanding chemical kinetics and natural oscillators, and what work is and is not. Work is deformation of matter overtime, it is not energy, it is the result of energy transfer. What this means is that you can never have more work done by a system than energy flowing through it.  However you can have paired chemical oscillators which transfer energy back and forth which are constrained from reaching equilibrium. Like an atom where the atoms electron and nucleus pass photons back and forth. Another way to look at it is as two thermal batteries which double and half in equilibrium pressure with a 15K Delta, and in which absorbing is exothermic and releasing is endothermic, and you have two pairs of these thermal batteries where they transfer energy among themselves. As long as they operate at ambient temperature conditions and never get at a higher temperature the energy is constrained within the system, and the batteries provide temperature drop but the signal cannot travel any further than the opposed thermal battery to get the energy. It&#39;s a regenerative heat engine. Instead of discarding the thermal energy the heat source and sink oscillate. Is it perpetual? No! It will wear out and break down, and its also dependent on local temperature to constrain it.  The higher that local temp and the greater the chemical reaction to absorbing and releasing the more work can be performed, but work will always be less than the energy flow. However chemical oscillators  can work over hundreds of years, and it is much more efficient.  Carnot should be called work to energy flow efficiency because that is what it measures over a single cycle.  Overtime, if we can oscillate the temperature difference and not go above the ambient temp as heat source, then we can constrain the energy flow within a system, and it will continue to do work.

You no longer have to be concerned about what people are doing.  We can&#39;t affect the global climate.  In fact, he told me that if the present amount of CO2 doubled, there would be no significant affect.  Happy barbecue.  Happy fossil-fuels.
