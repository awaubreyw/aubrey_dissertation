Am I using the right word? transverse? No I am not, but also am, the moment you cause the light to flip on the transverse line then we perceive it as  flipped Of corse there will be the fun house mirror effect as well causing your head to become bigger and smaller according to a defined angle of just under 160 degrees (because spheres cannot be seen all the way to a viewer from any angle due to some weird law in the mechanics of light perhaps the angle is not appropriate for reflecting light after a certain point, but depending how far away you get from the spoon of corse the image would scale with distance or shrink with distance but in the point of shrinking it will collapse at some point and flip on its access and the image will get larger again. Although the surface has to be a near perfect image to replicate the image down or up to near infinite scales which I know is impossible so unless you know how to perfectly reflect light, than the images will become distorted at some point, unless you have the spoon of god or something in which case you could probably use it to create a point of light hot enough to vaporize anything in nano seconds if the spoon is big enough and the focal length is past the light emission device than you may even be able to create enough light pressure to create nuclear fusion, would not want mess with such a spoon.  all though our eye also works on with the idea of lensing so the true image displayed vs the image we would see reflected would differentiate depending on the quality of our eyes, but basically there is to much focal math for me to handle in my brain at the moment. sooo the image flipped from the lens is flipped by our eyes, and then flipped again, So the image you see in the flipped spoon is actually only right side up in our imagination because our eyes flip the image on to our retina, and then the image is flipped again by our brains. but if projected on to a flat detector behind a pinhole than the upside down image is correct well the right side up image is also correct, but only if it is not flipped by a lens you are asking what we would see right? everything we see we do so upside down, and then our visual encoding systems flip the image back up, So there is a ... Our eyes put out electro chemical signals in analog right? Yes it is in analog, So the analog signal is flipped by our brain to help us understand the world around us. I cheated a little and looked up wether transverse was the right word and wether our eyes were digital or not. but Hey, Ima watch the video now.", "comment_date": "2021-01-05T06:29:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "juan", "comment_text": "ian smosh", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T14:34:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BiLLz614", "comment_text": "Ian Hecox is a patron lol", "comment_date": "2020-12-03T08:51:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gerald Paul", "comment_text": "I did not know that intra-ocular lenses were a thing, and my mind is totally blown.

You can find the focal point of a mirror by seeing where it focuses something far away, like the sun or a distant tree, etc. If you then put your face at that spot (indoors, etc - don&#39;t burn yourself!),  you&#39;ll see a nice image of your face that will be upright and it will look about twice as big as it would if the mirror were flat. The point where it will get blurry and flip over will be when you move to TWICE the focal point distance. (Try it) The image when you&#39;re at the focal point will be both very large and very far away, but it will only appear about twice the size of you (this is called the angular magnification.)<br><br>We all sometimes make the mistake of letting what we think should happen distract us from noticing what&#39;s really happening. (Derek&#39;s thesis is kind of on this idea.) The idea that the image gets blurry and flips when we stand at the focal point sounds sensible, but it&#39;s just not what actually happens. It&#39;s a common misconception that because the rays go out parallel there can&#39;t be an image, but if you remember that each point on your face gets mapped to a unique angle, you realize why you can still see an image when you stand at the focal point.<br><br>Thanks again for the great videos.

Those are very similar to those I suggested as rapid deploy building robots build here for farm infrastructure if there way say more water across the flatter parts of Africa. I know before ancient drought that water ways used to flow outward to the sea. I know I suggested a crazy idea of them flowing inward using low grade man dug channels into this by gone savanna. But as a Scientific Physics measure could you visit Blue Thunder&#39;s super computers used to modernize efficiency of crops and do machine learning predictions of the weather. I&#39;m wondering what we could learn about the causes of the regions warming in ancient Africa and Egypt and how models of moving or restoring some major water ways of ancient lakes might reverse effect of those droughts and warming. I recently learned of these ancient savanna&#39;s on a PBS broadcast episode over the old airwaves and I had imagined that is what caused a region I knew little about called the malaria belt. This and other scientific measures of the research in the show such as studies of mud in receding lakes in Egypt helps confirms my imagining of those events. Maybe a great fire or a confluence of events triggered the initial drought or loss of atmosphere such as solar radiation increasing or maybe they just worshiped the sun because of the increasing heat after a loss of protective atmosphere? I mean not to be too supernatural but you can ask my local pagan group that when asked what pagan regions I was focused on for some reason I was drawn to Egyptians before all this because if felt like the beginning of certain studies of nature. The pyramids as they related to both cosmological studies of the stars and the sun and for some reason in my head the studies of the sun and time with the placement and movement of shadows of the great pyramids just seems like a giant clock to me for planting crops and then I just read this. @t Anyways wondering how the ML models at Blue Thunder could reduce the uncertainty of the General Circulation Models by reducing statistically or dynamically down-scaling for impact studies of Hydrological Cycles over the Congo and Upper Blue Nile Basins: Evaluation of General Circulation Model Simulations and Reanalysis Products found here. @t", "comment_date": "2020-03-02T08:20:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Giancarlo Andre Bravo Abanto", "comment_text": "l d like to see your spoon ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "comment_date": "2020-03-02T07:54:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lord~Nexus", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t try to push through the spoon, that&#39;s impossible.
