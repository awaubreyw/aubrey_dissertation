However, this means that at the end of a bundle of chains, at the ferrofluid surface, there are many North poles next to each other with no attached South poles. Since North repels North, the bundles of chains are driven to repel each other, while surface tension draws the surface inbetween them, and they split into spikes, rather than terminating in a smooth dome over the pole.", "comment_date": "2015-10-22T12:59:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Make Science Fun", "comment_text": "Fun to stick a large supermagnet in ferrofluid, and then let the oil dry out over a few weeks and your left with hardened crazy alien spikes!", "comment_date": "2015-10-22T12:33:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rairiku", "comment_text": "Did this give anyone else goose bumps?", "comment_date": "2015-10-22T11:04:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bluephreakr", "comment_text": "I am proud of the lack of sexism (for one&#39;s own benefit and / or defamation of others) in the comments section.
