This telescope and this project are incredible. This is what makes me mad. We figured out warp drive, we are BUILDING fusion generators, our first consumer robots have been released, in a couple of years we will start mapping the universe accurately and soooo many more amazing things that we used to fantasize about and could only see in science fiction.<br>Well science fiction isn&#39;t fiction anymore. All the most amazing things are being invented and becoming reality. And no one seems to really care. How are these things not human milestones. Massively important historical events that are celebrated around the world. We are literally on the cusp of moving from the Cyber Age into the Space Age. Thats huge. But instead we are arguing about how many genders there are. WTF? Did I miss something. Did I somehow accidentally travel to a parallel universe where everything is backwards and upside down. Apparently...<br>Well even if no on cares about how truly incredible this lens and the telescope it&#39;s going into are, then hopefully people at least care about this.
