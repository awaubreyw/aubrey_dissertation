A smaller one might not be up for the job. You can&#39;t really compare apples to apples unless you get down to fundamental particles. Then you can eliminate material properties (e.g. size, mass, charge, spin, charm) as variables and focus on field properties and geometry. i.e. How do the forces compare for a given type of particle at a given distance?
