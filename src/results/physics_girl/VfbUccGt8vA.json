If you have a flat head screw, and you have 1 flat head screwdriver and 1 phillips head screwdriver, you&#39;ll probably just pick up the flat head and try it. But if you had 30 different flat heads, you might not know which one to use right away. You might be tempted to use a screwdriver which will definitely work for all screws, but you might end up doing extra work because of it. The same thing happens with math. Once we know that we can always use calculus to solve these optimization problems, we jump to this one-size-fits-all tool to solve this problem, and end up doing a lot of work to get to the correct answer. If you never learned calculus, you&#39;re more likely to think of the simpler solution. I would say aside from the fact that there&#39;s less info to sort through, it&#39;s also got to do with our desire to find a better solution being much less than our desire to find any solution. Once we find a solution, inefficient though it may be, we stop trying.

There is a simple case in which both solutions are equally correct. Place the towns equidistant from the beach. Then place the towns a distance apart that equals 1.5 times their mutual distance from the beach. If you measure the two solutions, you will find that they are equal. If the towns are placed closer together than that,\u00a0then the road will be shortest by going from one town to the other, and then to the beach. If the distance between the two towns is more that 1.5 times their mutual distance from the beach, then there will be curve, along which, both solutions work equally well. The curve will move away from one of the towns and away from the beach. On the side of that curve closer to the beach, Dianna&#39;s solution will work best. On the side of that curve farther from the beach, the simpler solution will work best. So the real problem is to define that curve.

The total amount of materials needed can be just be set proportional to the sum of the 2 paths that must be built (because these are just paths, so obviously the longer they are the more materials are needed). You can then define a math function that &quot;returns&quot;  the sum of the lengths of the 2 paths as a function of the point picked along the shore.<br><br>After you have that dreadful equation, you then need to figure out where the minimum is, so you take the derivative of that sucker, and you can pinpoint easily where the function &quot;bottoms out&quot; because as you approach the minimum, the slope (tangent line) gets closer to zero until it is zero, right at the bottom of the function.

We can then insert x + y for c in the previous equation, getting ax + bx = a(x+y), which, when distributed, is ax + bx = ax + ay. Take ax off of both sides and divide by b and y, and you get a/b = x/y.
