Just wanted to leave a note about this infrared camera and some of its quirks. The sharp crisp lines on the picture are actually due to a visible camera paired with the infrared. Infrared light doesn\u2019t usually give you crisp detail, so this camera combines the visible light image to give detail to the picture. ALSO! The app recalibrates and changes which colors correspond to which temperatures depending on what the min and max temperature are on screen. And lastly, though this may have become obvious over the course of the video, the particular filter we used showed \u201chotter\u201d as yellow and \u201ccolder\u201d as purple.
