The beautiful colors, like motor oil on water.  Thin-film interference color effects are in turn due to <b>very</b> small continuously dynamic variations in the thickness of the thin film floating on the surface of the water, in this case, a thin film of soap.  (Or tiny variations in the thickness of a thin film of motor oil floating on a puddle.)  Variations in thickness of the film so small that from one location to another nearby, but of a different color, the thickness differences are on the order of wave lengths of visible light.  Really small!!<br><br>So, this means that, if the swirling structures made visible on the surface by the soap film are due to, or reflective of, systematic patterns of heat flow within the water of the bubble, those heat flows I think must be systematically varying the thickness of the soap film in some true way so that we &quot;see&quot; the heat flows.  Looks like this is true too because the swirling vortices seem to appear predominantly on the <b>top</b> of the bubble.  The top is the part of the bubble to which the warmest water, which gets heated only at the bottom of the bubble (i.e,. from the metal can), would probably rise.  And once there, give up some of its heat to the surrounding air.  Swirling would be from faster-moving and slower-moving regions of the bubble&#39;s surface, which I think would in turn stretch in paces, and compress in others, the amount of soap in the film which would indeed vary it&#39;s thickness.", "comment_date": "2015-12-23T17:30:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Devendra Singh", "comment_text": "that is awesome i must try it", "comment_date": "2015-12-22T05:49:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Preston Siegler", "comment_text": "these videos are always fun", "comment_date": "2015-09-22T02:09:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raj Harsh", "comment_text": "Either you are stupid, or the people who conducted the experiment.
