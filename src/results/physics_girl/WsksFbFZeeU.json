But since soap seems to mix with water, I tried to find out how oil mixed with water. After some research (which is a few minutes of googling) I found that if you put detergent/soap into water, it is attracted to both oils and water, so it can help them combine to help form something called an emulsion.<br><br>But that didn&#39;t explain why there were those circles floating on top of the water. So I though maybe by flicking something onto the surface, you could separate the water and the oils inside the soap again, so the oil would float on top. But then the detergent/soap would combine the two liquids once more.<br>It may be a long explanation, but that was what I found.

When you flick the surface you might be flicking some pure water from below the soapy film which will then sit ontop this hydrophobic (oily) layer. Therefore the tiny droplets of pure water would try and maximise its interaction with itself (i.e. form little balls) rather than spread out over the hydrophobic (oily) layer. Eventually the droplet would What I&#39;m not sure of is why stirring the water would make these little droplets last longer (and one would imagine that stirring would break the hydrophobic layer and intermix the soap film with the water below).\u00a0<br><br>One other possibility, considering that both of the examples you showed contained milk (the coffee seemed to have milk in it!), that it instead might have something to do with the folding of the milk proteins (which presumably may have different folding in a hydrophobic and hydrophillic environments).<br><br>I tried to reproduce the experiment using water + detergent (specifically Fairy liquid and a hand soap) and milk + detergent. In the water I wasn&#39;t able to get anything like spheres that you observed, in the milk + detergent I believe I was (though it was hard to tell due to the lack of contrast). There could also be a temperature dependence and liquid : detergent relative composition dependence.\u00a0<br><br>So, I guess my question would be: Do you see it in coffee without milk? Do you see it in water without any coffee or anything like that? (if yes then it is nothing to do with the proteins in the milk). As you heat the liquid + detergent does it become easier or harder to make these spheres (higher temperatures lead to lower surface tensions, and should also increase the dissolving of the soap into the water / milk), similarly can the same thing be achieved with an oil (e.g. cooking oil) - soap will lower the surface tension of the water, oil shouldn&#39;t affect the surface tension as they do not intermix (to test whether it is the hydrophobic layer or the effect on surface tension that is causing this).

I only wash the Chemex with soap about once every two weeks so I have a feeling that the effect is possible with only coffee. I wonder if the freshness of the coffee changes the effect-- as I grind decently fresh roasted beans-- and whether or not the cream/milk you added to it changed it at all.
