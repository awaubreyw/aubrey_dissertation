[{"comment_by": "Physics Girl", "comment_text": "Hey, I&#39;m Dianna and you&#39;re watching Physics Girl. I know, that part of the video is missing. So is HAPPY PHYSICSING! SORRY! Let me explain. This video is part of a PBS Miniseries called Stellar done in collaboration with PBS Spacetime and It&#39;s Okay to Be Smart. There will be videos on their channels too, and one more on Physics Girl in 3 weeks. For the context of this video, let&#39;s go back to when I was a wee undergrad studying physics. Back then, there were experiments that physicists agreed were potentially going to be HUGE for modern physics - discovering the Higgs boson (we did that recently!), taking the first image of a black hole (we just did that too!). But a really big experiment was aiming to measure gravitational waves, and I remember being told we didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d measure them any time soon, if ever. But in 2015 we measured the first gravitational wave. It was a HUGE moment! Not just for physics, but for all of science! And the observatory that made the discovery was LIGO. For this video, which is part of a PBS space series that i\u2019ll explain more in the description, I GOT TO GO TO LIGO. The best part was sitting with the head of the observatory and asking him all my questions about the universe in the downtime of the shoot. One of the coolest days of my life. Anyways.. I hope you enjoy this series!", "comment_date": "2019-06-27T17:36:53Z", "likes_count": 789}, {"comment_by": "emtpayislow", "comment_text": "Why aren&#39;t gravitational waves constant?", "comment_date": "2022-07-14T20:34:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FlankyFrankie", "comment_text": "Do these waves disturb time?

As an ex Military electronic eng doing work for &#39;5 eyes alliance&#39; , you should google that,  it invloved Edward Snowden which may ring a bell!, which includes your NSA and 4 other nations doing sigint and elint, spook work. We used lasers in similar way to get audio recordings of what people were saying inside rooms, same principle infrared laser pointed at window or curtain and the phase shift in returned reflection due to subtle movement on surfaces,from sound waves:- a glass cup, window, table cloth, over head light or candle. It&#39;s difficult to initially set up getting all the angles correct to receive reflected lasing and compare phase shift with original laser before reflecting off subtle movements of reflected surface.  Essentially it&#39;s the same thing / concept. I remember laughing so much when Myth Busters did an episode on this and Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman found it as frustrating as we did to get it aligned correctly, but once set up correctly it works a peach. I would like you to do the same experiment . It would be so much fun to watch you do it . Your enthusiasm, passion and exuberance in physics is the same I have for electronics, quantum mechanics, astronomy and cosmology. I have to know how things work ever since I was a child. My first favorite website when WWW started which is still going is called &#39;How stuff works. &#39; My big fascination as a child was radio, Marconi, Faraday and Tesla were my champions at 6 yrs old studying after school at night technical college to get full amateur radio licence before I joined the Royal Australian Navy and did my electronic communications apprenticeship. I was gifted in understanding the things I was curious about and I&#39;m so grateful for that natural gift of understanding and curiosity, your passionate exuberance reminds me of myself. I&#39;m now medically retired and still passionate about how things work. Your doing a fantastic job of HAPPY PHYSICSING! . I subscribed to your channel a few weeks ago.

The two are related to their interaction, that I&#39;ve understood to be gravity.   Black-holes in space are believed by some to be that #1 condition of absolutely no matter, and are thought to be at a temperature of zero degrees Kelvin.  It is also thought by some that the most powerful force ever, is that #1 condition of absolutely no matter.  It is thought, by at least myself, that the force associated with absolutely no matter can &quot;pull&quot; itself apart, much as a vaccumn (but there really is no such thing as a vaccumn, there is always a lesser pressure giving the effects of a vaccumn).  And by pulling itself apart the force creates two general categories of matter that some understand to be matter particles and antimatter particles, thus the building blocks of atoms.  Where are these particles of matter and antimatter?  Well they&#39;re all around, the positron and electron are a matter-antimatter pair and the neutron-proton are also a matter-antimatter pair.  Both pairs are &quot;inverse&quot; particles to each other, thus what I mean by matter and antimatter.  And gravity is the interaction of a great amount of matter and a lesser amount of matter (or just nothing). <br><br>Believe it or not, I hope to have shared some information with the readers that you will find helpful someday.

Perhaps LIGO could build a device that compared a ray that has traveled several kilometers to a different wave that is fresh out of the laser, in order to detect chronic transience.

As I understand it, LIGO detects GWs by measuring the change in the lengths of the 4km arms. Since space itself expands and contracts when a GW passes, the light wave in the arms should also expand and contract (i.e., change their wavelength locally). Thus any change in length of the arms should match the change in the local wavelength. Therefore interference patterns shouldn&#39;t happen. I hope I have explained my dilemma clearly.
