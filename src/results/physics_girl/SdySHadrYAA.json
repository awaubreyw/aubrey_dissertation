Should we eventually learn how to travel through the event horizon, we might discover different universes with different laws of physics. Could human exploration extend to mapping universes? What if various stars are the other side of the black hole? Massive amounts of energy and matter come from stars, could it be coming from a mirror image black hole in another universe? Do Black Holes die as stars do? What about the creation of new universes? If black holes are one way  tunnels, every time a massive amount of matter is fully absorbed, the creation of a star comes to an end. When the black hole is given a break of sorts, the next amount of matter to be absorbed may lead to the creation of another star in a different position due to the black hole moving through space-time?", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T06:48:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hbg423", "comment_text": "You didn\u2019t mention Suskind vs Hawkins.

First of all, remember that I am no astrophysicist and secondly, I have no references, so take it as you may will. A black hole is also called an invisible singularity. Singularity why? Cause it is one object that breaks the laws of physics (or doesn&#39;t, we just don&#39;t know it yet). Light cannot come out of a black hole, not because of gravity (photons do not have mass), but because of the curvature of space-time itself. Think of it like a bottomless well which once you start falling inside, you will fall forever. Now what happens in reality is that any object nearing the event horizon, start going forward in time (yes that is relativity for you), for the observer, it seems like the object is slowing down (even though the gravity is increasing with decreasing distance). This is because any matter in the universe exhibits gravity based on its density, the higher the density, the higher the gravitational attraction. Now why is this important? Cause these large celestial bodies actually curve space time in a way such that the rate of flow of time decreases the closer you are to a body with high gravitation. So for example, the Sun which has higher density than the Earth, experiences a decrease in flow of time relative to Earth. A black hole is an entity where the space time curvature is so much that because of this property, the rate of flow of time reduces exponentially as you move towards the event horizon. That is why objects falling into the black hole (while you can see them) will seem like they are falling indefinitely. Now at the event horizon, these objects that fall in, from the observer&#39;s point of view, the objects get stuck in time forever. So when you consider light, its not because of gravity that the light cannot come out of the event horizon, but its literally because for us, the light or whatever object that has fallen inside the black hole are literally frozen in time. Thus, the objects form a layer on the outskirts of the black hole (which we cannot see) but are present in a squished sort of way, thus preserving the theory that information cannot be lost. Now for the objects that fall in (they are no longer objects anymore but destroyed into elementary particles like atoms or quarks), we don&#39;t know what happens from their point of view, cause from their point of view, time flows regularly and at the same time they are inside the event horizon. Black holes grow in size the more matter they consume and this can be observed. There is one theory that states that as black holes grow in size, they will ultimately merge into one huge black hole, which can form another universe inside it. Black holes are the only objects in the universe that defy laws of physics.

There&#39;s a lot of fixation even among physicists on gravity as a force, hence as a (fundamental) field theory.<br>On the matter of what BH&#39;s are, first of all they are certain solutions to GR equations, which yield certain consequences such as that there&#39;s an event horizon from which nothing escapes.<br>We somehow get the picture that things fall in and are &quot;lost&quot; to us, or rather the BH (its properties) is all that is left as physically accessible to us. In a sense what is accessible includes the proximity of its event horizon, though properly this is still the &quot;outside universe&quot; (relative to the BH).<br>But is the &quot;sink hole&quot; the right picture? When things fall into the BH, when they reach its event horizon?<br>For any reference system of the outside universe, not at any finite time: it takes an infinite amount of time for something to be seen as falling in. The picture that is given and objective to the outside universe is that of energy-matter accumulating on this side of the event horizon.<br>This &quot;seeing&quot; that we are talking about is not simply appearances, they are objective relations under general-relativistic laws. When we determine a distribution of energy-matter to put into the GR equations, it is in the very same sense as we are now speaking of &quot;seeing&quot;.<br>We started by saying that BH&#39;s are certain solutions to GR equations, but these solutions, via the equations, corresponds to energy matter distributions. Proper theoretical BH solutions have infinite density at the singularity inside the event horizon. You can get to that by considering a fixed energy-mass and progressively reduce the volume it occupies. But this is not a physical process, it is an analytical path through a set of solutions of GR. At some point we get an event horizon, and the consideration that this has the property that nothing falls in renders the analysis we were following suspect, at least in view of describing physical BH&#39;s.<br>We do know that the solution for an energy-matter distribution outside of the event horizon is not the same as that of an infinite density at the singularity. Furthermore if no energy-matter is inside the event horizon, we would not have a well defined solution inside of it (where there is no energy-matter, GR doesn&#39;t have a unique solution). Einstein though that these multiple solutions would represent the same physics, I think this scenario suggests the possibility that simply geometrodynamics is not defined where it is not well defined: there is no inside. And this latter point makes physical sense to the outside universe for the very fact that it sees nothing getting in.<br>A physical black hole might not be described by the traditional proper theoretical BH solution, with an inside and a singularity, rather by a solution considering that energy-matter is accumulated on this side of the event horizon. Then, the picture is not that of a sink-hole, but that of a geometrodynamical cavitation: what is cavitating due to high energy-matter density is the very geometry of spacetime. And we probably shouldn&#39;t think that there is an inside (well defined to the outside universe), we have no reason to think that the geometry of spacetime is embedded in any other extension, curvature is intrinsic, and in the cavitation scenario it does not extends to the other side of the horizon.<br>The benefits of this scenario are:<br>- it fits the idea (it is based on it) that it takes an infinite amount of time to &quot;see&quot; anything fall into a BH, more precisely, to this universe nothing falls into the event horizon, rather it accumulates on this side of it,<br>- there is no singularity,<br>- there is no information loss,<br>- makes sense of the result that BH entropy is a function of the area rather than the volume.<br>The cons: I don&#39;t know if it is right. :P", "comment_date": "2019-09-26T16:50:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Whiz Kid", "comment_text": "Black holes are the beginning and end of time.

This comment is only meant, as a question, of confirm of this statement, its only stated solely based on my curiosity.<br><br><br> - As for the picture, taking in april of &quot; the black hole&quot;, can we atleast agree, that what that picture actually shows, is the first photograph of the event horizon of a black hole, and is displayed in a 2 dimensional format. As of now, we have only proven photographically the phenomenons indicating the black hole, and seen prove of its gravitational curves and rotation.<br><br><br>As of now, we cannot take a picture to gain a full grasp of a black hole, since light can escape it. Even if we could see it, we would only be able to see it in a 2 dimensional format, and therefore not grasp the whole of what a black hole actually is.<br><br><br>We might try to convert it into a third dimensional format, but that would at best be a guess or speculation based on the little data we can receive. <br><br><br>Is this an accurate understanding, or is there something left out? or is it completely wrong?

All of the recent discoveries within astrophysics have been so very exciting , and to get to see an image of something that from the age of 5 or 6 I thought I would just have to have faith and believe in (always did) and now it has been realized , Professor Hawking would have been so excited and as well so justified to see this , well I believe he has and much much more .

Kudos, indeed Physics girl for regurgitating eloquently that which most of us have been taught. I mean it: wonderful presentation! The challenge with theoretical physicists is they live in a world of Unicorns whereas theories become models that have no basis in actual workings. The regauging of equations by adding constants is but one example. We end up with theories that only work at the macro scale and necessitate another one for the micro scale.We consider theories that throw away 96% (give or take) of the Universe, simply because we cannot yet observe it. We confuse attributes of things for the thing itself. My hand waving is still my hand. Waving is that which my hand is doing. A wave does not exist in and of itself. Something must exist, in order to wave, whether that something can be perceived, or not. We invent virtual particles for the sake of making equation work. We take all those things for gospel and current science is now more dogma than actual genuine science. A few succeed in breaking away from academic science and actually use thought, logic, intuition as well as retroduction to arrive to true understandings. Observations and explanations are two vastly different animals, unfortunately too often confused by scientists.What is energy? What is light? What is a field? The words we use must explain the phenomenon and not merely describe it, and the mathematics must also explain the phenomenon; not make up a model. It may not be simple to explain, but it can be simplex. Ken Wheeler certainly attains that level of understanding, even if his delivery is not always tasteful. See, also Nassim Haramein. I like those rebels of science that do not abide by the indoctrination of Academia and cannot stand the &quot;dumification&quot; of Humanity through a system that does not condone thinking and the scientific method, but that rewards regurgitation of ideas and dogma as basis for more of the same. These are most of the Phd&#39;s to which we are supposed to bow to. Hail to the rebels, with degrees, or without, who truly question everything and are open to changing their mind completely, if need be. It is just that it can be easier (not always) to change our mind and contemplate new possibilities when we have not yet been programmed by a system of science that rewards sheepish behavior and almost cultish allegiance to the religious dogma of the establishment. Even those who appear to be mavericks, such as Hawkins. I respect all of them deeply for their contributions. I am just not willing to conform for the sake of not rocking the boat. I want to understand, rather than regurgitate, or pretend to understand non-sensical explanations.  Sure, what is non-sensical today may become trivial, tomorrow. At least, let&#39;s admit when we make things up, rather than passing the as theories that become accepted and become the basis for new theories, each less sensible than the previous one.", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T04:28:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samantha Lee", "comment_text": "I\u2019m so disappointed I didn\u2019t know who he was until he passed away... such an amazing guy", "comment_date": "2019-04-01T23:17:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Astronomy guy", "comment_text": "Why would you bring up fundamental euclidean geometry when talking about curved spacetime.<br><br>And yes if you have 2 straight lines on a oblate spheroid they will eventually meet.<br><br>But that has nothing to do with the mass of an object curving spacetime.<br><br>Einstein figured out gravity is (a) with respect to time.<br><br>His theory predicts that photons curve around bigger masses like the sun.

I&#39;ve heard people say that only primordial black holes exist (from the big bang), for the same reason - gravitational time dilation prevents stars from fully collapsing the same way it prevents objects from reaching the event horizon.  Others say that since our frame is relative, and the object flying into the black hole would definitely not see itself as &quot;frozen in time&quot; (like we see in our frame),  it does actually get into the event horizon... but this would take literally forever in our frame.

There is still time and distance for the gravity to affect objects around it and there are different sizes of black holes that register how much mass is there. So I would question whether it ever arrives at a singularity where there is no time or distance for things to take place. If there was a true singularity, there would be no mass there unless the black hole fills up and overflows and then we would be able to see it.  The singularity or approximate singularity must increase in size or mass since we normally can&#39;t see a black hole no matter how big it is.

The same people that argue blue light would not disperse in space as there is nothing to disperse it are also the same people that tell us space is full of dark matter.", "comment_date": "2019-03-08T19:46:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silas", "comment_text": "Custom made black hole animation?<br><br>Wicked.
