Your weak muscles and lack of coordination in a range of motion you have never explored before makes your brain not trust you to flex your muscles in their full range of motion. So your brain makes those muscles contract to prevent you from going all the way and potentially hurting yourself.<br><br>To gain &quot;flexibility&quot; is really to gain &quot;trust&quot; from your nervous system by strengthening the muscles around the joint whose range of motion you are trying to increase. &quot;Stretching&quot; is really just an lightweight isometric hold that is strengthening the muscle being stretched. A more effective way to strengthen that muscle and make it more &quot;flexible&quot; would be to use weights or other forms of resistance and contract the muscle like you would workout any other muscle.<br><br>I am surprised the biomechanist didn&#39;t know/mention any of this...", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T04:13:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "abbey milligan", "comment_text": "Hi i do contortion its my profile picture", "comment_date": "2022-01-25T05:42:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A N", "comment_text": "90% comes with training Folks, the other 10+% are mind.", "comment_date": "2022-01-24T09:47:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jim Crossan", "comment_text": "Mines don&#39;t do that Diana", "comment_date": "2022-01-22T03:33:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Azalea", "comment_text": "With the Brighton score it\u2019s so weird.

I am living proof with a pulled hamstring attachment this video is very dangerous.

These injuries lead me to become a yoga instructor but that still does not address  hypermobility where I am injuring myself. Even my arms were in pain in downdog from this and until I found Anthony Bennenati @thatsnotyoga, no one could explain this and that&#39;s after years of searching and also physical therapy. Now after years I enjoy teaching but it is still really interesting that so many people do not address this and that&#39;s what lead me here. I want more information which this gave some of but to promote people over stretching is VERY dangerous! #1 rule is flexibility without strength can lead to injury. It is amazing to me to watch contortionists like this but they started very young while they were still growing so their bodies may have different collagen and after 12 years of dedicated yoga practice I am more mobile but before I found Anthony to explain the dangers of hyper extension, I was in pain in my arms and hips and even knees.", "comment_date": "2020-09-22T19:05:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pamela Harry", "comment_text": "I&#39;m 65 years old.

You and the biomechanist seemed to miss a significant point of tensegrity applied to posture (see Anatomy Trains Tom Myers) along with stress management, breathe change, and emotional regulation/modulation, as outcomes of stretching. The thing with stretching though is then that you/others are not seeing the body from a tension/emotion release and responsiveness-to-(re)act cohesively capacity, the difference between saying the sky is blue versus no, it\u2019s how the light is passing through the atmosphere with a certain wavelength due to the angle of entry. I feel that the perception of what is being perceived about the act of stretching needs to be switched, in the same way that the Earth was as the centre of the solar system, but that the Sun is.

The first two weeks I was stiffer than when I was brand new to yoga.  By 3 week I became stronger than when I quit yoga in Feb 2019.  I have been concentrating on upper back, shoulder, side ribs, hamstring, and hip flexibility since I came back to yoga and the result has been unbelievable.  I can finally do classic camel without leaning back.  I can pancake also flat to the floor.  The magic is breathing and let go of fear and control.  The sensation of growing longer and sinking deeper is wonderful (no pain as soon as I let go and trust my body).  Anyone can become more flexible and stronger but it does take time and intention.

The hypermobility doesn&#39;t just affect joints either, it&#39;s skin, hair.... Even organs. My hypermobility has paralysed my stomach, so I can never eat solid food again. It&#39;s also caused brain fluid to leak from my nose, it also makes me pass out when I stand up sometimes. <br><br>As you can tell, there&#39;s a massive distinction between hypermobility and flexibility already.<br><br>Flexibility is from stretching, this is what contortionists do. They condition their joints to get used to this. I used to be a contortionist until I had to stop. Flexibility is not debilitating, you can go about your life normally when you&#39;re not purposely stretching.

If someone is unconscious, they can do the splits without any problem. That is why picking up an unconscious person is so difficult. The mind protects the body from unsafe positions by making us stiff. Stretching trains the mind that these positions are safe. Strangely, one of the best and safest ways to stretch is not by relaxing but by flexing the muscle that you want to stretch. Flexing the muscle tells the brain, &quot;I&#39;m okay. I&#39;ve got this under control&quot;. A good test for this is the quadriceps.

Another way to look at it is when your body executes a move correctly, it is coordinated movement.  If your body doesn\u2019t execute a move correctly, it is uncoordinated.  Movement skills and attributes are acquired through motor learning and practice.  Sofie is unusually hypermobile and I wouldn\u2019t suggest any of the contortionist positions which could be unsafe for most people.  But everyone can improve the way they move.  And you could certainly learn the move you attempted at the end of the video.", "comment_date": "2019-03-08T09:13:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YouDont KnowMe", "comment_text": "Your channel is single handily the reason that I always sounds smart in any science class I\u2019m in lol. <b>ty</b>", "comment_date": "2019-03-08T05:18:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sunflower slime Queen", "comment_text": "Im kinda flexible :/", "comment_date": "2019-03-07T21:25:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amber Marenda", "comment_text": "Sofie dossi is on amricans got telnet right that girl WHO!

Vertebrae - 99.9% of people can&#39;t do half what Sofie does without damaging the bones of the spine - see their different shapes at different regions of the spine - different vertebrae allow for different kinds of motion - none allow for this amount of contortion.  4.  Over-stretching part 2:  An elastic body is an efficient body, allowing for easy and graceful movement.  You want to be elastic, not gangly.   5. Desensitization - many dancers and yogis love what they feel at the extremes of their range of motion - the body is sending alarms but to them it feels exciting.  They crave that feeling so they go past integration and flexibility into distortion and damage.  You want to develop subtle sensitivity to maximum power and freedom (i.e. feeling joint integrity, where forces go into structures), not lack of body awareness.   @Physics_Girl, this is seriously irresponsible.

I try to relax my mind as much as possible. As I pull on the muscle, I slowly breath a deep breath out as I let my entire body relax as much as I can. Any time I start to feel the pain again, I remind my body that it needs to be soft and not resisting. Opposite of flex. Not tight. Almost the same as when I am trying to fall asleep. Breath out... fall asleep.... As I pull the stretch, I let my mind lean into that &quot;sleepy place.&quot; <br>    An example:  Breath in deep breath, grab foot, as you pull your body low to the floor breath out, hold the stretch and slowly breath in (I usually feel the stretch pain a little more during the in breath), very slowly pull the stretch a little bit more and breath out slowly(as I breath out the pain subsides)...keep the stretch and as you breath out relax completely, breath in...<br>I try to do this until I can feel the muscle that I&#39;m working loosen up and get a little softer. I very gently pull a little more and hold there as long as I can.  usually about one minute when I am just getting back into it and then as the days go on my times get longer. <br>This method works well for me, I hope I help someone with their stretching. It&#39;s so good for us and makes our lives better and our moods better but stretching can be a little intimidating at first. But once you get through the first few times it starts to feel better. After a little while it actually starts to feel great.

So, some additional information to seek (no particular order):<br>Shallow hip socket versus deep hip socket and how that changes ROM (thigh/hip rom) between individuals. This shows how anatomy, which cannot be changed organically, effects an individual&#39;s ROM. We are all genetically different and must appreciate our gifts, and respect our limits.<br>Seek the ROM chart that physiotherapists and physical therapists use, which provides general guidelines for each joint&#39;s healthy ROM. Learn as much as you can about anything you want to achieve (not via YouTube or social media... Find another method of knowledge-gathering, and invest). <br>Lastly, learn about the amount of education required (book study and lecture hours as well as practicum hours) to even qualify to sit for a licensure exam that then allows a person to help someone increase their individual ROM, safely, and by using multiple protocols. <br><br>Stretching really is good for you, when it is performed correctly. Stretching can really harm you if it is not done properly. I encourage everyone to work with a qualified practitioner (many personal trainers take CEUs on stretching), and find a good licensed massage therapist and chiropractor.

It has caused a lot of problems in my life as well as a lot of other people&#39;s lives. I&#39;m 19 and will have chronic back pain partially caused by this disease. It&#39;s not really much to joke about and I warn people daily of the dangers of hyper extending your joints. It tears joint tissue and can cause massive swelling in the joints. One morning I woke up with knees the size of cantaloupes and I couldn&#39;t bend them at all. To make the rest of this story short, I ended up in a lower body cast to keep my legs straight and I was diagnosed with hypermobility. It is a lot of physical therapy and a lot of work to get your body to be stronger when you have hyper flexible joints. I spent years in and out of physical therapy with stacks of exercises to do to strengthen basically every muscle in my body. I did muscle stimulation therapy and tense therapy and even after all of that I will still never be able to play a contact sport without fear of hurting myself.

My advice is that warmups are far more important for activity preparation but mild stretching is still good so long as you monitor how far you&#39;re taking it.

Ligaments are what holds all our joints together- once they&#39;re overstretched (as they naturally are a bit in hypermobile people) they can&#39;t go back. That means your muscles/tendons have to work harder to hold your body together. Many people with benign hypermobility (like the contortionist) develop hypermobility spectrum disorder- meaning musculoskeletal joint pain or recurrent injury at minimum- due to their muscles/tendons overcompensating for their bendy-ness. They are more susceptible to overuse injuries like carpal tunnel. If you&#39;re hypermobile (check beighton score) please take care of yourself by strengthening your core and muscles around joints and opting for self massage as opposed to further stretching. Most people are encouraged to become more flexible, but people with hypermobility need to kind of become firmer to hold themselves together without injury or future chronic pain. About 20% of people have hypermobility, so I think it&#39;s important to educate people on how to take care of their unique bodies.", "comment_date": "2018-04-07T18:17:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danielle Perry", "comment_text": "Hot yoga is awesome for gaining flexibility.

Biomechanical researchers have raised the idea that too much flexibility might contribute to diminished running efficiency and slower times. <br>2. What about the long-term negative effects of being hypermobile/hyperflexible/having hyperlaxity? Although hypermobility is useful to many people (dancers, swimmers, pianists (finger joints), etc.) for some people there is an associated increase in things like muscle or joint pain, joint stiffness, injuries, stability problems, sense of proprioception problems, age-related increases in pain when stretching later in life, surgical recovery is more problematic and so on. <br>3. What about hamstring flexibility? The hamstring performs slightly differently to many other muscle groups in the body as in they are designed to be both long and tight.

If it becomes painful you stop &amp; change muscle Or decrease the force you are putting on your muscles and joints.

From doing yoga and being aware of anatomical function one can and will gain a body awareness of gaining functional flexibility. For instance touching one&#39;s toes or eventually touching palms to floor, start with focused breathing, bend over to a forward fold while keeping knees bent. Concentrate on the breath. Contract core muscles and focus on &quot;hinging&quot; at the hips. Fold more if possible while keeping knees bent. Attempt to contract  quadriceps. Be aware of bodily sensations. Back off from pain. Be aware of tightness in hamstrings, lower back, glute medius or glute maximus. Chances are certain muscle groups are not used to activation and other muscle groups have been carrying the load all along. Remember to breathe and engage the bandhas (you&#39;ll have to look that one up). This awareness is also a great form of meditation and stilling the mind. Leslie Kaminoff has some great insight into this. The problem with many (most) yoga instrucors is that the basic fundamentals are not explained. Regular practice will increase flexibility and allow one to understand one&#39;s body. Don&#39;t just overstretch!!!

Here&#39;s some insight in to types of stretching... I don&#39;t believe that static stretching creates the greatest increase in flexibility. I&#39;ve worked as a PT and an athletic trainer and was always taught (and I&#39;ve seen the effect in the lab) of massive flexibility gains when you use PNF stretching (proprioceptive, neuromuscular facilitation). Basically you stretch to your limit, and then contract against resistance through a full range of motion. This will inhibit the muscle spindle fibers from protecting a muscle and will allow you to gain massive flexibility gains in as little as 1-2 minutes. These gains come almost exclusively from the muscle, and some in the tendon. If you&#39;re curious about this process just google PNF Stretching and see a demonstration. The hamstring group is a great example, just because of the large amount of muscle there (you can see a really big effect). Thanks for making such high-caliber videos!
