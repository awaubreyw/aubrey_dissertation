Within the horizon the is no actual mass at all.  All that is left is the severely warped spacetime.  Recalling Einstein&#39;s mass-energy equivalence; all of the mass/energy that has crossed the horizon has been used up warping the spacetime within the black hole.  Additionally, due to the essentially infinite warping of spacetime at the central singularity the diameter/radius of the horizon as measured, again, by a remote observer is misleading.  If it were possible (which it is not) for someone to enter the black hole and cross it the distance that would actually need to be traversed would be enormous (essentially, again, infinite).

That&#39;s a common misconception. The speed of light in vacuum is NOT constant. And that&#39;s exactly what gives rise to gravity. In a gravitational field, the speed of light is lower. At the event horizon of a black hole, the speed of light is zero. That&#39;s why light can&#39;t escape.
