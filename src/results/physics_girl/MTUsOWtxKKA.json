I have asked many time a simple question that no one have answer. \u201cWhy does light have a limit on the speed in which it travels?\u201d By answering this question i think you will find the basic concepts of the laws are incorrect. The limit set through the laws of physics works but it also has led to the dead end were little but theoretical answers to larger questions can be put forward without actual proof of the theory. These theories are like playing dungeons and dragons. This role playing game is played out in a fantasy world of make believe yet to the players the fantasy is believable. The answer to why light has a speed as do other laws of physics have limit is simple. Something is controlling these limit and its not a god or other supernatural force. What sets these limit is how the universe as we know it was formed. But this formation was not a Big Bang.

So here goes my questions.  Now unless you use intelligent design as your answer How is it that the explosion from the big bang was directional instead of a traditional explosion that would have formed a sphere?  From my understanding, the only ways possible for this to have a direction would be either A:  The gravitational pull of the explosion itself was at such a rate that it pulled the explosion back towards itself in a singular  wave pattern, or the only other thing I can think of would be a force on the top and bottom of the explosion of equal and opposite force acted upon the explosion. In which that would have to be a force equal to the universe to keep the expansion at a constant. If the external force were greater the universe would collapse and if it was less than the universe would expand. so in that would that not bring one to the conclusion of a multiverse and in that a stacked multiverse where the big bang may have been created from the matter trapped between the 2 universes as the pressure that was stored reached the point in which it then overcame the external force and caused the big bang.

In fact if dark energy is a cosmological constant, our Universe will expand forever, even though it is spatially flat (i.e. at the critical density). The critical density comes from solving the Friedmann equation, which governs cosmological expansion, under the assumption that the energy density in spatial curvature is zero, meaning that contained in all the other components has to equal the total. The total energy density sets the value of the Hubble constant at present, which is an observed parameter, and so the Universe&#39;s being at critical density is just the statement that the total density of all species excluding curvature is enough to give rise to the observed present-day Hubble constant. The critical density is rho_crit = 3H_0^2/(8*Pi*G), H_0 = about 70 km/s/Mpc and G=Newton&#39;s constant. rho_crit is about 6 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.  <br><br>The question of whether it will expand forever or not hinges on the nature of dark energy, which we actually do not know with certainty. Dark energy is currently ~72% of the Universe, compared to matter (like us) at 4% and dark matter at ~24%. Note that dark matter and dark energy are totally different things; the similar names are just a coincidence, and as far as we know the two components do not inter-convert between each other. <br><br>If dark energy has equation of state (pressure/energy density) = -1, then the Universe will gradually asymptote to a perfectly exponential expansion (which is accelerated) and will continue that way forever. This is because the expansion of space will create more vacuum energy as occurs, maintaining the vacuum energy density as a constant. If dark energy has equation of state &gt;-1, the Universe will dilute the dark energy as it expands, resulting in slower expansion relative to the previous case, though still accelerated. If the equation of state is &lt;-1, then the Universe will end in a big rip.", "comment_date": "2017-08-17T07:51:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "he's the Master", "comment_text": "Space and time are related to each other and not properly explained.

These flat earthers and now flat universers are something else, yeah, I can look out and see the universe goes endlessly up, down, left, right (or north, south, east, west, whatever you prefer.) The universe is endless in every direction, and that goes for north, south, east, west and any direction of travel. Think about this folks, lets say you left earth and went a zillion zillion light years out in any direction and you hit a wall, would you say well that&#39;s the end of it all, most people would today because stupidity is rampant everywhere and nobody has any common sense whatsoever anymore and there is a reason why, it&#39;s sad actually. But think about this, you hit that wall and say that&#39;s it. How can that be? There has to be something out past that wall, that&#39;s common knowledge and common sense will tell you that, there has to be something out past that. Get a piece of paper, draw a big circle in the middle of it and say the circle is the whole universe and everything within the universe is inside of that circle. We&#39;ll call the edges or line of that circle the wall I was referring to earlier. What&#39;s wrong with this picture? There&#39;s still space outside the circle isn&#39;t there? Exactly. And even if there was a wall up (and there&#39;s not I&#39;m just using an example) but even if there was a wall up who put that wall there?!?! Exactly. You also have to think about how they say the universe is expanding, if it was expanding, the edges of our universe that&#39;s expanding (like the edges and line of the circle you drew on the piece of paper expanding outward, just look at that picture and imagine that in your mind that that circle is expanding) if they and our universe was expanding outward it would be expanding into endless infinite space. The universe is endless in every direction and certainly isn&#39;t flat. Now I want you to think about what I just said, the universe is endless and infinite in every direction, just imagine (you can&#39;t even begin to imagine) how powerful and Almighty God truly is, he has total control over all of this and God says there is no other God. Now just think, you have to stand before this Almighty God someday. All of you who have not believed in Jesus Christs death, burial and resurrection, and who haven&#39;t realized and admitted you&#39;re a sinner, confessed all of your sins to God, asked Gods forgiveness of all of your sins, and asked Jesus Christ to come into your heart to save you and live and to write your name in the lambs book of life, and ask it in Jesus Christs name, and confess him with your mouth as lord and personal savior and believe you are saved and that he has saved you (accept him as your lord and personal savior and get saved, and this is how you do that,) better do it now, tomorrow is not guaranteed and Christs return is imminent and if you die without doing that then you will be standing in front of this Almighty God lost and unbelieving and you will be sent to hell and eventually the lake of fire for eternity. If you don&#39;t get saved and the rapture happens you will be left behind lost and unbelieving, and the only way to get to heaven after the rapture during the 7 year tribulation period when satan and his demons and people run and rule this earth (basically where/how it is now but they will run it fully then) is to reject the mark of the beast and get your head cut off. I can tell you personally this is true as I died before and was sent back, me and many others like me. I know that what I say is true for a fact. Do not be deceived and listen to satan and his people and ways who want you to go with them for eternity. If you want to be saved and want to talk to someone about it I can think of no better person than an independent baptist pastor to sit down and talk with about this. As everyone in every religion knows, no one knows or reads and studies their bibles like independent baptists, and the bible they do this with is kjv, which is based solely off of the original scriptures, no other bible is. And independent baptist pastors have to go through a minimum of 4 years intense rigorous full and complete bible study where they learn the original holy scriptures, hebrew and greek that it is written in (kjv English bible is the English translation of it,) hermeneutics etc etc etc, the list goes on and on, its very rigorous and intense and covers everything and you have to know it and know it extremely well to graduate, it&#39;s actually insane and there isn&#39;t any other religion that does that at all. Most other religions if you want to be a pastor you just become one without any schooling. Don&#39;t say well catholic priests do. Catholocism is a false religion, it is satans religion as many others are, there is no salvation in it, and that&#39;s what satan likes and what it&#39;s all about, no salvation, and you&#39;re going with him because you&#39;re not truly saved. So folks please get saved and if you need to sit down and talk with someone about it sit down and talk with an independent baptist pastor, they will be more than glad to talk to you about it and show you how to be truly saved. And you will know when you&#39;re truly saved because something happens inside that is truly amazing and unexplainable, there&#39;s really no way and no words I can think of to explain it to you but you&#39;ll know and you&#39;ll have such peace you can&#39;t even begin to imagine.

Theres space outside our space if that makes sense. Think of it like we&#39;re living in a blackhole. Constantly rotating and sucking in space from another space. The only reason OUR space is expanding is because we have more matter to steal from the space outside of our own.  Magnetic pull from multiple sides of the universe cause the universe to spin so fast the universe ceases to have a shape, but it rather lays flat because of the unlimited force of spinning So rapidly..

That is not to say it will not expand forever and that it may not in fact collapse back in on itself. I do not subscribe to the big bang theory unless it is explained by a puncture in OUR space-time by a parallel universe which impacted ours. As for uniform density, I would not expect that in any natural system. And gravity being the weakest force known will not stop objects from continuing away from each other with out the friction we find on our earth. While there is interstellar friction caused by solar winds and such it is not what we would see here on earth. There is also a very complicated interaction between star systems and galaxys which tend to fling objects in all directions which will gather other objects ad infinium.
