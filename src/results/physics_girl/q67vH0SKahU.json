Red is at the lower frequency end of the visible spectrum. But how do we know there is a red shift? This seems to imply that the colors we see are shifted towards red compared to what they would be if  light-emitting objects were stationary. How do we know the light coming from faraway bodies is not just their natural color? How do we know it&#39;s shifted?  Using the train analogy, you can hear the frequency drop as the train goes by. It lowers in pitch as it starts moving away.

This terrible analogy is what I use to reason why we can (eventually) see light emitted by objects moving away from us (via expansion of the universe) faster than the speed of light.

Basically, energy is movement, and we know atoms move but the movement is so tiny we don&#39;t think we can see the effect of this movement. But really it&#39;s this tiny movement that causes light and radiation but it doesn&#39;t actually make photons. As a tiny atom moves away everything is drawn towards it and if it&#39;s pushed back everything is pushed away. And this also counts for electrons gaining and losing orbits. So the energy or the movement of two masses of atoms far away from each other can actually balance the energy between them. We think there&#39;s light photons passing through space but maybe there&#39;s not. Maybe it&#39;s just gravity or the attraction/repulsion forces between very far objects. We know we don&#39;t actually see the light but only the reflection of light off of atoms and this explains it. Now you may think that&#39;s not true because we can bend light and focus light but that requires a medium of atoms aligned in a specific way. So that can be just a chain reaction of gravitational forces. I think this partially answers the question about force at a distance or rather force at distance explains gravity and radiation. It fits so well. It also makes sense because the light doesn&#39;t lose any energy with distance. The force of gravity between the masses may decrease with distance and lower the initial intensity but it can travel (without traveling so it can transfer over) massive distances with zero loss of energy. Because the energy being transferred doesn&#39;t actually pass through space. You can&#39;t block it you can only make it affect another mass. It&#39;s like hot and cold air balancing it&#39;s energy but without any collisions so it&#39;s just gravity forces across the universe. It&#39;s just movement balancing in empty space and movement is energy. All energy is movement. It&#39;s heat it&#39;s light it&#39;s radiation it&#39;s moving atoms versus atoms stuck together in a bond. The movement seems to want to balance but there&#39;s also randomness. So the universe is like a combination of a balance system and a random system. If you look at luck and probability. You see that everything wants to balance out but it&#39;s also able to be random.

Now imagine an insect running along that rubber band. At first, while close to the hand moving away, it makes no headway and continues moving away from you. But because it&#39;s running towards a static point (earth), the movement of the rubber band gets slower and slower as it travels. Yes, makes sense. Let me clarify what I mean by a static point.

Start students in parallel lines opposite each other on different sides of a sports field. Have them run to each other and throw balls from one side to another. Slow them down as they get closer to each other. Initially it may be too far to throw a ball directly. But eventually the ball will start to roll to the other side beyond the throwing distance. The catcher will walk up to a slow or stopped ball. Again not a perfect model but demonstrates interacting with something beyond the observable field. That shows the ball will move far steer than them as they slow down and the ball retains some momentum. <br><br>Next you can discuss how things would behave without friction. What would the experiment have looked like then?

If the SOURCE of that light ceases to exist (goes off), wouldn&#39;t that mean that the light that left the source years ago would also go out, since the power source no longer exists? Or is it that the light that leaves the source that produced it is autonomous, self-sufficient and no longer needs the source to exist? If that&#39;s the case, it will be hard for me to accept.

An explosion will push all objects away from the centre of the initial force in all directions, so now we have a direction outwards we can introduce radials on the compass or a protractor. We the Earth have moved 13.8 billion years away from the bang or the force along a radial let\u2019s call this rad 090\u2019 of a compass.

We are moving away at a speed at 90\u2019 to each other, therefore as observers we are moving out the rad and away from each other and this combined ads to our speed and this brings in the statement, the universe is expanding.

Now I can tell you truthfully that I have seen QSOS at z&gt;3 in my larger telescopes:   I can see them (as they were) by the light they emitted about twelve billion years ago.   At all times, they have been receding,  along with their rest frame; within which they may be stationary or nearly so, by reason of the Mascon defined by the SMBH not likely having been kicked to any great velocity by local action, as might a star or other small body.  So If anything is &quot;moving&quot; very rapidly in its local frame,  it is me and not the Quasar.  However,  the light of the QSO HAS been strongly stretched during it&#39;s time in transit, as both rest frames have been &quot;expanded&quot; apart within space-time itself- and receded from eachother:   The light left the Quasar at a local velocity c,  at all times having a velocity c relative to the current local frame, incuding this one as it arrives here:  It can be measured to be arriving at a velocity c, requring an &quot;accelaration&quot; (actually the expanding universe literally stretching away from the source) to have arrived at al, on top of that value; not relative to us, but relative to the source. The obsevred stretching of the wavelength is the wave itself partaking of the expansion, over a vast interval of space and of time. So, the issue is that while the object that emitted that light is itself receeding at much greater than c,  we do not &quot;see&quot; the object as it is or where it is, but rather its &quot;echo&quot;.  we see the light coming from it, and which travels to our eyes at velocity c in the local frame, but stretched to over four times its actual (rest frame) wavelength!   The expansion is real,  The issue is real,  since that light left the source when the universe was far smaller than it is now:  It has expanded along with the Universe. The object we are looking at has long since receded beyond the hubble sphere and is therefore itself invisible, now and forevermore, <br>But the echo remains; every additonal photon stretched a little tiny bit more as the travel time has slowly increased, and delayed in its arrival just a little more. as well.

If both were moving at +C then the light would never leave the surface. We know an object travelling at +C doesn&#39;t emit light at 2xC because when two objects interact, we see their light at the same time. So, there is either a stationary universal point which all light is moving relative to OR physics is wrong about the motion of light.

A speed measuring device on a bridge over the river clocks the kayaker at 10 mph. 5 mph from paddling and 5 mph additional for gravity moving the water downstream at 5 mph.", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T00:08:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Toxafina", "comment_text": "Top 10 Worst Years To Be Alive in Human History - Listverse TV<br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QOjatIQULe4\">https://youtu.be/QOjatIQULe4</a>", "comment_date": "2022-02-08T19:40:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Cornejo", "comment_text": "Does that mean that the fastest speed is 2 times the speed of light (as 2 objects move away from each other without violating Relativity)?", "comment_date": "2022-02-08T15:24:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Herman Austria Palmgren", "comment_text": "But, the stuff we eventuellt will see can&#39;t be further away then the point in space were space are expanding faster then the speed of Light \u00d71.5... right?<br>Since space is expanding in all direktion, wee need to subtract halv the speed that the space itself is expanded in.

I wonder if a good analogy for the point you make about light initially moving away from us then stopping and then moving towards us (relative to us) is like having a series of treadmills with each one set to run a little bit faster the further it is away from us. If someone is running towards us on a treadmill really far away then relative to us that person would be moving away from us, but relative to the treadmill they would still be gaining some ground. As the person transitions to a closer treadmill that\u2019s moving a little bit slower, the person would appear to be stopped relative to us, and gaining a bit more ground relative to that treadmill. Eventually the person would transition to an even slower treadmill and appear to be moving towards us and of course also gaining ground on the treadmill. Ultimately, the person would be getting closer to us at an ever increasing speed because the treadmills that the person is running on are getting slower and slower. The fastest anyone could run on each individual treadmill is the universal speed limit.

I&#39;ve also noticed a kind of paradox about it that&#39;s similar to another one, wave-particle duality.<br><br>Some quantum mechanics experiments reveal that quantum entities such as photons or electrons are waves, while others reveal that they are particles.  More than a century ago, this caused a lot of controversy.  Scientists demanded that they must be either one or the other.  Nevertheless, the results of neither set of experiments could be denied.  Logic forces us to acknowledge that whatever quantum entities are, they must have aspects of both.<br><br>And a similar paradox exists about space.  Space is nothingness.  Just as time has no independent existence apart from the order of events by which we measure it, space has no objective reality except as an order or arrangement of the objects we perceive in it.  Nevertheless, space is also affected and curved by gravitational field that those material objects exert.  How can nothingness be affected by anything?<br><br>Here again logic forces us to acknowledge the nature of space despite the apparent contradiction.  The expansion of space appears linear and outward, forever, from any point as far as we can perceive it.  But that may be by appearance only, since the sum of the material content of the universe would have to exert an overall curvature of the space-time continuum back onto itself, in a great closed cosmic curve.<br><br>So not only do we see cosmic phenomena as it was in the distant past, since it takes light so long for light emitted to reach us, it seems plausible that the apparent direction from which was emitted would also be affected, that space isn&#39;t infinite, lending more credence that space is finite but unbounded.", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T15:10:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dabassmann1", "comment_text": "Multi-part question: 1.)

For nearby objects, you may be able to use the redshift or the blueshift, but if the whole visible universe has a redshift, as we can now observe it, it is possible and even very likely that our atoms are shrinking and thus the can explain redshift. When atoms shrink they emit a higher frequency and you can assume that 50% redshift then means that those atoms have a diameter twice as large as ours now, when our atoms halve, the electron shell is also halved in length and send therefore a higher frequency. That also has consequences for our clock, which then goes twice as fast and accelerates at the same time as the frequency, so the shrinking will also go faster and that also has an effect on the red shift that we can observe, it seems that we are the acceleration, with the big bang there is no explanation for that, but with shrinking atoms it does and would the shrinking atoms fit more with the observed deviations, just as well as the story of, that the space expands but the galaxies just on their remain in place, or that the big bang remnants can send their light to us in an expanding universe in 13.4 billion, try to make a step-by-step representation of that and then look critically at the big bang again, then you will see that that big bang is an idea from a hundred years ago, which now has to be replaced.<br><br>Als je denkt dat het universum aan het uitzetten is, dan heb je de roodverschuiving gebruikt en heb je niet gecontroleerd of dat wel klopt. Voor dichtbij zijnde objecten, kan je misschien wel de roodverschuiving of de blauw verschuiving gebruiken, maar als het hele zichtbare heelal een roodverschuiving heeft, zo als we die nu waar kunnen nemen, is het mogelijk en zelfs zeer aannemelijk dat onze atomen krimpen en zo de roodverschuiving kunnen verklaren. Als atomen krimpen zenden ze een hogere frequentie uit en je kan dan aannemen dat 50% roodverschuiving dan betekend, dat die atomen een 2 maal zo grootte diameter hebben als nu bij ons, als onze atomen halveren, is ook de elektronenschil in lengte gehalveerd en zenden daardoor een hogere frequentie uit. Dat heeft ook gevolgen voor ons klokje, dat dan 2 maal zo snel gaat en gelijk met de frequentie versnelt, daardoor zal ook het krimpen sneller gaan en heeft dat ook effect op de roodverschuiving die we waar kunnen nemen, het lijkt er op dat we aan het versnellen zijn, met de oerknal is daar geen verklaring te geven, maar met krimpende atomen wel en zou de krimpende atomen meer passen bij de waargenomen afwijkingen, net zo goed als het verhaal van, dat de ruimte uit zet maar de sterrenstelsels gewoon op hun plaats blijven staan, of dat de oerknal restanten hun licht in een uitdijend heelal in 13,4 miljard naar ons toe kan zenden, probeer daar mee maar eens een stapsgewijze voorstelling van te maken en kijk dan nog eens kritisch naar de oerknal, dan zul je zien dat die oerknal een idee van honderd jaar geleden is, die nu toch wel eens vervangen moet worden.", "comment_date": "2021-10-20T00:36:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Wusinich", "comment_text": "Oh to be the editor. . . seems like a wonderful job, to get to talk to a physicist all day.<br><br>Just wondering, what role does the light traveling through space play in the expansion of space?", "comment_date": "2021-10-20T00:27:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Animal World", "comment_text": "at this rate scientist are just waffling without any proof to back it .", "comment_date": "2021-10-20T00:10:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Journey With Nora", "comment_text": "None of this makes logical sense and I will explain why with a simple loop and a couple real-world examples. \r<br>It would be like Usain Bolt 32 feet in front of a turtle on a race track.

You can never complete the list.\r<br>\r<br>Assume galaxy distance is 32b LY away (her claim)\r<br>Assume each loop takes 1 year to complete (1 light year per cycle)\r<br>Assume that distance increases by a given acceleration rate (supported by hubble)\r<br>Assume that the acceleration rate also increases as distance increases (supported by hubble)\r<br>\r<br>distance = 32000000000\r<br>acceleration = 1\r<br>Do until distance = 0\r<br>acceleration = acceleration + 1\r<br>distance = distance - 1 + acceleration\r<br>Loop\r<br>\r<br>As long as acceleration &gt;= 1, distance can never = 0\r<br>\r<br>TLDR; As space increases, the amount of space required for the photons to traverse also increases. Once the increase rate exceeds the maximum speed of a photon, the photon will be moving in our direction but increasing in distance. Like being swept away by a tide even though you&#39;re swimming toward a beach. In simple terms, no matter how many times you add 1, if you keep subtracting 2, the number can never increase. You can try to add 2, but physics won&#39;t allow it. And even if you could, physics also not only allows you to subtract 3, but requires it. In the simplest terms humanly possible.... distance = distance + acceleration", "comment_date": "2021-10-20T00:08:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Perez", "comment_text": "THATS SO SICKK", "comment_date": "2021-10-20T00:06:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meet Parikh", "comment_text": "Great video, but I\u2019m still not clear here.

HOW are they getting faster and faster? This punches a universe sized hole in the expansion and contraction theory of the big bang! In order for the universe to come back together into a super singularity, NOTHING can be accelerating away from the explosion. It can ONLY be slowing down. Otherwise, the universe just spreads outwards forever and that makes the big bang a complete fantasy!<br><b>*</b><br>OK...so it&#39;s all accelerating outwards and away from everything else. This means that at some point it all used to be lots closer together and that could lead one to conclude the big bang existed. However, accelerating away from everything else means it will never collapse inwards again. The galaxies in the universe have already been accelerating outwards faster than gravity can drag them back in again. MAYBE...there was a single big bang at the beginning of the universe, but there will never be and never was more than one.<br><b>*</b><br>Nothing can supposedly exceed the speed of light. AT MOST any 2 objects will be traveling away from each other at 2X the speed of light. And of course they can only accelerate to something close to the speed of light before C limits them from accelerating further. I have to wonder where all that energy that is still accelerating them away from each other is coming from?

We of course now understand that these motions are due to the wind.  Air is something we can feel and measure.  It is tangible and has a real impact upon the world around us.

If we visualize the structure of the cosmic web and imagine space-time flowing through.  I think it is natural to conclude that space-time would not be flowing outwards in a laminar flow exclusively.  But rather that we should expect that there are areas of turbulent flow as well.

At 1 billion light years away we\u2019re looking at something 1 billion light years in the past which is now expanded or spread out even farther out at this point.

And the tree expands. Stuff on the outside of the tree like someone\u2019s initials will grow and expand and become bigger as the years go by. The same thing happens with the universe. The rate of expansion of the tree is very small because of the small amount of stuff in immediate inner ring that is nearest us and then it\u2019s larger and more vast as we go outward. I have yet to see proper math to prove and properly show the positions of stars and objects that we predict versus where are they are in the next time we look at them. If an object moves 1000 ly away it took another thousand years for it to make that progress and then move the light towards us so technically it\u2019s even more in the past so it was always moving add an expanded rate.

However isn&#39;t that earth-centric. Surely some galaxies started their trajectory from a different position relative to us and are therefore moving at a rate from the point of the big bang and not us, that is to say, the hypothetical galaxy that we can see moving isn&#39;t moving from us at all but from the point of initial expansion, it may be moving away from us relative to the angle of its trajectory alongside us with a calculable allowance for its trajectory from the centre of the universe to ours. I get that the observable universe is a fixed point from where we are at any given time but the periphery of that surely means some things will be moving expansively not away from us but a shared point of the beginning of the universe. Aren&#39;t galaxies moving directly opposite us relative to the big bang point of expansion actually moving at twice the speed attributable to them singularly? If all Galaxies move at the same rate from the expansive origin. Are they actually moving or are the debris on a wave expansion of space? Does the rate a galaxies mass influence it&#39;s movement from wherever the expansion started?

Thus it does not matter if the object has moved since the light left because it left at a fixed point in space. It then travels towards other objects minus the speed at which the distant object is moving due to expansion/trajectory etc.<br>3) Knowing this, the time it takes light to travel from 1 point in space to another would actually be further then the distance light could travel in a set amount of years. We are therefore looking into the past at objects that are no longer where they appear.<br>4)If we could travel at near lightspeed towards an object as we got closer the object would appear to move further and further away and time would appear to fast forward as we would be closer.<br>5) There are 3 points to consider not just our point of view:<br>A)Our point of reference and trajectory.<br>B)The object we are observing estimated distance and trajectory.<br>C)The speed at which space is expanding multiplied by the distance apart as the further away 2 objects appear the greater the % of expansion will continually shift the actual distance a part.<br>6) The span of a human lifetime greatly limits the distance we could travel even at near light speeds and our minds are likely to fragment long before that span of time.<br>7)We live in a 4 dimensional universe not 3 dimensional as Time is yet another distance to consider. If other dimensions can in fact be applied perhaps, theoretically we could travel via folding space itself but likely even if such a science existed and we discovered it we would likely destroy ourselves entirely before ever learning to apply it ethically.<br>8) The greatest flaw in considering humans expanding out into the galaxy is assuming humans could do it.

If something is moving towards us at FTL then we should not be able to see it before it reached us.<br>Explanation:<br>We see things because they either radiate light or light is reflected off the thing and that light reaches our eyes. Place two objects a little bit apart on the space in front of you to illustrate this yourself. One of the objects is you and the other one is flying FTL away from you. If that object is a galaxy then it properly has stars that give off light, so light having to catch up to it and reflect off the FLT-object is not necessary. Light will we sent from the FLT-object to you from that perceved position, and light will keep comming at you when that object moves directly away from you.<br>Think of breaking the sound barrier. You can&#39;t hear the shock from the front, but from the back you can. I think light works in a similar facion that there is a cone behind the object moving away that we will be able to see it, no matter its speed.<br><br>Another thing... I think our theory of time is flawed.<br>Explanation once again:<br>We best and most precise way we know of to measure time is a cesium-clock. A cesium isotope that vibrates at a specific frequency and that vibration is then counted to make up how much time has passed. Now here on earth where we experience approximately 1g that frequency will be at a certain point, but in orbit where we experience a lower g-force we get a higher frequency of vibration meaning that time flowes slower when gravity is pressent.<br>I think that observation is flawed in the time measured because of this theory of mine.<br>Example:<br>If you strike an anvil with a hammer at a set frequency, then you will have easyer striking down because of gravity and difficulty with raising the hammer to make another strike. In 0g you will only experience the force it takes to move the hammer to strike and move back.<br>I think something similar is happening with the cesium-vibration.", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T22:16:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "M.

A constant Hubble constant (heh...) would mean that the expansion would stay the same, and in that case the edge of the Hubble sphere would be exactly the same as the cosmological event horizon. Our universe however seems to be accelerating, that is, the Hubble constant is growing, and the Hubble sphere is actually shrinking.

E=mc2 only tells us that energy and matters are convertible and so if the speed of light is the limit, then fueling more energy to an object traveling at the speed of light would not increase the speed further. So the problem is in what way the additional energy will be consumed. Obviously our current thinking is that it will turn to mass but it doesn&#39;t seem that E=mc2 has suggested that it is the mass of the moving object that would increase. Perhaps there is a slight chance that the increase in mass will be in other forms such as splitting of the object or other ways which we can&#39;t even imagine. So the key is that E=mc2 only tells us the effect but it doesn&#39;t tell the mechanism.

The latter is a characteristic we are used to ascribe to an instant. In truth, we intuitively project our physical experience, which occurs locally &quot;here&quot; in both space and time, to its remote causations placed in the space-only extension, which constitutes the pre-relativistic &quot;instant&quot;. This, obviously, relies on an infinite speed of light, and fails in SR and then in GR.<br>Indeed, with SR, the &quot;instant&quot;, extended beyond &quot;here&quot;, spans the time dimension, and it is actually, for each event, the 4D volume of space-like separated events from the reference event.<br>While there are ways to set a definition of &quot;now&quot; (so that, in every event of its extension, it doesn&#39;t have a time-like extension) in GR, they are not relevant for causal relations, i.e. mechanically, and they do not represent our subjective physical perspectives, since these are about what happened in our past cones, not on spatially-separated events from us (remember how this works in our pre-relativistic intuition). In other words, these ways are conventional, but not fundamentally objective for the theory (which doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have a well defined significance).<br>As soon as the &quot;instant&quot; &quot;over there&quot; spans the time dimension, talking about what that thing &quot;over there&quot; &quot;is&quot; is somewhat misleading if it forgets to point out that it is, in fact, not about a state at a fixed time, but actually a whole evolution of the state respect to time (which &quot;now&quot; does not affect me and which &quot;now&quot; I do not affect).<br>In the sense of the &quot;now&quot; as the volume of space-like separated events from us, that galaxy that we see at 13bly from us (i.e., that we see at the local now because the light from it traveled for 13by), &quot;is&quot; actually at 13bly, as well as at 30bly, and as well as at infinite distance from us (if it is already so far that the light from us emitted now will not reach it due to the universe expansion).", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T09:08:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Albert Fuentes", "comment_text": "I wondering how her brain works lol \ud83d\ude06 \ud83e\udd14...", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T09:08:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Verret", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q67vH0SKahU&amp;t=5m37s\">5:37</a> Slide transition*<br><br>* No slide transition", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T09:05:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Esbern Torgard Kaspersen", "comment_text": "Another way of thinking of what is happening outside the Hubblesphere, is that while light has travelled 1 meter towards us, 1 meter of space has been &quot;created&quot; between us and the light.

Correct me if I\u2019m missing something. <br><br>The idea that light can travel away from us, stop, and then come toward us is only the case when viewed from our perspective (on earth). The light in question is always traveling in our direction relative to the local patch of space (the space it\u2019s currently moving through) but since space itself is moving away from us, it would appear as if that light were traveling away from us if the space around it is receding faster than the speed of light. <br><br>It\u2019s sort of like those people mover conveyor belts at the airport. Imagine earth is at one end of the conveyor belt and the surface of the belt is moving away from earth. If you tried to walk toward earth (opposite the direction of the belt), you would have to walk faster than the belt to make it back to earth. If you walked at the speed of the belt, you would stay put, and if you walked slower than the belt, the belt would win and you would move away from earth. <br><br>Now imagine the speed of the belt is greater the farther you are from earth. As you walk at a constant speed (speed of light) with the belt initially moving faster than you, you would initially be moving away from earth. Then as you moved along the belt (through space), the belt speed would decrease enough until the belt is going at the same speed as you. Now you would appear stationary relative to earth. Then as you continue, the belt speed would keep decreasing so that now you are going faster than the belt. You would now be moving toward earth, appearing to speed up until you reached the earth (at the speed of light). <br><br>This may not be a perfect analogy but it makes sense to me.

But where celestial and planetary bodies exist what was a cubic meter is now a cubic centimetre, space having been deformed and compressed by the presence of a body. \r<br>    \r<br>In order to understand the concept it is easier to first visualize this idea in two dimensions. Like a straight, horizontal line on which are placed steel ball bearings. Thus, we have a horizontal line with a few circles resting on top of it. For convenience and to aid this illustration we will refer to these circles as heavy ball bearings. If the line is elastic then it will sag from the weight of the ball bearings. The nature of this elasticity is that the line only sags locally in the vicinity of each ball bearing, but remains horizontal and straight for the remainder of its length. \r<br>    \r<br>Thus, we have a horizontal line with a series of local dips.\r<br>    \r<br>Now, slide an object along the line. This object will continue on its path, moving horizontally and nothing seems to affect it until it reaches a localized dip and it moves downward to the steel ball bearing where it comes to rest. \r<br>   \r<br>Now, consider space along this horizontal line. Imagine, this line representing space comprised of metre squares abutting each other making up the entire length of this line. Visualize this as a line one metre thick. Where the ball bearing is placed it sags, meaning that the one metre squares are squeezed together and the line in this local area now consists of one centimetre squares. The one metre thick line is reduced to one centimetre.\r<br>    \r<br>An object sliding along this line will drop down into the dip and stop.\r<br>    \r<br>Gravity is a flow. That is gravity.\r<br>   \r<br>The effects of gravity are overcome in an anti-gravity device by simulating a one cubic metre volume of space where in the dip its actual size is only one cubic centimetre. If the simulation of space is larger than a cubic metre then the object will rise, seeming effortlessly. When the simulation of space is less than a cubic metre the object will drop downwards, its rate controlled by the degree of reduction of space. Application of the same principle in front, behind or on a side enables the craft to more forward, backwards or sideways, seeming effortlessly.\r<br>\r<br>This characteristic of space may be expressed mathematically, as a differential equation.\r<br>\r<br>Given that the universe is in a state of vibration, which is sound, then it is a sound wave of particular characteristic that is required to simulate space and overcome gravity. The same principle may be employed to turn heavy solids into lightweight soft material, in which the properties of rock become those of a marshmallow. Ancient drawings depict sound tones passing from base to apex in a pair of cones tuned into resonant earth energy. The confluence of sound waves is the crystal matrix of eternity that form metre cubes.\r<br>   \r<br>Two dimensions were employed to illustrate the principle of space and gravity. In reality the process is three dimensional. Objects moving in the metre cubes that make up space flow into the dips, the one-centimetre cubes of space where celestial bodies reside. And there they stop. \r<br>   \r<br>The phenomenon that enables electromagnetic waves seem to travel pervades the universe. It is already there. That is why light, an electromagnetic wave within a narrow band of frequencies, is independent of the speed of the observer. No matter how you measure its speed it will not vary. \r<br>    \r<br>That is until you consider the makeup of space. Outside of the influence of celestial bodies the one-centimetre cubes are restored to their normal one-metre size. Time, as we measure it, then, is distorted. Travel of one centimetre becomes one metre or 100 times the distance. Using the same metre to centimetre ratio bodies that appear to be 100 light years away are only a light year away. Of course, the metre to one-centimetre illustration was employed for easy visualization of the concept. In reality the ratio might be a billion to one. Thus, a celestial body a billion light years away employing conventional measurement, in reality, is only one light year distant. \r<br>   \r<br>Gravity is a flow towards a condensation of space. Outside of this influence light travels a billion times faster and objects are a billion times closer than they appear to be.", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T01:15:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Wilson", "comment_text": "I often wondered if the Starlight we see from Telescopes like the Hubble is coming from Stars that are no longer there and if they are no longer there what is?", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T01:15:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J Alvi", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd14 So how can the distance of the object be determined, if it&#39;s measured in light years and the expansion waves are traveling faster than observable light?", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T01:13:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fr33land", "comment_text": "Is space an object?
