There are lakes that have a similar gas effect when tectonics and the water levels evaporate enough. They&#39;ve been known to kill off entire towns without warning due to the nature of gas like co2. This is interesting because unlike the lakes it&#39;s moving, suggesting gas can form currents underground. You know how they say in the Bible as it is above so it is below. What if our wind and sky river system/currents are similar to the gas reaction underground because of the nature of geological currents.

If the source is some distance away, and the relief of the gas is the path of least resistance deep underground via a highly permeable layer or some horizontal&#39;ish linear void, it would explain why it&#39;s moving.  Maybe it did not move initially because the overburden around where it initially appeared was highly impermeable and took a long time to erode, but now it&#39;s moving as the overburden is more erodible as it tries to find equilibrium, likely when its vertically over the source.  It&#39;s interesting the bubbling does not occur along the path where it came from, only where it is, which seems to further support the angle theory.

A possible explanation to this increase in velocity could be reduction in the cross-sectional area of the fluid channel below the ground surface due to insertion of the sheet pile, considering the fact that width of that channel is not very large in comparison to the longer dimension of the sheet pile wall. So, there might be a base of this fluid channel underground. Moreover, if it is really a channel, there must be a source of this mud water and, hence, the water could be diverted somehow.

You have a gas pocket that is being fed upwards. This gas along with a massive amount of water keeps the ground wet and moving at all times. The erosion that happens allows it to move. Before the quake the gas rate at which it feed the mud hole was more than likely stable which contained the hole to a small area. Once the quake hit it more than likely cracked more areas open which increased the flow rate at which the gas escaped and cause much faster erosion. The water is either from underground areas that get mixed in when it comes across it which is why the hole gets larger and smaller.  The best option at this point yet would cost more than its worth. Is to drill a few thousand holes anywhere between 100 and 5000 feet looking for the source of the gas. When a hole is found vent it as fast as you can which should lower the overall pressure and flow rate to the hole and either stop it or drastically slow it. Examples of this type of movement and or destruction can be seen in places where there used to be landfills that have been covered over. They solved many of these problems by venting the entire area which relieved the pressure.  Also I am not so sure this is a huge problem because anyone with even the slightest brains can see that this is a gas and water erosion problem .", "comment_date": "2021-06-17T06:39:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gamesensay", "comment_text": "You can&#39;t stop mudder nature.", "comment_date": "2021-06-17T01:55:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Johansen", "comment_text": "Simple. <br>Just pump the hole dry!", "comment_date": "2021-06-17T01:50:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrTweetyhack", "comment_text": "&quot;I&#39;m sourced over here so it wants to go back&quot; NO", "comment_date": "2021-06-17T01:26:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Pinecone", "comment_text": "The next blockbuster geological disaster flick:<br><br>            PUDDLE!", "comment_date": "2021-06-17T00:43:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "_Equinquinox", "comment_text": "I&#39;m gonna pop it", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T23:58:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Lee", "comment_text": "Put the road where the mud has already been and let it go on its way.", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T23:40:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kerry krishna", "comment_text": "Subscribed .

My theory, since they lined the canal and closed the z drain and no more fresh water is getting to the salton sea, either directly or through seepeage, the carbon is building up and not able to travel as easily or be as diluted as before. The ground underneath has dried and  perhaps thats why theres such a concentration of it or as you say a pocket. The change in the sea I believe has something to do with it. In case you didnt know, there are several geothermal plants nearby... Another outlet for pressure..so.... Earthquakes??? Been having those since forever. That is something that hasnt changed so I don&#39;t think it has to do with that..

The tectonic plates above this high pressure pocket of gas are shifting  causing what looks like the mud puddle moving but in fact is the earth crust shifting.  It may not be detectable by typical surveying methods as the earth&#39;s magnetic field is also altering as these plates shift.  There really isn&#39;t a good way to counteract this phenomenon but you can attempt to anticipate it&#39;s movement and provide an open channel to relieve pressure perhaps a few years in advance prior to the pressure&#39;s main throat reaching that area of the crust.  This pressure relief channel would have to be somewhat sizable; think along the lines of a typical sheet pile system for a bridge pier foundation for the golden gate bridge but deeper.  It&#39;s interesting to note that there doesn&#39;t seem to be much water release from this mud puddle; it&#39;s movement is more from the continuous carving of the crust due to the extremely high pressure.  Kind of reminds me of a water jet cutting machine on a grander scale where the earth&#39;s crust is the medium we are cutting through.  My only question would be if you are able to somehow relieve this pressure which is undoubtedly created by the weight of the earth above, would you create an even bigger problem? What would the impact be of this large amount of carbon dioxide release on our atmosphere? How would the earth&#39;s crust behave above a no longer pressurized void between the earth&#39;s crust and most likely the mantle?  Could Earth&#39;s atmosphere become similar to Mar&#39;s if this large level of CO2 is no longer contained within the Earth&#39;s lithosphere?", "comment_date": "2021-05-15T21:06:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R", "comment_text": "Just move the road a little bit.

The gas is mixing with the soil and severely lowering its internal viscosity. Like the Leidenfrost effect, but at room temperature. The long metal bulwark won&#39;t work because as compared to the gas, it has a huge difference in density. Metal also transfers heat extremely well, so it could easily transfer the heat from one side of the bulwark to the other side, heating the sand, and continuing the movement of the mud puddle. Also, how deep is the gas bubbling up from? The puddle seems to meet obstacles by seeing how rigid it is, meeting some resistance, and then off-shooting to avoid the rigid thing. Think of simple vector mechanics here. Picture an isosceles triangle sunken into the ground with its tallest side pointing downwards. Imagine yourself along the two sides facing downwards at various points. At the apex of these two sides is where the hardest ability to move straight-up will be. Along the sides will be theSince the puddle seems to be moving along in a line, it seems this line, of whatever it is, is helping to direct the puddle forward. So, my proposal for fixing this is to create a lower density at the top, so that it wants to find relief only in this less dense spot and so remains there. The gases are noxious and may be flammable. So, when the spot is remained fixed, a building could be built around the spot and the gases collected to either move a fan for energy production, or the gases burned for combustion energy production.", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T06:47:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "viscountalpha", "comment_text": "What if magma starts coming out?

The solution?  Drill the other side of the track or freeway in line with the direction it&#39;s moving.  This would relieve the pressure on the farside.  The risks: it could develop potential for a bigger sink hole below the track as the branches could converge into one. Potential solution; drill holes along the same track and equidistant points, relieving the pressure and allowing for the potential to measure the pressure (and pressure differences) at the holes and give the ability to calculate the source.  The other risk being, as it would be very difficult to know how deep this thing is, it would be tough to measure the cost of the drilling and how far they would need to go down and therefore hard to obtain contractors, cost estimates and weigh that against the possibilty of it being a successful solution.

When light travels through space, as it pass by or goes around massive objects , the light waves are stretched and red shift occurs. <br>This scientific experiment is not reliable using light over vast distances. Light that is leaving a massive galaxy may already be stretched by Gravity pulling at it from back into the galaxy. There are other unsean forces in the universe that could be responsible for the red shift. Like gravitational waves, OR maybe massive fields of electricity or other types of energy. <br>We just don&#39;t know. <br>Hubble was a smart man who came up with a good idea to determine whether or not our universe is expanding. Maybe the motion of the universe is like a current in the ocean. <br>Maybe it rises and falls like the tide. Of course there is no way to tell what is happening in far away space right now. Because all of the light we see originated from different times and traveled a different path to get here. Scientists want to know the answers. And believing that it is possible to know the answers is a step in the right direction. But part of conducting a scientific experiment is knowing all of the variables. We are so small in the big picture. I believe that Scientists assume too much. Especially about space and objects in space. Even about physics and fundamental particles. I have heard the theory that all matter in the universe is created by the same kind of particle<br>Just with different spin. This sounds crazy to me. I don&#39;t believe that we have begun to fill out Periodic Table.  To believe that everything in the universe is created with one particle is ridiculous. How is that even provable?<br>We don&#39;t even know what is in the center of our sun or earth. How are we supposed to conduct an experiment on this theory  ?  I believe in good science. Like sea level rise and climate change. I believe that some theories such as evolution, got some things right, but tried to make everything fit into one thing.  I believe that Darwin is right that we have evolution. But he was wrong to believe that there is only natural selection that drives evolution. There are other forces at work besides natural selection. Darwin got a lot of things right. But his theory is incomplete. There is are still too many evolutionary differences that can&#39;t be explained away by natural selection alone. At least they still call evolution a theory. I think it is a fact that everything is evolving. I think science is very limited in comprehending other types of intelligence and conciousness that don&#39;t resemble our own.
