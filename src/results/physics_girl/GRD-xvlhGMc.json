That&#39;s not generally the case. They are telling you to avoid specific chemicals that might be found in sunscreens whether they are Chemical or Physical sunscreens. There are a great many chemicals out there that have been used in sunscreens, Some chemicals are harmful to humans, some are harmful to marine species, some don&#39;t absorb UV rays that well, some wear off too soon, some turn into free radicals which cause cancer,. Hawai&#39;i just banned certain chemicals in sunscreen because they were causing the coral around the Hawai&#39;ian island to bleach which can lead to the early death of the coral. Here&#39;s the crux. The government allows companies to make and sell any product that doesn&#39;t outright kill people. If it shortens lives, that&#39;s ok, until it&#39;s not okay, but the people who were using those toxic sunscreens have already suffered possibly irreparable harm. So, you really should do some research on the chemicals that were and are used in sunscreens. See which ones should be avoided. I looked up just the first chemical listed on the page that you showed in your video, &quot;Does Your Sunscreen Contain Toxic Chemicals&quot;. The chemical Avobenzone breaks down into free radicals after just an hour and is no longer protective. Also, those free radicals can be absorbed into your system and cause cancer. That chemical or the free radicals are also toxic to marine life such as dolphins. Who doesn&#39;t want to protect dolphins? So you should avoid sunscreens that have that chemical (and all the others in that list) in their ingredients. People who say to avoid chemical sunscreens are concerned because those sunscreens and all their chemicals are absorbed into your body only to be caught and kept by your liver. Physical sunscreens get absorbed at a much lower rate, and possibly not at all.

So it is going to appear as if there is little difference between them. However, if your in the sun all day, 2% of UV rays get through with the SPF 50 sunscreen versus just 1% of UV rays with the 100 SPF. And over 8 hours, that could be a lot! Even when reapplying at least every two hours. A better way to think of it is by how long you can stay in the sun without reddening. The higher the SPF, the less UV rays get through, and the longer you can stay out before reddening. Remember, lighter skin reddens more easily than darker skin. Notes: No sunscreen blocks 100% of UV rays and sunscreen starts to wear off after 2 hours so reapply at least that frequently. 2) The reason for the Chemical and Physical distinctions is as you mentioned. The Chemical sunscreens are absorbed into the body, ie. all those chemicals are absorbed and the liver has to filter (collect) all those (unwanted) chemicals. The Physical sunscreens don&#39;t get absorbed but rather lay on the skin thereby forming a barrier between the UV rays and the skin, so very little (if any) of those chemicals actually get absorbed into bodies and livers don&#39;t have to filter out all of those chemicals.", "comment_date": "2022-04-28T01:41:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Simko", "comment_text": "This video is clearly just a sneaky way for white people to do blackface without being canceled.", "comment_date": "2022-04-28T01:34:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Bagley", "comment_text": "Eeeewww, take your damn flip-flops off before putting your feet on the furniture! \ud83d\ude1b", "comment_date": "2022-04-28T00:53:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tommy Mairo", "comment_text": "But wait, if I don&#39;t go outside during the daytime, do I need sunscreen?", "comment_date": "2022-04-28T00:09:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tommy Mairo", "comment_text": "Any updates in ingredients safety after 3 years?", "comment_date": "2022-04-28T00:07:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dave N", "comment_text": "Did anyone else click on this because they thought it was &quot;SUNSCREEN in UK&quot; and thought, &quot;they don&#39;t wear sunscreen over there, do they? too rainy, right?&quot; No?

SPF is a measure of duration (indirectly). SPF 100 doesn&#39;t protect against instantaneous sun exposure much better that 50 SPF, if at all, but it can do it longer. This is pretty clear just by reading the FDA&#39;s website on SPF. If you compared 50 to 100 SPF (all else equal) over a period of 15 minutes, protection is close to identical, but over 6 hours the 100 SPF outperforms because it can absorb more total solar energy. This seems logical, as the sun only produces so much energy - once you cross the threshold of how much energy is incoming, you can&#39;t get much better protection. That said, the protection/duration is not doubled, as the value is exponential. Typical SPF tests last 4, 6, or 8 hours, and measure how much UVB is not blocked. QyetOne summarized this below, but here it is again. <br>SPF 4 = 1/4 or 25% of the radiation is not blocked (absorbed/reflected)\r<br>SPF 8 = 1/8 or 12.5%\r<br>SPF 15 = 1/15 or 6.7%\r<br>SPF 30 = 1/30 or 3.3%\r<br>SPF 50 = 1/50 or 2%\r<br>SPF 100 = 1/100 or 1%\r<br>SPF 150 = 1/150 or 0.67%<br>So the incremental benefit of higher and higher SPFs decreases. Of course, once you get above 50 or so, correct use and personal characteristics are probably more important than the SPF (coverage, reapplication time, skin type, sun intensity, etc.) for most people.<br><br>Also, FDA is the Food and Drug Administration, not the Federal Drug Administration.", "comment_date": "2021-09-15T15:33:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kim M", "comment_text": "*FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION<br>I can&#39;t believe you haven&#39;t fixed that in 3 years.

It&#39;s just descriptive of how the sunscreen works. When in the video they say that these types of sunscreens &quot;absorb&quot; the UV light, what they really mean is that the UV light induces a chemical reaction within those chemicals, where they are broken down into smaller molecules. By giving energy to the chemical reaction, the light becomes less dangerous, and its frequency shifts down so that it is mostly heat rather than penetrating rays. And this is why they say you have to reapply the sunscreen every few hours: the chemicals get consumed as they work. They also get consumed if the sunscreen in left in a hot location, so it&#39;s best to not leave your tube of sunscreen out in the sun when you&#39;re at the beach. The mineral sunscreen, on the other hand, are physical barriers that are placed between the light and the skin. No chemical reaction takes place (or only a tiny one). The light simply bounces off it. This is also why you can generally see mineral sunscreens on people&#39;s skin. It&#39;s an actual physical barrier. But they also make tinted varieties that are less noticable.<br><br>Both chemical and mineral sunscreen contain chemicals that are potentially toxic to some degree. The chemical sunscreens we use in the US are banned in Europe and vice versa. (But this might also just be protectionism because the chemicals in European sunscreens are produced by European companies, and the US sunscreens&#39; are made by US companies). However, the molecules in mineral sunscreens are orders of magnitude larger than those in chemical sunscreens, and the latter get broken down into even smaller ones. So the chemicals in chemical sunscreens are much more likely to make it into your bloodstream than those from mineral sunscreens.<br><br>Regarding effectiveness, my understanding is that the chemical ones tend to work somewhat better, although they need to be continuously reapplied because the UV light is constantly breaking them down. With mineral sunscreens you also have to make sure that they have BOTH zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in them, as the two minerals are effective against different light wavelengths. My personal sunscreen strategy is to use a mineral sunscreen as my every day walking about sunscreen. I mix an untinted and tinted so that it matches my skin color. If I&#39;ll have a long sun exposure, then I have a sunscreen that is primarily mineral but also contains some of the chemicals.

Yes that is what causes skin aging, winkles, DNA damage which increases risk for SKIN CANCER!<br>SO WHAT CAN WE DO?<br>Limit prolonged direct sun exposure.<br>Yes high SPF reduces risk for SUNBURNS, VERY IMPORTANT.  The more Sunburns you get the greater your risk for skin cancer.<br>Contact if you would like to discuss this further or any medically related topics.  <br>ajbdo1959@<a href=\"http://comcast.net/\">comcast.net</a>.", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T05:21:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sanchi Singh", "comment_text": "The &#39;chemicals&#39; part actually means to refer to &#39;unnatural&#39; compounds.", "comment_date": "2020-09-16T04:33:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Renzokuken", "comment_text": "SPF only indicates UVB protection efficacy.

SPF 50 should provide 50 times your skin&#39;s natural protection against the sun, so that 50 minutes wearing it is equivalent to 1 minute unprotected.

Or, would the sound be<br>diminished at each progressive pair of cords (2 is quieter than 1, 3 quieter<br>than 2)? The other part of the question is similar, would the second and third<br>pair of vocal cords be limited in the range of sounds they could produce, as<br>related to the frequency being produced by the first pair?

The Titanium Dioxide is what will reflect the UVB rays and the shorter UVA rays, where the Zinc Oxide reflects the longer  UVA wavelengths better. I did my research and use sunscreen quite often.

SPF is the hour exposure equivalent. So 30 SPF allows you to be exposed for 30 hours, while receiving the exposure of 1 unprotected hour. Understanding this, there are a variety of questions that come into play. 1. What is your body&#39;s ability to  handle and repair exposure damage. 2) Can higher levels of exposure be beneficial? For 1, there is a threshold of repair and replacement that the body can handle with no adverse effects. For 2, they answer is yes. People living in Denver which have higher background radiation levels actually have lower cancer risk because the cellular repair mechanisms are more activated. To be in a zero-exposure environment would lead to the shutdown of the mechanisms and mutations would become prolific. So, my own reasoning is this: Use a SPF which is rated for how may hours I can handle before burning. I estimate 1 hour, (less in spring and more going into fall). So if I will be out for 8 hours, I use SPF 8. I get no more damage than by body can handle, and I develop a tan (natural protection) which is usable even when not wearing sun screen. <br><br>I think a lot of the controversy comes from people not understanding what SPF means. I&#39;ve been pitched sunscreens that don&#39;t cause cancer, and I believe them on a compositional basis. However the USE of that same sunscreen may. There is actual statistically significant* (*formal definition) evidence that people who use sunscreen have HIGHER risk even though they don&#39;t burn. My take on it is this: think about it this way: if you use sunscreen as a block, you never let your body develop it&#39;s own protection. Any time you are not wearing sunscreen you&#39;re in a more vulnerable state, letting those photons damage DNA. However if you use sunscreen to develop your tan, providing natural protection, you expose your self to less &quot;chemicals&quot; and reduce your need for such chemicals. <br><br>Finally, do wear &quot;appropriate&quot; sunscreen but <b>always</b> make sure your glasses and sunglasses are UV rated.

It&#39;s not about your opinions of &quot;diminishing returns&quot;. Replicate the experiment, conduct your own study, or identify some flaw in the study to show otherwise.

After exposure, 40.7% of the participants (81 of 199) exhibited increased erythema scores (by \u22651) on the SPF 50+ protected side as compared with 13.6% (27 of 199) on the SPF 100+ protected side&quot;  (Williams et al., 2018). <br><br>The reasons for choosing &quot;physical&quot; over &quot;chemical&quot; sunscreens extend beyond fears of toxicity (and it probably would have been better to have cleared that up and maybe even referenced your own citation (Hayden et al., 2005) as a positive sign instead leaving doubt lingering in the air before inexplicably concluding that at the end of the day we should wear sunscreen).  People need to know if the pros outweigh the cons and the nature of the cons besides rumored concerns.  Chemical (organic) sunscreens convert UV light to heat which comes with a host of issues that are related to skin temperature (darkening/melasma, increased flushing of skin for those with rosacea-prone skin).

Second comment is the way the UV camera works, and its lack of fidelity. A color camera sees a wide spectrum of light, i.e. colors, yet the UV camera seems to see in B&amp;W with no fidelity of color. Is this camera wide spectrum capable, or single frequency only? I know If you had a camera that could see only red light as another example, it too would show a rather flat, low fidelity image as it is only sensitive to red light which will look odd to us.. so is there any kind spectrum range of the UV camera or very narrow? Seems our eyes are more remarkable than a UV camera with greater frequency, or color range of visual sensitivity.

Here&#39;s what he had to say about this in the Feynman Lectures on Physics:<br><br>&quot;The science which is perhaps the most deeply affected by physics is chemistry. Historically, the early days of chemistry dealt almost entirely with what we now call inorganic chemistry, the chemistry of substances which are not associated with living things. Considerable analysis was required to discover the existence of the many elements and their relationships\u2014how they make the various relatively simple compounds found in rocks, earth, etc. This early chemistry was very important for physics. The interaction between the two sciences was very great because the theory of atoms was substantiated to a large extent by experiments in chemistry. The theory of chemistry, i.e., of the reactions themselves, was summarized to a large extent in the periodic chart of Mendeleev, which brings out many strange relationships among the various elements, and it was the collection of rules as to which substance is combined with which, and how, that constituted inorganic chemistry. All these rules were ultimately explained in principle by quantum mechanics, so that theoretical chemistry is in fact physics. On the other hand, it must be emphasized that this explanation is in principle. We have already discussed the difference between knowing the rules of the game of chess, and being able to play. So it is that we may know the rules, but we cannot play very well. It turns out to be very difficult to predict precisely what will happen in a given chemical reaction; nevertheless, the deepest part of theoretical chemistry must end up in quantum mechanics.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There is also a branch of physics and chemistry which was developed by both sciences together, and which is extremely important. This is the method of statistics applied in a situation in which there are mechanical laws, which is aptly called statistical mechanics. In any chemical situation a large number of atoms are involved, and we have seen that the atoms are all jiggling around in a very random and complicated way. If we could analyze each collision, and be able to follow in detail the motion of each molecule, we might hope to figure out what would happen, but the many numbers needed to keep track of all these molecules exceeds so enormously the capacity of any computer, and certainly the capacity of the mind, that it was important to develop a method for dealing with such complicated situations. Statistical mechanics, then, is the science of the phenomena of heat, or thermodynamics. Inorganic chemistry is, as a science, now reduced essentially to what are called physical chemistry and quantum chemistry; physical chemistry to study the rates at which reactions occur and what is happening in detail (How do the molecules hit? Which pieces fly off first?, etc.), and quantum chemistry to help us understand what happens in terms of the physical laws.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The other branch of chemistry is organic chemistry, the chemistry of the substances which are associated with living things. For a time it was believed that the substances which are associated with living things were so marvelous that they could not be made by hand, from inorganic materials. This is not at all true\u2014they are just the same as the substances made in inorganic chemistry, but more complicated arrangements of atoms are involved. Organic chemistry obviously has a very close relationship to the biology which supplies its substances, and to industry, and furthermore, much physical chemistry and quantum mechanics can be applied to organic as well as to inorganic compounds. However, the main problems of organic chemistry are not in these aspects, but rather in the analysis and synthesis of the substances which are formed in biological systems, in living things. This leads imperceptibly, in steps, toward biochemistry, and then into biology itself, or molecular biology.&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-07-21T23:13:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis C.

Reflection is about scattering which is relatively broad spectrum depending only on the micro-structure. Red paint doesn&#39;t selectively reflect red. It reflects white and absorbs green and blue, and these effects combine a few manometers into the surface to give the impression of reflecting red. We&#39;re used to surfaces that appear to have a precise reflection spectrum in this way.

One of several things will happen:<br>a) Bob gets reflected in the same angle he came. That&#39;s (specular) reflection. Think &quot;mirror&quot;.<br>b) Bob gets reflected in a random angle. That&#39;s diffuse reflection or scattering. Think &quot;matte white surface&quot;.<br>c) Bob passes through without being scattered, following the law of refraction. This is called transparency. Think &quot;glass&quot;.<br>d) Bob passes through in a random direction. this is called translucency. Think &quot;translucent screen&quot;.<br>e) Bob is absorbed and lives on as heat (which is ultimately radiated away), This is called absorption. Think &quot;matte black surface&quot;.<br>e&#39;)  Bob is absorbed and lives on as some other kind of energy, (maybe chemical), This is also called absorption. Think &quot;leaf&quot;.<br><br>So, a surface appearing &quot;like metallic black paint&quot; on the uv camera is reflecting (a) more and diffusing (b) less uv photons. As earthlings aren&#39;t capable of photosynthesis, I think most radiation absorbed by the sunscreen will transform into heat (e),  so it would be interesting to visualize the IR radiation as well, in order to estimate the amount passing through (c and d).<br><br>P.S.: When I say &quot;One of several things will happen&quot; I deliberately ignore the possibility of quantum superposition of several things happening simultaneously to Bob.
