But only if you had a department that cared more about teaching than chasing ever dwindling amounts of research money.<br><br>And, just to let you know, if you&#39;re thinking graduate school is what you should do, I would suggest that you wander over to a public uni, because there are far more of them than prestigious private ones. Find out the % of current faculty that are adjunct, assistant, associate and full professor. See if any of the bastards who run the joint will tell you of their current Tenure Track faculty openings. Find out what happens to your research in case your denied tenure, i.e., fired, and if any of it belongs to you. Ask what their current policy is regarding the curriculum that you set up, you know, all the work that you put into creating the notes, tests, annotations, all of the things required to actually teach the god damn subject. Then make sure that you know the unemployment policies in the state which you have taken on the post doc serfdom that you decided was the way to spend about 5-8 years of the most highly productive period of your life.
