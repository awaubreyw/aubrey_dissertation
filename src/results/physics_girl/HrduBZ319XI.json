At first I thought there must be an air leak in the water supply to the pump.  However when the pump was stopped, there was no water leaking, so I reasoned that it was unlikely that I had an air leak.  Then I had another idea, which I believe is the correct answer to the question of where the air bubbles were coming from.  The water behind the impeller blades in the pump is at a much lower pressure and is actually boiling at far less than the 120 degrees Fahrenheit that people often think water boils at.  When I told this to my boss, he looked at me like I was crazy because &quot;everyone knows the water is no where near hot enough to boil&quot; and I became quickly stifled.

The act of striking any partical changes its position or momentum. Hence it cannon be calculated accurately. Minimum error is h/(2pi). But since to gravitational waves we do not need to change any property of a particle. The detectors should be very very precise if we are to calculate for very minute particles. We may need incredibly large space like the Supervoid (CMB cold spot). Who knows that supervoid might have been created by some advanced alien civilization. Theoritically, we can cirumvent uncertainty principle.

People are saying with confidence that they came from rapidly spinning black holes 1.3 billion light years away. Surely this is just an example of something it could be. Even if there were irrefutable evidence of rotating black holes 1.3 billion light years away, who is to say that was the source? You can&#39;t even tell the direction the waves are coming from with just two detectors, as you need three for triangulation.

How long did it take the black holes to collide and merge from the moment they first detected it? How many black holes are out there doing the same thing? Can we use LIGO to detect black holes in the economy? Two previous detections of GW took place before but both were proven wrong, who&#39;s to say this any different?
