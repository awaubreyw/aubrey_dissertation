I wonder what would happen if we let the milk sit for a while then tried again? I&#39;ll keep updating as I dig into this!

Example from real life, when traveling on a four lane expressway, when a car going 55mph is being passed by a car going 65mph, the closer the faster car gets, the faster it seems to be moving relative to the slower car. Possibly because you are halving the distance at twice the speed, exponentially.
