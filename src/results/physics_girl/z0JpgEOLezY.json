This corresponds to an apparent potential of Utotal = U gravitational + Ucentrifugal = m * [g * (z - Zref) - (1/2) * omega^2 * r^2]. The floating ball will follow Archimedes Law in this apparent potential, staying at the surface, while also dropping to the stable floating body energy minimum at the r=0 centre; this is where equipotential spacing is sparsest and vector force magnitude finds its minimum. Archimedes also says the lowest point on the floating ball is below the water level; we only need to ramp up rotational frequency until respective low point touches bottom.", "comment_date": "2022-07-14T00:03:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amirthavarshan Ramesh", "comment_text": "blow a wind to that ball", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T02:22:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "10P WU", "comment_text": "of course,the king  dropped in the 25 Celsius water will hit the bottom first,because water is less dense when its hot,because the atoms are faster.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T04:55:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyg", "comment_text": "Swirl the water making a vortex until the ball is down to the bottom.", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T07:29:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vasilii Popov", "comment_text": "The polyndrome one doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re used to 24 hrs format, cuz is write it as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0JpgEOLezY&amp;t=09m59s\">09:59</a>", "comment_date": "2021-12-05T18:48:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Melody Mathilde", "comment_text": "The palindrome was the easiest one I got it right away.

I can only imagine this has been addressed in the several years since you posted this one, but I didn&#39;t see it in the few comments I perused.<br><br>I call bs on the first riddle. Your question was which king would sink faster in water that was 25\u00b0f vs 25\u00b0c. It&#39;s supposed to be a trick question but the trick is invalid. 25\u00b0f WATER is not ice. Water is the common name for the liquid state of H\u00b2O. (I can&#39;t sub text the &quot;2&quot;.) Ice is the common name of the solid form of the same molecule. Steam, the common name for its gaseous state. Ice, water and steam are NOT the same and therefore, you can&#39;t substitute one for the other to trick someone in this riddle. <br><br>On top of that, it&#39;s relatively simple to produce water that is 25\u00b0f. Simply place it under pressure and the molecule can stay liquid at lower temperature than the accepted, 32\u00b0f freezing point of water. <br><br>I expect a physics expert to know these things and employ rigid adherence to basic definitions and simple physical properties of matter. \ud83d\ude09<br><br>And as a sound engineer for over thirty years, the sound cancellation riddle is a well known property of sound. In the analog world we could almost accomplish full cancellation in studio equipment. With the advent of digital sound, it was one of the first tricks we played with because reversing phase on one of two identical tracks could demonstrate complete cancellation. Each track has it&#39;s own level meter. Both tracks show plenty of level, but the output channels of the virtual console show nothing sure to the cancellation. (And, consequently, no sound is heard from the monitor speakers. Cue up either track on its own and the sound can be heard, but together it&#39;s a lot of power that adds up to silence. I can demonstrate it physically, using only my hands, but it&#39;s hard to describe in words.

Having never used the Fahrenheit system, I did over think the first riddle. As liquids expand (mostly) when heated, I was thinking the warmer liquid would be less dense and therefore provide less buoyant force and allow it to sink quicker. I think it might also have reduced viscosity and therefore provide less drag as the objects sink. But then I thought about the objects being used, and as chess pieces are typically wood or plastic, I think they would float on the liquid water and therefore neither touches the bottom. <br>For the last riddle, creating a fast enough vortex would of course allow it to touch the bottom. My boys love putting ping pong balls in the bath when draining it. They also do it with a golf ball which provides its own unique bit of physics that you may find interesting. <br>Another method would be to use an upside down jar or glass to push the water level down and take the ball with it. There are problems though with how the trapped air will compress with depth and may not allow the ball to actually touch the bottom. Also capillary action would cause the meniscus to rise at the glass and the ball would slide to the sides if given enough time. <br>Regards,<br>Tim", "comment_date": "2018-08-16T10:53:54Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "shivaraj p", "comment_text": "keep bowl on stove and boil off the water", "comment_date": "2018-08-16T10:48:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kedrak 1", "comment_text": "Well I&#39;ve read the swirling answer and it is probably the answer the question is aiming at.

A long round-a-bout way of saying it would at least hit the bottom of the 25 degrees celsius bucket first, if it hit the fahrenheit at all, which it wouldn&#39;t as all water at -3.888C (this was Googled) would be solid ice.<br><br>(2) The clock puzzle<br>24 hr clock - 00.00 <br>12 hr clock - 01.10 or 11.11 if they&#39;re like one of mine where it&#39;s displayed 1.10<br>Secondary thoughts; 00.00 to 00.00 is 24 hours.<br>Tertiary thoughts; Previous thoughts are somewhat rubbish, it&#39;s between 2 separate times, 24hr, 00.00 to 01.10 is 1 hour 10 minutes.

Put the bowl of water in freezer. When it is frozen, start scratching the ice from underneath the ball in the center and putting to the ice crums to the sides without touching the ball, ball will keep falling the dug out cavity, yea u will have to keep some ice under the ball intact until the end so u don\u2019t touch it.<br>3. Take a piece of PVC pipe wider than the ball and taller than the surface of water from the bottom of the bowel. Put the PVC pipe vertically around the ball, then pump out the water from within the pipe to surroundings of the pipe within the bowel, basically you are transferring water from the center to the surroundings until the ball touches down within empties out central pipe area.<br>4. Put a really long cylinder with same circumference as the water bowel (one end open, other one closed) upside down and seal it on top of bowel, then heat up the water until it turns to steam, ball will fall to the bottom because it is lighter than steam, then cool down water instantly to below zero, water will come to bowel as ice without letting ball float up lol (this one is a bit hard)<br>5.

Since the bowl is closed, it won&#39;t technically leave the bowl, but I guess this is not valid.<br>3. Close the bowl. Shake it.<br>4. Get some gas with higher density than the water. With a hollow cylinder, guide the gas to stay only within a certain volume containing the ball. Let the water overflow until there&#39;s only the ball and the gas in there. I&#39;m not sure if this would be considered touching the ball through the gas.<br>5. I suppose the ball (considering it&#39;s a Snatom) would be affected by magnets or magnetic fields. With this, it could be forced to the bottom of the bowl.<br>6. With a hose, force air from the bottom of the bowl. If the bubbles are sparse and big enough, they should lower the ball similarly to how the whirlpool does.<br>7. Call Dumbledore.
