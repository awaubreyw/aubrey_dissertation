A thought experiment I imagined utilises a device which uses an atom as the harmonic oscillator. Send the atom within a closed vacuum detecting the frequency it rebounds off each of 6 walls in a cube. It will begin at a fixed speed at an arbitrarily set space as close as possible to zero movement. The pattern of how the atom bounces should have a distinguishable form. Then as the ship accelerates the atom will take a longer time to bounce between the forward wall and the wall to the rear relative to acceleration. Why? Because the faster the acceleration the more spacetime fabric the atom has to move through to reach the front wall so the timing will appear to slow and of course conversely the bounce back will accellerate. This is because the speed of energy/light is constant in a vacuum relative to an object so the atom being energy/&quot;encapsulated light&quot; will travel through the spacetime fabric at a fixed speed regardless of the speed of the spaceship. As the spaceship approaches the natural speed of the atom it will appear that the atom slows down and would theoretically stop if the spaceship reached the speed of the atom. There we have it a speedometer for a spaceship. Finding the particle most stable would be the only minor problem to overcome, a particle without an electron would be ideal but perhaps not as big a problem as I first thought if there was an electron or electrons in the shell. A hydrogen atom maybe??<br><br>Physics becomes easy when you understand light, matter and the structure of the spacetime fabric. To get up to speed with the real physics that work go to the Theory of Everything that solves the double slit experiment with a simple inequality that has been staring physicists in the face for over 100 years and none of them noticed. The inequality is proven in a 1 minute long peer reviewed time lapse video of the experiment done in Nebraska in 2013, I explain the inequality and give a link to the video so anyone can see within a matter of seconds that I am correct.<br>doubleslitsolution dot weebly dot com/springtimetheory dot html", "comment_date": "2021-08-11T07:33:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LChagas", "comment_text": "What an excellent video.

Try it for yourself and you will see that it will make no difference in the results. This is the source of the problem Vera Rubin uncovered when she looked through a telescope. Her discovery was explained away by saying she verified dark matter exists. But what if another woman comes along, another Vera Rubin, who looks through a telescope and then decides that the stars in the inner region of galaxies do not travel fast enough? Then what do we do? Vera did not actually verify the existence of dark matter. Instead, she uncovered a problem with the equations for gravity. These equations simply describe the balance of two opposing types of gravity. If we are afraid to to correctly identify these kinds of problems, then we will find ourselves trapped in endless snipe hunts for things like dark matter and dark energy. I know what some of you are thinking after what I just said... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj60OAh7O5U\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj60OAh7O5U</a><br><br>We do understand electromagnetism very well because James Clerk Maxwell got his equations right, perhaps by good luck. Back then it was easier to identify magnetism and electric charge as energy. It was not so obvious that weight and mass are also manifestations of another type of energy. Today we are still struggling with gravity because the equations are problematic. If we are to understand gravity correctly \u2013 for both it&#39;s positive and negative aspects - then it seems the best way to do this is have equations for gravity structured similar to Maxwell&#39;s equations. Isaac Newton was a brilliant man, but today we have much more insight and knowledge than what scientists and mathematicians had even fifty years ago. As we apply our new knowledge, many of these old equations will need to be, and should be, updated or changed or replaced over time. Consequently, all mathematical equations based on our current understanding of gravity and are thus suspect, and subject to change.<br><br>I think Newton&#39;s greatest achievement was his calculus. Calculus is compatible with the universe because it is infinity-compatible. It works very well with the smooth structure of space as it can be used to describe an infinite amount of points.

Thank you.<br><br>You mention gravitational waves travel at the same speed as light (in a vacuum, in a previous lesson I think you said it varies, and potentially the key to my question below). I, for no valid reason, believe light is not travelling at the max speed possible. Said speed is just a limitation of light but there could be something that travels faster. We can&#39;t see it of course because our eyes work on the basis of light.<br><br>I have asked a few if gravitational waves travel faster than light but am yet to get a satisfactory answer. I base this question on my extremely feeble brain recognising that light arrived 1.7 seconds later than a gravitational wave from the same location (if I understand correctly the observable gravity actually stopping). Kind of makes sense, then, that the gravitational wave was travelling faster.  I am of course referring to the neutron star merger in NGC4993 and GW170817. The best information I can get is from Ask Ethan. Where the explanation is stuff got in the way, slowing light I think (by not being in a vacuum), at the point of explosion. So essentially light left (crudely speaking) 1.7 seconds later than the gravity wave stopped.<br><br>Are you able to explain this in the moderately easy way you explain all your lessons?
