But i tried some algebra and found it impossible (im probs wrong). We also assume the handle is uniform in mass and the brush is uniform in its mass. Heres my reasoning. Say we assume the CoM is exactly on the edge of where the broom starts, here the CoM of the brush is directly in the centre, and the CoM on the handle is exactly in the centre. When i ran my maths in the sense that the LHS has to be greater than the mass of the RHS (so ML (mass of left) = kMR where 0&lt;k&lt;1) i found that the distance x from CoM of handle had to be less than the distance y of CoM of brush to the CoM of the whole object (which we assumed lay on the edge of the brush). Heres the math: at CoM (ML)x = y(MR) therefore (ML)x=y(kML) therefore x = (y(kML))/ML, MLs cancel so youre left with x = ky where 0&lt;k&lt;1. So therefore x is less than y. If x is less than why, then the length of handle = 2x will be less than length of brush which is 2y, so it is impossible. However this was assuming the CoM was on the edge, how about if it was slightly more left and included some of the handle. Here i found it hard because you rely on the density of the handle to calculate the reltionship between the additional handle added and how much that affects length y. The brush CoM will be composed of length y on the LHS and length z on the RHS. So total length y+z. We want to see if y+z is greater than 2x. Since y is always greater than x, it means z has to be less than x. This means y is always greater than z. So this means whatver additional handle is added , the shift of CoM of brush, which will move to the left, the additional length to y is greater than the distance the CoM moves.

You can translate triangle b across the hypotenuse and lay it on top of triangle a&#39;s hypotenuse so that the common integer run, which is 6, is at the same point for both and the angles are stacked in the a+b position.  The point that used to be (7, 0) on triangle b (this is why 7 by 7 boxes is significant) is now sitting at (5, 5).

That&#39;s basically a can-you-think-outside-the-box puzzle.  Here are some outside-the-box possibilities:<br> * The longer side doesn&#39;t actually stick further out, it&#39;s merely longer.  So we&#39;re distinguishing length measured along the broom from length measured perpendicular to the plumb line. Like:<br>    * The long side is curled up<br>    * The broom is bent and the long side goes almost straight up or straight down<br>  * We have a weird distribution of mass, like:<br>    * The longer side actually has almost all of its mass very near the pivot,<br>    * The shorter side has almost all of its mass very near the end<br>  * Some other force is also applying torque to your broom, like:<br>    * The broom is magnetic and you have a big electromagnet near one side<br>    * The broom is carrying electric current and aligned so that earth&#39;s magnetic field pulls the short side down.<br>  * The broom is very light and partly filled with a lifting gas such as  hydrogen.  Now our long side can be more <br>     massive without being heavier,  since it&#39;s bouyant.<br>  * You are balancing the broom in some extreme tidal situation, such as near a neutron star.  I say &quot;tidal&quot; and not <br>    &quot;gravititional&quot; because gravitational feels like a cheat - like if you have a black hole just under one side of your <br>    broom, your plumb line isn&#39;t actually plumb because a plumb line should align with the local gravitational gradient, <br>   and if you fix that and use an honest plumb line, you&#39;re back to the original situation, if somewhat closer to <br>   spaghettification.
