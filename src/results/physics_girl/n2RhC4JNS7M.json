My story have some similarities with yours, but also some different points. Science fascinated me at a young age, too. My dad used to read me NG Kids until I start primary school. Watching documentries was also one fo my favorite activities after school. I was so derterminated about being a astronaut or a scientist when I was in middle school. In high school, my interest were still the same, but that&#39;s when I realized that it&#39;s better be more realistic. Being an astrounaut was impossible for me, even though I work really hard enough , I&#39;m not strong enough to bear the harsh conditions of space environment. So I held tight the ideo of being a scientist, It&#39;d be awesome if I could have a contribution to humanity knowledge, even in the small scale. Specifically, I&#39;d like to  study Astrophysics more than everything. We have a little bit different system here for attending university after high school. Of course we take an exam, too. My results were pretty good, I could attend to the best universities in my country, only except one. I could also choose any kind of enginnering so my teachers expected that I&#39;d choose engineering. However, I thought that being an engineer and working for fixed hours in a stabil job was not the career I&#39;d like to have. All of those bright Scientists were my idol, my inspiration.( My dream job is working at NASA,  despite the fact that I am not an American or European citizen, I have to achieve a few times more to be an exception, I guess. I know that I have a little chance, but I&#39;ll try my best.) So I attend to Physic major in a university which I think is the best at this department. I studied in English prep school ( English education in our high schools is inadequate,  and I&#39;m sorry for the mistakes I made writing this )   for a semester and I&#39;ve just finished my first freshman semester. Nevertheless , I can&#39;t say that I did well. I feel like I hit my lowest point, I have seen such low grades I had never got before. I &#39;ll probably get B- or C+ for from Calculus and Physics. I&#39;m really scared of the fact that if I &#39;am not capable of what I want to be, for all these years. I know that it&#39;s necessary to have a high GPA in order to receive PhD so I think I have to take them again at the next term to raise my grade. I&#39;ll also use the office hours  this time , like you said. I alos decided to take some engineering classes as electives too.  I&#39;ll be studying hard this summer. Do you have any  suggestion? Like a method or any kind of source make things easier to learn for you?

They do two things, they give you one-on-one instruction with some super-wise people, and they get your professor to know you, know that you care, and if you do it right, get you to like you. If you REALLY want to crunch it, then attend office hours early and decently often. In project-heavy courses (software!) they tend to have a TA run help area. Go there too. Good TAs are frequently better at teaching topics than tenured professors. Profs have often understood topics they teach for such a large proportion of their lives that they&#39;ve forgotten what it was like to not yet understand the concept; and what details are needed to reframe your worldview. Physics and math in particular really does rewire your brain and gets you to see things in a completely different manner than what you intuit of the world around you. And that is one of the critical things you get out of a STEM education.<br>I majored in CS at UMD and UMBC. I have an undergrad degree.

I still do not understand how the current in the plasma is set in motion and maintained  and how the magnetic field that that creates interacts with the two fields from the coils. It just occurred to me right now as I type this that it&#39;s the very high temperatures in the plasma that causes the deuterium and tritium nuclei to travel at such high speeds that when they collide they can fuse and not so much, as I have always thought till right now, the extremely high pressure created by the magnetic fields. I guess the magnetic fields contain the extremely high temperature plasma. Bringing this about - the confinement of the plasma - and maintaining that confinement has yet to be achieved for long periods of time.<br>I wonder if you could do a YouTube video about the tokamak explaining everything and assuming that the person watching the video knows only the very basics.

I did quite well in high school (always taunted and labeled as being an overachiever/teacher&#39;s pet), went to college and tried everything -- psychology, premed, criminal justice/criminology, prelaw, electrical engineering, computer engineering, physics -- and finally ended up having my parents plea for me to just finish school (they weren&#39;t paying for it...they just wanted me to commit to a major). They wanted one - I decided to go for two. Go big or go home, right? (I really should&#39;ve just gone home) I decided to finish with a dual degree in criminal justice and computer engineering (with a focus on embedded systems) with minors in math, physics, and electrical engineering. The reasons why I chose those degrees were, at the end of the day, they produced both interesting and well-paying jobs. Engineering, specifically, interested me because I was empowered with the ability to create and impact a multitude of people at once.<br><br>To my parents&#39; dismay, however, I went on to get my master&#39;s in electrical engineering with a focus on controls.  Even though my parents wanted, so desperately, for me to get out, they always supported me. I remember growing up -- they&#39;d let me take apart appliances, toys, cars, etc. and let me figure out how the parts all fit together and worked to make something magical and useful. I&#39;m gainfully employed (you&#39;re welcome, mom and dad!)!<br><br>Like you, my biggest problem with academia (and, specifically, the research route) was that you have to work on a single project for YEARS. I worked for my univesity while I was in undergrad and I could never wrap my head around how Ph.D. students and research faculty did it -- they&#39;d work on one problem for months; sometimes years. I always admired, and sometimes envied, their passion but I don&#39;t think I could commit my career to working on the same problem day in and day out for years-on-end.<br><br>I can pinpoint the reason why I fell so in love with math, physics, and engineering. It was because of my math teacher.  Most of my school (including my older brothers) thought she was mean and too strict but I thought she was awesome. I had her for 7/8ths of my high school career -- everything from advanced algebra to calculus. She always made me strive to do better. Math was the first class where I felt like I could relate to a teacher by simply staring at a problem on a board. There were 4 of us in my Calculus classes. We&#39;d all sit there, student and teacher alike, silently staring at half-solved problems on the board, trying to figure out which step to take next or what idea to pull out of our toolbox in order to progress.

Salesman told me there might be a mistake about the value. I argue with him and told there is no mistake because I&#39;m certain about the equation I use. Then he explain to me that capacitors are packaged at standard size with units mostly in microfarad. To have a capacitor with a unit in farad, he told me it might be as big as a school bus.

I got accepted in a flight school college degree right after high school. With a flawless timing for my graduation, my first company just started a program where they would hire right out of college. I started to fly for a regional airline, right away. With a decent income and tons of time off, I wasn&#39;t seeing myself stopping my education curriculum there. I started a certificate in aeronautical engineering, which was more or less the equivalent of a minor. I was looking at doing a mechanical engineering degree, but my university was demanding too much of a commitment for my schedule and I couldn&#39;t reconcile my job and this program. So I kept on looking at other options and found atmospheric sciences. I liked my meteorology classes in flight school and I thought it could become a relevant asset to use for a possible second revenue source, or a less traditionnal path for a commercial pilot. Here I start my undergrad degree, a BSc with a major in atmospheric sciences. Being a branch of physics, I realized how curious I was for this field overall. You can find physics to be the root of anything that you will ever experience in the universe, which fascinated me. I minored in physics. Although I loved those two fields of study, I felt I was moving away a bit from my first passion, and I couldn&#39;t see how I could wrap all my experience into a unique job. At this point, I was also trying to get into flight testing. In order to move closer to my goal, I enrolled into a MASc in aeronautical engineering, which I&#39;m just about to me done with (last two semesters). My research is on flight control systems. Because all my experiments are simulated, I&#39;ve developped my skills around modelling, simulation and control theory, and consequently, computer programming. In the mean time, I got hired at a legacy carrier and now fly all across North America and a bit of Central America. It would be pretty hard to quit the job that I have now because of the wage, the working conditions and the pension are too good. It would be hard for me to find something equivalent anywhere else. But, I do believe I&#39;ll be able to have a secondary occupation with all my experience, at some point in the future. It could be a personal project with computer programming. In my city, there are a few aircraft simulation companies, some side-work could be a possibility.

That&#39;s what drew me in.Then all throughout HS I would shut myself out and just read dr math and math &quot;armchair books&quot;.

I wanted math to seem more <a href=\"http://intuitive.in/\">intuitive.In</a> my undergrad classes (majored in math lolz), I realized that we sometimes &quot;relearn&quot; the same concepts and what not. I just ended up more confused after I graduated than when I entered, with all my naiveness. I wanted to know roughly in what order to learn concepts once and for all, and in an intuitive, non circular-seeming way. And apart from that, a lot of subtle things would confuse me also (one thing was why, when doing &quot;set equality proofs&quot; we use both the same letter in showing inclusion and the reverse inclusion. I later learned that it was because of &quot;quantifier scope&quot;).So my ultimate goal is to understand in an intuitive way why it is that math works, and to be able to start from the bottom (some reasonable bottom...) and build it back up (not formally, since incompleteness doesn&#39;t allow you, but just in an &quot;informally rigorous&quot; way). I want to see why its theorems work, and where they reasonably come from.

The discussion of job opportunities was nice too - people are always talking about how many jobs are out there for a software engineer, but I&#39;m always on the lookout for ways to incorporate physics into a career, and you seem to have done a very good job of that :D<br>As someone who&#39;s not really sure where to take his next step, it&#39;s very helpful for me to see the path someone else took, and the choices they made. Thank you so much for making this video! I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll ever see this comment, regardless, but I felt that a thank you was in order anyway. <br>It was also neat to see a few of the problems from tests you&#39;d taken and wonder if maybe I could pass physics at MIT :)", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T19:18:46Z", "likes_count": 43}, {"comment_by": "Mikolaj Wojnicki", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t decide if I should study physics or engineering at university.
