Some of these tubule vortices are smaller than the width of a pencil. Dolphins also create torroidal rings with their sonar/echolocation abilities, then they blow air into the ring and an amazing silver spinning torroidal ring is created. The dolphins can then &quot;blast&quot; this spinning ring with sonic frequencies and move the ring around the water. Some dolphins can even change the shape and size of the air filled vortices.

You need a vortex building upon a vortex.  It&#39;s not about creating the one big wave, rather it&#39;s all about a wave following a wave.  It&#39;s really a question of symmetry, proximity, balance, and emergent effects.  When you understand the underlying tensional fabric of space-time better, it will become incredibly obvious.<br><br>The trick is to use sequential induction rings in a cylindrical physical shielding structure (to block cosmic rays/particles), to magnify the effect exponentially, which should get you at least .14 &quot;warp factor&quot; (and maybe as high as .83, depending on how well you synchronize how many interactive generators).<br><br>The more effects (even if smaller) you can generate within a given length, the greater the exponential buildup will be, and so the greater velocity you can simulate as you ride the total wave of transposition of location.  You don&#39;t need one big &quot;boom,&quot; you need to surf your way along.<br><br>This is enough to jet around the solar system for now, and to send probes to nearby star systems.  You have to get the embedded rings within positive feedback/emergence range of each other.  &quot;From many, comes one&quot; is the effect you need, so power-plant distribution should be designed around maximizing that dynamic.<br><br>Since this eliminates the mass limitations in free-space, you only have to worry about launch conditions.  You could shield the thing with granite plates if you want.

Actually the system is composted by a pipe of still water and the toroidal vortex sliding on it. The friction between the toroidal vortex and the still water embraced by it keeps the stability of the system. Frictional systems tends towards a geometrical shape that maximises the losses: think about a parachute: the stable shape is the shape in which the friction between the air and the parachute is the maximum.

Kiehn--<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.449.6471&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.449.6471&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>. In section &#39;1.2 The Experiment&#39;, he explains in detail how to create these solitons, which you already know, and gives a verbal description of the physics. He says:<br><br>&quot;If a thin broom handle or a rod is placed vertically in the pool, and the Falaco soliton pair is directed in its translation motion to intercept the rod symmetrically, as the soliton pair comes within range of the scattering center, or rod, (the range is approximately the separation distance of the two rotation centers) the large black spots at first shimmer and then disappear. Then a short time later, after the soliton has passed beyond the interaction range of the scattering center, the large black spots coherently reappear, mimicking the numerical simulations of soliton coherent scattering. For hydrodynamics, this observation firmly cements the idea that these objects are truly coherent &quot;Soliton&quot; structures.&quot;<br><br>You didn&#39;t center the rod so it didn&#39;t do this. I think it would be worth your while to try it again, this time taking great care to center it. It would be very cool to see it &#39;heal&#39; itself. Too bad Philip Pullman didn&#39;t use this idea in &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. Maybe the kids&#39; d\u00e6mons would have been more difficult to sever. :)<br><br>He goes on to say:<br><br>&quot;If the string connecting the two endcaps is sharply &quot;severed&quot;, the confined, two dimensional endcap singularities do not diffuse away, but instead disappear almost explosively.&quot;<br><br>Maybe Pullman got the idea from this\u2026 :( I don&#39;t know how you&#39;d accomplish this but it would be awesome to see.
