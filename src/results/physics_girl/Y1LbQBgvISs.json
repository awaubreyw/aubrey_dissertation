It may take me a bit longer to learn that what\u2019s possible in a classroom because they\u2019re kind of pressed for time, but I\u2019d love to learn more and see how much my brain can handle lol. I\u2019ve never felt this way about learning something as high as physics and I love it. Science was/is my favorite subject in high school and watching these has given me the desire to learn more about this. Maybe even go back to college for a physics degree (if possible).

Why can&#39;t redshift be explained by something simpler like the entropy of time in the spacetime equation or light passing through clouds of gas?
