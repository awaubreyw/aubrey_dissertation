If his statement is true, he will be thrown off a cliff. If his statement is false, he will be eaten by tigers.

A similar thing will happen here. The professor says &quot;You will give me ten dollars.&quot; If the statement is true, then the participant gets to keep both $10 bills, but that makes the statement false, so the student has to give up one of the bills.

But the agreement the night before was that whoever goes first says purple to indicate an even number of purple hats and green to indicate an even number of green hats. In this scenario, the first prisoner should say purple (indicates an even number of purple hats because there are 0 purple hats) but obviously this prisoner would say green under the very reasonable assumption that his hat is green like the other 99. In this scenario, he might live and everyone else would certainly die so this solution actually has a really good chance of backfiring to become the worst possible way to solve the riddle resulting in the death of all prisoners. Even if There were only slightly more green hats, the first prisoner would still be incentivized to guess purple because it&#39;s more likely to be a 50/50 distribution if it&#39;s truly random.
