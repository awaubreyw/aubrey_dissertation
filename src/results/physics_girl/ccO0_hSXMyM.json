The inequality in the double slit experiment is a proof by contradiction that the SMOPP is impossible and ipso facto so is the big bang. The inequality is that few &quot;particles&quot; get through the slits when run to get the interference pattern (if anyone thinks they all get through, check the FACTS, the video by Nebraska Lincoln in 2013 shows the correct data) but when we run the experiment to detect which way ALL the &quot;particles&quot; get through the slits.

Until they do we will never get out of this health emergency. <br>If you all produce an episode and release it at the same time my hope is that you will flood YouTube&#39;s logarithm and push the misinformation into the background. <br>And maybe &#39;Susan&#39; can coordinate the timing of release of everyone&#39;s video. <br>If you already made a video on this then use that to save time.<br>But having watched and learned how you get recommendations it seems there is a way to push the good science forward if everyone does it at the same time. <br>Another suggestion is that everyone collaborate if it helps to sync the release. <br>I&#39;ve heard that you have meetings or conventions at some point. So there must be a channel where you can talk to each other to make this work. <br>If I&#39;m wrong then all you did was create a informative video. But if it works you might convince someone to get vaccinated and stop listening to all the BS that is being feed to them because of some political reason. And no do not make this about politics. It should be just science driven and no sides taken. My hope is that if you can get enough people to watch you might get them to realize they have been getting the wrong info from people that don&#39;t have their best interests at heart. <br>Also on top of asking them to get vaccinated  also ask them to wear a mask and give the reason in a scientific way. <br>Ok thanks for reading this and considering it. <br>I will be posting this exact message to ask many of the channels I follow that I respect.<br>I also realized that it might be good to keep this project quiet if everyone decides to do it because I would not want the misinformation channels to find out and then interfere with the release. Remember I am trying to overcome the logarithm.<br>I am sending a copy of this to the Whitehouse. It seems that later today President Biden announce new ways to help people get vaccinated.

The &quot;Energy Crisis&quot;, if you had been listening to the NEWS, was solved in July 2019 at Bath University (UK). When a Canadian High tech Electrical Engineering Company (called SAFIRE) revealed the new PLASMA REACTOR. This is a revolutionary new system that not only generates electricity on demand in huge quantity cheaply 24/7. It ALSO allows the planet to get rid of ALL the buried RADIOACTIVE NUCLEAR WASTE currently costing us Billions a year to store. And yet further it can &quot;CREATE&quot; ANY ELEMENT in the element table including Gold cheaply &amp; in quantity, read on !!! <br><br>So how does a PLASMA REACTOR WORK ?  Well no thanks to the idiotic mainstream scientists who have been leading the Electrical Generating Industry in circles for Decades, with their absurd notions that they  should copy the Sun, by using Nuclear Fusion (Not Fission). <br><br>SAFIRE realised around 2008 that mainstream science is quite simply &quot;faulty science&quot;. So being Electrical Engineers they trotted off to have a chat with the alternative &quot;ELECTRIC UNIVERSE&quot; scientists. Who quickly explained the Sun in reality BURNS NOTHING AT ALL, never has and never will&quot; !!! In reality the Sun &amp; Stars work electrically as they are all fed by the Universe wide Birkland Electrical Currents which flow in Plasma. (Discovered by the Norwegian Professor Birkland as long ago as 1903)!<br><br>To replicate the Suns atmosphere according to the ELECTRIC UNIVERSE theory, required a multi-million dollar, airtight chamber, capable of dealing with large amounts of electricity (33,000v), high temperatures (1500deg C), Plasma, Hydrogen gas, and to make it all work an &quot;Anode&quot; to represent the Sun itself in this electrical circuit. It was then a long and painstaking process to test all the variables to see what would happen. As the CEO said during the conference at Bath University &quot;This was the point at which we realised we had accidentally opened &quot;Pandora&#39;s Box&quot;. <br><br>SAFIRE slowly learnt by testing, how to control the Plasma, but this revealed Plasma is NOT what mainstream science has been telling us, as they call in a hot gas! . In reality Plasma is not a gas, liquid or solid it is &quot;THE FIRST STATE OF MATTER&quot;.  Which basically means it is the foundation stone of the Universe, and it is Plasma that is still CREATING the Universe, as it produces all the atoms. So learning how to control Plasma with electricity, inside a Hydrogen filled airtight chamber, has led not only to the huge amounts of heat needed to create the high pressure steam, to turn the turbines, that rotate the generators that make electricity, in any normal power station. It has also revealed that by playing around with the Plasma, forces it to &quot;create&quot; any of the elements you want by minor adjustment of the electrical supply. Further it was also discovered from these experiments that the Suns atmosphere, both produces radiation as well as controlling radiation. Further experiments then ensued to find how to manipulate the atmosphere in the chamber to also allow radioactive material to be contained and burnt. <br><br>Therefore any PLASMA REACTOR can be used to alter any current power station whether currently coal, gas, oil, or Nuclear to the new Plasma Reactor method. Further the Commercial design stage of PLASMA REACTORS now underway, will allow these plants to do any, or all, of the three jobs possible. i.e electrical generation, consuming radioactive material, or creating &quot;elements&quot;. This last is aimed mainly at Industry, for the purpose of producing &quot;rare metals&quot;. We will no longer have to find or mine such as a result. This part of the discovery has of course implications for the current value of such rare metals. The price will of course plummet as will the cost of electricity.<br><br>THE UNIVERSE IS ELECTRIC THERE ARE NO ISLANDS IN SPACE.", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T19:59:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wizardin", "comment_text": "Just curious, would the steam create more water vapor?

And as long as there are humans who want stuff, we will have to deal with that. The question is how can we minimize the impact. Right now fossil fuel powered plants are the most destructive form of energy generation, not only because of emissions, but because of the mining, transporting and using, that affects land and water. Fossil fuels have to be mined where they are, regardless of how many species there are. Artificial structures in tropical rainforests do kill more plants and animals than those in a desert. Again, we can only minimize damage, and for that goal deserts are better suited than mining fossil fuels in areas with much more plants and animals. And then there is the emission aspect. Climate change kills or at least threatens a huge number of species. Plants and animals die out because they cannot adapt fast enough. Building clean solar power plants in the desert is a great solution to solve our problems. <br><br>The best way to help the environment is to reduce consumption.

As to my reason for commenting, the problem with the plant outside of Las Vegas is that it is beyond expensive. Not including the operational cost, in order to see a pay off in 20 years, the cost per kilowatt has to be at least $1.30. If we compare that to photovoltaic being put on your roof, the 20 year payoff averages to about 8.5 cents per kilowatt at today&#39;s prices. Energy storage is the biggest issue in our goals towards renewables, and the sands idea does appear to be very interesting. Of course we have the future cost of what to do with the photovoltaic panels when they are no longer useful, which means that we need to work on a recycling technology as well. My fear with what we are seeing in green tech is not the tech as much as it is government being so eager to go green, that no one making the decisions is considering the steps to get there, and the challenges of waist in the future. Considering how many cars are on the road for instance, the idea that we can have 100% of drivers switch to electric cars, we would need to create enough power production to produce another 1,120 gigawatts per day. The worst part of that number is that it would mainly have to be produced during the night time. With all the new tech, it seems the best answer is nuclear.

If we can get storage costs low enough, PV+storage is also more interesting.<br>2) Geographical limitation: You can&#39;t just place these plants everywhere, the efficiency reduces a lot depending on the available sunlight. And ofcourse you need space and lots of it. With PV you can if need be place it in smaller units in a same location to avoid obstacles, elevation differences etc. aren&#39;t that much of a problem, with CSP this can be more of a problem. Another problem here is that CSP isn&#39;t usually located close to the main energy users, so you possibly need to install connection wires etc too. With PV you can place them on the roofs, car parks, nearby fields, ... limiting these kind of connection costs.<br>3) Water usage: These mirrors need to be kept clean. This often requires water use to do so. The problem is that these systems usually are in more arid places where water is more valuable. Ofcourse you might have ways to get around this, but they will usually be less effective or more costly. This was for example one of the controversies with CSP plants in Morocco that were subsidies by the EU, I believe.<br><br>Does CSP has a place in the grid mix? Yes, I think they definitely will play a role. Are they likely to become one of the main sources/compete with PV? Doubtfull. They might be usefull for energy intensive industries that could possibly be build around them and then either you use their storage to keep these industries going 24/7 or it is used to help balance the grid in the evening/at night.<br><br>If you were to ignore things like costs, political stability (for example northern Africa region), ... , CSP would likely be the best source to get us fully renewable. in fact they are probably one of the only renewable sources that could completely on its own get us to 100% renewable; No battery storage, no PV, wind, hydro, ... needed, just CSP.

And by the way how doesn&#39;t it melt and turn into glass or something? How are there no heat losses if we use it as storage and wait for hours to release the sand&#39;s energy?

You never send saturated steam to a turbine or even old-style steam locomotive cylinders.  If you were to send saturated steam through the pipes it would  expand in the turbine or steam cylinder, it would cool and partially condense into zillions of tiny droplets that act like pellets, blasting over the turbine blades, chipping away material in no time at all. In old locomotives, the problem with that condensation is that water does not compress as steam does so, at the end of its run, the pistons would press against non-compressible water, damaging all the mechanism.  That is why steam engines take quite long to start, you have to heat up all the steam circuit, valves and mechanisms so that at no point steam will cool down enough to condense into water.   What you do, as the diagram seen in your video at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccO0_hSXMyM&amp;t=2m05s\">2:05</a> shows,  you superheat the saturated steam (see, preheater, steam generator which is the one that produces saturated steam and  superheater), which you can do under high pressure, so even when completely spent after passing through the last stage in a turbine, its temperature will remain above the dew point and won&#39;t condense into those deadly water droplets.  And, since vapor still contains quite some energy once it passes once through a turbine, it goes to a reheater (you can see it labeled so in the diagram) before going to the low pressure turbine, which is the larger one, since by that time the steam would have expanded a lot, and that turbine works more by volume of steam passing through  than by pressure.", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T07:47:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IcyMidnight", "comment_text": "It would have been good to get a few details of how the energy storage works.

Water is not unlimited there is only so much on earth and if we turn it into fuel in any form it will create water shortages .Because pure hydrogen does not occur naturally on Earth in large quantities, it usually requires a primary energy input to produce on an industrial scale. Hydrogen fuel can be produced from methane or by electrolysis of water.  As of 2020, the majority of hydrogen (\u223c95%) is produced from fossil fuels by steam reforming or partial oxidation of methane and coal gasification with only a small quantity by other routes such as biomass gasification or electrolysis of water.<br>\r<br>Steam-methane reforming, the current leading technology for producing hydrogen in large quantities, extracts hydrogen from methane. However, this reaction releases fossil carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere which are greenhouse gases exogenous to the natural carbon cycle, and thus contribute to climate change. In electrolysis, electricity is run through water to separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. This method can use wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, fossil fuels, biomass, nuclear, and many other energy sources . Combustion engines using hydrogen are of interest since the technology offers a less substantial change to the automotive industry, and potentially a lower up-front cost of the vehicle compared to fully electric or fuel cell alternatives. However, the non -zero emission nature of the engine means it will not be able to operate in city zero emission zones, unless part of a hybrid powertrain.

The Ivanpah towers in California are marvels of engineering.  What people are not told is that they do not only produce electricity with solar heat but must also use natural gas (methane) to keep the system operating above a certain temperature at night.  With the most complete data I have for 2015 - 2018, Ivanpah used nearly 1,490,000 MWh of natural gas to produce 126,031 MWh of electricity.  That&#39;s about 8.5% efficiency.  Most modern natural gas power plants are CCGT types.  The same amount of natural gas would typically produce about 815,000 MWh of electricity.  That is at 55% efficiency and is 6.4x as much power as Ivanpah.  In those 4 years, Ivanpah would produce approximately 270,000 metric tons of CO2 which would be about the same for a CCGT plant with 6.4x more electricity to show for it.  On another note, hydrogen cars are a perfectly clean way to drive producing only water and heat when burned.  This only works if hydrogen is easy for us to create, which it isn&#39;t.  For every 1 metric ton of hydrogen produced, approximately 6 metric tons of CO2 are entering our atmosphere.  Green minded people may say we can capture that CO2 and pump it into deep wells in the ground.  Yes we can but this would add 80 - 90% to production costs.  This is not a realistic scenario.  Once again, great ideas but everyone needs to know both sides of the story.", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T01:41:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KenSDCA", "comment_text": "So, next series should be about micro grid technologies.", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T01:39:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SpongyD", "comment_text": "No mention of all the birds they kill", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T01:35:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roger Huston", "comment_text": "Really wished you stopped by Heliogen in Lancaster near by.

I though you wanted to say superheated steam, but then you say that both states of water exist together because the pressure and thats technically true, being a physicist I know you know more thermodynamics than me, and were oversimplificating. But it is bad to expand in a turbine.<br>It&#39;s really difficult to explain without a couple of mollier diagrams of water, but you can look up for them, specially the T-S one.<br><br>When you heat water it starts increasing it&#39;s temperature until it reaches(at 1 bar) about 100\u00baC. This is called saturated liquid, and all the energy you put in went to increase it&#39;s sensible heat.<br>Then, all the energy you put into boiling water doesn&#39;t increases the water&#39;s temperature, but it&#39;s absrobed into transforming liquid water into water vapour, wich is called latent heat. This is due to the vapourization enthalpy,  wich is how much energy is required to change the state from liquid to gas.<br>When all the liquid you had has become vapour, now you are in a state known as saturated vapour, and all of the energy you put in them from now will now increase it&#39;s temperature. <br>The vapour you keep heating is known as superheated vapour, and it will reach temperatures as 650\u00baC at pressures about 20 bar<br><br>If you expand the saturated vapour in a turbine, it will start giving it&#39;s latent heat back and condensing, and the water droplets hitting the blades of the turbine will ruin it. <br>That&#39;s why steam turbines work with superheated vapour, wich will give the turbine it&#39;s sensible heat but preventing whater to condense inside the turbine.<br>It is so important to avoid condensation, that steam turbines have multiple stages, and in every one of them expand the superheated vapour to just before reaching the saturated vapour point, and the reheat once or twice the vapour to keep extracting more energy from it before sending it to a condenser stage.", "comment_date": "2021-08-31T23:44:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hans Tubben", "comment_text": "Yes people have to get away from the idea that energy only can be stored in lithium ion batteries.

What percentage of electricity does this facility provide to homes and businesses? What power resources are available that can back up this facility in case it cannot provide adequate electricity or facility failure? (Recall what happened in Texas when a cold front hit.)  When minerals are mined and refined that are needed to construct solar panels and storage batteries, are toxic wastes produced? What is the life expectancy of the solar panels and batteries? How will worn out and damaged units be disposed, and will toxic wastes be produced? How will dust storms and hail storms and lightning storms affect the facility? How will extreme heat or extreme cold affect the facility?
