OK, I watched it up to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q_6--XsIgA&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a>. It looks like the ethanol and other components of the liquid are draw up by the low surface tension of ethanol, then the ethanol evaporates away leaving a heavier, non-alcoholic liquid to fall back down as legs.<br>OK, finished it. I was on the right track I think. Just learned that things flow from low to high surface tension and the maragonisomethingsomething effect. Thank you, Dianna.

When testing wine and talking about qualities of the wine, one usually doesn&#39;t just wait for the &quot;legs&quot; to form by Marangoni effect. Usually, one swirls the wine, causing the residual wine to drip down the sides, in &quot;legs&quot;. We&#39;ve always thought that the longer those legs run down the glass, the higher the residual sugar content in the wine, since dissolved sugars increase the viscosity of the wine. One can see this in the difference between ports (high sugar) and zinfandel (lower sugar). While the alcohol contents are slightly different (port is ~19%, zinfandels ~16-17%), the residual sugar contents are WAY different: an old vine zin has 3-5g of sugar per liter, most ports run around 100-150 g per liter. Consequently, the legs last way longer in a port than a dry wine. The difference between different wines can often show up as well in legs that are more or less persistent.<br><br><br>Incidentally, this formation of legs doesn&#39;t say anything about THE quality of the wine, rather about A quality, namely, the residual sugars. This can tell enthusiasts whether the grapes were likely harvested late or early, what type of grapes might be in a blend, etc. But given this interesting work here, I guess it also tells us about the potential alcohol content. One might guess that the sugar content will also have an effect on the surface tension gradients formed to make the Marangoni effect.", "comment_date": "2019-10-26T12:54:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray Ceeya", "comment_text": "Well it can tell you about the quality, but only if you live in the US and the reason is taxes.  Wine above 13.9% jumps into a higher tax bracket and is considered a &quot;luxury good&quot;.  So wineries aim for that 13-13.9% range to maximize value per unit for the consumer.  It&#39;s what separates a $20 bottle from a $35 bottle.  Naturally some people will pay extra for that nicer bottle with the higher ABV, so wineries make those too, and naturally they&#39;re going to be more selective about those grapes.  You don&#39;t want someone to pay extra for a bottle and feel like they got ripped off.<br><br><br>Now I  know what you&#39;re thinking.  You&#39;re thinking about that apocryphal study from about 15 years ago where wine connoisseurs were presented with samples of cheap and expensive wine side by side and couldn&#39;t tell the difference.

There&#39;s a whole bunch of other chemicals that get created depending on factors like fermentation temperature, pH, chemical composition of the initial must (for wine/cider) or wort (for beer), specific strain(s) of yeast being used, presence/absence and specific strains of malolactic bacteria during fermentation, material of the fermentation and aging vessels, etc.<br><br><br>One of the most important of these chemicals is glycerine, which gives wines like port and sherry their characteristic syrupy mouthfeel, and the resulting association with quality. Adding glycerine to improve a batch of wine is a very old trick, as a single teaspoon can turn a demijohn of meh wine into a good one in seconds. Checking for glycerine in table wine is also very easy, because the alcohol content alone isn&#39;t always enough for it to form legs, so you just stick it in a glass and swirl.

Also, you can see some really whacky effects if you place a splash of water and a splash of isopropyl alcohol on a horizontal glass surface such that they are touching each other -- all sorts of weird oscillatory motion as they try to mix. Given that the bulk of the wine has a higher alcohol content than the droplets, I&#39;d expect the cause/explanation of the oscillations is the same, and somehow related to the different compositions/surface tensions of the liquids, but I&#39;m yet to see a good explanation.

But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflection in the glass; and our imagination adds atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth&#39;s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe&#39;s age, and the evolution of stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization; all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts -- physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on -- remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more final pleasure; drink it and forget it all!\u201d<br><br>~ Richard Feynman", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T22:22:19Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Zoltan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q_6--XsIgA&amp;t=4m55s\">4:55</a> &quot;This is not Chemistry Girl&quot;.
