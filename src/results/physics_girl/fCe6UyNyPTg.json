It may not always be the biggest aspect of friction, but surely it plays a role. I mean if you were to take a sideways step/row of triangle bumps/ridges and push them along another row of triangle ridges along the bottom, the top ridges would always be falling into the spaces in the bottom and then if you push them along, would climb back out.  This would be a friction. If you rapidly moved one over the other there would be lots of collisions and instances with one climbing over the other slowing down the movement. It would also take a steeper incline before one fell off the other depending on the size of the triangles and other factors. Surely this applies on smaller scale as well. <br><br>                  Like if we are talking about shoes, or  car tires, they have ridges. These ridges on the flexible material with weight flatten out but want to go back to the standard shape.  So you have the additional friction of pushing against this material rebound factor. This is why more flexible and uneven materials provide more friction under weight.  Matter collusion friction becomes a big factor sometimes when we are trying to create friction.  Is there a physics formula that could possibly fully calculate that factor with the rest?<br>                On the more extreme end, you have things like cleats, which are shoes with spikes and snow tires, which are either car tires with something like chains on them or on bicycle tires are small metal spikes along the ridge of the wheel, using material collision to it&#39;s fullest to increase friction. And surely these count as &quot;friction&quot;, or at least need to be considered in the same formulas when calculating friction. Like if the cars tires are &quot;bald&quot; AKA all the ridges have been worn away from repeated collisions making the tires relatively smooth, the car would take much longer to stop. And if there was a series of speed bumps, it would stop sooner. <br><br>                Also, as you talk about molecular attraction (which I kind of already knew but your lesson helped focus in my mind in regards to friction) Might you call water tension, a form of &quot;friction&quot;? I mean water tension is how things can be wet without having to sit right on top of whatever surface, without water tension things would dry immediately with the smallest amount of gravitational force.(watched a video recently about a material called &quot;dry water&quot; [I think that was the name] that does nearly just that because of it&#39;s lack of surface tension)  And without water tension, water could not bead up.  (which I&#39;m sure you already know all this)  Water tension can also do things like make something wet cling to a vertical wall if the item isn&#39;t too heavy and the surface area is great enough. So is water tension just a specialized term for water friction? Or is there a difference?", "comment_date": "2020-11-18T07:13:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Jackowski", "comment_text": "The perfect item to go with a box cow is a spherical horse.", "comment_date": "2020-11-18T02:00:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zapfanzapfan", "comment_text": "I have that book! :-) Warped Passages by Lisa Randall.", "comment_date": "2020-11-18T01:51:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Explorateur", "comment_text": "Oh!
