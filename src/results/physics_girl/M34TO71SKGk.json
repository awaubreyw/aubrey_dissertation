One of the experiments that we did to demonstrate how kinesthetic awareness was greater than eye hand coordination in most subjects was to have each one throw 100 darts at a 4x8 foot board from the same distance with and without a blindfold. On average, people throw the group of darts in about half the size circle as without the blindfold. This is the secret behind parlor tricks such as cutting a watermelon on a volunteers stomach with a sword while blindfolded.

Is anything truly random? Even though they were trying to &quot;increase&quot; randomness, subconsciously, some sort of pattern, no matter how unusual it is was being developed to get randomness.

The problem you are always going to have with this is the fact that some darts miss the entire paper. Some of the randomness is being &quot;lost&quot;. If you could make it so\u00a0every particular dart will be assured of always landing on the paper somewhere, you would get a better result.<br><br>Also, because you are aiming, you are necessarily introducing a bias in favor of landing inside the circle since you are likely to always aim at the same spot on the target...presumably the center. Even if you turn the paper around backwards so you cannot see the circle, there will be a tendency for you to aim at the center. I suppose you could randomize your aiming point, but it would be tough to do that without introducing some kind of bias. Using a blindfold will help somewhat to minimize that bias.<br><br>I am curious how you counted those darts that landed half-in/half-out of the circle. If you have lots of these, how you choose will bias your result. The darts have awfully large pokey ends that leave a pretty big hole, relatively speaking. Using darts made out of something much thinner like sewing needles propelled by a blow dart &quot;gun&quot;, like a soda straw, I would expect to produce a better result as well. Especially if you load up the straw with lots of them and blow them all at once...again blindfolded.<br><br>You should also do it inside so wind won&#39;t create a downwind bias, and shoot directly downwards or upwards so that gravity doesn&#39;t introduce a bias which favors the edge of the target closest to the ground.<br><br>Probably a much easier and far more accurate way to compute\u00a0PI in this sort of manner is to make your target out of graph paper (a square grid pattern). Don&#39;t throw any darts or anything at it. All you have to do then is count the number of grid intersections falling on or inside the circle.

Technically, your hypothesis, with regards to a standard RANDOM sample within the circle vs outside the circle, is correct. Your problem exist with your concept of randomness and a natural human tendencies towards two different things: 1) When throwing darts, you try to aim for a particular spot. If trying to throw at a bulls-eye, you won&#39;t often miss the entire dart board. 2) When INTENTIONALLY trying to force randomness, human presumption takes over. What do I mean by &quot;human presumption&quot;? Imagine - as in think about doing it in your mind - flipping a coin 100 times and charting the results of each flip. Now actually flip the real coin 100 times and chart those results. if you were to show me both charts, I could tell you which one was &quot;imaginary&quot; and which one was real. How? The human brain does not usually consider the possibility of something like: 8 tails in a row. Human presumption - a little trick the mind plays, when trying to be random - tries to factor in, what many call, &quot;law of averages.&quot; You know, the simple concept of saying, &quot;It came up heads 4 times... it&#39;s due to come up tails!&quot; Meanwhile, as you are well aware, regardless of how many heads we&#39;ve seen, &quot;heads,&quot; in a row, our next toss is still 50/50. Essentially, in a nutshell, when trying to be random, the brain forces false results.<br><br>A possible solution to your randomness problem would be to step further away from the board (decreasing your accuracy) and spin the dart board, upon which it is placed (think: dart board centered on a bicycle tire).", "comment_date": "2015-12-10T17:42:29Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Lai Shun Chan", "comment_text": "This is awesome!", "comment_date": "2015-12-10T07:42:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arra Neon", "comment_text": "Nothing is random at all", "comment_date": "2015-12-04T13:22:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "dxdx666", "comment_text": "Thumb down because of Veritasium :D", "comment_date": "2015-12-04T10:08:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joel Kindiak", "comment_text": "ship", "comment_date": "2015-11-26T13:07:50Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Sharkiuli", "comment_text": "they look good together", "comment_date": "2015-11-24T17:05:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Phizicks", "comment_text": "why not try (Buffon&#39;s needle) a long flat board and draw lines across it at the lengths of a pencil or needle or something, then drop the item large number of times and calculate the number of times that it crosses the line over the number of times it doesn&#39;t , you&#39;ll get PI/2 ( think it was).", "comment_date": "2015-11-22T11:00:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Felix Jung", "comment_text": "The actual number is 3,141592659", "comment_date": "2015-11-18T20:34:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dewayne Morgan", "comment_text": "shoot it with a shotgun,where the circle is 10 times the diameter of the shot shell and the distance from target is 1000 times the diameter of the shell.", "comment_date": "2015-11-16T00:00:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jeremy western", "comment_text": "WHO IS THIS EGGHEAD?", "comment_date": "2015-11-14T21:35:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChantandCo", "comment_text": "did you estimate her cream pi after the video?", "comment_date": "2015-11-14T00:40:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tebz Go", "comment_text": "I have to admit... that was cool.", "comment_date": "2015-11-13T01:43:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Herbert Miller", "comment_text": "The bias arises because of how our brains are wired.
