So sorry you are dealing with OLD SCHOOL knowledge of holographic plates. Your comment that if you cut a small square piece of the holographic plate that you would still be able to see the entire object in\u00a0that small cutout piece of the holographic plate is INCORRECT. And this is simple as a thought exercise. Now imagine that you bounced a laser beam at a coffee cup that is centered to the middle of a photographic film that you are capturing the image on. Now imagine that you have to look through the photographic film, lets say that the film was like a 12&quot; inch square.\u00a0And\u00a0the 12&quot;sq film and the coffee cup are stationary and cannot be moved. Only you the viewer who is behind the film can only\u00a0move: up/down/side-to-side/diagonally, so that your angles of view\u00a0to see the\u00a0centered coffee cup changes. Let&#39;s say that you cannot look through the holographic film unless you poke a peep hole through it first. If you poked a small hole at the top portion\u00a0of the film so that you can now peek through the film and look slightly downward to see the top of the coffee cup, but from the hole at the top of the film you cannot see the bottom\u00a0of the coffee cup because the light hitting the bottom of the coffee cup is blocked by the coffee cup.\u00a0And\u00a0in order to see the bottom of the\u00a0stationary coffee cup you would have to view the coffee cup by poking another peep hole at the bottom of the 12&quot;sq stationary film to see the bottom of the coffee cup. So, what you are missing is angles of view. If you were to cut a 12&quot; X 1&quot;strip of the top of the holographic film you would ONLY see the top of the cup side-to-side as if you are looking at a coffee cup sitting on top of a wooden table, but unless you could look up through the bottom of the table you would never be able to see the bottom of the coffee cup. WHAT YOU WOULD LOSE IF YOU CUT A PIECE OF THE 12&quot;x12&quot; SQUARE holographic plate is ANGLES-OF-VIEW.
