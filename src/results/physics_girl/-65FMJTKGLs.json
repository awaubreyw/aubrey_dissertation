He then told another music teacher at the school who plays saxophone and when I walked into the band hall after another lesson he told me to name a note from his saxophone and I named it. Then other students got exited and asked me to name notes from their instruments, which I did. Then every so often they&#39;d hit random piano keys and wait until I named them. Another music teacher at the school figured out I had perfect pitch when I was the only one naming keys. The way I did it was by being bored one day in the spring of 2016. Being in my school&#39;s Jazz Ensemble for the first time because the professor needed a guitarist and he recognized me from the school&#39;s music club. Sometime after the first day I was intimidated, so I went home and hit all notes on the keyboard at home and said the name of the note (sharps and flats also) then went upstairs and strummed all of the notes on my guitar and named them. Then I did it a second time on the guitar, except during the second time, with each note, I thought of the first word that came to mind with each note. So whenever I hear a note, I hear the word I associated it with and then I name the note.

But it was a time when I started hearing about DJs. So it quickly became a bit of an obsession with me and I started learning DJing as a way to perform music. Slowly but surely, playing other people&#39;s music became more boring with each day and I realized that it would be great to have your own music. And with that thought, I began my journey to becoming a sound-producer and engineer. \r<br>\r<br>Since creating a musical piece in a modern way often comes with a regular repetition, I couldn&#39;t help myself but notice that I could recall certain parts of the composition in my head. What made me wonder is that with this ability I could not only &quot;listen back&quot; but modify sounds in my mind the way they could be modified by different audio plugins and tools.\r<br>\r<br>In a parallel to that, I also began experimenting with my voice. In other words, singing and beatboxing. One day I was strolling down the street, deep in conversation with a fellow musician. We were debating over a piece of music and at one moment I casually a passage without &quot;tuning&quot; myself. Then my friend wanted to repeat that passage with a smartphone keys app and when he played it with the original key he noticed that I actually sang it pitch perfectly. He asked me whether or not I have an absolute pitch. Naturally, I told him I don&#39;t have one.\r<br>\r<br>But cases like that started to repeat and one day a friend tested me. I could always sing whatever note I was asked to sing but I was struggling to listen back and guess a note correctly. With singing, I felt like I&#39;ve been recalling a pitch from the back of my mind and matching it with my voice, but with listening it was more of a like trying to find a pitch one semitone at a time.\r<br>\r<br>A few years had passed and now in 99.9% of the cases, I can not only guess a note correctly, I can tell by how much is it off. I can also tell a difference between different A4 references and types of tuning. In general, it took me 9 years to develop such a skill, the only drawback being unable to enjoy the music without analysing it, guessing keys, etc., etc.", "comment_date": "2018-05-23T09:06:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thepianoplayer416", "comment_text": "Learned to play recorder early in life.

No-one else in the class could, and I became a bit of a celebrity in the school for it. Stories like &quot;she can even tell you the note of the aircraft flying overhead&quot; (not really true...) spread. I always found it tougher with  instruments other than the piano, but could usually manage it. With voice, I could usually get it right, or at least very close.<br>But now, it&#39;s gone. Not completely; sometimes I will absolutely know that note you played on the piano is a C, or whatever. But very often I will be quite unsure. And it&#39;s not even a proximity thing; sometimes I might be unsure if a note is (for example) a Bb or an Eb, but I think it is one of them.<br>Maybe it&#39;s a result of not being tested, and not testing myself on it. Maybe it&#39;s because I played a piano that was out of tune for a while (that is, incidentally, very difficult if you have perfect pitch, because you keep thinking you&#39;re playing wrong notes).

It is just a matter of practice.  There are numerous examples of adults acquiring this capability.  In fact, I would go so far as to say this is wholly unlike most of your videos and almost irresponsible in its claim.  This is one of these bizarre myths that lingers like &quot;language acquisition is superior in young children&quot;.  In fact, this is also totally false.  Adults learn languages much faster and more efficiently than children and can learn to speak any human language with fluency provided they work hard enough- it just feels like more work as an adult.  <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027715000621\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027715000621</a>  Further, there is significant evidence that all children are born with perfect pitch and as one neglects the ability, one loses it.  <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1323575/Babies-tune-into-the-art-of-talking-with-gift-of-perfect-pitch.html\">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1323575/Babies-tune-into-the-art-of-talking-with-gift-of-perfect-pitch.html</a>   Finally, I think the most conclusive piece of evidence here is actually a study on monkeys that were born red green colorblind and then administered a gene therapy correcting this flaw.  They did not immediately see red and green though the photoreceptor expression was readily observed.  They, in fact, had to be taught to see it.  <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/2009/090916/full/news.2009.921.html\">https://www.nature.com/news/2009/090916/full/news.2009.921.html</a> The precision of our senses is not innate and baring physical or cognitive disability can be vastly sharpened with practice.

Absolute pitch means that you can identify any tone on any instrument and any object, like you showed. So far so good. If you can however identify any tone on your own instrument but not on other instruments or objects, for all octaves or a few octaves of your instrument, then you still only have a relative pitch. If you can find all the notes on several instruments but you need to take a reference note to find it (a note from a song or a note which you can reproduce immediately (for example C3/C4 on the piano) then you still only have a relative pitch. Relative pitch can go a lot further than just recognizing a difference between notes and while it probably is impossible for adults to develop a perfect pitch it certainly is possible for adults to learn to recognize any note on the instrument they play, including tritones or even more notes which are being played at the same time. As a matter of fact, even people who have a perfect pitch need to do ear training to optimally use their ability. For example, somebody who has got a well trained relative pitch might be able to recognize intervals (even spread out on several octaves) without being able to tell which notes he exactly hears while somebody with perfect pitch might hear the notes but can&#39;t easily identify the intervals. To become a great musician or composer you don&#39;t need perfect pitch. I recommend to watch Rick Beato (a professional musician who has got a Youtube channel) his explanation on relative pitch vs. absolute pitch. He demonstrates it with his son who has both a perfect pitch and an extremely well trained &#39;ear&#39; (obviously it is the brain which makes the difference and not the ear). There also are people who have a perfect pitch but they can&#39;t sing the notes correctly without practice while there are people with just a well developed perfect pitch who can sing the notes perfectly.<br><br>I think that people might get the idea of your explanation of relative pitch that it is a lot less extensive/useful than what it can be. Relative pitch is an extremely broad concept which covers people who couldn&#39;t get close to singing with the correct notes if their lives depend on it to people who can transcribe anything they hear and recognize any note with some tools they developed (taking a reference note, that might even be the same note from your memory). Even though you only have a relative pitch, with practice you could learn to sing directly correctly while just reading the notes or based upon nothing else but your own memory of listening to the song,  you don&#39;t need a perfect pitch for that. It doesn&#39;t have to be like you showed with your friend: roughly singing the correct intervals but transposed. Though it easily happens to people who don&#39;t have a perfect pitch but a reasonably welll developed relative pitch. Sometimes that is a good thing, if you have to sing an octave lower or higher. <br><br>I liked you showing the same note of different instruments. That is something at which my old physics teachers and the writers of my old physics books failed. I was quite confused by that as a kid. Why do two notes sound different while the frequency is the same? Little did I know that you have many harmonic sounds which are not a pure sinusoid (or better put a combination of many sinusoid (fourier)). I figured out back then that you hear multiple notes at the same time with some dominant frequency but it wasn&#39;t clear what that does to the shape of the amplitude vs. frequency.
