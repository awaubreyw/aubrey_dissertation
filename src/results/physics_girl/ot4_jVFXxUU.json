And when I say strong, they are in the -50dBM range at over 50 feet from my own access point (AP) (the smart meter is outside my house completeley opposed to where my AP is), 3 walls, 1 celling and many metal conducts and home appliances in between.  I never saw those signals before and all of a sudden they are there. I also see (at -80dBm though) the same kind signals from one of the nearby house smartmeter too.<br><br>So I pushed my investigation further because I didn&#39;t find it normal that my AP could catch signals that strong at that distance. I did the microwaves oven test like you did and what I found is getting me worried.  I transformed by iPhone into a WiFi scanner (you can do that by using AirPort utilility and activating the Wi-Fi Scanner option) by using the Air Port utility and let it scan continuously.  With that, you can now find the strenght of any wifi AP (up to 5Ghz) - and that is how I found out that it was my smartmeter that was emiting those signals. <br><br>I put my iPhone in the microwaves oven while the scanner was On and it could &quot;see&quot; all wifi networks in the area, including mine, the smartmeter, my neigbors, etc.  But when I closed the door of the microwaves oven, it lost all wifi signals - and my own AP was barely 20 feet away but still lost its signal - except those 5 smartmeter signals that barely lost their strenght : from -50 dBm to -60 dBm.<br><br><br>Now I know I am writting this in 2022 and there was a lot of complains back in the 2010-era about the safety of these smartmeters, but working in networking and knowing a bit about signal strenght for network optimization -  and also what they can do the more you are near an AP - I can testify that these are not healthy level of radiations that are emitted from that smartmeter that far away. The room in my house that is adjacent to the wall where the smartmeter is installed outside receives signal strenght of -30 to -40dBm - that&#39;s the same as being 10 feet from your own AP at home in straight line with no obstable in between.  I don&#39;t have my mG reader with me, but I will and measure those signal to see how &quot;cooked&quot; we are getting each day.", "comment_date": "2022-05-28T10:49:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Viren Ramchandani", "comment_text": "Microwave radiation leaking out of microwave should not be mixed with the concept of faraday&#39;s cage.... a microwave oven limits microwaves within walls solely by reflecting/absorbing.... for a farday cage, any internally generated electric field shall be visible outside.", "comment_date": "2022-05-11T06:58:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Asher Goney", "comment_text": "1554hrs at ist", "comment_date": "2022-04-26T10:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kristine Humber", "comment_text": "My Samsung microwave, bought under a year ago, allows my phone to ring inside and stops our internet!

Anyone stood near the appliance would find the softer tissues of their body (liver, kidneys, brain etc.) cooking first, followed by the remainder of your bodily organs. Trust me..... microwaved eyeballs are seriously not good for your general well-being. So folks, get your microwave oven tested once a year by an approved appliance engineer to ensure there is no microwave radiation leakage. \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2019-12-14T11:51:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carolin von Petzholdt", "comment_text": "I just dump my old Mircowave which is 10 years old because I did the cell phone test. <br>I bought a brand new expensive Mircowave and did the cell test via WiFi.

It used to be that you could unscrew the antenna and put in a coax cable to connect to the cell hardware but external antennas disappeared. Note that in the US voice calls would use CDMA band classes 1 and 2 at 850 MHz and 1900 MHz (PCS) and sometimes the auxiliary 800MHz range. But for testing LTE data which runs in the GHz bandclasses we place the mobile UE in the microwave and run an antenna wire inside from the eNodeB. This prevents the UE from attaching to a commercial signal and our testing from affecting any users of the commercial signal. We are not allowed to bleed any RF.<br><br>Another interesting fact is that some high efficiency energy saving windows are very good at blocking LTE radio ranges. So much so that I have seen a demonstration where a mobile was placed less that two feet from from the eNodeB antenna and one of those salesman demonstration mini windows placed between them. The mobile lost communication immediately.

RF signals that travel through the air experience significant reflections off the ground/houses/walls/people/furniture/etc.  These reflections creating interference patterns as the reflected signals add and subtract and these patterns change dynamically as the &quot;environment&quot; that the signals travel through changes.  The interference patterns are very small in scale, where moving the phone by a few inches in any direction can create massive changes of 20 dB (a factor of 100) or more in received signal strength.  A person moving, or leaves rustling on the trees outside create dynamic changes to the environment.<br><br>The implication is that whether a certain microwave allowed a call to ring or not could be simply dumb luck related to the dynamic environment of the RF signals travelling between the phone and tower.<br><br>The &quot;Faraday cage&quot; of the microwave oven is by no means perfect.  Since the metal if the microwave box is not a perfect electrical conductor, there will always be some signal leakage, but it does act as a very good attenuator of the signal (60-70+ dB).  Depending on the signal strength available outside of the oven (which has to do with many factors including distance to the tower, presence of trees foliage, ground topography, building materials used in the house, the RF fading environment discussed above, and more) the signal strength inside the oven will be 60+ dB less.

A frequency too low would not<br>warm up your food, too high would only warm up the outside.<br>When engineers<br>wanted to bring this to the market, they ran into a problem: you need<br>a license to broadcast electromagnetic waves. As it was impossible<br>for everyone to study for a license, in 1947 the 2.4 GHz was made<br>free into a Industry, Scientific and Medical band. Now every<br>housewife could cook without having to be a radio amateur.<br><br>Time progressed,<br>internet came, and so did wireless internet. The inventors of Wi-Fi<br>now had the same issue: it is impossible for everyone to obtain a<br>radio license, so they had to choose an available ISM band. The 2.4<br>GHz ISM band was a good choice: it had quite a large allowed<br>bandwidth (thus allowing for more data rate), and it was<br>internationally standardized (which was necessary for transatlantic<br>ships to have microwave ovens). Thus, not so coincidental. See<br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band#History\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band#History</a><br><br>Having that out of<br>the way, I do know quite sure why your Wi-Fi works, while your<br>telephone signal doesn\u2019t (and it\u2019s not what you are saying).<br>Shielding effectiveness always decreases with frequency, so 2.4 GHz<br>is definitely shielded more than 700 MHz. Note that 2.4 GHz<br>corresponds to 12 cm wavelength, thus the assumption that the grating<br>is much smaller than the wavelength is valid.<br><br>For a call, your<br>phone needs to reach a base station, which can be either next doors,<br>or maybe up to a kilometer away (or even further if you are unlucky).<br>The base stations are those vertical white bars which are usually<br>grouped in three, mostly with some white disk on top of them. The<br>signal, although it is transmitting much power, needs to reach your<br>house, and then penetrate your house, thus losing nearly all of its<br>power. Electromagnetic power is four times lower for every time your<br>distance doubles, which is the same with sound. So you can imagine<br>your phone having to listen to someone yelling 1 km away from your<br>house while it is having its ears buried in fluffy pillows. And it<br>needs to yell back in the pillow such that the base station can still<br>clearly hear it, 1 km away from the house\u2026 You get the point.<br><br>For<br>Wi-Fi this is different. Although the maximum power of your router is<br>much smaller, it is also much closer. You can imagine this as having<br>a conversation at normal volume with someone in the same room as you,<br>while you have your ears and mouth in fluffy pillows. Hard, but<br>doable. <br><br>To make it a bit more technical, I have done a little<br>test myself. I used the Wi-Fi analyzer app on my smartphone to<br>measure the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) of my 2.4 GHz<br>Wi-Fi in and outside my (old) microwave oven. Since my router is<br>close, my RSSI outside the oven was high (-37 dBm, 0.2 microwatts:<br>yes, this is considered high). Inside my microwave oven the RSSI<br>dropped to 68 dBm (0.2 nanowatts), which is doable for Wi-Fi. I still<br>had a link budget of around 10 to 20 dB left before my phone would<br>start malfunctioning. Thus, the shielding effectiveness of my old<br>microwave oven at 2.4 GHz is around 30 dB: a factor 1000.

We see tops for fizzy bottles with built in pumps in the stores that claim to keep the drink carbonated by pumping air into the bottle and pressurizing it.  But they don&#39;t.  The Partial Gas Law tells us that the presence of air (mostly Nitrogen and Oxygen) doesn&#39;t affect the pressure of CO2 at all no matter how much of it there is in the bottle.  The CO2 ignores it completely.   And the amount of CO2 in air is only 0.038% so pumping up these devices adds virtually no CO2 to your drink.  And it&#39;s dissolved CO2 that makes your drink fizzy and nothing else.<br><br>So the only way to fizz up your flat drink is to add CO2 directly with a Soda Stream machine, a bit of dry ice or...
