I understand why we see true yellow light as yellow and also red/green as yellow because our cones have overlapping sensitivity ranges.  I deal with radio filters and they have what is called Q which is how tightly they filter or pass a frequency range.  My question is why does violet light (400ish nm) look violet AND when you mix red/blue we see the same violet?  Does it have something to do with either the blue or red cones each responding to blue and red light?  I know that deep red, near IR, is around 800nm and that deep violet (not to be confused with Deep Purple) is around 400nm.  Is it that the blue cones see the second harmonic of the red light in the violet range and thus be responsive to both?<br>OR visa/versa?", "comment_date": "2019-03-09T22:12:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zurski_", "comment_text": "Don\u2019t worry.

Also when I&#39;m at the beach and I have my eyes closed for a couple of minutes, once I open them again the sandy beach looks greenish.

Mixing pure red and green pigment should produce yellow. The only problem is that while colors of light get lighter as they are mixed, colors of pigment get darker as they are mixed. Thus, mixing pure red and green pigment will produce a dark yellow, which is a brownish color. This is also why mixing red and blue pigment gives a dark, often unsightly purple instead of a bright one. Another interesting fact is that while the primary colors of light are red, green, and blue, and the secondary colors are cyan, magenta and yellow, with pigment the primary and secondary colors are reversed. This is demonstrated with printers, which use magenta, yellow and cyan to make every hue. The classic color system with red, yellow and blue is just plain wrong.", "comment_date": "2018-05-04T01:12:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UNWONO", "comment_text": "Green is not a primary color.

If you add blue paint to yellow paint, it becomes green paint. this is called subtractive mixing (subtractive as in light is absorbed by the paint, hence the &quot;subtraction&quot; of colors). Light, however, is different. Adding two colors of light together is called additive mixing. It&#39;s called additive mixing because combining (adding) the two lights creates a different color light. there&#39;s no material for this light to be absorbed (subtracted) into since light doesn&#39;t absorb light. it just blends together. For paint, the paint is absorbing light and reflecting one shade of light. <br><br>... Did this help anyone?...<br><br>I prolly made everyone more confused... <br>Sorry.

That would be the most common display technology. The cones are more correctly called LMS or long, medium and short wavelength. Cones can&#39;t normally be activated in isolation, so a cone doesn&#39;t correspond to any normal color. Devising a way to do it such as by tiring only certain cones (which was mentioned in the video but for a different purpose) produces so-called imaginary colors. Short of exploiting such limitations in the visual system, you could for example note the color of light at the wavelength where the response of a particular cone peaks. Then S=blue, M=bluish green, L=yellowish green.<br><br>Yellow isn&#39;t defined to be monochromatic light at a wavelength of 580 nm. It&#39;s a percept based on the integration of multiple kinds of cones. There are many ways to produce a particular color. A blend of multiple wavelengths only constrains saturation. We aren&#39;t bipedal spectrometers! Besides, how would you define something like white or purple? Neither can be produced by any single wavelength. A mix of red and green run through a low-pass filter or any kind of optical mixing process really IS yellow.<br><br>There are some variations in pigments between people. There&#39;s also how aging yellows the lens. This is why there are subtle variations between people who would all be considered to have normal color vision. It&#39;s generally close enough that most of us would agree for the most part.<br><br>Color wheels get really messy. Additive color is easy: simply linear combinations, however many dimensions you&#39;re using to evaluate colors. The gamut is always a nice convex polytope. Subtractive color (which is a bit of a misnomer) is much trickier because interactions across the entire spectrum matter. You can&#39;t simply reduce it to a few channels to model it accurately. Reflection and absorption have different results, too. This is why an RGB monitor can easily produce white but CMY ink can&#39;t produce proper black. And then in printing there&#39;s halftone patterns, dot gain, etc.<br><br>Tetrachromacy doesn&#39;t seem to happen in a meaningful way in humans. There are some numbers going around but very few have demonstrated increased discrimination in practice. Interestingly, they tend to be women who would&#39;ve been like men with color vision deficiency if not for their additional X chromosome. The pigment that normally reduces color discrimination is now just an additional pigment.<br><br>If you take all this into account the video is fine. :-)", "comment_date": "2016-02-03T22:20:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edgar Pande", "comment_text": "who clicked this video coz the thumbnail is like markipoo and jackaboy?", "comment_date": "2016-02-03T07:31:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nabbie", "comment_text": "what about black?", "comment_date": "2016-02-02T22:32:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Henrix98", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNOKWoDtbSk&amp;t=3m29s\">3:29</a> I was just like, yeah, you forgot to change colors<br><br>Probably mobile YouTube still uses 30fps and every cyan frame filtered off", "comment_date": "2016-02-02T22:07:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KayJay", "comment_text": "I saw white, red and cyan.", "comment_date": "2016-02-02T19:04:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ava Smith", "comment_text": "Is the white/blue thing have anything to do with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23the\">#the</a> dress?", "comment_date": "2016-02-02T08:23:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Narf Farf", "comment_text": "XD if you watch at x2 speed eyes cant even pick up the change and if you play back from start it has chances of being red or blue. i didnt notice and got lost till played back and saw blue and red changing than notice at X2 speed", "comment_date": "2016-02-02T03:34:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Syburiz G.", "comment_text": "I think this video just brought to my attention I&#39;m color blind.

Thus, the color we&#39;re seeing leans a bit towards a light gray even before our human perception factors in (because the pixels &quot;travel&quot; towards red and cyan, maybe not even reaching them fully on slower screens). Not by much on modern LCDs, but it is a factor.
