I build unusual clocks (with my collaborator Guy Marsden) and I was inspired by your straw levitation of a ping pong ball. After looking deeper into the subject of ping pong ball levitation I reckoned I could display the hour of the day if I could get the ball to float, in  a reproducible manner, to a unique height for each hour. Turns out the ideal way to do this would be by using a PID controller and unfortunately such electronics are well beyond my expertise. I think I found a pretty cool work around. The video shows how I created a stack of &quot;nodes&quot; where the ball wants to settle in for the ride. Just as the ball wants to stay in the center of the air stream that keeps it aloft, the ball also wants to stay in the gaps between the short tube segments. I&#39;m now building a refined prototype before making the final clock. Thanks for the inspiration. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/00HXj4hj2Jo\">https://youtu.be/00HXj4hj2Jo</a>", "comment_date": "2020-06-21T00:51:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "KHOA LUONG", "comment_text": "U have the longest neck", "comment_date": "2020-05-15T21:55:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just a Bearded guy That is a hero for gear", "comment_text": "You realy know what u r doing", "comment_date": "2020-02-01T12:32:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sandro Giacomuzzi", "comment_text": "Your explanation is equivalent to the Bernoulli principle, right?

I remember that once our prof told us that this works also with a stream of water! I remember that he used it as an example for the Magnus effect, i.e. that the spin of the ball plays a crucial role.
