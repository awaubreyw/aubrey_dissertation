When you discribed the San Andrea&#39;s fault slipping away a little at a time. Could it be possible that it slipped away little by little in like 1 year?  I am wondering about the validity of how long something takes to accomplish from the eyes of geology.  The foot prints in white sands national park have several layers of different footprints.  I question a lot of things I do apologize.  I am trying to possibly fully understand some things.  <br><br>Time and gemstones!  I think of the ?2018? volcanic eruption in Hawaii that had olivine fall from the sky. <br><br>I guess the main thoughts that I have questions to at the moment are liquid flows and difference in flow patterns (water, mud, hot ?lava? mud, and lava itself depending on typ of rock recipe available for volcano).<br><br>The other thought involves time it takes for Geological events to occur.  Does the moon effect the earth (yes) if so then to what effect does it have on movement of plate in the earth and what about distance of moon 2000 years ago vs today.  In addition weather events like glaciers,  lakes like Bonneville lake, or other such things that change weather like intense volcanic eruptions.   Also I am curious about land mass 2000 years ago vs today.  I wonder about land mass because it is said that Mt Everest grows a certain amount in height every year.  If I look at the Google maps.  I can see a line in the pacific ocean and stretch marks on either side of that line. Suggesting to me land mass was smaller.  <br><br>Then this caused me to think about the type of rotation the earth and moon must have had at that time.  I think of a ball that has to much weight on one portion of a ball. Like a big wide mole or wart.  Does the earth spin faster when moon was closer? Does the land mass location change rotation?  I know of a meteor  that hit the United States in Arizona.  Was that while it was in water or on dry land that that had occured?", "comment_date": "2022-06-28T18:23:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ayesha de Queiroz", "comment_text": "I live downwind of that stinkpot.

It\u2019s like bogey boarding on a sand dune, you can feel the house shifting on sand, rather than being jolted as I have experienced elsewhere. I can hear them coming, it\u2019s so bizarre. When we\u2019ve had earthquakes from a different direction, it feels completely different.

So, therefore energy should be a constant value. It is also true that the universe is expanding and accelerating its expantion, which needs force. A constant force or energy can only accelerate an object to a specific velocity. But here the universe seems to accelerate to an infinite velocity. The query is that, from where does this energy coming which causes this acceleration, if energy is constant. It seems as if energy is being created in this process. Dark energy should also be a constant force.

The motion of North America is off angle with the midocean ridge so parts too the south get stretched more and eventually basaltic magma is able to rise up and start the sea floor spreading the part where this occurs is the Gulf of California so the Salton Sea will one day be part of this system and California will be torn off completely as the East Pacific Rise once again becomes off shore as part of the pacific until one day in the future they will reaccrete onto North America or I guess Amur is a possibility too?
