Volume of 1000kg iron balls = 127 liter. That&#39;s the volume of water it will displace when you sink it. But it is being kept  afloat by the ship, the volume of water it  displaces is equal  in weight to the weight of iron balls. <br>Weight of 1000kg iron =10KN. Equivalent volume of water 10KN/10 =1000kg = 1000liter. (The power of metric system YAYYYY). SO Water level should decrease to compensate for 1000-127 = 873liters.", "comment_date": "2018-10-23T07:20:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MBRSLITDESK Vashi", "comment_text": "Also Definition of Antigravity?", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T11:46:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MBRSLITDESK Vashi", "comment_text": "What is the difference between Molecular weight and Molecular density?

The wood is now lighter than the metal.<br><br>Problem 2:<br><br>Circumference is 2\u03c0r so if you had 10 ft telephone poles all the way across the planet, you would be adding 10 ft to the planet&#39;s radius. That is tiny for planets.<br><br>So starting with a unit circle and thus a circumference of 2\u03c0, if you add 10 to the radius, the circumference increases to 22\u03c0. This is a difference of 2r(2 times the added radius). So in this case, the amount you add to the circumference is 2\u03c0r.<br><br>If the circle instead had a radius of 10 and you added 10 to the radius you would get 40\u03c0 and the original circumference being 20\u03c0.<br><br>So for any circle, even a planet, increasing the radius by 10 increases the circumference by 20\u03c0. And thus you get 2\u03c0r added to the circumference for all possible added radii, assuming of course that gravity does not affect this increase in circumference by putting an upper limit on the radius that can be added before it gets so massive that the added radius:added circumference ratio drifts wildly away from this 2\u03c0r.", "comment_date": "2017-08-09T23:48:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vani Vasil", "comment_text": "If two objects with the same volume but the different weight jump in the water the level will be different", "comment_date": "2017-08-08T02:40:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vani Vasil", "comment_text": "it depends on the rock", "comment_date": "2017-08-08T02:34:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ezurth", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVT1c0tr8NE&amp;t=0m14s\">0:14</a> sec in same the wait of the rock ways the boat down and tossing it in boat rises but rock still takes up space in the water<br><br>edit<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVT1c0tr8NE&amp;t=0m25s\">0:25</a> sec in i ralised depends on density of rock and water", "comment_date": "2017-08-06T01:32:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yosen B.

I search all over the internet, they all say that a balance is a mass measuring device. (really?) So, sucking all the air out, you are still comparing two blocks of the same mass, therefore, they balance. So far so good.<br>Here is my confusion\u2026 #1. How does a beam balance works. If I hang two identical object on the two sides of the balance. According to Newton, the force acting on them would be (each, ignoring the force between the objects themselves since the earth is way massive than these two objects) f=G.m1.m2/r^2, where m1 is the mass of the object, m2 is the mass of the earth, r is the distance between the object and the center of the earth. Now, if I push down on the one side and then let go, the object on this side now is closer to the center of the earth, r is smaller, thus, f becomes larger, therefore this side would not comes up again since this side has a bigger downward force than the other. See the problem? Confusion #2\u2026 If I use f=ma method (in vacuum) to find a wood and a lead block of the same mass. Certainly they would have different volume. In use, they will displace different amount of air, according to Archimedes principle, the up thrust they experience would be different. Thus their weight (downward force of the earth acting on them) would be different, will they still balance the scale?  (they still have the same mass)<br><br>problem 2: I\u2019ve difficulty using extreme case method to figure out the extra length of the cable. The way I see it, we have to establish the extra length has nothing to do with the size of the planet, shrink the planet down to zero, the different in length would just be 2 pi 10. OK, so far so good, but how do you convince me about the relationship of the extra length and the size. You may say \u2026 look at the equation, the different is 2 pi (r+10) minus 2 pi r. Alright, if you present this to me, I would say you don\u2019t need the extreme case at all, since the equation clearly shown the extra length was independent of radius. See the dilemma? No equation, can not establish relation, with equation, no need extreme case.

That said, both the second water example and the the planet circumference problem (if I am right about the intended extreme case) are bad examples of extreme cases. Let me try to explain why. Consider the planet problem. Now instead of the length of the wire what if we are interested in the surface area of a &quot;Protective shield&quot; we constructed at a height of 10km from the planet surface (to fend off an alien invasion!). By the same logic we could say that the extra surface area is the area of a sphere of radius 10km (by zeroing down the radius of the planet), which is obviously false. That&#39;s because circumference is linearly dependent on radius whereas surface area is not.<br>The key here is that extreme cases are useful when answering questions about whether a certain quantity has increased or decreased, because it reasonable to assume it will be one way or the other. However quantities which remain constant in an extreme situation are not reliable because it might be an extreme case of the governing equation itself wherein zeroing out a certain variable zeroes out the resulting increment/decrement thus being completely non-indicative of possible non zero values of the same.<br>P.S.

However, the fact that they are balanced doesn&#39;t mean that they have the same mass, but rather that they have the same weight. This weight comes from gravitational force, but is lowered by buoyancy when air is present in the chamber. <br>    The force F1 with which the Earth attracts each cube is proportional to its mass: F1 = mg (for each cube). Buoyancy (let&#39;s call it force F2), when an object is surrounded by a liquid, is directly dependent on the volume of the object: F2 = Vdg = (m/d&#39;)*dg, where m, V and d&#39; are, respectively, the mass, volume and density of the object and d is the density of the liquid. The total weight F of a cube is then: F = F1 - F2 = mg - (m/d&#39;)*dg = mg(1-d/d&#39;). So, unless d=0 (vacuum), this weight is dependent both on the mass and density of our cube.<br>    In the first part of the problem, when air was present, the cubes where balanced, thus their total weights were equal. If you now say that their masses are equal, you will contradict yourself, because it would lead to a conclusion that the cubes are equal in density (only then the weight could be equal), which is false.<br>    Summing up, in my opinion, the problem presented in the way you did is internally flawed because it is contains a false statement. I believe that deleting the part: &quot;so that they have the same mass&quot; would correct the error, since this sentence is a wrong conclusion, and make the problem solvable.<br>    I hope my note, though lengthy, gets to you so that I may receive a reply from you.", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T17:40:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nitin Sharma", "comment_text": "The answer of the second problem is 20xpi..<br>do let me know, if i am correct", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T17:33:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abhishek Jha", "comment_text": "initially floating and finally sinking = water level goes down <br>initially as well as finally floating = water level stays same :)", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T15:41:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dorian Greer", "comment_text": "Why is the mass of the object relevant, when the only thing that should matter is the volume of displacement?

So it could be a tanker or a bit of aluminium foil, doesn&#39;t matter. <br><br>Now, when the object is placed in the boat, we can consider the water level change as being proportional to the mass of the object in the boat (ie bigger mass = bigger displacement = larger water level rise). So the object could be the size of a building, a toothbursh or say a speck of dust, it doesn&#39;t matter.<br><br>However, when the object is placed in the water, its mass is completely irrelevant (I am assuming it has large enough density and thus sinks).

If it were an object the size of a football stadium, but only weighed the same as say a football, then it would barely raise the water level when in the boat and raise the water level a lot (and sink very slowly) when not in the boat.<br><br>If it makes it easier to understand imagine a small box with water in it. Now imagine a small object instantaneously appears on the bottom of the box and stays there. It doesn&#39;t matter at all how heavy this object is, just how large it is as the space it now occupies used to be occupied by water. Where&#39;d the water go? well.. up. the water level rises to compensate for the object suddenly appearing in a space where the water used to be.

Yet both volume and weight are important on both ends of the &quot;equation&quot;. The speculation was that the rock was small but very heavy. So it caused the boat to displace more water because of the weight. The important thing is the volume of the rock not its weight when you cast it in. Because the weight of the boat is reduced by exactly the same amount as the weight of the rock added to the water. The total weight present in the water is constant. The total volume is not.<br><br>If you reverse your speculation to the other extreme you get an opposite result. Assume your rock is as big as a planet but weighs nearly zero...just dense enough to sink in water. When you throw it over the side, the boat&#39;s displacement does not change much because the weight pressing it down does not change much either. So the water does go down but not by nearly as much as dumping a planet sized rock into the water would do to raise it. The answer would be the water rises by an enormous amount in that case. Because it isn&#39;t based solely on weight...it is the volume also that matters. You stated that you &quot;could make the argument that this will be the case for every rock that starts in the boat and sinks in water.&quot; Yet I just gave you an example where making such an argument would make you look like you are cherry picking extremes to get the answer you want. Since the volume of the boat never changes in your assumption.<br><br>Likewise, if your boat is smaller than an atom, even a black hole sitting on top of it will not displace much water (assuming it will remain floating of course). You have to take volume into account when you look at the boat, and also you must consider the volume of the rock when you throw it over the side. You did neither of these things and so your speculation was inappropriate...well you did say the rock was tiny so I guess you sort of breezed over its volume and got half of it in there.<br><br>The water will only go down every time if you tear off a piece of the boat and throw it over as your &quot;rock&quot;. So you are losing both weight and volume when you throw it over the side. Actually, I am thinking that the water will stay the same if the volume of the boat is reduced by the same amount as the volume of the rock. The weight already does that (i.e. the weight lost by the boat = the weight of the rock added to the water). So it is the volume difference that becomes the important element to examine. If the boat loses much less volume than the volume of the rock, the water goes up. If the boat loses much more volume than the volume of the rock, the water goes down. In your speculation it was the latter (boat loses zero volume, rock has tiny volume), for my planet sized lightweight rock speculation it is the former (boat loses zero volume, rock has huge volume). When the ratio (Boat Volume lost) / (Rock Volume) is\u00a0larger, the water will go down, When it is small, the water goes up. When it is = 1, water does not change. With the assumption that the boat&#39;s volume does not change, you can use the ratio (Total Volume present in the water) / (Rock Volume added to the water) instead to reason the same conclusion.<br>Isn&#39;t that right?", "comment_date": "2016-02-13T08:33:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Axe Murderer", "comment_text": "Planet and wire problem.<br><br>Assume there are no poles, just a wire.

This has the effect of increasing the radius of the circle by 10 since every pole is 10 long and is placed on the surface of the Earth. How long is the wire now? Well, using the same formula you get 2*PI*(r + 10).<br><br>How much longer is the wire on the poles?

The first says that there are an infinite number of equal length poles installed. If this was not the case then the wire would necessarily dip below the surface of the larger circle in between each pole. And therefore it would end up being shorter than the circumference of the outer circle because the wire does not rest entirely on the surface of the circle but cuts across it between every two poles. The second assumption is that the wire is being stretched so taught in between each pole that a straight line is achieved. If it were allowed to sag, like it does in reality due to a combination of gravity and the tensile strength of the wire, then\u00a0depending on the amount of this sag permitted, the wire could potentially end up being even longer than if an infinite number of poles was installed. And thirdly, it is assumed that the poles are placed at uniform intervals around the circle such that the distance between every two adjacent poles is the same all the way around. And finally, the &quot;planet&quot; is assumed to be a perfect sphere. If any of these assumptions is not true, then the formula 2*PI*L is going to be way off when you are working at planetary scales.<br><br>A more interesting question would be to specify a finite number of poles and assume the wire sags in between each of them to an equivalent degree.

The video concluded that the water level would drop, but that&#39;s only when it&#39;s level is measured by the height of it&#39;s outer edge in a pressure vessel, such as the plastic tub. If you measured the water level across the entire surface, including what is depressed by the hull of the boat, and then generated an average height it would be the same before and after tossing the rock out.  Both the puzzle being presented and its answer aren&#39;t correlating all of the variables involved in the situation.  The extreme cases don&#39;t help to solve the problem in this case because they&#39;re only presenting more ignored variables.  In order to teach someone how to solve a problem it&#39;s important to help them understand how to assess the situation surrounding the problem and determine precise details to every factor that influences the problem at hand.  Overall the presentation is still useful for inciting discussion, so I don&#39;t want to be negative about it.<br><br>  Problem 1 at the end is interesting and has several factors.  The wood and the lead are initially the same mass and balanced in the scale, the scale is placed in a glass chamber and all the air is removed, and the question is about how the balance will behave in the vacuum.  So the variables include the relative properties of wood and lead in regards to how their relative masses would be affected by a vacuum.  Atmospheric pressure is removed, but is still the same for both objects. Relative surface area generally wouldn&#39;t be an issue, but since the vacuum chamber is a curved dome there is a scaled variance to the position of each measured object to the sides of the dome. Does that matter?  Wood is a porous material with a normative amount of air and water content.  Water boils in a vacuum and air is obviously removed, so does the wood lose all of its free internal air and moisture?  Is the weight of the air and moisture in the wood part of its original calculated mass in regards to the problem at hand? If air and moisture are trapped inside some of the wood&#39;s cells does the internal pressure from the water wanting to boil change the scale&#39;s ability to determine the wood&#39;s mass by gravitational relativity? In other words is the pressure radially applied, cause lift against gravity in a vacuum, or create downward pressure? (a balloon filled with helium has mass but weighs negatively on a scale)  What is the species of the wood and can a particular species change the overall outcome when considering all the variables at hand?  Generally we would think that because of what is being presented, wood versus lead in a vacuum, that the wood should become lighter because it loses some of its intrinsic mass.  That is based only on the assumption that these properties of wood versus metal would be the common knowledge point of discussion.  It&#39;s also worth considering that the lead could have properties that would be affected by being in a vacuum, but I&#39;m not presently aware of any that could be relevant. The easiest thing to do would be to just perform the experiment presented in the problem and record the result, but that by itself doesn&#39;t yield any critical answers. What is does may not be as important as why it does it.

Imagine that instead of a wooden block and a lead block, you have nothing on one side of the scale, and a balloon full of helium attached to the other side. With air in the chamber, the side with the helium balloon attached will rise as the helium balloon pulls up on it - this is because the air is providing a buoyant force on the balloon. Once all the air is removed from the chamber, the side with the helium balloon falls - the lack of buoyant force from air makes it evident that the side with the helium balloon has more mass than the side with nothing.<br>2. Imagine that the Earth was a single point with a radius of 0m, and therefore a circumference of 0m.

Here are the facts: a) Air is a fluid, and so we can apply Archimede&#39;s principle to this situation of blocks in a chamber full of air. b) Archimede&#39;s principle states that the buoyant force applied on an object in a fluid is equal to the weight of the volume of fluid displaced by that object. c) We can conclude that the wooden block, having a greater volume, displaces more air than the lead block, and so there is a greater buoyant force on the wooden block pushing it upwards. d) When the air is removed from the chamber, there is no longer that greater buoyant force pushing the wooden block upwards and so the wooden block tips down the scale.<br>2.

It&#39;s actually a very easy problem than it what is shown in this video.<br><br>If a rock sinks, then it is evident that the amount of water which would be needed to be displaced resulting in the increase in water level couldn&#39;t be displaced. When the rock was on top of the boat it could displace a much larger volume of water and hence could prevent the rock from sinking. It results in much larger rise in water level than the former.<br><br>I think, extreme cases should be used for verifying theories, because theories let you determine the result without having to set up a practical demonstration. Understanding theories also makes you understand the working of this world in a much better way.<br><br>Problem 1: Initially, both are of the same mass (given), and buoyancy of air is to be considered. The wood has much larger volume than the lead and hence displaces much larger volume of air. So, if the panes of the balance would have the same mass, the one with the lead would be lower than the other. But since they are properly balanced (given), the mass of the pane with the wood must be greater than the plane having lead on it (neglecting the other masses of the balance and considering the volume of both the panes are the same). So, if vacuum is created, then the pane with the wood would be lowered much more than that of lead.<br><br>Problem 2: Since, the circumference can never be integral multiple of 10, \u03c0 being irrational, I&#39;m going to consider a disc of 10 m. high, instead of telephone poles which forms a polygon instead of a circle. Let, the radius of the Earth be &#39;r&#39; in metres. Hence it&#39;s circumference is 2\u03c0r. The circumference of the Earth with the telephone poles=2\u03c0(r+10).

The infinitely dense anchor takes up the same volume as the infinitesimally denser anchor, so when you throw it into the water it&#39;s going to raise the level equally(if you were standing on the bank).
