Eventually, the Big Island will slowly erode into the sea. Other islands appearing in the east, each larger and younger than the preceding ones west of them, will continue to form over the mantle plume. One day, the Big Island will be an underwater shallow reef somewhere west of the new, future Hawaii islands that have yet to be formed.

When an asteroid hits the earth, the shock waves race around the earth and blow out the other side where they meet (the antipode).  It is thought that the Chicxulub impact in the Yucatan blew out the Deccan Flats in India (the Reunion Hot Spot) which magnetism and lava attracted the Shiva asteroid soon after.  That asteroid smashed open the Reunion Magma Chamber, leaving a teardrop crater and massive volcanism.    The asteroid hit the earth so hard it broke the plate, separating India from the Seychelles Islands and shoving India at high speed up into China.  The crater today is partly on the plate with the Seychelles but mostly on the Indian plate off the coast of Mumbai.  Oil companies have drilled there for decades.

Only volcanoes along the edge of the tectonic plates explode because they have super heated water in them that explodes when released from the high pressures in the magma flow.  This is why the volcanoes of Hawaii only emerge into a pool and flow out down the slopes.  Volcanoes such as Mt. Saint Helen are caused by the clashing of tectonic plates which also pumps water into the magma chamber.

Change my mind (or refute me If you can). The &quot;chemical evolution&quot; hypothesis of Oparin doesn&#39;t make any chemical sense. The first living cell, with a minimum of 256 protein-coding genes, ATP production capacity, filled with complex molecular machinery, and self-replicating, could not have formed spontaneously according to our current knowledge. For life 4 classes of compounds are needed: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleotides, we don&#39;t know how to synthesize any of those in prebiotic-like conditions. What we know is that in order to synthesize then, a series of intermediate steps are necessary, and that these intermediate products (and final products) are frequently unstable to air, light, water..., (the peptide bonds of proteins, for example, rapidly undergo hydrolysis in water), which means that time is a not a good argument in favor of abiogenesis, the whole process would have to occur very rapidly. Also, life compounds are homochiral, but random reactions produce racemic mixtures (for example, the aminoacids produced by Urey-Miller are racemic, while life&#39;s proteins are made (almost exclusevily) of l-aminoacids), and that is a huge problem in terms of chemical synthesis. Also, the proposed reactions for the prebiotic synthesis of nucleotides are thermodynamically unfavourable, meaning they do not occur spontaneously. And that is only the beginning of the problem, even If we had all the molecules, we have no idea how to build a cell. All the nanotechnology that we have developed so far looks like &quot;childplay&quot; in comparison with the &quot;simplest&quot; cell. In summary, from the point of view of the chemical sciences, origin of life remains a total mistery.  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zU7Lww-sBPg\">https://youtu.be/zU7Lww-sBPg</a><br><br><a href=\"https://inference-review.com/article/animadversions-of-a-synthetic-chemist\">https://inference-review.com/article/animadversions-of-a-synthetic-chemist</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/project/Synthetic-routes-of-the-fundamental-building-blocks-of-life\">https://www.researchgate.net/project/Synthetic-routes-of-the-fundamental-building-blocks-of-life</a>", "comment_date": "2020-03-21T23:48:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guy Skillen", "comment_text": "Not that you&#39;ll read this, but Hot Spots DO NOT originate in the outer core!

But the Hawaiian Islands are by no means unique. In May of this year, my partner and I, along with two wonderful ladies, visited the French Indian Ocean island of LA REUNION (previously the Isle Bourbon), where the mighty shield volcano PITON DE LA FOURNAISE, dominates the southern third of the island; whilst the extinct PITON DES NEIGES towers over the northern section, rising to 10,070 ft; making it the highest point in the Indian Ocean. In many ways the island resembles a &#39;mini-Hawaii&#39;, because it is only 40 miles x 30 miles; and the scenery is spectacular. FOURNAISE is also over a hotspot (it was once beneath the Deccan Traps of western India, and then Mauritius), and is one of the most accessible volcanoes on Earth.

We clearly don\u2019t know what is going. Maybe it\u2019s an inter dimensional influences, who knows, but this should bother people as something we just don\u2019t get. Something in Earth must be stationary in order to have a stationary hot spot.

I pray people don&#39;t just shrug off all this as if it is just another normal day on earth.

I am praying for Hawaii and all who have lost their homes and that it would stop, but it seems like they say it could go on for years. Truly sorrowful. I never even got to go in person. The waves there are legendary for sure. God be with us all as the world has gone insane, and we need to seek God and trust in Jesus our only hope in all of this.

Three super-eruptions at Yellowstone appear to have occurred on a 600,000-700,000 year cycle starting 2.1 million years ago. The most recent took place 640,000 years ago \u2013 suggesting Yellowstone is overdue for an eruption. There are about 20 known supervolcanoes on Earth - including Lake Toba in Indonesia, Lake Taupo in New Zealand, and the somewhat smaller Phlegraean Fields near Naples, Italy. Super-eruptions occur rarely - only once every 100,000 years on average. Given Yellowstone&#39;s past history, the yearly probability of another caldera-forming eruption can be approximated as 1 in 730,000 or 0.00014%. However, this number is based simply on averaging the two intervals between the three major past eruptions at Yellowstone \u2014 this is hardly enough to make a critical judgment. Yellowstone has had at least three such eruptions: The three eruptions, 2.1 million years ago, 1.2 million years ago and 640,000 years ago, were about 6,000, 700 and 2,500 times larger than the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mt.

Unfortunately fro the brainwashing theory we are taught since birth is that full moon is often on earth&#39;s day sky, sometimes even with the sun at its back!!! How is this possible???

They\u2019re independent deposits; snapshots can be flipped back and forth, not topography. What we see at the surface today is more of a collage. Also Hawaii isn\u2019t exactly a flood basalt environment, it\u2019s a shield volcano that erupts very non-viscous lavas (compared to silicious melts) and produce the wide/shallow slope vents iconic in the area. Flood basalts flood, basalt flows flow. How do you flood if you\u2019re in the ocean? It\u2019s already flooded.<br><br>As the Pacific plate moves over the plume, new magma compositions are temporarily produced as the oceanic crust partially melts at depth and forms a calc-alkaline melt that behaves very differently than the basalt typically fed into the system by the plume. This makes newly forming volcanoes in the Hawaii region a bit more violent, but they\u2019re usually built up from the sea floor where the underlying plume heats the preexisting crustal material. These would be even less flood-like, but I must admit I imagine the time it takes to melt the cold, wet oceanic crust may allow for the region to build pressure and further increase the melt material by pressure melting until it finally bursts.

Here are some things to consider:<br>1) Even if a hot plume of magma could slowly rise through the entire mantle, the plume would lose heat to colder, overlying rock. This heat loss would exceed the excess heat in the plume. Calculations show that hot plumes cannot rise from the outer core and produce flood basalts. Nor will current processes open cracks in the mantle so a plume can rise.Confining pressures under the crust are simply too great.<br>2) There are long chains of submarine volcanoes that intersected the Hawaiian chain\u2014some at large angles. It is now recognized that if hotspots exist, they must move.<br>3) Other volcanic chains, such as the Bermuda Rise, are almost perpendicular to the claimed movements of their plates.<br>4) If the mantle circulates enough to move a plate, why is a hotspot\u2019s plume in that moving mantle fixed? <br>5) If a chain of volcanoes means its plate is drifting, does an isolated volcano mean that its plate is not drifting? <br>6) Faster moving plates should have fewer volcanic cones \u201cburned\u201d through them than slower plates. Just the opposite is the case.<br>7) The chemistry of rocks comprising these \u201chotspot\u201d chains indicates that the magma originated from the upper mantle, not the lower mantle boundary as claimed by plate tectonics.<br>8) Other island chains show no correlation between age dates of rocks along the progression of the chain.<br>9) The hot spot theory doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny:  \u201cIt seems that we must abandon the convenient concept of fixed hotspots as reference points for past plate motions.\u201d Ulrich Christensen, \u201cFixed Hotspots Gone with the Wind,\u201d Nature, Vol. 391, 19 February 1998, p. 740.<br><br>Mantle Circulation is also not backed by facts.  <br>1) Japanese research as far back as 1988 showed that magma has a cross-over depth of about 200 miles.  Meaning, at that depth, the magma&#39;s volume is reduced by about 50 percent and it becomes so dense that it can only sink, not rise.  Below 200 miles, magma sinks, never to rise again.  Magma can&#39;t possibly be coming up from the mantle.<br>2) \u201cA simple calculation shows that if ascent is governed by Stoke\u2019s law, then the great viscosity of the lithosphere (about 1025 poise, if it is viscous at all) ensures that the ascent velocity will be about ten thousand times smaller than that necessary to prevent solidification. A successful ascent could be made only by unrealistically large bodies of magma.\u201d Bruce D. Marsh, \u201cIsland-Arc Volcanism,\u201d Earth\u2019s History, Structure and Materials, editor Brian J. Skinner (Los Altos, California: William Kaufman, Inc., 1980), p. 108 <br>3) Check out the book by N. Christian Smoot, &quot;Tectonic Globaloney&quot; where he catalogs the problems with Plate Tectonics.  He mapped the sea floor for 30 years and says the evidence does not support PT. <br>4)  Calculations are sometimes put forth in an attempt to show that plumes can rise through the mantle. Usually assumed are unrealistically low values for the mantle\u2019s viscosity and density or unrealistically high values for the plume\u2019s initial temperature and volume. These claims take the position, \u201cWe know flood basalts came from the outer core, so here is how it must have happened.\u201d  Other calculations show that a magma plume rising buoyantly and melting its way up from the core-mantle boundary would initially have to exceed the earth\u2019s volume for just one drop of magma to reach the earth\u2019s surface.<br><br>Magnetic Stripes:<br>1) A better explanation of the magnetic stripes on the ocean floor isn&#39;t reversal, it is varying intensity.  More or less magnetism. There is no possible mechanism for reversal of earth&#39;s magnetic field.  Does the core suddenly stop and then start to spin the other way? (dynamo theory)  What happens in the middle-- does earth have NO magnetic field for a short time?   <br>2) In his book, Smoot documents the fact that the magnetic striping pattern on the ocean floor is overwhelmingly NOT lined up with plate boundaries,", "comment_date": "2018-05-27T04:16:08Z", "likes_count": 74}, {"comment_by": "Willy Nelson", "comment_text": "Ok what would cause a tectonic plate to suddenly change direction?", "comment_date": "2018-05-27T03:04:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PabnixTTV", "comment_text": "You can tell he\u2019s really passionate about his job.

When this happens, know that God\u2019s Word will no longer be revered and that humanity will be led into grave error.<br><br>No man, or sacred servant, has been given the authority to overturn the Ten Commandments or the Word of God.

Hawaii is just a big ole fissure where the crust is weak and part of the lava is redirected there much like water when it traverses the path of least resistance.

How do you explain that molten rock with iron in it is magnetic? Molten iron isn&#39;t magnetic or affected by magnetism. There&#39;s a temperature when you forge iron that is non-magnetic, a magnet doesn&#39;t have any visible or tactile effect on the metal. Magnets, any kinds, have their magnetic properties destroyed by applied heat. Increasing the temperature doesn&#39;t re-establish the iron&#39;s magnetic properties only cooling does. And this non-magnetic temperature is nowhere near the melting point or iron. If it is so, then the earth&#39;s magnetic properties are from the iron in the crust and not below it. How can molten iron be magnetic? Please explain this to me if you can. I would really want to know. PLEASE, NO AMATEUR RESPONSES OR THEORIES.

What this planet essentially is when observed using the most basic observation methods is a free energy device/internal combustion engine, the amount of water on the planet is relevant to the amount of water cooling needed to keep the engine cool enough that it doesn&#39;t overheat. Trees and other ecosystems where nature is in abundance act as our warning signs on the dashboard. Volcanoes act as exhaust and the oil we&#39;re so ignorantly removing from the engine and replacing with water is the lubricant based coolant. <br>On that note remove the oil from any internal combustion propelled vehicle/engine you own then replace it with water and see how long it takes for serious shaking and breaking to occur. Then tell me that replacing the crude oil lubricant we have already technologically surpassed the need for ;but we still take is best replaced with water vs a synthetic or vegetable based lubricant (or even better it&#39;s not best we don&#39;t completely eliminate the entire crude oil industry, which in turn would instantly alleviate huge problems both ecologically as well as economically. The world as a whole is held economically hostage by OPEC and other industrialists that built their fortunes on claiming ownership of the Earth&#39;s natural resources (resources that by rite nobody can own or everyone owns). <br>Resources I should add they use to rule over us with via the creation of the illusion that false scarcity exists (this illusion is one that capitalism is entirely reliant upon) within a naturally abundant ecosystem that they themselves have the sole rite of ownership over. <br>This of course despite the fact they only obtained a means of control through invasion and hostile takeover via military means against unarmed peaceful communities, communities that since before the days of the crusades and inquisitions have been systematically erased, only to be converted and white-washed into church and state controlled resources (people included are church and state owned live-stock AKA resources).<br>Our natural operating system &quot;love and compassion&quot; which was coded in a language compatible with the entire planet we&#39;re birthed from and also completely harmonized to the entire operating system of the &quot;universe&quot; (one song) itself has been formatted and replaced with the Church and State&#39;s own &quot;fear and belief&quot; which was given a coding language (English) completely incompatible with the universe and all that&#39;s naturally contained within, plus it&#39;s a language with no administrative programming power for the users who are given very limited access to read/write functions of their own experience. The English language was systematically created to be the language of slaves, it&#39;s a completely dead language. Even basic tonoscope tests when used to compare English to ancient languages proves my claim ;but also studying of words going back to their usually Greek and Latin roots (which are still what&#39;s used to define legal speak and mean something completely different from their English counterparts) clearly exposes the implications the use of this dead language has to the end user. The word &quot;society&quot; is one I love to use to get people thinking as the original meaning of this word draws critical implications from it&#39;s use. Society was a word the English used to brand on their slaves ;but now we speak English and brand ourselves society. Another good one is one most people say a lot while saying to imply something other from what it actually means, that word is &quot;government&quot; which when properly translated and taken back to it&#39;s Latin root means the obvious Govern=Restrict/Control and Ment can be traced back to &quot;mentis&quot; which is &quot;mind&quot;. So Government literally means &quot;control/restrict minds&quot; and what is the primary function it performs? Doubt me? This is the reason in the USA there is something called the (unelected) electoral college which consists of 536 &quot;qualified&quot; citizens who actually decide who the President/VP is going to be because the rest of the population is literally deemed not able to be tasked with such an important decision. Same reason (so called) commonwealth countries are owned and operated by the monarchy, these common wealth places are where wealth is anything ;but common unless you&#39;re a part of the &quot;monarchy&quot; (another word with a true root meaning that should bother most people) who are the unelected and unremovable body of actual owners. The democratic process and other such nonsense are all just for the illusion of freedom, these things also put unbreachable barriers in place that stop common folk from surpassing the control mechanisms used by the few to rule the many. Doubt this? start reading the Papal Bulls like Pope Boniface&#39;s famous 14th century (1302 AD) Bulls like Unam Sanctum which claims (unchallenged) Roman ownership of the entire planet and everything contained within or Romanus Pontifex which removed all rights of ownership from everyone with the exception of the Papacy , the Papal Bulls pose serious implications and were originally written on human skin and inked in human blood of those who wouldn&#39;t convert. &quot;Render unto (Julius)Caesar&quot; became &quot;Accept Jesus Christ (still JC and still Rome acting as representation of the literal Sun in the sky) as your lord and savior&quot;. Both were verbal contracts which under Roman Civil Law which is now known as UCC which is commercial code and also called Maritime Admiralty Law which governs and is the law of water/ocean. Civil Law contracts whether verbal or written (with civil being the last thing they represent) are legally binding and subject to repercussions in the event of violation . Further defining was set out to govern the law of the land in the roughly 500 BC (546 BC or so being the exact time frame if memory serves me correct) rule set called Julian Law, which is still used as the Criminal Law code (or Law of the Land) in most if not all Westernized countries. By all means though analyzing the inner workings of the most sophisticated physic(al) based functions of the planet that are outside of our control rather than the parasitic nature of man(un)kind in our current form and the effects we knowingly and willingly cause on the ecosystem of a host where in we exist ;but are all consuming without consideration being given to the health of the host. A host that is constantly subjected to us consuming more than we contribute back, at a level of consumption no host could sustain for too long before building a natural immunity that will do whatever it takes to stop the threat against it&#39;s survival being posed by the parasite. Believe you me this planet will immunize itself against us and can easily with something as simple as changing it&#39;s axis a few degrees, Pole Shifts of times passed have eradicated nearly all life on this planet and if need be can and will do it again. In fact we have since before 2012 been witnessing a Pole Shift where Magnetic North has been (at a faster and faster rate of speed) moving away from what was current North Star we call Polaris towards a new Magnetic North and at the time we rest at our new MN the global climate will adjust accordingly to represent the planet&#39;s new positioning in relation to our axis point and the planet&#39;s distance from the Sun. There are a group of 5 stars that Magnetic North rests on, this is how Greenland once represented it&#39;s name and maps exist that show Antarctica&#39;s land mass beneath the ice and finally to add in the nature of the Sirius controlled Binary system we live in, this is also how a polarity switch reversed most things on this planet. Like Common Sense actually being Common or Human(e) Beings that are Being Humane , anyone half assed observant can agree the last thing man is currently being is kind to anything even ourselves- I refer to us as man(un)kind because it more accurately represents our current parasitic nature. Anyways I doubt anyone has even bothered to take all that in or even gives a damn about anything other than what occurs within a 3 foot radius of themselves without ever realizing no one part of the whole can be free of suffering and oppression unless the entirety of the whole is free from suffering and oppression. A good start is to stop subscribing to the circle of life as a food chain that&#39;s styled like a pyramid to which man sits atop.", "comment_date": "2018-05-11T21:07:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roadfart", "comment_text": "This is literally the only pop science channel on YouTube that ALWAYS leaves me feeling like I wasn&#39;t given a complete answer.

Earthquakes for nearly three decades now have been referred to as &quot;underground lightening&quot; and the electromagnetic connection to all things in this universe should be coming clear to anyone with the eyes and mind open enough to see it. Electricity like water seeks the path of least resistance which interestingly enough would be along the cracks that divide  tectonic plates.  So, how does this apply to Hawaii, you ask? There is an electric current which circles the globe called the Equatorial Electrojet(EEJ) and the Hawaiian Islands are right on the path of the EEJ. This EEJ is diurnal and directly powered by the sun and is not unlike a similar band that encircles the sun which produces the majority of sunspot activity, while the majority of coronal holes tend to be outside this highly energetic band. In other words the EEJ is highly energetic.<br><br>When it boils down to it all weather is an electrical event,  even underground weather, it is an attempt by charge in the ionosphere to ground itself. Charge that is delivered by the sun via the electric sheet current called the solar wind which when it speeds up due to a coronal hole produces geomagnetic storms. Space is not empty there is plasma which is a resistanceless conductor which when it forms double layers increases its potential.
