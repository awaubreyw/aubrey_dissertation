Clearly the water level will not change because the volume of water displaced is the same as the volume weight of the ice and plastic that was submerged.  Make the diamond more dense, and you displace <b>more</b> water despite the volume of the entire thing remaining the same.  This means that after the ice melts, there is less volume despite greater displacement.  This means the water level goes <b>down.</b>  This is true <b>regardless</b> of the size of the diamond.

Since water with an ice cube will not change the water level upon melting, we can effectively ignore the ice cube&#39;s impact on the water level since it will balance out.

So if I fill a glass of water, and freeze it, the water level rises, and when it thaws it goes back down. <br>For an ice cube, if I drop it into water, it displaces some water, which makes the water level go up. I believe if you let the ice cube melt, it will make the water level go down, because the original volume of the ice cube now has less volume (because it melted). <br><br>B:<br>There could be a mistake in this however, because I don&#39;t have the exact numbers. The ice cube COULD displace the same amount of water (due to the forces of gravity/density of liquid water) and the water level stays the same (as the ice cube melts, it displaces less but the water level rises an equal amount to compensate). <br><br>Now we add the diamond:<br>A. In this scenario, if the diamond is added, there will be an amount of volume that is NOT displaced (as the diamond can&#39;t melt into liquid and has a differing density as water). This could also vary on the diamond size, because if the diamond weight is equal to 3.5x the weight of water in the cube, more water would be displaced when the ice cube is added.<br><br>B. If we hold the water level constant from the thawing ice cube, then I think the diamond would make the overall water level rise, because diamond will always be &quot;heavier&quot; than the volume of water it replaces in the cube. It could also be the same water level before/after, because the diamond&#39;s weight is pulling down the cube and displacing an equal amount of water before/after the cube melts.

The explanation-- <br> <br>Firstly, let&#39;s state an assumption,  the ratio of mass of diamond and mass of ice is such that the complete set is floating and does not settle to the base in the initial condition. Secondly, let&#39;s find out that whether the water level will change if the ice cube is plain solid water (without the diamond). And the answer obviously is that the water level will not change because the same amount of water was being displaced before and after the melting phenomenon to keep the ice cube afloat.<br>Now we can safely assume that the melting of ice will have no effect on the level of water. <br><br>Let&#39;s discuss about the diamond now. The ice cube has now a diamond inside it, which is floating on top (maybe completely immersed, depending on the ratio of the size of diamond and ice) of the water surface. To keep the diamond afloat, some buoyant force was being applied which was definitely equal to the weight of the diamond (I mean, its pretty obvious using the laws already mentioned in books). let that weight be &#39;W&#39; and buoyant force being applied be &#39;F1&#39;.<br>Now, <br>                                         F1 = W ;               ---------------(1)<br>But, when the whole ice has melted away, and the diamond settles down due to higher density, the diamond&#39;s weight is now being supported by 2 forces, and those are the buoyant force from the water(let it be &#39;F2&#39;) and the normal reaction from the base of the container (let it be &#39;N&#39;).<br>Here,  F2 is equal to the weight of water being displaced by the volume of the diamond.<br>So,<br>                                         W = F2 + N;<br>implies that,                  F2 = W - N;          ---------------(2)<br><br>Subtracting equation (2) from (1),<br>      We get,                     <br>                                        F1 - F2 = N;<br>Now since N is some positive quantity, we can finally see that F1 is greater than F2.<br>Since F1 is more, more height (let it be &#39;h1&#39;) of water will be required to provide such force as compared to the height (let it be &#39;h2&#39;) in final situation where the force needed is &#39;F2&#39;.

If you were to put a diamond in the ice cube, there is more weight to the ice cube, so the level of the water is higher than the pure ice cube version before it melts. However, once it melts, the diamond takes up less space than the same amount of ice that has been converted into water. Except that we started with water higher than it was before,  so does the diamond make this go down to the same height, more, or less, than pre-melting? ...Uh...

Since the forces are in equilibrium, the volume displaced is equal to the volume of water needed to weigh the same amount as the ice cube. Ice has a density of 917kg/m3, so a bloc of 917kg would take up 1m3 and displace 0.917m3 of water. Because of the conservation of mass, if the cube melts, it would still weigh 917kg of liquid water (same amount of atoms than before), now taking up 0.917m3 of volume since the density of water is 1000kg/m3. The level pf water didn&#39;t change. (This is also the reason why floating icebergs don&#39;t raise the level of the oceans when they melt, only ice supported by ground will).<br>-&gt; Now if we add a diamond to the cube, it will displace more water. Let&#39;s imagine it weighs 3.5kg (nice size right?) : 3.5L more of water will be displaced by the floating ice cube. Now when it melts, the diamond will be submerged and displace a volume of 1L (since its density equals 3.5kg/L). Less water is displaced, thus the level of water will go down.<br><br>BONUS: You can also notice that in the compound ice cube + diamond, the mass of the ice has to be at least 7.9 times the mass of the diamond for the compound not to drown immediately.

The diamond displaces its weight in water when it floats in its ice cube, but its volume in water when it sinks. Its volume in water is less than the volume of its weight in water, so it displaces less.<br><br>Let&#39;s consider an extreme case: an ice cube with a tiny but mega-dense gold pellet inside it. Assuming it&#39;s floating, it will displace water equal to its weight. Part of that displacement is due to the weight of the ice and part is due to the weight of the gold pellet, and since the pellet is so dense, it accounts for a large fraction of that weight. The ice becomes water as it melts, so its volume becomes the same as the volume of the water it displaced. In other words, the melting ice does not affect the water level. But the gold pellet, once it is free of the ice, does not have enough volume to displace its weight in water--that&#39;s why it sinks. The large portion of the displacement that used to be due to the weight of the gold, when it floated in the ice cube, is now due to the volume of the gold pellet. Since the density of gold is so much higher than that of water, its volume in water is a lot less than its weight in water. Thus, the water level will go down, since the displacement of the gold pellet has shifted from its massive weight to its small volume. The same logic applies to the diamond, since it is denser than water.<br><br>This entire explanation is based on the assumption that the ice cube with the diamond in it floats in water, and the key fact that a floating object displaces its weight in water while a sinking object displaces its volume.<br><br>Apologies if my explanation is long and/or repetitive; I&#39;ve not answered a puzzle like this before.", "comment_date": "2018-07-05T19:54:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abu Baker Baobaid", "comment_text": "I think it might be one of the three options depends on how heavy the diamond is, if the weight is heavy enough to sink the ice cube totally the level will go down because the volume of solid water (ice) is more than water in liquid state.

Naive answer is yes because the boxes gain potential energy, so the mass of the planet increases. The correct answer (given in a later Spacetime epsiode) is no because the increased potential energy of the boxes would be negated by the released chemical energy of the lifters. More simply: total energy didn&#39;t increase, no change in energy, no change in mass. I don&#39;t think this is right either. Lifting and burning chemical energy is a lossy process, so the planet will be warmed by the lifting effort. A warmer planet will radiate more heat, so energy is lost.

Now, having the diamond inside is mathematically the same as having the diamond floating on top of it as if it was sitting on an iceberg, now this diamond weighs alot (relatively) so pushes the ice cube down into the water, it must displace a weight of water equal to its weight for the ice-diamond system to remain afloat, since the buoyant force must equal the weight. So the weight of water displaced equals the weight of the diamond, however since they are different densities, the volumes differ - diamond, being denser, has a lower volume for the same weight, so the diamond displaces a volume of water larger than its own size, so when the diamond is allowed to sink that displaced water is allowed to flow into the gap created by the ice-diamond system, overall lowering the water level.", "comment_date": "2018-07-05T19:33:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Leonard", "comment_text": "water level goes down.
