But if, as is often thought, gravity is whatever it is that moves things towards the earth (or, after Newton, towards other planets), and was the thinking in ancient times (but only because the Earth had already fallen to the center of the universe), then it becomes an irresolvable mystery that the effect of gravity could be nullified BOTH by something moving up AND something moving down, or for that matter, something neither moving up nor down.<br><br> The cleanest way out of the impasse is to just abandon the notion that I had even after taking basic courses in physics, complete with the appropriate math, in which I got A&#39;s, in which the teachers had better things to do then confound their students with such paradoxes. The first paradox about gravity I came to was in a popular book that introduced the extraordinary oddity that the laws of motion, even the outdated Newtonian version of gravity, are time reversible; only for the author to get to the topic of entropy. More interesting to me was a contradiction in my thinking: that if gravity in forward time was what tended to move things towards a mass, then gravity would tend to move things away if you played time backwards, as if a movie. I spent the next several weeks imagining time playing backwards in my imagination and confirming that real gravity looked the same in backwards time.<br><br> This brings me to a paradox which I noticed while thinking over this video. Gravity tends to disappear when the container is in free-fall, but not when the container is supported. And if the support were in free-fall, gravity in the container would also tend to disappear. Let us suppose the support were moving infinitesimally slower than container. Then it would be as if the container were supported.  Imagining going from support to no support, then there must be some amount of time which it takes to go from one state to the other when the container is dropped.
