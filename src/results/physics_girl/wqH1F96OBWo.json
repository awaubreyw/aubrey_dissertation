[{"comment_by": "Physics Girl", "comment_text": "Some people in the comments (hey people!) have stated the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed due to aeroelastic flutter rather than resonance. I found this idea really interesting and it took me down a rabbit hole of nuanced physics.\u00a0<br><br>There\u2019s a common misconception that the bridge collapsed because of resonance in a particular way. Namely, that the wind pushed, then stopped, then pushed, then stopped at just the right rate to match the natural frequency of the bridge. This did not happen.\u00a0<br><br>What happened is that relatively steady wind pushed on the bridge, the elastic properties of the bridge caused the bridge to twist/sway, and that process repeated, and occurred at the natural frequency of the bridge. This is an example of a process called self-oscillation, and the self-oscillation that resulted was at the natural frequency of the bridge. This is quite different from \u201cforced resonance\u201d where the driving force is at the same frequency as the natural frequency of the system. The question I\u2019m considering is whether the bridge scenario can be considered a type of resonance. We call it \u201cresonance\u201d when you blow into a bottle and it whistles. In that situation, there\u2019s no periodic driver. There\u2019s a constant force, just like with the bridge.\u00a0<br><br>Some of you mentioned MinutePhysics\u2019s video on this.

You have to keep in mind that when tuning and trying to find the sensitivity and/or resonant frequency of a speaker, you must count the volume the speakers are putting out. The odd time you can listen to a song at a low volume, and it`ll sounds amazing, bassy, anything you can ask for, but the second you go to turn it up it`ll lose quality. The reason being is everything comes into play when it comes to audio. Everything from the resting air pressure in the room, to the temperature. Placement is another huge factor. If your subwoofer isn`t placed correctly in a room, you may not even hear it but you`ll be able to feel and hear it on the other side of your house. If you really want to try and find the resonant frequency of human body parts, the only way I can think of doing so is to have a nice high power subwoofer in a symmetrical room with sound insulation on the walls ceiling and floor, and then try a certain frequency, if you have no luck, move the subwoofer around the room until you do. Still no luck? I`d bump it up 2hz every time, still making sure to move the subwoofer around the room. It might take days or weeks to find the perfect placement and frequency, but theoretically that would be how you`d do it.

Have you ever wondered why we evolved to not hear frequencies below this range? As it would turn out, the world is very loud in infrasonic ranges- on the order of 85db average. As observed by the folks that invented the mp3, you only perceive the loudest 10% of sounds that you hear- why you can&#39;t hear a finger snap beneath a thunderclap, even though both sounds impart vibrations to your eardrum. Well, as it turns out, natural processes like weather and geologic processes produce rather loud sounds in the ranges below 10 hertz, and so our hearing evolved to not be affected by those sounds, so that we could hear very minute sounds. It is a commonly held belief that human beings cannot hear frequencies above 20khz- but the most modern thinking with regard to that limit says that while I might not be able to directly hear a 21khz tone, that the sound field occurring in those higher frequencies still affects the perception of sounds below the 20khz threshold.

It would require around 125dB that low down to do anything interesting, which is not an easy task for sustained periods due to thermal limitations of the coil/magnet assembly, or short periods even, as the drivers can only move so far before mechanical failure occurs.<br><br>Conventional bass loudspeakers are designed for linearity and output over a useful, musical bandwidth. Much of the time, this is 30Hz -3db point, relative to it&#39;s output in much of the best case scenarios, as anything lower at higher output becomes too large and inconvenient to transport. A good example of a sub frequency loudspeaker for this purpose would be the Danley Matterhorn, which is rather large. A more cost effective method of generating one particular frequency would be to build a tuned resonant pipe/horn, which uses air as a driver opposed to displacement caused by back and fourth motion of a piston.

When the bridge would twist one way, the wind would catch it like a wing and twist it even further that way, then as swung  back the other direction, the  wind catch it and push it even further the other way.  It seems like a distinction without a difference, but in a resonance system, the frequency stays the pretty much the same while the amplitude grows.   With this type of flutter, it doesn&#39;t oscillate at the fundamental resonant frequency of the object, but is pushed either faster or slower frequency by the aerodynamic forces.   The frequency of flutter depends on the  shape of the object, wind speed and the vortices thrown off the object.

Fire is just plasma right? so if sounds are able to put them off, may be they can put off arcs in High Voltage circuit breakers. Which could be a good practical application. What do you think?. \r<br>BTW I think i know why the fire squeezes and puts off. Ionization is dependent on pressure (an inference taken from paschen&#39;s law) so if you increase the sound to an adequate amplitude, the plasma would be pressurized in some parts (compression)  and  de-pressurized in the other parts (rarefaction). where there is compression ,the mean free path for collision would decrease thus reducing the impact of collision.  where there is rarefaction, the space between ions will be large so that the probability of collision is low. SOOOOOOOOOO the fire is put off BINGO BANGO!!!!\r<br><br>Why does the fire squeeze? from where does the ionization start? from the chemical reaction in the candle. hence near the candle the ionization is better sustained  during the compression and rarefaction whereas, away from the candle upwards, the effect of de- ionization is felt significantly ( because of low plasma cross sectional area, as we go up the flame, the diameter of the fame reduces so number of ions reduces) , hence the ionization fails to happen above some height (where the ionization probability is low)", "comment_date": "2019-06-07T06:39:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saswat Sarangi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqH1F96OBWo&amp;t=1m42s\">1:42</a> infrastructures do a better job , big speakers put out small flames , not very cost effective and transport etc", "comment_date": "2019-06-07T06:38:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LlamaHomefry", "comment_text": "You might not have felt the resonance in your eyeballs because of how long a 19Hz wave is.

Most music that we run on our systems is bass boosted to 23hz sometimes. It\u2019s such a low frequency, I can also feel my eyes vibrating when my bass hits and it\u2019s only a 12 inch klipsch 500 watt. What you need is a space that reflects the bass back instead of adsorbing the sound. If you\u2019ve ever been in a car with a decent system you\u2019ll realize your eyes are vibrating with the bass and everything becomes slightly wavy. That\u2019s the best I can describe it.
