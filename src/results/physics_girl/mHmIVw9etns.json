Just wondering if you have come across a newer idea for pumped-hydro from a group of academics at the Australian National University, lead by Prof Andrew Blakkers.<br><br>Off-river pumped hydro. Their idea is simple. Since the amount of energy that can be stored is proportional to the height difference between the two dams/pondages, you want to find sites that have big height differences. And most of these sites aren&#39;t next to rivers. They are in other locations, away from a river. The pumped hydro site you visited in California had a height difference of 300 feet. They have identified many 1000&#39;s of sites in Australia, and now many, many more around the world, with height differences of up to 600 meters!!! So to store the same amount of energy as that California site, you would only need 15% as much water, and the dams/pondages could be much smaller. Meaning you need to make up less water to account for evaporation.<br><br>So, how do you get water for this, if it isn&#39;t on a river? Well it might be near a river, say a few km away. So you run a pipeline from the river to fill the pondage as needed.<br><br>Or, you use evaporation suppression systems - essentially covering the dam/pondage - to reduce evaporation. The best evap&#39; suppression systems reduce evaporation by 70-90%. Typical annual evaporation losses for open water in a medium climate, not desert, may be 2-3 meters per year. But if ideally you could reduce that by 90%, that is just 20-30 cm per year. If you have a halfway decent annual rainfall, say 0.5 - 1 meters per year natural rainfall will keep it filled. And even a year or few of drought would still only lower water levels by a meter, and one years average rainfall would refill that.<br><br>Their idea would see something like a Turkey&#39;s Nest dam built on a suitable hilltop, built mainly from earth and rock excavated out of the hilltop, and a second pondage at the base of the hill.

The drastic price decreases in batter storage costs make that even easier.<br><br>Unlike what the doofus says at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHmIVw9etns&amp;t=4m05s\">4:05</a>, solar power sources have no problem being disconnected from the grid. PV modules are one of the few power sources that have no issues being used from 0 to 100% of their capacity at any time. They do not &quot;force&quot; power onto the grid, and can be ramped up and down in milliseconds. Large rotating kinetic mass generators such as the hydro generators need much longer to change power output, and will &quot;force&quot; power onto the grid until they can be ramped down. Wind generators are also rotating kinetic mass generators (albeit much smaller than most large hydropower generators), but depending on their configuration, are very easy to change power output, and bring online or take offline when needed.<br><br>As an electrician who has worked on wind, solar, hydro, combined cycle, and nuclear plants, nuclear power is highly overrated, and THE most expensive source of power available, along with not actually being low carbon when the entire construction, fuel cycle, decommissioning, and long term wast storage is considered. The US has spent, on average in inflation adjusted dollars of DIRECT taxpayer subsidies, 3.5 billion dollars per year since 1948 on nuclear power, yet it is our most expensive source of grid scale power (120 to 180 dollars per mega Watt hour). Renewables have received 0.38 billion in direct taxpayer subsidies a year since 1994, and are the cheapest source of grid scale power today (25 to 50 dollars per mega Watt hour).<br><br>Nuclear power also has a huge indirect cost to taxpayers in security, insurance indemnification, and unknown waste disposal cost for tens of thousands of years. The total insurance pool for nuclear power reactors in the US is around 13.5 billion dollars. As the Fukushima disaster is reaching a trillion dollars, if the US had a similar disaster, the US taxpayers would be on the hook for the remaining 986.5 billion dollars.", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T13:14:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Reinert", "comment_text": "Nuclear, problem solved.", "comment_date": "2022-06-18T08:45:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hrushikesh Patil", "comment_text": "Energy transition hope it will make boom in the upcoming future!!", "comment_date": "2022-06-18T04:22:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FeeshUnofficial", "comment_text": "WE NEED FUSION WE NEED FUSION WE NEED FUSION", "comment_date": "2022-06-17T21:04:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZMacZ Furreh", "comment_text": "Short term energy storage, battery.<br>Medium term energy storage, water elevator.<br>Long term storage, bio-diesel, from compressed panst and other longer chain hydrocarbons.<br>(possibly even sugar)", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T18:16:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZMacZ Furreh", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHmIVw9etns&amp;t=5m57s\">5:57</a> Replace the bricks with water, same principle like a steam engine, but with water instead of steam.<br>Also, I&#39;d use large water globes or water cylinders, one above the other.<br>When energy goes in, the piston compressor moves water upwards, when energy comes out<br>another cylinder allows water to come in, and push the piston connected to a generator.<br>Easeh peaseh.

It is very straightforward and fairly simple to do and it works great. Now if the government and or state really was concerned with global warming and carbon footprint they would allow citizens to go solar and eliminate my property from the grid completely. But they will not allow that to happen. What they really want is for homeowners to produce their own energy after paying for the materials and installation while they continue to charge you just like Edison.<br>   We can all be energy efficient and save the planet at the same time but in order to do so the government has to relinquish its power over the right to charge/tax us as consumers. If we produce our own energy we are no longer consumers, we are producers of the product. People need to wake up the government is the true enemy of ecology  not individuals. If I had to spend 300k to go solar but it meant I would no longer have to pay an electric bill I&#39;d take out a loan tomorrow and I think many would do the same but the government wants us to do that and still allow them to bill us in the form of a tax. This totally eliminates the incentive to go solar. Your choice is to pay for an actual product like energy or pay them for absolutely nothing while you go into debt. Who wants to do that. This is only one facet of how the government will not allow renewable energy to be used wide spread. I could go on and on but my point is if the government would stop insisting on getting a piece of the pie we&#39;d already be using renewable energy across the board.", "comment_date": "2022-04-03T19:19:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Graem Elliott", "comment_text": "There\u2019s no free lunch!

You only supply electricity to get the steam production started and then it switches over to the electricity produced by the Sterling Engines from the heat No the Sterling engines would be hooked together like a tandem bike so if it was not able to put in Energy it wouldn\u2019t lock up the system but could always add to the power being produced. Because 60% of the lost energy is lost in heat in any production if we could take full vantage of the heat to continue to produce another source of electricity just to heat the water and if it\u2019s too much electricity it could be added into the other electricity as additional surplus or storage in battery\u2019s for on demand startup.<br>Any electricity production produces heat or lost energy why could we not you Sterling engine to utilize that additional heat to work pump the water back up the hill from what you\u2019re using but I still like the first one because it\u2019s sealed system you don\u2019t lose the water to evaporation you condense it back in the order and you recover the lost energy.", "comment_date": "2022-04-01T14:44:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bicarus G", "comment_text": "Salt batteries are what i think are the real future.

Providing even 20% of our electricity from nuclear would be a huge help, and between uranium and thorium fuel cycles, along with reactors burning existing nuclear waste for energy, we have enough fuel for many centuries if not millennia.<br><br>The cost difference of storage needs between 80% renewables and 100% is huge.  For example, a major study on storage needs for California by The Clean Air Task Force (a respected climate change charity and think tank), found that at 80% renewables you would need 9.6 million megawatt-hours of energy storage and 36.3 million mWh at 100%.  Almost 4 times as much storage just to get the last 20%.   Maintaining that storage reserve (a great deal of it unused most of the time) is expensive and that cost has to be paid for by electricity users, resulting  an an effective  net production cost of $1612 per mWh at 100% renewables.  Compare that to about $160 pr mWh,  the high end of costs for electricity from new nuclear power plants... often derided as &#39;too expensive.&#39;  In reality, it is <b>not</b> including nuclear in our clean energy mix that is too expensive.  It is certainly possible to make 100% renewables work.  It just takes even longer than building new nuclear plants and costs 10x as much.<br><br>As for safety, the reality is that we have been misled for decades about nuclear power by activists who, however well meaning, can&#39;t or won&#39;t understand that nuclear power and nuclear weapons aren&#39;t the same thing. Even when waste and accidents are considered, the number of lives lost per mWh for nuclear is comparable to that from solar and wind power, all vastly less than the death toll from fossil fuels.  Just the small particulates alone from coal kills as many people every 7 hours as the high end calculation of the  eventual total death toll at Fukushima.   The problems of waste are far more manageable when you don&#39;t use 5% of the energy in the fuel and call the rest waste like we do now.  Instead use it for fuel in other type of reactors.  Nuclear waste is as manageable a problem as the toxic heavy metal and other chemical pollution produced making solar panels.

After watching your video it really seems that energy storage will not be such a big deal after all (and wow, this is good news isn&#39;t it ?). Plenty of different ways to store energy meens all eggs wont be put in the same place, affordable technologies, most of them are very simple and clean when it comes to the &quot;basic principle&quot;. Yet, not long ago, i read a book about rare-earth and rare-metals and how they are a really BIG problem when it comes to renewables. First of all, solar thermal (with mirrors) or wind turbines generate energy from rotating magnets to generate electricity. Magnets ? Well as for now, magnets are a mixture of neodymium (rare-earth) + boron + iron. And to operate such plants, of course you need a lot of chips to automate and optimize energy production (tasks such as finding optimal orientation in regards to the sun or wind direction). So, more rare-earth and/or rare-metals. The problem with rare-earth or rare-metals ? To extract them, in most cases, you need to extract tons and tons of rocky material, smash it, dissolve it. And of course this process, the chemical solvants, all of it produces immense amount of pollution. In France (my country) there used to be mining activity for rare-earth and rare-metals. All of it stopped in the past decades because of environment protests. Protesters were right in the sense that the pollution generated by this industry was absolutely unbearable. But all it did is move the production sites to countries far away (in Africa, China ...). Well, just wondering, as you seem to have super powers (at least when i watch your videos, your most obvious superpower is to give me a smile for the day), maybe the BIG problems i mentionned above could vanish because of some smart alternatives or solutions that deserve some coverage ?

When you dig down into the components of them they are anything but clean. The extraction of the materials required to make them is hazardous and releases compounds into the environment that are unsafe and then there is the long term disposal that we can see today with the horrid way in which current so called clean energy systems are being recycled, or rather discarded and left to leach these dangerous chemicals and minerals back into the soil where they are contaminating the surroundings and making those areas as well as neighboring aquifers unsafe.

The first step towards reaching a zero emissions economy, is to reduce the CO2 production of the electricity infrastructure to 50% of it&#39;s current value.  This is readily achieved by solar panels alone, without the need to build even 1 kWh of battery or other form of energy storage.<br><br>Solar photovoltaic panels have gotten so cheap in recent times, that they produce the cheapest form of energy of all the mainstream existing technologies (the only potential exception being wood harvested on your own land using your own labor, where you value your time and risk of injury at $0/hour).  A properly implemented solar photovoltaic array can generate electricity at 2 cents / kWh, when the panels and support equipment is amortized over a 20 year or longer timescale (most solar panels come with a 20 or 25 year warrantee, and getting well over 20 years of practical service is realistic).<br><br>If you 3x overbuild your solar array size (such that you are wasting 2x of your base energy needs, on sunny days), the useful electricity it produces will be 3x as expensive, so around 6 cents / kWh, which is still cheaper than what the vast majority of electricity consumers pay today.  Consequently, it is economically sensible to 3x overbuild solar panels.  Doing so also provides highly reliable electricity, even on cloudy days, since on completely and continuously cloudy days (but without precipitation), solar panels generally still produce around 30% or more of their full sun day output values.<br><br>If we did 3x overbuild solar panels, we could nearly 100% shutdown all combustion power plants, during the daytime hours.  This would in effect reduce the CO2 production intensity of the electric grid to roughly 50% of the current values, since the combustion plants would only be operating during the nighttime hours of the day.<br><br>Once you have so many solar panels installed, there will be massive surpluses of electricity during sunny daytime conditions, since the system is 3x overbuilt to meet the normal daytime energy needs of society.  You can then use some of this &quot;surplus&quot; electricity for electric car charging purposes (assuming people go to the trouble of installing charging ports at places of employment).  The rest of the electricity can be put to valuable use as low priority industrial energy, for energy intensive activities, such as metals refining and reduction (ex: making iron from iron oxide for instance).  <br><br>Then, if people buy enough electric vehicles, and the electric vehicles are designed with high cycle life batteries in them (ex: lithium iron phosphate could be used, which often provides manufacturer claimed cycle life of 4000-20,000 cycles at 80% depth of discharge), the electric vehicles can be used to perform car to grid and grid to car storage operations.  High cycle life batteries are somewhat expensive on their own, but when you are buying them primarily for a high value use purpose (ex: as part of an electric car), they are very cost effective, and can serve a dual use purpose of storing vehicle propulsion energy, in addition to providing grid energy storage (some of which will be consumable during the nighttime hours of the day, using stored solar energy from the daytime hours).  Eventually, a zero emissions economy becomes realized, where long range, high cycle life, car to grid/grid to car capable electric vehicles are providing the majority of the necessary electricity grid energy storage for nighttime consumption.<br><br>Thus, there is no grid energy storage &quot;problem&quot; at present.  The current problem, is that society is not yet embracing solar photovoltaic panels fully.  They are good tech, but they are highly underutilized at present.  Simply building and hooking up far more of them, is the first step towards a zero emissions economy.  Energy storage technology is not the problem, as the current problem is one of human behavior, that is, most people just aren&#39;t doing the right actions to build the necessary solar panel manufacturing plants, and then running them at full capacity to build the necessary solar panels.", "comment_date": "2021-11-27T20:17:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CohibaSkeeza", "comment_text": "Take the mask off", "comment_date": "2021-11-27T20:02:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ronald Morgan", "comment_text": "Nuclear.", "comment_date": "2021-11-27T19:54:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Smith", "comment_text": "THORIUM !!!!!

It made me do some digging on the topic of hydrogen as a fuel.<br><br>ICE engines are great from the energy density point of view but the carbon footprint of the well-to-pipe is scarry.<br>Hydrogen is also great. Especially for large vehicles that allow storing lots of it onboard rendering far superior range in comparison to BEV. <br><br>I am not sure however if today it is a green fuel. The phrase &quot;colours of hydrogen&quot; is a key here. And this is, in my opinion, the reason that keeps the whole technology from mass adoption. Otherwise, it would be refused the carbon-free status for several decades.<br><br>The major problem with hydrogen is the assumption that all of it is coming from the electrolysis of water. The process is quite energy-demanding and renders the end product&#39;s high price. The free market economy favours the cheapest solutions. The cheapest hydrogen you can buy to run your car today is coming from the extraction of natural gas (making it a fossil fuel?). <br><br>Hydrogen&#39;s abundance is misleading to the point where it is hard to use it as an argument. Sorry.<br>Let me explain.<br>Hydrogen atoms are abundant (bound to other stuff), hydrogen molecules (H2) on the other hand - not so much. So, we need &quot;stuff&quot; to be processed to get the fuel, which we can use in vehicles. Most likely, the place where the &quot;stuff&quot; is extracted and where it is processed doesn&#39;t have to be the same place, so we need to transport it back and forth. That sounds very familiar, doesn&#39;t it?<br>Also, the BEVs are based on the circular economy - create a product and when it reaches the EOL - turn it into a new product. Hydrogen would require water vapour capture to make it a closed loop.<br><br>There is also the CCS, which turns out to be a scam, providing very little to none of the &quot;blue hydrogen&quot; per year (see the recent film from the Australian thejuicemedia on YT).<br><br>So, hydrogen - yes, but we need more research and development as well as net-zero carbon footprint.", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T12:18:09Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "James Oldfield", "comment_text": "Hydro storage isn&#39;t viable everywhere because the terrain isn&#39;t always suitable for it.<br><br>I like how we will make all of this tech to store energy and go carbon neutral in 2050, after the feedback loops of global warming are established and ensure the warming will continue even if we produce no CO2.", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T11:21:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "O_O", "comment_text": "she is one of the sweetest personality to explain science, GOD bless her.", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T07:49:28Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Lilly Notayi", "comment_text": "yohhhh! been looking for quality content- thank you!", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T05:28:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eelshock", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHmIVw9etns&amp;t=6m30s\">6:30</a> 10GWh can power about 1000 households for a year.", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T02:00:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "madstork91", "comment_text": "After watching this video... you are so far behind on energy storage... lmao.", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T01:33:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aoiichi", "comment_text": "Does her sweater remind you of the Pink Power Ranger ? or is that just me ?", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T00:51:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Searle", "comment_text": "This is only a hidden problem for those who know nothing about the Green Energy Problem which tend to be the ones who push the hardest for Green Energy.", "comment_date": "2021-09-06T21:59:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ironicalballs", "comment_text": "I work relates to PV Solar Farm/Electrical.

At that depth the hydrostatic pressure of the water acts to provide all the containment pressure. The tank is open to the sea at the bottom and is initially filled with water at the same pressure as the water outside, so there is no net force on the tank walls. Compressed air is piped from the surface down into the tank, displacing the water inside which exits through the bottom. The air pressure inside is automatically equalized with the water pressure outside , again resulting in no net force on the tank walls, sort of like a diving bell.

We have a very wet environment that is very hilly in places, yet we don&#39;t have enough pumped storage capacity. It results in telling (well, actually, paying) wind farms to turn off in bad weather, which is obviously not ideal. The main problem comes from the way renewable power is subsidised. Wind farms and solar farms get a very large subsidy to operate based on their unit export. Pumped storage, on the other hand, is not subsidised at all. And not only that, if you use single source renewable power water to pump up to a big reservoir, and then have a conventional hydro turbine allowing water back down to self regulate, you still can&#39;t get the subsidies for the initial energy collection mechanism. For now this means renewable power cannot regulate its own output without throwing the financial incentives in the bin, and all it does it put strain on the grid. Then when the situation gets bad enough that it becomes commercially feasible to build and run a pumped storage scheme - but to my mind this is inefficient and you have to let there be a problem before it is fixed.

Let us go through the numbers. Many French reactors have a power level higher like 1.6Gw = 1600 mega watts. We\u2019ll use 1Gw = 1000Mw to keep our arithmetic easy. <br>A 1 Gw nuclear Plant has a capacity factor or 95% some are higher some lower.<br>Wind Power has a capacity factor of 33% this can very as low as 25% or a bit higher.<br>For the layperson this may not seem so important so please bear with me. Because we wish to replace a nuclear plant with a wind farm<br>To build a wind farm you will need 1Gw/ 33% = 3Gw of power because of the capacity factor. The wind blows 33% of the time. That means 3Gw of power is needed to be produced power so to replace 1Gw of Nuclear. How this is done is wind supplied 1Gw of power to the grid while the remaining 2Gw of power goes to storage. So lets say we have very very predictable power where every third day the wind is blowing and at sufficient speed &gt;20km/hr. So Monday it blows Tuesday and Wednesday the wind doesn\u2019t blow. So on the Monday 1Gw goes to the grid 2Gw goes to storage to be used on Tuesday and Wednesday. Then by some miracle the wind blows on Thursday and the cycle continues\u2026 For EVER. If there is no wind power on the third day your out of luck. Now let\u2019s calculate the size of the battery. Energy is power times a unit of time.<br>1 Joule of energy = 1 watt for one second. Therefore 2,000,000,000 watts (2Gw) needed to be stored in one day or 24x60x60 seconds= 86\u2019400 seconds. So the storage that\u2019s needed is 2,000,000,000x 86,400= <br>172,800Gj of energy storage. But the kicker here is assuming 100% storage capacity efficiency. Now let\u2019s calculate the cost of 3Gw Wind plus 172,800GJ of energy storage. <br>Wind\u2019s cost is about $1000 per Kw or $1 per watt (a low value). So 3Gw of wind will be $3 billion.<br>Batteries are about $500 / Kwh or (1Kwh = 1000w/K\u00d760 min/hr x60 sec/min)<br>So that\u2019s $500 / 3.6 million joules. Or .0001388889 $/J<br>Therefore 172,800 Gj x .00013888$/J= $24 billion <br>So that\u2019s 24 plus 3 = $27 billion to replace 1 nuclear plant. So the cost of storage is the kicker.<br>But for how long?? A nuclear plant can go for 40 to 60 years.<br>For a wind farm its life could be 20years. So look to spend 3 $billion times 60/20  (or  $9 billion) to cover replacement over 60 years. For batteries lithium ion type they can take 300 to 500 charges. For calculation lets use the generous 500 charges. If the batteries will be charged once every 3 days that\u2019s 1500 days of life.<br>1500/365=  4.2 years Therefore over 60 years the replacement is 60/4.2= 14 times<br>So the total cost over 60 years is $24 billion x 14 for batteries plus $9 billion for wind turbines equaling a grand total over 60 years to be 24\u00d714+9=<br><br> $345 billion. Over 60 years.<br><br>A cost that is not calculated is not just the cost per Kwhr or replacement costs over 60 years. <br>But the cost of a power failer.<br>The cost of a power failer is extremely difficult to calculate. A good example is that of a bakery or other industries that are highly dependent on reliable power. Bread that does not rise or a process that\u2019s time dependent like the refrigeration of food or vaccines. A patient on an operating table. A person stuck in an elevator etc etc. <br>Now do the same for solar but it has a capacity factor of 20% less in Germany.<br>1/20% =5Gw  etc etc. Create your own spread sheet and adjust some numbers if you like.<br>For nuclear it is 95% Do the math for it as well. You will need 0.05Gw of storage but this could be made up with natural gas. A lot of nuclear power plants have 2 reactors.  Darlington 4 Pickering 8. As you can see by the back of napkine calculation it\u2019s the cost of storage.

Wow time to buy Tesla stock. The largest battery installed by Tesla is in Australia at 129Mwhr that is only 464.4 GJ.

The sun gives us, apparently, &gt;36000 times the energy we currently use...but solar panels are not the way, just like recycling. What do we do in +25 years with all the now-being-bought-ones being installed? More e-waste. Thermal batteries? How do you heat them? Heat as an energy storage device, does not make sense. You start losing heat immediately, therefore calling it storage is like calling a leaky boat, seaworthy. Heat needs to be used to do the rest, not stored. If you look at ANY organism, it gets its energy from the sun, one way or another, through an extremely intense network of delivery and every cell stores energy. It&#39;s energy, in other words, is not centralized. We hope one solution is going to help, but just as computer engineers realized, the more the complex the network the more efficient it became. We need 5 on the list (and a few that&#39;s not mentioned here) and that&#39;s it. All cheap to build, old technology therefore stable and easily taught. Can ALL be made using reclaimed materials, therefore the carbon cost is lower than most of the other ones. And there&#39;s a YouTube video or 50 on almost each one of these, ranging from DIY to INFO. We could&#39;ve had ALL of this more than a century ago, but copper &amp; iron mining and oil won due to our love of convenience. We didn&#39;t want to chop wood for the fire, write letters, and go to bed early anymore. It is what it is, but we really need to stop wasting time on RESEARCHING new technologies and start doing it now with what we have, EVERYWHERE. Once we have met the 2030 (9 years from now...) levels, then, maybe, can we put TIME towards these other ones, TIME being the operative word, but it still sounds like more mining and Earth-stripping to me. We love to mimic nature when it suits us, i.e. the shape of planes, but when we have a seeming abundance, like why cars was boxy in the 70s but not before or after (oil crisis anyone?), we actually can&#39;t give a hoot. And that is where the crux lies... We are selfish animals, one of a kind, and we ALWAYS wait for someone else to come up with the solution, or blame government or big business (both of which we keep there, by voting and buying the products) and the only one that&#39;s waste is actual waste, but it&#39;s like Michael said &quot;Gotta start with the man in the mirror&quot; .  Small usage changes at home, in everything, can have a massive impact already in usage overall, i.e. switch wireless devices off when not needed and maybe get wired keyboard and mouse (the wireless tech needs way more minerals than just a cable and not to mention batteries), unplug from the wall socket, don&#39;t just switch-off, do you really need a new phone, or do we need phones with standardized batteries like what we&#39;ve had for decades, that can be used in multiple devices (oh, yeah, I forgot, closed patents...), grow some herbs and other food, what you get from there helps with the CO2 cycle, especially trees. Never think the little you do has no impact. We&#39;re billions contributing to the dilemma, it&#39;s going to need the mind-set change of billions to reverse it, or something else. It&#39;s like voting; if all the people that didn&#39;t vote, saying &#39;my vote won&#39;t make a change&#39; , actually showed, there would&#39;ve been change...

I&#39;m not a techno-phobe at all, but really? Do you really need a kindle or your phone to read a book? Books don&#39;t require battery and if looked after, can store the info contained for more than a century (longer than the tree that the paper came from to regrow twice and stores carbon!) and no upgrades needed and it doesn&#39;t matter how many times you&#39;ve read it either, not to mention hemp-paper could be used, then no trees needed and now you&#39;ll have the seeds as well and they are a brilliant protein source or the oil can be used for medicine or fuel. And don&#39;t tell me a kindle or phone can store thousands of books, have you read thousands of books, from a kindle or phone screen, in your lifetime? So, no, it&#39;s an invalid statement.

Take the &#39;problems&#39; with using Li-ion as storage.  1.  Flammability- yes, they can catch on fire- but not often, and catch on fire far less than Gas cars, which average about 200,000 car fires a year here in the US.  And Hydrogen- extremely flammable as well- think Hindenburg...  2.  Capacity Loss- again, yes, they do lose some capacity- but not much.  In fact, their losses have proven far less than anticipated in several studies.  Tesla just released an overview of the batteries in their cars, where the losses were tapering off between 8-10% after 200,000 miles.  Consumer Reports a couple of years ago looked at a Prius, whose older-tech-Metal-Hydride battery capacity was virtually unchanged (though admittedly, this was a small sample).  3.  Supply- this is kind of silly.  This is a new industry, so yes, capacity to build batteries is not yet built out.  But within 5 years, there will already be many times the capacity of today.  And Lithium itself?  Running out of it?  Again, silly.  Lithium is a fairly abundant resource.  Even if we were to exhaust all the mines on earth (unlikely), there is plenty of it in sea water- and the oceans are vast.  Additionally, there are several, well-funded companies around the world developing recycling processes to re-use all the valuable minerals from old batteries.  4.  Cost- they said the same thing 10 years ago... and then the cost decreased by about 80-90% since then.  And it will continue to drop, perhaps not quite as dramaticly, but it will, especially as manufacturing processes improve, and chemistries improve, and energy density goes up.<br><br>I really like your show, but this particular series, so far, shows very little in the way of research, and instead seems to rely on a Toyota-centric POV to promote their hybrids and Fuel Cell technology.  I would not have chosen Toyota to sponsor a show on this subject, as their bias pervades the show.  And I like Toyotas- one of our cars is a Prius!  We do need more energy storage solutions- but all of the ones you show are not new, and have been around as long as Lithium Ion battery storage, if not longer.  There is a reason none of them are yet successful in the marketplace, including your upcoming video (I am guessing) on using Solar Thermal to store energy in molten salt.

Using a Lithium Iron Phosphate chemistry, they could get it down to $40 per KWH.

And as you state, the growth potential for it isn&#39;t great, even less so within Europe. The only storage alternatives he thinks of are Hydrogen and Methane. He he argues with the bad efficiency (maximum efficiency by Carnot) of these chemical storages but does not even try to think of other storage possibilities.

The quirky thing about this is that all zinc <i>must</i> be dissolved off the electrode, or it can form dendrites that will eventually short out the cell. And so every few cycles the battery must be full discharged. So after it&#39;s down to zero, it&#39;s shorted out for about half an hour just to make sure it&#39;s dead. Most practical systems will have two battery banks. When one is completely discharged and sitting there shorted out, the other has power. The ZCell is 48 volt, 220 Amp-Hour.<br><br>Curious, a few years ago I looked at the US price and it was about $15,000 (USD) delivered.

But mirrors absorb some amount (significant) while reflecting the light rays back. Instead of mirrors, I would suggest the use of Total Internal Reflection (TIR). In TIR, the light rays travel from Denser to Rarer Medium. We can calculate the critical angle of the denser medium using the refractive index of the two medium and then create a prism arrangement and place the entire TPV inside of it. As the light which passes through the PV will hit the rarer medium, the incident angle will be greater than the critical angle and hence lead to total internal reflection of light which will bounce it back to the other side of the prism which will further bounce it back to the PV. This is way more efficient than using mirrors as it absorbs absolutely no energy.

They made some wild awesome claims about their tech, which obviously never came.  Later in college I wrote and delivered a persuasive speech encouraging my classmates to drive hydrogen cars when they come available.  One of my primary arguments was that given the efficiency of the vaporware Anuvu PEM fuel cell and liquid H2 storage they could expect comparable fuel mileage to the Toyota Prius of the time.<br><br>But as time wore on the realities of H2 economy became more apparent.  Real PEM efficiencies were much lower than Anuvu promised.  People probably weren&#39;t going to carry liquid H2 in their car.  And the Toyota Prius became much more efficient.  Eventually, when learning about the plug to pavement efficiency of BEV&#39;s, it became clear: H2 is not the answer.  It&#39;s not just that round trip efficiency is worse than every other storage method.  There are other things that we have to worry about.  Hydrogen is very difficult to contain, so leak management must be much better than our current methane infrastructure.  Second, once hydrogen escapes from our storage and transport system, which it will, it&#39;s gone forever.  That may not seem like a big deal, but consider that every two hydrogen atoms lost is also a water molecule lost, and an extra oxygen atom in the atmosphere.  At the scale of the rest of human civilization, that might be a problem.  Lastly, the metals involved in PEM fuel cels are very expensive and finite.  Clearly it&#39;s not the answer and I think we&#39;re fools to chase that dream.<br><br>I&#39;m a huge fan of compressed air storage.

A mere doubling of the energy density of the lithium ion battery per kg and there will be not enough room for more COP vessels in the Mirai to match the range of a Tesla Model 3 Long Range like mine, which already has 350 miles of range to the Mirai&#39;s 400.

Really The biggest problem with hydrogen out west is the same problem with pumped hydro namely the lack of water. I guess you could use excess energy to split seawater but you would realistically want to separate out dissolved ions but I still think there are better uses for water I mean even copying plants toolbox and making an ultra efficient analog of photosynthesis would likely produce far better rates of return. I do see desalination being a thing in arid environments but I really hope the salts are dealt with appropriately rather than dumped as waste. The very notion of waste is a problem as ideally all waste is misplaced resources and our long term survival depends on our ability to close the resource life cycle. Renewables are currently far away from reaching this threshold as the technologies have high initial environmental impacts<br><br>Personally I am worried that  a fully renewable pathway isn&#39;t ideal as energy density is a problem intrinsic to all renewables barring large space based solar grids as the net energy budget of Earth is fixed and must be shared between us and the biosphere. Already far too much of this budget is going into anthropogenic sources to an alarming degree.  As such while it isn&#39;t renewable Nuclear needs to be considered as part of the solution to reduce our land impacts on the biosphere while also avoiding the worst of the climate catastrophe.  Of Nuclear reactor solutions Small Modular Reactors (SMRs particularly those based on molten salt reactors rather than water) are probably the best route forward as they would naturally fix most of the big problems with the technology. For one  modern reactors are able to be designed to terminate the reaction under runaway conditions, and importantly by being modular it allows mass production rather than needing to build unique individual nuclear power plants. <br>Thus this technology combined with fuel reprocessing to avoid the current huge waste of  conventional reactors  is  by far the most natural option to solving the energy crisis and the critical biosphere&#39;s crisis in habitats. Yeah I  know there are worries about nuclear proliferation and waste but really the first I don&#39;t think is going to be all that worse than it is now as use of such a weapon screws over everyone and radiation risks appear to be largely overblown with regards to multigenerational impacts. Not to say proliferation isn&#39;t a real problem but security precautions could probably be built into such batteries especially if they have to be sent to a reprocessing center where any unauthorized tampering could be identified and research has shown that deterrence based measures don&#39;t work with human psychology. <br><br>This high energy return is what I imagine will best be utilized to capture carbon from the atmosphere and chemically fix it into less volatile forms like rock or potentially I guess even back into hydrocarbons as a type of liquid battery.  The &quot;radioactive waste&quot; on the other hand can be bred into more stable/unstable isotopes or used to power radioisotope thermoelectric batteries. The problem with what we currently do is largely the concept of waste as a whole as there is no such thing as waste only misplaced resources.<br><br>Ultimately space based solar seems the optimal path to the future once we figure out space based manufacturing but until then a solution of renewables plus smart nuclear energy. In an ideal world this would include the disarming and dismantling of all those bombs for  peaceful power production as after all research in psychology and neuroscience have shown that deterrence doesn&#39;t really work and has never worked instead increasing the risk of weapon utilization.<br><br>Carbon captured and resynthesized Hydrocarbons if converted into a battery tech is another promising angle which also would provide a good solution for all the existing fuels out there though this is purely dependent on well developed carbon capture technology. Where suitable I would instead argue that sequestering carbon into carbon based rocks is likely more important since there is already so much in the atmosphere arguably even graphite is an option with enough excess energy. If you have excess power available while capturing it is one prospective use another would be to use it right away for energy intensive processes that otherwise would be carbon intensive.", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T20:51:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OneOFThese NotLikeTheOther", "comment_text": "So nice to see someone with a big show that isn&#39;t hosted by a narcacistic egotistical predator lol <br>Very refreshing thank you keep up the good work <br>Namaste \ud83d\ude4f<br>PS we already have the answer <br>The Tesla coil", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T20:51:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jim's videos", "comment_text": "One thing that seems like low-hanging fruit is a sort-of reverse tow truck to act as a brake for over-the-road trucks going down mountain passes and capture some of that energy.
