If anyone wants to visualize this mathematically, I suggest using a mathematical grapher program.

But the relative rebound speed between each set of colliding spheres, is never more than the relative collision speed. This is as I said before, and I can explain this in mathematical proof if anyone finds it necessary to doubt. When I was talking about the maximum height being Hd (n^2), I was referring to the case where the ball beneath comes to a halt upon collision with the top ball. In other words, when the lower ball has three times the mass as the ball above it. If there are more than two balls, and all the balls fall effectively the same distance, each ball must (in order for the top ball to reach a height of Hr=Hd n^2) have a mass of 1+2(1/v) times that of the ball above it, where v is the speed of the ball in question, relative to the stationary frame of reference that the balls were initially dropped from. This speed is (2^n+1)-1, where n is the amount of balls beneath the one in question. If zero balls are beneath it (it is at the bottom), it has an upward speed of not greater than that which it fell at, so the &quot;(1/v)&quot; part of the mass predicting equation can be neglected, leaving mass= 1+2 times that of the ball above it.", "comment_date": "2015-02-28T13:02:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "matszz", "comment_text": "That was cool, I still don&#39;t really get why it&#39;s happening though.", "comment_date": "2015-02-27T16:17:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MickeyHP", "comment_text": "That golfball could have hit him in the face", "comment_date": "2015-02-27T11:55:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "tauke dabai", "comment_text": "ermm, launch space ship using this method? :D", "comment_date": "2015-02-27T06:49:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elias", "comment_text": "your eyes... are\u00a0AMAZING!", "comment_date": "2015-02-26T16:40:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Al Shahrani", "comment_text": "She&#39;s have 6 fingers <a href=\"http://youtu.be/2UHS883_P60?t=1m07s\">1:07</a>", "comment_date": "2015-02-26T09:05:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Martijn Decauter", "comment_text": "Sorry but HEAT to the GROUND HEAT to the BALL as reason for loss of energy?
