[{"comment_by": "Sean G #NewPhysics137", "comment_text": "Bell&#39;s Theorem is not wierd or mysterious at all when you have the correct model of physics. It makes absolute clear and toral sense using wave mechanics.  <br>This excerpt from the Theory of Everything (mine, which works, fixes, explains and unifies everything in physics) explains what is actually at work in Bell&#39;s Theorem.<br>Bell&#39;s Theorem is another example of where the mathematics show that it is a wave that is moving through the lattice, it is not particles moving through empty space. Where we have energies, traditionally identified as particles expected at 75% of the total possible energy it is in fact the swell of a wave which at 75% of energy is at 85% of it&#39;s full swell, so the values collected on analysis do not reflect the number of expected particles they in fact represent the number of nodes in the lattice being passed through at 75% of the swell of the oscillating wave. Conversely when the wave is only at 25% its full energy level it has only aquired 15% of its maximum momemtum. <br>In the polarising lenses in the accompanying video the reason why a wave can be totally obscured to darkness when a filter is added and orientated at 90\u00b0 but further filters added between the darkened filter actually brighten it when we intuitively expect more filters would only compound it&#39;s darkness is because the darkened filter is positioned in time and space where the waves that were in phase at the initial filter are out of phase and not visible because they are blocked at the later (darkened) filter.  Adding more filters in between means the waves are propagated at closer to the full swell of the wave so more waves are generated/propagated at closer to full swell so rather than these waves oscillating and decreasing at the later (darkened) filter they never actually appear out of phase, rather instead they are closer to the full swell, that is, the more filters are added at specific angles the more they keep the wave moving at closer to full swell. If we add 3 more filters between the initial filter and a filter orientated at 90\u00b0 which appears dark because the waves from the initial filter are all out of phase then this is what happens.<br>When another filter is added between the darkened filter orientated at 22.5\u00b0 the wave is propagated at 85% of the momentum at the first filter, propagated as a wave at full momentum. Another filter added at 45\u00b0 propagates that wave at 75% of it&#39;s momentum which is 85% of its total swell (which is the square root of 85% of 85\u00b2) which is approximately 78% of the momentum relative to the 1st filter&#39;s momentum rather than 50%.  This in turn is propagated at 85% full momentum which relative to the first filter is 72% (the square root of 85% of 78\u00b2) the initial momentum rather than 15% momentum (or 75% through its progression to it&#39;s trough). So by the time the initial waves arrive at the filter orientated 90\u00b0 they are not all out of phase appearing dark, they are carrying 66.5% (the square root of 85% of 72\u00b2) the momentum of the initial wave rather than 0% as we expect from a wave that is out of phase. <br>The full explanation is in the video on the topic on my channel. And in my Theory of Everything, THE Theory of Everything that is linked at the end of the video on my channel.", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T05:52:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jerry Byers", "comment_text": "Wow!

Unfortunately it makes silly predictions at the level of the discrete event such as tossing just the one coin or using a microscopic event to assassinate just the one cat.<br><br>Whether or not we know about Bell&#39;s Theorem, we can look at the superluminal world and use a bit of imagination. The SE itself is ambiguously a wave equation or an equation with an imaginary diffusion coefficient, which should have us thinking about tachyonic Brownian motion straight away. Just playing around with the Minkowski formalism, there is evidently more than one way to travel faster than light. Let&#39;s guess that an entity could have an oscillation in one of the ways, and be in tachyonic Brownian motion in the other way which is orthogonal. TBM is often practically invisible, but it has an effect when matter interacts with the electromagnetic field which gives an outcome where a penny lands either heads or tails, or a cat is either dead or alive, and neither is ever in any superposition of states.<br><br>TBM means that when we integrate the SE, we need to make a random choice between a spacelike and a timelike integration. If we make the same choice for Maxwell&#39;s equation, then we have the possibility of a Vernam cipher which can convey information nonlocally. The thing which is conveyed is in the nature of a one-time pad rather than a true message or a book, and it does allow Bell&#39;s over-correlation. The apparent interchangeability of cause and effect for nonlocally-correlated random events under Lorentz transformations is not a problem because (1) causality is merely an anthropocentrism, and (2) by the time a real LT has been executed, the random event under study is ancient history.<br><br>That is one hundred and thirty decimal places, and modification of the Schroedinger equation is prohibited.", "comment_date": "2021-10-25T07:53:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "charles bromberick", "comment_text": "Please do something on gravity waves - you could interview Bernie Schutz, for example.", "comment_date": "2021-10-23T13:39:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ironshade420 Russell", "comment_text": "actually mam the cats alive bc they got night vision", "comment_date": "2021-10-19T15:36:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "robo 042", "comment_text": "why did my mind go to such a weird place during the coin illusion", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T18:43:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean G #NewPhysics137", "comment_text": "The logical mechanics and the MATHEMATICS that explain and demystify Bell&#39;s Theorem.

I believe that Quantum mechanics will end up  explaining scientifically what conciousness is, and where it comes from. <br>I believe it will be able to prove life after death, and how reincarnation can be explained. I believe that it is the key to understanding ESP, and other types of psychic abilities. I believe that it is possible, that conciousness exists within matter, that all matter has conciousness, and that all life has conciousness. My theory is that conciousness is created when information is exchanged, and shared. Take a bee hive for example. I believe that each bee has its own conciousness. And the bee hive as a whole has a higher level of conciousness.<br>But below the individual bee, are the flowers that communicate with the bee. The flowers exchange information with each bee, and the bees go back to the hive and share information about the flowers to the rest of the bees. So the bee hive has a conciousness, the bee has a conciousness, each living cell in the bee has a conciousness, and the living organisms, and matter on the Quantum level, that shares information with the bee has conciousness. My theory goes like this. <br>Conciousness is created by the exchange and sharing of information. I also believe that we are all connected. When we see the light from stars billions of light years away, we have received information about the universe. Light carries information. Our spirit, is made up of energy. Our conciousness, or our energy never dies. It is just exchanged, or transferred from one place to another, or from one state to another. Science is not able to measure this yet. But I believe that the planet earth itself has a conciousness. It is made up of everything that exists in and on the earth. We are all connected in more ways than anyone can imagine. Every form of matter has energy. <br>I just believe that there are different stages of conciousness. And it evolves , just like species evolve. The longer life exists, the more information it gathers and stores to share and exchange with other forms of life, and matter. The evolution of conciousness runs parallel to the evolution of species. <br>But it is not directly connected to one species. Humans evolved along a specific time line, and  family tree. But our conciousness is not tied down to human evolution. We could go back to the beginning of life on the planet, and existed in many different species and forms of matter. Two thousand years ago, people didn&#39;t know about single called organisms. We were not advanced enough to measure or observe them. I have contemplated many different types of science, to come up with my theory. I believe there is proof that it is correct. But we have no way to measure or observe the things that will reveal what would make it correct, or incorrect. But it would explain why observing something can determine its condition.

The quantum system has only one internal state at any given time - we represent it as a vector in a vector space.  It&#39;s ONE VECTOR, and it evolves in time per a differential equation like all the other stuff we&#39;re familiar with.<br><br>The problem is that we can&#39;t see that state.  We can measure various quantities and get various results.  Each of the results that it is possible for us to get also corresponds to a specific vector in the vector space, but not all of the vectors are accounted for.  It&#39;s like having a clock that can only read out 9am or 12pm - it just can&#39;t show you any other times.  The other times can still exist, as in it can &quot;actually be that time,&quot; but for whatever reason we can only SEE 9am and 12pm.  Now say the actual time is 10:30am.  That&#39;s exactly halfway in between 9am and 12pm.  So when we &quot;measure&quot; the time, we have a 50% chance of getting 9am, and a 50% chance of 12pm.  Oh, and when we get one of those values, the system is forced to adopt that time as well.  So it&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6WxIblKVZI&amp;t=10m30s\">10:30</a>, and we measure - we get 12pm.  Now the system says it&#39;s 12pm.<br><br>There was never more than one actual state inside the system.  It was never the case that it was 9am and 12pm at the same time - it was 10:30am up until we measured, and 12pm after we measured.

It also doesn&#39;t matter if they were hidden from observation before, so the box doesn&#39;t apply. It&#39;s more like you check via perfectly synchronized video connections (quite impossible) on two &quot;entangled kittens&quot; playing in distant locations and one always looks in the exact opposite direction of the other. ... although the kittens are just a random object in this thought, so the effect isn&#39;t a lot easier to grasp with a kitten than with any other object like let&#39;s say an electron. ;) What I would like to know is why the guys you interviewed think they can show quantum entanglement with a) an experiment setup so fragile that it reacts to minor alignment variations of the detector (although there should be more significant variations in the long travel through air distance of the laser beam) and b) why they think they can fix that with having the detector auto aligned with random star light variations.

My intuition - the way I grapple with the concepts outlined in quantum mechanics that are difficult to attach to my day-to-day life - is to treat time as if it&#39;s something only multiparticle systems believe in.  It&#39;s funny to say it that way, but if a fundamental particle isn&#39;t interacting with anything else, time has no effect on it.  So, for a photon, every aspect of its existence happens one right after another.  Emission, passage, and absorption as a series of events one after the other.  It doesn&#39;t matter to the photon that 600 years have passed during the passage phase, or that it has had its energy colocated in space by being emitted as a tangled pair (or larger grouping, possibly), emission and absorption are where things start and end.  <br><br>This means that when you do experiments that involve something outside of the system interacting with a photon, the rules being followed to enact it don&#39;t involve time as part of the equation.  The period between emission and absorption is more-or-less undivided with everything that will be done to that photon happening to the same piece of information simultaneously.  The lack of local hidden variables makes this interpretation more likely-seeming, since we are almost completely sure that the photon isn&#39;t storing any information about what&#39;s happened to it inside of itself somehow.  <br><br>Non-fundamental objects have their properties, like chemistry, heat , and conductivity, determined by the arrangement of fundamental particles making them up.  A subatomic particle has its identity determined by the arrangement of its quarks, but there don&#39;t appear to be any fundamental particles that <i>are</i> phase or spin in the way that vibration <i>is</i> heat, and electron shells <i>are</i> things like chemistry and conductivity.  Bell&#39;s experiment was designed to figure out if there was something that science was unaware of that did these things for photons and electrons and whatnot.  As the video says, the answer is &quot;no&quot; in any way we can determine.  There is nothing about one photon that makes it different from any other photon.  The things that differentiate photons (Frequency, polarization and spin) are due to their interactions with other things.<br><br>So, a photon that is in-transit where it isn&#39;t interacting with anything doesn&#39;t have anything to exist against.  If something is being done that influences how a photon behaves while it&#39;s in transit, things like causality just don&#39;t get brought up.  Some experiments bear this out, with one part of an entangled pair of photons being absorbed in such a way that a measurement can be made, while the other half continues to travel until it&#39;s put through an apparatus that biases the particle towards one state or the other and measures it.  Even though the influence happened after the first half no longer exists, the pair of particles almost always will measure out as agreeing or disagreeing as expected.  The influence impacts the already-absorbed photon that doesn&#39;t exist any more because &quot;transit time&quot; is a single event, so anything that happens during transit impacts all parts of a photon equally.  <br><br>You&#39;re already thinking of FTL communication and you&#39;re not the millionth person to do so.  None of the methods we have to influence the behavior of a pair of entangled photons can encode information.  They&#39;re all probablistic and there&#39;s no way to make sure that a specific group of photons behave in a coherent enough way to be read as a signal.  We know how a particular particle would look at the far end if it was measured at near end, but there&#39;s no method that can make all the photons you&#39;re sending be measured one way or the other.

I was thinking about gravity the other day as I made a mental journey to earth&#39;s core and found myself to be badly crushed and burned but eerily weightless. The pull of gravity all around me was perfectly balanced resulting in zero G. I extrapolated these findings to the centre of exploding stars and realized the highest gravitational field strength would lie in an elliptical spheroid vector around it&#39;s core, and if a singularity were to form it would probably be initiated at either pole where lower  centrifugal forces due to rotational velocity provided less counteractive force against the gravitational attraction. I only mention this as the singularities that give birth to black holes may be the birth of universes such as ours via the big bang seen from the outside of it&#39;s event horizon. The subsequent polarization of the singularity may be the explanation for our perceived lack of anti-matter in that a relative preponderance of either types of matter is produced at the opposite poles, perhaps even being flung in different temporal directions into the fledgling universe and so destined never to meet unless the universe were to eventually stop expanding and begin contracting into the big crunch.

Think of it as you blow a bubble and it floats as a perfect sphere (wave movement) until it is popped by a disturbance.\u00a0 If you&#39;ve ever seen a balloon pop in slow motion, the sheath (circumphercial sphere) actually retreats around the empty air of the sphere until it becomes a blob of rubber (the particle instead of the bubble) at the place opposite of wherever it was popped.\u00a0 Back to waves.\u00a0 All waves &quot;travel&quot; as\u00a0in sinusoidal movement - upcrest, peak, change direction, down to center, negative crest, to negative peak, change direction, back to center.\u00a0 Quantam entanglement is this:\u00a0 by necessity, if this side of a wave starts as an upwards moving peak, the other end will be the negative peak returning to zero.\u00a0 Top peak one side, negative peak other side.\u00a0 Simple enough?\u00a0 Now, why is\u00a0distance does NOT affected by time? Well, which reference frame are you in? To you, it takes the speed of light to go from your location to the other end of that EM wave.\u00a0 To you, if the wave is one light second long, you wonder why in time zero, if you &quot;pop&quot; (cause the wave to precipitate into a particle) one side if spin up (up crest) will cause in zero time, spin down on the other, there should be no mystery to understand.\u00a0 From your reference point, it should take one second, but it happens instantly, so you think the information is going at super luminal speed, but it is NOT.\u00a0 In the reference frame of the wave, travelling at light speed, all waves precipitate in time zero, because, as you approach the speed of light, time slows down.\u00a0 But, to the wave itself, going the speed of light, time has STOPPED.\u00a0 That&#39;s right, no matter how long a wave travels (without being and until it is disturbed/observed), it&#39;s span of distance occurs in NO TIME, within it&#39;s own reference frame, travelling at the speed of light.\u00a0 Deep breath.

The eye has locked out the majority of stimuli from reaching the brain (to prevent being overwhelmed) and\u00a0the senses only apprehend a small portion of what is truly out there. We are basically fit monkeys, determined by evolution. We\u00a0exist in a world that interacts with\u00a0and usually\u00a0conforms to our expectations of what evolution has provided for our sensing apparatus. These configurations become beliefs over time, and beliefs can influence Scientific conclusions. Thus, the Physics we observe may be at its fundamental level totally different from what we observe in\u00a0our status as evolved monkeys. Experiments are important, but we may be constrained by our own belief systems (or even our own\u00a0quantum vibration!)\u00a0to a degree. This is why we have quantum mechanics, but cannot figure out what it really means. Let&#39;s put it like this: the world we see as monkeys has a sympathetic component to it, Nature begins to act in accordance with our preconceptions because of this. Until we get down to the marrow, where quantum Physics has delved. Then, we notice our conceptions don&#39;t match. Evolution may have screwed us over when it comes to comprehending the Universe. Why? Because being alive is a higher priority than understanding reality for Scientific perks. We had to find food, and make sure we\u00a0were safe. Nature whittled our senses down to the bare necessities, so we could live most efficiently in a sometimes hostile environment.\u00a0\u00a0Mostly, and most importantly, humans remained separate from Nature to a significant degree. We cannot see the Unity of quantum mechanics because we are not aware of it in our consciousness. Instead, we see separation from Nature, as set by our monkey heritage (ego, and all that). Random probabilities are part of that separation, and we can&#39;t make much sense of randomness because we are not united with Nature. In a Universe that has a sympathetic component that reacts and interacts with consciousness, we are largely\u00a0chasing our own tail. Science does not consider enough its interaction with its own experiments, how the observer can augment results. Our own ideas of what the Universe constitutes may be largely a fantasy (objects are not solid, nor permanent, all is energy). We are not separate individuals,\u00a0but part of a collective. Until mankind begins to delve profoundly into Unity, Scientists will likely not find the answers\u00a0they seek, it is beyond their\u00a0perspective. Our notions of Time, matter and energy have to become guided by Unity. Consciousness is the way to enlightenment, because consciousness is not limited by the mechanics of the senses or body. Experiments that focus on interdependence and interconnection may reveal Unity. Separation + Consciousness\u00a0\u00a0interacts with Nature, but Unity + Consciousness also interacts with Nature. Is evolution leading us down the wrong path? That is highly possible. Evolution wants to produce fit monkeys, not Scientists. If fitness includes understanding the Universe, that may manifest through evolution. However, it may not.

I love your videos, and I need your help, meaning all physics communicators.<br>1. It&#39;s true, QM is more than 90 years old. Isn&#39;t time to check it out? I would suggest you read Steven Winberg&#39;s latest communication here:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/01/19/trouble-with-quantum-mechanics/\">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/01/19/trouble-with-quantum-mechanics/</a> or you wouldn&#39;t begin to believe me. There are too many &quot;anomalies&quot; in QM- It&#39;s time for a scientific revolution.\u00a0<br>2. The physics community will not accept this idea easily, and that is understandable - too many generations of physicists have been educated along QM paradigm. To trigger a scientific revolution we need innovators, and then early adopters - science communicators. The Physics community will be, at most, early majority, if you know what I mean in terms of diffusion of innovations.<br>3. The problem you address in this video is where the trigger is - Bell&#39;s experiments. I hope you will be curious enough to check wikipedia on this subject\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopholes_in_Bell_test_experiments\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopholes_in_Bell_test_experiments</a> , where you can read in the introduction, that the same Alain Aspect responsible for the influential 1982 Bell&#39;s experiments, late 2015 recognises that &quot;No experiment can be said to be totally loophole-free&quot;. So there is no evidence of quantum entanglement. (by the way ... everytime you see a Bell&#39;s test performed with photons, please ask what were the detection efficiency of the detectors, because if less than 67,7% all Bell&#39;s tests performed with photons are inconclusive, meaning no way to affirm entanglement - and if they answer you it is over that number, you ask them what method they used to calculate that efficiency, and if it is not Klishko, you say Hummmm ...).\u00a0<br>4. To finish this - you can now ask yourself why, the 3 major and unique quantum technologies proposed by QM, the quantum computer, quantum teleportation, and quantum encriptation, are all funded by companies that see the quantum computer as a threat to their secrets - both financial and military. No entanglement, no quantum computer. You see the problem?\u00a0<br>That will be the major barrier to a scientific revolution in Physics - we take down entanglement, and the funding disappears.\u00a0<br>I hope to hear from you soon.<br>scientific regards<br>Teresa (teresa.f.mendes@gmail.com).", "comment_date": "2018-02-06T18:57:06Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Chris King", "comment_text": "In what manner does the starlight driven adjustment to the detector cause it to interpret the state of an individual photon differently?

It takes three polarized lenses that one can buy from any camera shop. Vertically orient one lens and then place a horizontal oriented lens in front of it and about 100% of the light is stopped.

Let me try to figure out what it could be:  In Lasers all photons generated inside laser has the same quantum state they behave like bosons, all they are equal, different photons posses the same quantum state, not like fermions - 2 fermions cannot take the same state, but photons like any bosons can occupy the same quantum state.  (An important characteristic of bosons is that their statistics do not restrict the number of them that occupy the same quantum state.) So as I understand the same laser produces the light and the ray is split at 2 and directed to two opposite directions. All photons generated by the laser has the same quantum state so they are entangled. And the state is a super position of the polarization, unknown before measurement. At the one site the polarization was checked, and also it was checked at the other site. 4th principle of QM is when a system exists in a superposition of the states, measurement forces nature to make a choice and to choose only one of the possible states - like Shrod&#39;s Cat. And as I understand measuring polarization at the one place, is independent from the measurement of polarization at the other place, expected outcome the same results, the nature makes the same choice, but if that is the case that is not super-luminal communication speed, it is that the making choice is deterministic by something we do not know. Light also is something special it moves with exactly C everything for it from it&#39;s reference of frame happen for time 0, and all distances measured from the reference of frame of a photon is 0 as well so the light is somehow at all places together because the universe has a size of 0, and of course made the same choice. In other words if you move with exactly speed of C according to special relativity, it is possible for light and from lorentz transformation, the distance is 0, so the both photons are at the same place and they posses the same state by their birth. I could somehow expect that. The things could become fantastic if it is possible to influence at the measurement at the one place, and measure at the other place without an influence, if the influenced site can force the uninfluenced site to make the same choice, well that&#39;s it super-luminal communication a transfer of information between site A and site B with an unlimited speed, violation of special theory of relativity. If only the observed make a choice gives the same result that is NOT transfer of information between the site A and site B that is just collection the same result from the same source. Not transfer of information the events are not reason-consequence related at all and may happen within whatever time they wish including 0 making speed infinite but that is not information transfer nor teleportation of astronauts to a distant galaxy far far away.

By the way, I have to disagree with you when you said the cat in the box had a 50/50 chance of being asleep or awake.
