Therefore, H2 viewed as a &quot;fuel&quot; (stored energy medium) does not make sense at the outset (except for necessity such as space habitation where you can get warm, clean H2O, some electrical power back and have extra needed O2 on board in another tank). The history (as I understand it) is, at the outset of the automotive emissions regulations (mid 1960&#39;s), the question was asked of the smartest minds (space engineers), &quot;How low can emissions go?&quot; (wishing to eliminate poisonous NO, CO and toxic unburned hydrocarbons). The scientists proclaimed that, using H2 (as a &quot;fuel&quot;) and O2 as an oxidizing agent, the emissions can be benign warm H2O. This started the talk of H2O as a &quot;fuel&quot; but the &quot;energy sink&quot; reality ends the feasibility unless there is another CO2-free way (nuclear?) to create the hydrogen but, as stated, it is untenable unless the requirement is emissions at the vehicle and wholly inefficient unless cost is no object (space program). Without this in place (it is not) for dedicated service (again, not), there are better uses of electricity than to carry on the &quot;H2 as a fuel&quot; myth. Perhaps there are some out there who have those answers (or better sources for H2 extraction/yield in the works).

People love to discount hydrogen due to its high fuel price, but most of them ignore that hydrogen and fuel cells haven&#39;t realized economies of scale yet; with predictions that Hydrogen prices could drop from their current ~$14 per kg down to as low as $1-$2 per kg.  The only way to do that is with massive scale.  The problem is, the more companies that transition to BEV production, the less likely it is for FCEVs to hit the scale of sales they need.", "comment_date": "2021-12-29T18:07:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Mech", "comment_text": "Kinda sounds like VCR VS Beta max", "comment_date": "2021-12-28T22:23:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Steven Joy", "comment_text": "Hydrogen is much more abundant in the universe than earth bound elements", "comment_date": "2021-12-28T16:38:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Steven Joy", "comment_text": "Crack hydrogen on a large scale and never be short of water in Africa", "comment_date": "2021-12-28T16:33:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "snoozy04", "comment_text": "Tesla vs Nikola", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T13:02:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Duhamel", "comment_text": "Dianna, none of the big car manufactures are talking about cold weather usage and with good reason.

The synthetic fuel production demands a lot of energy, but it may be of the cleanest solutions. We could also keep the tech alive, using this, because it works with the traditional internal combustion engines. All the chemicals in use, producing batteries, are harming the nature maybe even more, than burning the traditional fuel we are used to use. It is just transferring the polution from the air, out of the cities, to somewhere else. Almost no one talks about, how batteries polute the environment, when they are thrown away, or recycled partly. Where do the chemicals go, when they are not usable anymore. All this is not happening with synthetic fuel, but there of course, many parts need oil still. Traditional batteries can&#39;t be it, imo . Imagine the first Teslas, just had very very much parrallel linked traditional batteries in a parallel connection. Oh yeah it is SO nature friendly, urrm , the batteries though ... . In history, the very first cars where electric yet, but this was given up. I guess it was the polution or cost along producing batteries.

Where do the C and O go? That&#39;s right, even MORE CO2!! Yuck! We&#39;d get more miles driven (and less CO2) if we just used the natural gas to directly power an internal combustion engine. Want even MORE driven miles from that natural gas? Great! Use it to fuel a modern combined cycle turbine generator plant, charge a BEV and drive that. But wait, hydrogen fans cry, can&#39;t we just split water to make hydrogen? Yes, but that has an EVEN HIGHER CO2 footprint, and a higher cost, than reforming natural gas.

I Honestly believe with every fiber of my being that BEV push has everything to do with financial greed under the guise of an Eco-friendly ruse; and here&#39;s why. Big Biz; especially the auto industry; has always been about profit first &amp; damn everything else. Is that a bad thing; in general No; but in this case, it&#39;s Devastating...environmentally. Only certain companies are allowed to mine the raw products then certain others allowed to transport, then to produce the batteries. There&#39;s $Billions in each level of the process and just a handful allowed. Now, what about all of the byproducts from the manufacturing assembly? Where are they disposed of? You know all of it is either caustic or pose a human health risk. Now what about disposing of them 5, 7, 10 years down the road? You cannot recycle Any battery; correct. So why are we making them hand over fist so blindly right now; Ignoring the environmental impact later? This is why the BEV push is strictly for financial gain. On the other hand, fuel cell cars are where the developmental work Should be, for multiple reasons. Firstly, the refill time is very close to a gas powered car so it would be easier for people to understand &amp; accept. The fuel supply is better protected from damage than a BEV. Range is already closer to a gas powered vehicle W/O costing over $100K to own. The repair cost are also lower since it&#39;s basically a pressure tank &amp; valves versus thousands of little batteries located in hard to access areas. The other reason I&#39;m leaning towards fuel cell is that they do Not keep taxing the electric grid for more power which means there is Nothing extra you have to buy; home charging stations; or to subscribe to like Tesla&#39;s Supercharging.

Considering the speed at which Tesla has really pushed through the mainstream use of BEVs, it makes me wonder why Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicles weren&#39;t pushed in the same manner.<br><br>No matter how you look at it, or what your reasons are, switching to some form of alternative fuel vehicle is in your best interest.

However where BEV&#39;s have still a huge potential of increasing the driving range (better batteries), this is less the case for hydrogen. The only way to do this is increase the efficiency of the fuel cell, which won&#39;t be easy, since already around 60+% is achieved from what I can find. So the growth margin for FCEV range is maybe around 20-30%. To be fair, they might try to get more hydrogen inside the same tank, but this might need a stronger tank due to pressure, more energy losses, ...<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=3m15s\">3:15</a> Hydrogen isn&#39;t really much newer than BEV&#39;s in terms of when they started/could start rolling out the infrastructure, FCEV infrastructure is just much more difficult to roll out. <br>For one you need hydrogen stations, BEV&#39;s don&#39;t need charging stations since they can charge at home. So you can start selling BEV&#39;s with a not so great infrastructure, this is virtually impossible for hydrogen. Essentially with BEV&#39;s, the infrastructure follows the growth of BEV&#39;s, with hydrogen you need to first roll out hydrogen infrastructure before you can really start to get FCEV&#39;s sold. This is a huge risk for those who build the hydrogen stations. If hydrogen vehicles don&#39;t take off afterwards, they&#39;ll have lost a lot of investment. <br>Secondly hydrogen stations are expensive to build and you need to constantly refuel them too, which adds more complexity in terms of logistics for example.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=4m05s\">4:05</a> so what do people who don&#39;t have a garage/private parkingspot/charging at work do with their cars? They go shopping for example, so you place chargers at the shopping locations. Moreover they need to park their cars somewhere, so try to get public charging spots at those location. Also maybe they can convince their employer to install a charger they can use at reasonable cost for example, it is not like this charger will not be usefull anyway in the future. This isn&#39;t really a reason to go hydrogen, improving the way people charge/charging infrastructure might be a cheaper and a better solution than placing hydrogen stations all over.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=4m50s\">4:50</a> problem with hydrogen is the volumetric density, not the mass density. A regular FCEV can maybe store around 5kg of hydrogen, a battery can weigh around 400-500kg and more (or less). This means you can with 250Wh/kg 50kg battery store around 125 000 Wh vs around 175 000 Wh and then ofcourse you need to take into account the efficiency, lets be optimistic and say the fuel cell is 70% efficient and battery is 90% efficient. This means it is around 122k vs 112k Wh to the motor, barely any difference.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=7m00s\">7:00</a> true that you can increase FCEV vehicles range without adding much mass, however the problem again is volumetric, not mass. You can&#39;t just keep adding/enlarging hydrogen tanks to/in a passenger car. It might be easier for e a big rig, but these are normally also limited in size, so you can&#39;t just keep adding more either.<br><br><br>Honestly often this video felt quite biased in favor of FCEV&#39;s. <br><br>FCEV&#39;s have no real future in the passenger vehicle market past maybe a niche group. For trucks it might be good for some situations, in other situations BEV trucks win out. The main market for hydrogen (in terms of vehicles) imo is shipping and aviation.", "comment_date": "2021-09-02T20:02:04Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "Robert Bringardner", "comment_text": "I fully believe hydrogen fuel cells have the propensity to eliminate emissions in vehicles like tractor trailers.

It was pretty easy to do... except that you had to be sure that you could reach the next nat gas fueling station. The dual system meant that you could switch over to gasoline when you ran out of nat gas. Nat gas DOES burn cleaner than gasoline so less emissions AND it was about half the cost of gasoline. But it is still a fossil fuel. Mostly the range of such a vehcile was limited to the amount of compressed Nat gas you could carry. I could get about 140 km per fill. I did ONE lengthy trip where I could fill pretty much at the end of each tank full. 800 km one way. There was only one stretch of about 80 km that I had to switch to gasoline. The trip also took longer because I was stopping more. BUT it only cost me about half the amount of a totally gasoline fueled trip. So that was the trade off.<br>HOWEVER! Nat gas cars didn&#39;t catch on and all of this effort, including the infrastructure to supply the vehicles, is now gone. It was an interesting experiment.<br>BC has a huge abundance of hydro electric power. I would be very interested in a fuel cell car but again, when would the distribution infrastructure be ready?

I do not understand why , for reaching 400miles, an electric battery car is 1500 kg more weight.<br>In fact, we drive (with heavier cars) 5 km/kwh (speed 100km/h). That is now ca 4 kg of battery. 400 miles, 640 km, tells me that I need ca than 500 kg of battery.. Even with some extra strength in a car to carry this weight it cannot be more than 650 kg in total weight for battery. And we do not need a chemical factory in the car (the fuelcel) Difference in weight is not more than a third to 40% of what you are telling. Also, in contrary to your story....when you want more range in a hydrogen car it&#39;s going to be heavier. Because the fuel tank, high pressure tanks (800 bar I&#39;m told) do have a mass.And when doubling the tank the mass will also get much more...to keep that 800 bars at bay, even in accidents.<br>You&#39;re telling that charging an bev takes 30 minutes average. New technology on batteries , laboratorium , claim minutes of charging. My car can charge from 10-80% in 18 minutes, not 30 minutes at a decent (800volt 350KW) fast charger. (Yes the ioniq 5 is already delevered in my country, range close to 300 miles).<br>For charging a fuelcel car you MUST go to a filling station (the same as for petrol cars). BEV cars can be charges at or near home (yes also when not heving a private parking or garage) when the government is taking environnement seriously like in the Netherlands. When you buy a BEV in my country just ask your town to build a public slowcharger near your house and they will do on all locations whene there is no one near by or when there are not enough slow chargers near by. Slow charging is all up to 10KW charging (3 phase) or in otherwords...every morning you&#39;re starting the day with a fully charged car and can go on for 300 miles without chatrrging (depending on the type of car more or less) . Mayb on 2 or 3 trips a year you&#39;&#39;l need a fast charger. For hydrogen you&#39;ll need stations for refilling for every 300 miles. In other words....much more hydrogen stations needed than fast chargers when we extrapolate to hugh numbers (all cars om hydrogen or all cars on battery). Hydrogen stations have theit own problems for refuelling...I advise youtube on this subject from Tesla Bjorn (Bjorn Nyland) from norway and the video&#39; s about this subject from engineering explained (an USA channel). Also I van tell that in Norway already one hydrogen fuelling station exploded. Easy to find on internet.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=11m40s\">11:40</a> If the grid is down you cannot charge a BEV, taht&#39;s correct. But you can use some electricty from your BEV for keeping your fridge cold. (V2L). But also you cannor refuel your petrol car. Gazstations NEED electricity for pumping the fual. The same for hydrogen...They use electricity for compressing the hydrogen to the 800 bar.<br><br>No &#39; I&#39;m not against use of hydrogen , but only at those places where the battery is not a technical option, because being good for the environnement means....as efficient as possible using the energy. Also not all batteries need to bee li-on...other options like iron when weight is less an issue can be very usefull.<br><br>Why should the grid fail at night when we start charging all our verhicles? 15 miljon? On average A car will be charges easily with 4KW during the night <b>Half a battery</b>  most even need less enery. And at night (Californie) we do NOT need so much airconditioners at homes, factories are using less energy. I calculated that in the Netherlands the grid will not get any issue when driving all normal cars electric. Average distance a day 36 km of at max 8KWH (1 KWH /hour needed   during a full night) Would be a very bad grid when it fails at such use. It&#39;s a big mistake to multiply number of cars with 50-100KW charging all at the same moment. We also do not expect that all petrol cars can refill at exactly the same moment....(The queue would be inmens if 15000000 cars wants to refill at only 8000 gaz stations).<br><br>Also the man telling about taking 4000 trucks offline during night for recharging....I suppose it will be a 7*24 business....well A battery can charge at 3C from 10-80% (my car). This does not alter when the battery gets bigger. So only for lunch brake or coffee brake it is enough time for charging (This will be using hyper chargers...maybe even 1MW).<br><br><br>ps My child was already busy wihth experiments on fuel cell AND (solar) battery cars in 2007 and 2008 at the high school.

But if we generated all the hydrogen for a third of the amount of FCEV at the same time the grid would go down.  The fact that people use most power during the day and charge during the night means a more distributed load.  Using tech that charges at time where the rate is the lowest means that you not only get the cheapest power, but BEV&#39;s would actually help stabilize the grid usage.<br><br>Another huge point is that the main purpose of EV&#39;s is to help the environment.  If vehicles take 3 times more power to run it is going to take a lot more infrastructure to produce that extra power, until we get rid of carbon burning power plants this is going to mean we are using fossil fuels.  Also we are much more likely to use the cheapest way to produce hydrogen, which is basically the using modified fossil fuels but less efficiently than burning them directly, so it is likely to be worse for the environment than an ICE vehicle unless that is made illegal which is currently not on the table in any country to my knowledge.<br><br>The comments on some of the issues with BEV&#39;s are also not really accurate anymore.

Two technologies are very noteworthy in this regard: <br>1. BEV&#39;s (battery electric vehicles)<br>2. Heat pumps<br><br>The reason why BEV&#39;s reduce the primary energy demand is quite obvious. 7l of gasoline for 100km contains about 70kWh of energy. A BEV on the other hand using only 20kWh for the same distance. So the primary energy demand drops to a third even if we drive the same distance. <br><br>Heat pumps are less obvious, since we often think that oil heaters for example are already 98 percent efficient, so how can this be improved? I won&#39;t go into the thermodynamics of this, but as a matter of fact the energy demand can be reduced drastically with heat pumps. An oil heater produces less than 1kWh of thermal energy for 1kWh of oil. A heat pump on the other hand produces 3-5kWh of therman energy for 1kWh of electric energy. That means that with heat pumps we can reduce the primary energy demand to a 1/3 or even a 1/5. <br><br>These are key technologies for a successfull and intelligent energy transition. We get the same comfort for a lot less energy. This also means that we need less renewable energy sources, which allows us to make the energy transition faster.

Hydrogen fuel cell cars use 2-3 times the energy that a battery electric vehicle would use. In places like germany or switzerland and certainly a lot more places we don&#39;t have those 2-3 times more energy in the transportation sector (which makes up a large chunk of the energy demand). That means that in such places the energy transition and thereby the paris climate goals of reaching net zero CO2 emissions by 2040 would be virtually impossible. <br><br>That&#39;s why regenerative energy systems experts like Prof. Volker Quaschning and many others make it pretty clear that BEV&#39;s have to be the future. If fuel cell powered cars become too popular it would endanger the energy transition. To save it we would have to drive 2-3 times less kilometers then with BEV&#39;s. Does anyone really want that? The problem become even worse if with e-fuels, since you also need hydrogen for it, but have to process it further, which causes more energy losses and you&#39;ll burn it in internal combustion engines, which are highly inefficient. That would mean we&#39;d need about 6 times more energy for the same distance. So that would also endanger the energy transition in case this would spread too much. Or if you want to see it this way: The more inefficient the technologies that we use the longer it will take to complete the energy transition, the more expensive it will probably be and the less we&#39;ll be able to do/the more we&#39;ll have to give up. <br><br>The bottom line is that you can&#39;t look at any potential technology that helps us achieve carbon neutrality by itself. You will always have to look at it in the context of the energy system it&#39;s working in. Which means that it&#39;s crucial to read the scientific literature in regards to 100 percent renewable or CO2 neutral energy systems. <br><br>Another thing to consider are EROEIS. Renewables can have quite low EROEIS therefore we have to be carefull when combining renewables with very inefficient technologies. We don&#39;t want to end up using more energy then we get back in the form of work i.e. we don&#39;t want our energy sources to end up as energy sinks. So if a solar panel has an EROEI of 3 (it hasn&#39;t) and i use it to produce e-fuels to drive an internal combustion engine with (losses of over 90 percent), then i won&#39;t have gained any energy. I lost energy in the overall process i.e. i made life harder compared to having done nothing.<br><br>PS:<br>I&#39;m not bashing hydrogen by the way. The scientific literautre seems to be quite clear about the fact that we&#39;ll have to produce hydrogen to produce some amount of e-fuels and as an long term energy storage system (to deal with the seasonal variability of renewables), but because of the losses it&#39;s not a good idea to use them anywhere where it isn&#39;t completely necessary. For cars it&#39;s not necessary.

Certainly a lot of energy that may overload the grid if not prepared for that. Now what would it take to fuel 4000 trucks with Hydrogen? 3 times more electricity. Ok, yo can make the hydrogen (and consume the electricity) in advance, not necessarily at the time of fueling like when you charge the batteries, but at the same rate of production, it will take 3 times more time to produce the electricity needed to make hydrogen. So you you load the batteries of 4000 trucks during 8 hours at night at the same time, you will have a peak of load during these 8 hours every night. But to fuel the same 4000 trucks with hydrogen, you will be generating that same &quot;peak&quot; of energy 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (because 8 x 3 = 24). That means that the capacity of generation must be the same for both, and the net consumption of energy is triple for hydrogen. Not only that, as Physics Girl explained, there is not much room to improve on hydrogen production and electricity generation from hydrogen, we are approaching the theoretical limits. However in batteries there are several leads of investigation going on, batteries will get better, live longer, be smaller and lighter, and charge faster. On top of that, expanding / improving the electric generation capacity needs to take place either for hydrogen or batteries, and more so for hydrogen, and on the distribution side improving / expanding the distribution of electricity is easier and cheaper that creating a distribution system for hydrogen, which involves very specialized pipelines (much more complex and expensive than wires) or, even worse, transporting by truck. And... as we move to renewable energies (all or most of which are electrical generation) it makes a lot of sense to remain electric all the time (instead of going from electric to hydrogen to electric). What I mean is that if we are going to keep moving towards electric ovens, ranges, water heaters, home heaters (heat pumps) and cloth dryers, to replace non-renewable gas with renewable electricity, we are going to need to upgrade the electric grid anyway... or produce more electricity at home with solar panels, which is the smartest thing to do... and good luck using that home-produced electricity to generate hydrogen at home. The fact that not nearly everybody has its own garage will be circumvented with rent homes offering charging capability (that will be a competitive advantage as electric cars become more popular), street charging systems similar to park-meters, parking lots with charging systems (so you can charge while in Walmart) and at work locations too, and charging stations that, combined with improved batteries, will become faster and more capable over time. While there may be a niche for hydrogen now, I sincerely think that hydrogen is a dead end in the long run. It becomes immediately obvious when you see the huge differences in efficiencies and the possibilities (or lack of) for each to improve that efficiency in the future. The only place where hydrogen may have a future (and I still doubt it) is in applications where eight is critical, and I mean airplanes. But then having synthetic kerosene made from plants (including algae) or from carbon captured from the atmosphere will have so much more energy density that hydrogen will not be a competition. So, again, even in aviation, I think hydrogen is a dead end in the long run. I would not be buying hydrogen stocks if I planned to keep them in the long term.", "comment_date": "2021-08-21T15:47:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dreffon", "comment_text": "Fuel cells for planes?

GM had been developing them for quite some time, and we had one of their development facilities in our area that one of my neighbors worked at as an industrial engineer.  It was in 2008 when they finally had a fuel cell vehicle (a Blazer, or something like that, it&#39;s been a while) that they passed around to the employees for the purposes of spreading the good word to the public.  She brought it over to our house one day and we took it for a spin around the neighborhood (we couldn&#39;t spend much time with it, she only had it for the evening).  It drove like a regular vehicle, of course, except for the turbine sound of the fuel cell cooling system, which of course made it seem quite futuristic.  I was really quite excited about it, just <b>knowing</b> that this would be the future.  For posterity, I had my kids pose for a picture in front of it, one of them (of course) standing there with a &quot;gee, dad, this is about the stupidest thing in the world&quot; look on their face.<br><br>Fast forward a few years and GM threw in the towel.  They hit some pretty significant barriers, one of which was the cost of the fuel cell (largely due to the expense of the platinum it required).  I haven&#39;t read about the most recent developments of fuel cell technology, and I have to assume that this has been overcome to some degree.  But I knew Toyota was still working on it, and I was (in my head at least) cheering them on.<br><br>Fast forward to last year and, well, I bought a BEV.  There were no FCEVs for me to consider, not in my area at least.  Toyota seems like the only player in fuel cells for consumer vehicles (I might be wrong on this, it&#39;s just what I&#39;ve kept up with via the articles that come across my feed, which is admittedly not comprehensive; I&#39;m not a journalist and I haven&#39;t done all the research).  The technology seems impractical; the infrastructure is a problem, hydrogen storage and handling is a problem, etc.  Compared to the relative simplicity of BEVs, it just seems like a bad idea to try to push this technology to consumers.<br><br>So, I&#39;m bummed that it turned out this way for the FCEV, at least for me.  And I have a suspicion that FCEVs are just not going to be a thing; a total flip from my optimistic perspective back in 2008.  Just considering the fuel infrastructure alone (it&#39;s all different; you can&#39;t use the petroleum pipelines, fuel delivery trucks, tanks or pumps at stations, etc., and the replacement cost is high) compared to the pre-existing electrical grid that can be used today (and, admittedly, upgraded tomorrow to take on the additional burden of more BEVs), well, it just seems like a race that can&#39;t be won.<br><br>But forget about my disappointment with FCEVs, that&#39;s not the story here.  It&#39;s really about how obvious it is that Diana is just being a shill for Toyota.  But of course she is, they sponsored this thing.  This is just one of Toyota&#39;s marketing videos.  Full stop.

This mean you are losing  a 92% of the output + 12% of batteries + 12% of your car batteries +7% wire loses, so around 96% of the source power lost. <br>If you want to double the capacity of your batteries, to 8 hours, your capital cost also doubles. <br>Now some may say, but we can use the same car batteries to store that power, but the issue is the same, beyond 4 hours of storage, hydrogen becomes more cost effective, not only that, what happen when you need to store season disparaties?   Summer of solar vs winter. <br>Then you have that hydrogen pipeline transport is 10 times more cost effective than electricity by wires.<br>For last.. we have that the 60% of all the energy consumed by the world needs to be on chemical state (hydrogen in this case), because airplanes, ships, no electrify trains, long range trucks, the natural gas network, all those energy sectors can not work on batteries. <br>So if you want to clean all energy sectors, you need to generate clean energy with solar and wind and 60% of that needs to be one way or another chemical energy, this mean that you can not count the 40% energy lost from fuel cells, because you need that one way or another, this mean you balance the power grid just converting excess to hydrogen, as you need to produce a lot more for all the other sectors there are almost few cases that you would need to convert hydrogen to electricity again to feed the power grid.  <br>It is incredible that no youtuber understand these cases, and that is the reason why almost all countries had huge hydrogen roadmaps planned.", "comment_date": "2021-08-20T18:59:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexis Goetcherian", "comment_text": "Using cars to &quot;solve&quot; or help solve the climate crisis is somewhat bizarre to me... why are we trying to develop cleaner ways of doing something inefficiently when we could be building out walkable cities, then cycling paths and public infrastructure?

In large Spanish cities a number of rental companies have sprung up that maintain fleets of electrics that people get in and drive around the city. Keys are digital and sent by mobile, and cars are opened over bluetooth. The average range is about 50km. Computers monitor their location and charge. When they are low the computer removes them from circulation and the company sends out personnel to drive them to nearby charging stations, then puts them back on the road. It works well. They are popular. About half the price of taxis and cheaper than owning a car if you only drive occasionally. They are not without issues, though. First, they tend to charge people by the minute rather than by the kilometre, which leads to unsafe driving. Second, you can&#39;t guarantee availability, and depending on traffic patterns vehicles tend to be unavailable when you need them and abundant when you don&#39;t. So you might drive to a place and then be &quot;stranded&quot;. ;) Despite this, they are very popular, as anyone with a driving licence will prefer them to hailing a cab. Electrics may also make sense for short-range inner-city logistics, loading and unloading, and delivery, generally run by workers on an eight hour shift, or maybe two workers on two shifts for 14-16 hours of operation, and the rest of the time the vehicles are idle - so they can be charged for the next day no problem.<br><br>It would be a different story, though, if everyone had a BEV. Even if we had as many electric stations as petrol stations, and people were willing to wait longer, they would just collapse. They are designed for fill-up times of a few minutes. There would be long queues and long waits to access a charging station. We&#39;d need higher capacity if everyone switched. Rental companies can mitigate this essentially by rotating cars in and out of circulation.<br><br>Furthermore, the reality is most people in European cities want their private cars for holiday trips and visiting relatives, not city driving. That involves long distance driving. Electrics <b>can</b> also be used for that now with super-charging stations, but their range is short so you need to <b>carefully</b> plan your route from one station to the next and be prepared to wait between charges.<br><br>Hydrogen is the only technology that could really substitute petrol cars in terms of range, capacity and convenience. While they take slightly longer to fill up, it&#39;s only a small difference, and we can mitigate this by streamlining payment through digital payment platforms - payment in traditional petrol stations takes as long or longer than filling up. So we can more or less get away with just adding hydrogen pumps to existing petrol stations if we&#39;re smart about it.<br><br>The issue, though, is that this is the CURRENT situation. If, however, there were another battery breakthrough that extended the range of BEV to at least 600 km per charge or beyond and lengthened the lifespan of BEV, then BEV will definitely win. If the range of BEV went to 1000 km on a single charge, it would be no contest. If you can get better batteries with increased energy density to extend the range such that you only have to charge occasionally, and a single charge will get you at least as far as you can go in a single day of driving, then the efficiency of BEV is a no brainer. Li-ion batteries are just not there - but they are tantalizingly close to being there.

This, in turn, doubles the amount of carbon linked to the production of the required electricity, no matter how clean the source is, because it\u2019s <b>never</b>  zero.

In other words, you\u2019re changing the <i>slope</i> of the line that accounts for the total amount of carbon that was emitted since the beginning of the manufacturing process at any given point in time. Given the relatively long life of a typical car, this means the total CO2 emissions of a FCEV over its entire lifetime is likely to be quite a bit higher than that of a BEV for the same usecase. Obviously, here, we\u2019d need to compare the initial intensity of manufacturing to be sure, but I\u2019m ready to bet that they\u2019re similar, and the lifetime emissions are generally dominated by the per-kilometer component anyway.<br><br>Unless you can find some other major advantage of FCEVs that\u2019s good enough to justify this discrepancy, this sounds very much like a deal-breaker here.

Hydrogen is insanely light. In fact, I&#39;m fairly sure that it beats out everything short of nuclear power in terms of Wh/kg, but the real kicker to hydrogen is Watthours per cubic meter. (Wh/m^3) That is, and has always been, it&#39;s main stumbling block.<br><br>Hydrogen is not dense. At all. In fact, the energy desity for hydrogen is so atrocious we have to freeze it to an extremely cold temeperature just so we can pack it tightly enough for it to be practical. And this isn&#39;t really anything that can be improved upon. Hydrogen cars may get expanded range as all the small systems and possibly the energy conversion in it gets improved, but the size of a fuel cell can&#39;t really be improved any farther, in contrast with batteries who are constantly improving in this area and probably will for a while.<br><br>This all means that the larger a veichle is the more sense it makes to use hydrogen. People have mentioned planes, and yes, that is a possibility, but planes would have to be a lot larger than they are currently for that to make sense, and storing freezing hydrogen is no easy task, especially somewhere with fluctuating pressures. Not saying it can&#39;t be done, but there are more than a few problems with the idea. Trucks are better, but still not really large enough. I feel batteries will probably still be more viable even at that scale. Wheels are amazing things, and with those the weight doesn&#39;t really hold the same meaning than it does in a plane.<br><br>Fuel efficency and range is only minimally impacted if a wheeled veichle is 1000kg or 4000kg. Which is why the weight of batteries really aren&#39;t as big a downside as some people seem to think.<br><br>Where hydrogen would really shine is boats. More specifically; giant transport ships. They shouldn&#39;t have much problems with pressure there, and storing it should be far easier than on any plane. And they&#39;re large enough that the Wh/kg would probably be more important than Wh/m^3. Of course, the actual best solution for such ships would be nuclear power, which has FAR more energy in both density and weight. But that has problems with the insane requirements for training personel and the awful public opinion on nuclear power.<br><br>The seconday problem with Hydrogen (which you actually did mention)  are their sheer inefficiency. So much energy is lost between conversion and action that the only time I can really see it as viable is if we have plenty of cheap power. But considering fusion might be comming in the next decade that might not be too difficult a problem to overcome.<br><br>Whatever the case, either battery or hydrogen cars are indeed going to &#39;win&#39;.

The same way you crash the grid switching on every possible load(which is a poor argument, as most vehicles actually charge at night time, helping even further to even out grid peaks of day and night)- the same way you would crash your fueling system if you would send all the cars to refuel at once- that will never happen in normal conditions. Unless the pipeline bursts- and we saw what happens then with such fragile systems(where hydrogen is even worse to transport and store). Last but not least- the whole point of using hydrogen at this point instead of existing fuels is to reduce co2 emissions- but every single hydrogen refuelling station you will go to is getting hydrogen made from Methane with lots of waste product of what?-Yes good old CO2 and pumping more of fossil fuels out, making it as bad and even worse than all fossil fuels because it&#39;s even less efficient. And the clean hydrolysis way is just years and years away to potentially get to a financially viable option at scale for all. And if you add the curve of battery energy density improvement year over year on top by the time we can have clean hydrogen at scale, Big IF, as massive investments will be needed now, while there are no profits out of it...by that time we won&#39;t need it(with exception of some niches), as the batteries and capacitors will do it as good or better.

You mention hydrolysis is the cleanest way of producing hydrogen but forget to mention that most hydrogen (95% as of 2020) is produced by steam reforming natural gass. And even if we&#39;d use electricity for hydrolysis most of the grid is not powered by renewable energy. Meaning every kilowatt we use more than necessary will come from fossil fuels as the clean energy capacity is simply not there. And don&#39;t say it&#39;s clean if we place it next to a solar farm or something alike, because if it could have fed the grid it&#39;s not helping, it&#39;s just nice PR. Electrolysis for hydrogen is only good when you use excess energy, but that has a whole new downside. Producing hydrogen from electrolysis is already more expensive than steam reforming but if we&#39;re only running a plant when excess energy is available it is downright not viable because downtime of a plant like that is very costly.<br><br>The weight vs range graph is somewhat true, but, the energy density of batteries aswell as the efficiency of BEV&#39;s is going up rapidly.  <br><br>The interview with the guy from the non-profit is nice, but most can be said about BEV&#39;s aswell, not only hydrogen like it is portrayed now.<br><br>Going on to the &quot;clean&quot; / &quot;zero-emissions&quot; hydrogen trucks; I&#39;ll just refer to mentioned above, the part about efficiency, about the production of hydrogen... Further, if you look at the upcoming battery electric trucks, they should be able to charge up during on- and offloading and mandatory rest stops for practically no downtime.not the 4 to 12 hours that guy in the video mentioned.<br><br>Love what you say about converting all 50M cars to BEV&#39;s right now. Yes the grid would definitely fail, but what if we convert all 50M to hydrogen right now?.... Both would need some serious infrastructure upgrades to make this happen. But building a solar powered charging station is way less expensive than building a hydrolysis station. Also because of safety you cant build hydrogen stations / production just anywhere. And even if you could you need economy&#39;s of scale to produce cos-effective, not small plants all over the place. So we going to transport highly combustible fuel through our neighborhoods? Or non cost-effective production everywhe.... oh, wait, we can&#39;t because then we&#39;d need to produce a less efficient fuel off of a not sufficient / un-sustainable grid...<br><br>The end piece about the climate and air pollution, I&#39;ll just refer back to the production of hydrogen again. <br><br>Tell me again why we need hydrogen.... By the time we have enough clean renewable excess energy to get value out of hydrogen the world will already run on batteries entirely if you ask me.<br><br>Sorry, i usually love your video&#39;s but felt like you are way off on this one. <br><br>You should watch some video&#39;s of Cleanerwatt / Sandy Munro / CleanTechnica / Rob Maurer (Tesla Daily) etc.", "comment_date": "2021-08-19T15:19:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Sheppard", "comment_text": "I understand that you need sponsorship, but I wish these felt less like a Toyota commercial and more like your old videos.", "comment_date": "2021-08-19T15:16:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "zapisana kartka", "comment_text": "Great video!

And because the end product is exactly the same, these production technologies are in direct competition, and the fossil fuel approach is WILL win unless it&#39;s either outright banned or heavily taxed.

So, not only can you charge in a rented house you share with roommates, you can charge while staying at an airbnb on vacation.<br><br>I can understand wanting to educate people on FCEV, but the presentation of the data seems biased.  From my research on the topic, two very notable things are not being mentioned as of yet (perhaps on an upcoming video).  The speed of technology development for BEVs is going up at a similar rate to its adoption.  So even questions of range increase being tied to weight of the vehicle is shifting as BEV tech is developing new batteries with much higher energy density.  While current FCEV tech does beat out BEV on this graph, if technology improvements continue on the current trend, BEV will be much closer to FCEV in the not so distant future.  <br><br>The other major item is how exactly H-fuel is created.  As of now, my understanding is the vast majority of hydrogen we need to fuel what few hydrogen vehicles we have now is generated using unsustainable methods requiring natural gas/electrolysis.  If my memory serves me correctly, it takes more energy from the grid just to create the fuel than the amount of energy it can provide to the vehicle, let alone if that energy were just directly placed into a BEV.  So increasing the number of FCEVs would currently cause a spike in pollutants in order to create the Hydrogen fuel needed.  Not to say that FCEV tech cannot get to a point where fuel development is sustainable, but as i understand, they are nowhere near that at this time.  <br><br>Personally, I would love to see FCEV become an option at some point, but if someone were to give me a billion dollars today and say, you can spend this on developing either FCEV, BEV or both; with where we are today, I would put nearly every penny into BEV.

One issue I feel got too little attention are the impacts non-mobility markets will have on hydrogen, hydrogen pricing, and, ultimately, the economics of hydrogen mobility. A couple of points to consider:<br>- Hydrogen is already used in many industrial applications, particularly in the chemical industry. Most of that (~94 %) is fossil hydrogen from methane cracking. Therefore, that legacy use of hydrogen will have to be covered by &quot;green&quot; hydrogen from renewable energy electrolysis. <br>- There are several applications where hydrogen is the ONLY alternative to how we currently produce stuff, e.g. steel. At the moment, steel is produced using coking coal, which emits a lot of greenhouse gases. The current thinking in the industry is that hydrogen is the only viable alternative to producing steel from iron ore without the use of coke. Luckily, several companies are working on that and Hybrit from Sweden just announced that they shipped a first batch of &quot;green steel&quot; to Volvo using hydrogen. <br>- As carbon taxes, tariffs, and whatnot rise, i.e. the cost of carbon emissions rises, the economics will swing towards a widespread adoption of hydrogen for many industries outside of mobility. <br><br>For these reasons I believe there are several applications for hydrogen outside of mobility markets that will determine the pricing of hydrogen worldwide. These industries, particularly the steel industry, will dominate the demand side and therefore push hydrogen pricing so high that FCEV will not be able to compete against BEV, at least when it comes to passenger vehicles.

Thing is, hydrogen needs a Tesla of sorts, and that&#39;s pretty hard to accomplish.... specially now that Nicola imploded. The idea of hydrogen cell as replacement for regular fuel cars, in modern presentation, has been around longer than battery in a feasible way. It&#39;s pretty bad for it to be still behind the curve like that. I&#39;m not sure if I put much faith in it getting to that exponential upwards curve that battery is getting to.<br>On the other hand, California or America in general is not all countries, so there could be potential for growth in other countries.<br>EVs are a distant reality where I live. I&#39;ve seen people adopting hybrids... but because we have no wide availability neither for fast charging stations nor hydrogen pumps, it&#39;s still kinda up for grabs. It&#39;s not that people don&#39;t want alternatives... heck, we had a pretty interesting if short lived period with people making conversions to natural gas. I only kinda know and remember it because some of those conversions were pretty shoddy, some cars exploded, etc. If people are willing to go that way...<br>Obviously battery has a leg up there for the simple fact that you could manage (slowly and poorly, but still) with a home installation alone, or even out of the grid with excruciantingly slow charging times or making use of short distance travel only. This also isn&#39;t a perfect strategy here because quite frankly, electrical installations are so poorly made here that I fear the ammounts of electrical fires and whatnot coming for people getting bevs... every single summer we have a huge spike in home fires because people are getting ac units and plugging in homes that are not prepared to take the load.<br>So, what hydrogen really needs in countries like mine is an extremely large, extremely heavy handed push for availability. It needs multiple car manufacturers to adopt it, with a standard nozzle skipping the proprietary phase, and a huge build up in charging facilities.<br>Whoever does it first in my country will take the cake, because up to today, we have neither - substantially I mean.<br><br>Regardless of all this, I do agree that it&#39;s just plain better to keep working on both tech, they are both promissing. Just that neither reached the mainstream everyday commute point just yet, though bev is certainly closer for americans. I&#39;ll just say this: if battery tech evolves to one of the promissing stuff that is in labs right now, like solid state batteries or something like that... it&#39;s kinda all over for hydrogen, isn&#39;t it? And the push is really there, far more than there is for hydrogen. The window of opportunity is closing down.<br>There are already some promisses of lighter, more efficient, safer, cheaper to produce batteries on the horizon. Perhaps I&#39;m wrong on this, but efficiency in hydrogen fuel cells and cleaner methods of production sounds generally harder to accomplish in the short term, and there&#39;s far less people looking into it, because you know, batteries are far more than just for EVs - which kinda is the genious part of it.", "comment_date": "2021-08-19T10:26:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yhtimSmithy", "comment_text": "There are two major issues that I&#39;ve not seen discussed in these videos. <br><br>1.

FCEV and BEV completely miss the real solution, which is to radically reduce the dependence on cars. In Europe, if you&#39;re near a city you don&#39;t need a car - public transport is excellent, and there are enough facilities (shops, banks, hairdressers) within walking distance. We can&#39;t fix the climate crisis with new technologies alone. The first and most important solution is to reduce demand, <b>then</b> replace the demand with cleaner options. Public transport will always be far more efficient than the best electric car.<br>This also goes for the trucks - Ideally these should only be used to cover the last 10-50 miles. Everything else is better carried by rail, which is powered directly from the grid.<br><br><br>BEV also have other advantages.

I doubt that hydrogen stations will all be equipped with their own on-site power and even if, the question is if your payment system will work, if it relies on internet access and when the power outage is bigger, it might very well affect this too. In conclusion, I disagree with Diana on this point. If I had a hydrogen powered car, I would not be able to charge it at home or anywhere where there is a regular 240V 50Hz 16A socket. Which is basically everywhere. In the case of a massive blackout, I probably will have more important problems to solve than to charge my car. Also, how much hydrogen is actually made by electrolysis? How much is made from fossil sources? Last: The term Batterry Electric Vehicle, or BEV, is technically incorrect. It is an accumulator vehicle, as it can be recharged. Batteries are single use primary cells. I know that the english language is pretty benevolent when it comes to using the term battery for both primary (true batteries) and secondary cells (accumulators), but this is not the case in other languages. For example, in German, people do not say that the &quot;Batterie&quot; died on their phone, they say their &quot;Akku&quot; (short for accumulator). Same with other electronics like notebooks. But a TV remote control or a wireless mouse/keyboard, which are often powered by single use batteries, need &quot;Neue Batterien&quot;, which is technically correct. Also, when it comes to hybrid trolleybuses that can operate off the grid, or even streetcars with their own independent electricity storage for emergencies so they can move out of an intersection if the power fails, we refer to the &quot;traction accumulator&quot;, nobody is saying &quot;battery&quot; or &quot;traction battery&quot;. The reason is use this wording is to distinguish the traction accumulator from the &quot;regular&quot; accumulator, that operates the 24V circuits and contactors you need in order to connect to the HV system. Even my own electric car has two types of accumulators. The regular 12V lead-acid and then the traction acumulator that stores the energy to move the car. I really dislike the term &quot;battery electric vehicle&quot;.

Those who can&#39;t charge an EV at home can charge at work in the future, with increasing popularity of EV&#39;s, using daytime solar energy on PV panels mounted above the parking lots.  \r<br>Well, what to do with the excess solar PV output at the parking lots on weekends and holidays when people don&#39;t go to work?  Well, we will use the excess solar PV electricity to make H2 for people to fill-up their PFCV before heading home on Friday, for extended weekend driving if necessary.

Such as solar and wind sound great but they have a manufacturing cost and maintenance cost with a high waste rate due to life of equipment, which has a fairly large impact on the environment that has concerns of it being greater than what it is attempting to fix :)", "comment_date": "2021-08-19T00:31:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DinMamma002", "comment_text": "Great video, thanks!", "comment_date": "2021-08-19T00:30:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David McCarthy", "comment_text": "Continuation of Toyota advert.", "comment_date": "2021-08-19T00:30:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D Sherm", "comment_text": "damn you rent a house AND share with roommates?? being a successful science youtuber doesn&#39;t pay nearly as much as I thought it would :*(", "comment_date": "2021-08-19T00:29:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thunder Stumpges", "comment_text": "Haven&#39;t read every comment but no one so far has mentioned (and it wasn&#39;t in video either) the fact that batteries require so many rare metals that we are now dredging the ocean floors to get, and that all has to be disposed somewhere when it hits EOL.

First: I think that because the series is sponsored by Toyota, who would obviously benefit financially from increased popularization of FCEV vehicles, there is a greater burden of proving non-bias(?) in comparing FCEVs and BEVs within this series. So I&#39;m hoping we might still hear from people representing the latter. I can understand the inclination to focus on the FCEV side because it&#39;s the lesser-known technology, and that would be fine without a biased sponsor. I agree that the more alternatives to ICE-based transportation that we get on the road, the better, and so both FCEVs and BEVs are needed. But this brings me to the second thing, which is that if the goal is to produce cleaner, greener vehicles, then FCEVs are potentially problematic due to the fact that, to my understanding, most hydrogen is produced as a byproduct of natural gas production, and so is not very clean. If that&#39;s not the case for most of the hydrogen used in stations to refill FCEVs then I&#39;d like to know, which is part of why I hope this is covered in the series. Finally: people will argue that, just as FCEVs rely on unclean hydrogen (meaning produced from natural gas), BEVs often rely on electricity produced by power plants burning fossil fuels. FCEVs are cleanest if renewable energy is used to power electrolysis, and BEVs are cleanest if charged with renewable energy. But how scalable/efficient is renewables-powered electrolysis compared to the same for charging stations?

The fact is there is absolutely no way to charge a BEV fast even the batteries could charge that fast because of the power requirements. If your BEV requires 12 hours of charging with your 4 kW charger at home, doing it in 5 mins would require a half a megawatt charging station for each car. That&#39;s a ridiculous amount of power. But you will be able to refuel your hydrogen car in 5 mins and enjoy a zero emission car. So perhaps what we need is a refueling station that generates its own hydrogen. That would require less power if the station keeps producing hydrogen 24 hrs a day compared to the peak power requirements of a super fast charging station for BEVs. The only other way to make fast refueling possible for BEVs is the concept of swapping batteries but that also comes with a lot of problems starting with how to do that automatically and safely to the need for all manufacturers to agree on the same standard for batteries, which is not feasible since the range of a BEV depends on the battery which is the selling point to beat the competition.

Considering that hydrogen is not found in nature but has to be produced artificially and that its efficiency is 70% over the 85/90% of electrical conversion I would say that I would result in 15% less energy consumption than the same amount of trucks that are using hydrogen. But let me discuss furthermore the argument, how do you move electrons through the country? Cables, already there and the energy required is? Minimal. How do you move hydrogen? Well, you do not produce it for sure in every hydrogen station, so it has to be transported in huge trucks. What is in common between all the huge trucks? That they consume a ton of energy to move. The full-electric conversion would eventually result in not only a better efficiency but would also reduce massively the number of trucks roaming every day around transporting physical fuels such as gasoline or hydrogen. So I would say that the smart response to the question is: It would be clearly better than 4000 hydrogen trucks.

But we move to fuel cells then we need 30% more energy produced to do the same amount of work... that is a bit of a logistical nightmare as we electrify everything.<br><br>That said, there are some fantastic uses for hydrogen.

If you need to drive 2000 miles, and the best BEVs have a range of around 300 miles, that is 6-7 stops for recharging which will cost at least 3 hours of down time.

Green Hydrogen effectively DOES NOT EXIST. Gray and Blue Hydrogen are just petroleum companies strategy to keep pulling petroleum out of the ground. <br><br>Gray Hydrogen is steam reformation of Natural Gas (NG) that pumps the waste CO2 right into the atmosphere. It&#39;s even worse than NG powered Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) because it uses so much energy to heat the NG to separate the H2. <br><br>Blue Hydrogen purports to capture the CO2 to store it or put it to other uses. This &quot;storage&quot; is going to be like the &quot;green washing&quot; plastics companies did with their promise of recycling all plastic, which in reality can&#39;t be done. Pumping the waste CO2 into the ground (that&#39;s their proposal) is just pushing that CO2 release to sometime in the future. Compressed gases in the ground are eventually going to make their way into the atmosphere. Our grandchildren&#39;s grandchildren will have to suffer the consequences of our determination to pull petroleum out of the ground. Blue Hydrogen also wastes the electricity that it requires to now not only reform the NG but also to transport it and pump it to the underground storage that they have created for it. <br><br>Green Hydrogen, from electrolysis using renewable energy to create is the only Hydrogen that would be zero emissions, but only if the transportation and compression is also from renewable, zero emission, energy. Today, Green Hydrogen created with renewable energy is prohibitively expensive and requires A LOT more electricity than if the solar, wind, hydro, etc. power was just put directly into a battery. <br><br>There may be some use cases for fuel cell vehicles, but it WILL NOT be passenger cars. It probably shouldn&#39;t be for trains either. Trains run on tracks, therefore VERY predictable routes. Electric trains taking power from overhead lines is the best way to give trains their power. Including overhead lines when building new train tracks is a miniscule increase in infrastructure cost. Retrofitting existing lines with power lines is feasible and will amortize for train companies in only a few years. In the interim, before all tracks have overhead lines, trains that need to travel short distances between powered segments can hook up a train car(s) with rechargeable batteries for those stretches. <br><br>Boats and planes?

We already have PHEV, which pair Li-Ion with gas. FCEV by themselves still seem to be expensive, so bringing together the technologies of FCEV and BEV to make this new hybrid might be extremely expensive. <br><br>But the hybrid mentality is exactly why I still want to purchase a Chevy Volt (PHEV) as my next car. The resilience that you get, like whether the grid fails due to more frequent extreme weather events/a shift in climate (see ERCOT in Texas this past spring) or whether the Canadian tar sands dry up/Saudi Arabia stops selling oil to the US for political reasons/we outlaw shale and deepsea extraction, means less emergencies. Life can still go on. Think of the redundancies engineers employ in cybersecurity, or in fire protection of buildings, or in Uninterruptible Power Supplies used for big data centers at Microsoft or FoxCon. Less failures lessen the loads for all parties involved in acting to get the system back to normal.<br><br>I think the short refuel time with FCEVs makes so much sense. With BEVs, yes the grid would be overloaded if we put all vehicles on it immediately, but with electricity you can control the rate of charge. If you plug your car in overnight, electricity can flow both directions at different rates and at different times of the night depending on larger, collective grid statuses (see Vehicle 2 Grid concepts). BEVs can still act as distributed renewable energy storage devices, those of which many people argue are necessary if we want to see renewable generators like Wind and Solar take off and become successful (80-90% grid mixes compared to the 10% today). <br><br>I can totally see a future where if you have the time and are not driving your vehicle for hours and hours, say if you&#39;re working at home, then through electricity you can employ your car as a distributive energy store for renewables. If you don&#39;t have time, then the quick, 5 minute fuel time means the rest of the activities for the day aren&#39;t delayed or blocked. <br><br>Aside from the safety rules involved, I can totally see hydrogen becoming a 1-to-1 replacement for natural gas.

Coffee shops, mall parking lots. Easy to expand to apartments and more common places. Even street lights have been proposed. Bottom line is the situation is pretty good for a good chunk of people, and getting better by the day.

Let&#39;s discuss openly, Dianna(+team)! :)<br>I&#39;m glad the video is back with improvements! :)<br>I&#39;m aware these videos are Toyota-sponsored but I think there should be more critical views on hydrogen-electric cars/vehicles.<br>For them to go the same distance as purely battery electric cars we need about 2-3 times as much energy in \u201aproduction\u2018. (~55kWh/kg for 100km range in a car vs. 15-25kWh/100km). German scientist Volker Quaschning and economist Claudia Kemfert regularly call hydrogen the \u2018champagne of energy resources\u2018. I think for a rapid reduction of emissions we need to preserve green hydrogen and e-fuels mainly for the energy-intensive industry and planes/ships/maybe heavy duty trucks.<br>We shouldn&#39;t \u2018waste\u2018 green electricity to H2-cars. Also H2-cars and green hydrogen will stay too expensive for many people for many years, which further delays our energy/mobility transition.<br>Regarding <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=6m51s\">6:51</a> : And yet BEVs need way less energy than hydrogen-electric cars. Again: Yes, there are use-cases for hydrogen, but in cars not so much, I think. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=8m09s\">8:09</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=8m41s\">8:41</a> Volkswagen is aiming for BEV-trucks as well, not so much for hydrogen-electric, but I&#39;m not well-informed enough in trucking. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=8m39s\">8:39</a> I&#39;m sorry, has anything changed with Nikola or is it still a disastrous scam? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=10m06s\">10:06</a> And if we tried to fill all these vehicles with hydrogen at the same time that probably wouldn&#39;t work as well. At least with BEVs we have a decentralised refilling infrastructure and many people can recharge at home. (Yes, not everybody) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=10m13s\">10:13</a> Some(!) trucks can charge while (un)loading, but for now I agree, trucks might work better with hydrogen-electric technology. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWAO3vUn7nw&amp;t=11m35s\">11:35</a> No, Without electricity you cannot use the electrical pumps at hydrogen stations.
