Earths density differential is visible as 35m/s plus adding back any friction lost but would be relative to the other objects around it&#39;s differentials combined at all scales of reference. What if there was no impact to the falling on a trampoline. Such as like a neutrino falling through not hitting the mass of the earth. So low friction it had a downward half of the sine wave curve near the same as the up sling shotting over and over like a Spirograph. Since at that scale of possible energy to move it the earth is one large body particle with much less large body dense objects to effect the density difference between that void hole everything from the universe to the edge outside of which is the void the edge being the tip of the curve in or out both ways fall from that curve.
