We have a thing called the sound barrier that we call breaking the sound barrier.  Anything faster than the sound barrier is something like Mach 2, 3,4 (i know it may be the case that most everyone understands this better than i do). What about the speed of light? Does it have a barrier like sound that produces light?  I remember reading an article about child birth and that at some point a flash of light occurs (in this case it is said that it &quot;could&quot; be a chemical reaction). Lighting is the connection of negative and positive being balanced right? and the sound is the speed barrier being broken right?  A bullet makes a sound as it goes faster than the speed of sound.  i wonder if those flashes of light are a light barrier being broken.  I don&#39;t know if it may be something completely absurd.

You don&#39;t need a theory or research to understand what is happening, when you use a vacuum to separate the elements, it takes energy, the elements want to naturally go back to their natural state of rest, the energy put in will result in equal energy coming out. These are the very basics of the laws of thermodynamics. The flash you see in the heart of the implosion (bioluminescence) is the by-product of heat from the energy used to separate the elements rapidly reversing. The flash is hotter than the surface of the sun but happens very briefly. Basically water is the exhaust of the combustion from hydrogen and oxygen, separate the elements by using energy under a pressurised atmosphere, you end up with a collapse that allows for the ignition of the hydrogen and oxygen, the result is the fuel being hydrogen and oxygen are now ignited and turning back into water, or the exhaust of the spent fuel combusting due to the speed of the collapse. Example: if you slowly stretch a rubber band with one end on your leg while the hand hold the other end, when released it will snap back at a specific speed, no matter how slow you pull it back, it wants to go back to its natural state of rest as fast as it can, depending only on how far back and how much energy is used to stretch it being the only factor in energy released from the amount of energy put in to pulling it back no matter how slow or fast you actually pull it back.", "comment_date": "2022-05-21T16:33:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean R", "comment_text": "My god the moment with the carbonated water was so awesome thanks.", "comment_date": "2022-05-19T19:41:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mikee mous", "comment_text": "Pistol shrimp does the same thing I love those guys", "comment_date": "2022-05-19T16:37:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wire Tamer", "comment_text": "This explains why explosive shock waves can cause profound by difficult to isolate brain damage in soldiers, that often manifests as PTSD.", "comment_date": "2022-05-19T04:28:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "usethefooorce", "comment_text": "A thresher shark creates vortices that trap fish for a few seconds, not cavitation bubbles.

The bubbles floated the same distance and exploded against the wall farther down. Like a jackhammer pounding one spot. This caused pits in the wall, which caused more cavitation. Only larger bubbles, which made larger pits farther down. This happened throughout the tunnel. The last &quot;pit&quot; was over 32 ft and it was predicted that 1000 ft cubed/second of soil concrete and stone was violently ejected from the spillway walls.

Would it be possible that the light emission is due to the added energy caused by the vacuum created during cavitation? Additionally, regarding the carbonation not working for the bottle trick. Would it be possible that this is due to buoyant forces working against you? Or perhaps instead due to the nucleation sites it&#39;s more or less causing a force dispersal which is then mitigating the effect.

The faster something travels through water (or other fluid) - be it a bullet, propeller blade, shrimp leg, etc - the less pressure water exerts against it, eventually to the point of vaporization. Therefore cavitation occurs along the surface of the object travelling through liquid - not behind it.

Now, those fit inside massive ducts (two) that could pivot 210 degrees, and they were driven by electric motors that could easily be switched into reverse.<br>I accidently discovered that there was a point/RPM just prior to cavitation where the prop if left at that RPM the ship would gain speed to a point faster than the maximum of the propeller RPM. (The Propellers Max Efficiency) I marked that point on our main engines RPM gauges, and then played with our forward maneuvering thrusters. (Two smaller ducted props) Not using the main engines I found an RPM of the forward thrusters that moved the ship over half of our max speed! Adjusting the forward thrusters with the mains at Max Efficiency I found a second Max Efficiency point for the forward thrusters that also aided in a incredible speed far greater than if all four propellers were driven to Max RPM. By the way the ship was a catamaran.  The forward thrusters were driven by electric motors at half the output of the mains.<br>Check this out and see if my ship was just fluky or if this can be repeated?", "comment_date": "2021-06-17T06:36:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sid Kemp", "comment_text": "Really cool, Diana, even more than always.<br>Two questions, if I may:<br>1) When a cavitation bubble forms, and before it collapses, what is inside?

There&#39;s very little air in there to compress. Granted, I think you are right that the collapse of the cavitation bubbles and the resulting shockwave is what breaks the glass.  Also, I think the reason for the different behavior of carbonated water is probably that the carbonation both lowers the threshold to cavitate in the first place, so it doesn&#39;t store up as much potential energy as pure water, and that it causes the water to cavitate everywhere there is an impurity to seed a gas bubble...

It seems to me that the shockwave generated by hitting the top of the bottle is what generates the cavitation, not the water getting left behind due to inertia. You hit the top of the bottle, which sends a shockwave through the water, which was actually seen in the footage of this video. Shockwaves in this situation have low pressure zones at the front of the shockwave (from the perspective of standing beside the shockwave, watching it go by), and high pressure zones downstream (pressure is recovered downstream of the shockwave from that perspective). Once the shockwave reaches the bottom of the bottle, that low pressure zone creates the cavitation bubble. I believe the bottle trick works with a completely full bottle (filled with water) with the cap on, if I&#39;m not mistaken. I think this would disprove the &quot;water is left behind slightly due to inertia&quot; theory, given that water can typically be treated as incompressible in this scenario.", "comment_date": "2021-05-28T07:37:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BASS NINJA", "comment_text": "Mark rober needs to see this", "comment_date": "2021-05-28T01:34:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yoda", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve heard about this already but did not understand it all, but let me tell you, I&#39;m french without scholar degree, I did continue to learn english after school on my own, and that video was the best explanation I&#39;ve heard about it.

This was a 1.75L Jack Daniels whisky bottle.  I ended up in the ER with several cuts, one needing stitches.<br><br>For the next 6 months we were finding shards of glass embedded in the wall, some 20 feet away.<br><br>The air compressor I was using was set to about 20-30 PSI since I was mostly using it to clean stuff.

That turbulence generates electrostatic field between the extremes of the bubble sphere with charge high enough that will split oxygen of the hidrogen of some molecules. The fast colapse of the bubble is due to the rapid temperature loss and the internal electrostatic field discharge however the light is created by the recombination of the hidrogen with oxigen valence electrons emitting photons. One proof can be done by taking the picture of the flashes and using spectrography. Well, I could have a PHD in physics now defending my thesis on sonoluminescence.

What happens is that large amounts of cavitation reduce the thrust the propeller is able to produce,  thus limiting the speed the ship can attain.  Virtually all surface ship propellers cavitate some. Current practice,  based on decades of experience,  is that on commercial ships,  cavitation of not more than 5% of the blade area is normally acceptable,  and in service  will not cause significant damage to the propeller over the life of the ship,  but each design must be carefully evaluated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and physical model test to ensure that the propeller and ship, when built,  will perform as expected.

At least I have never read that cavitation was <b>her</b> problem.  She was originally fitted with two older design locomotive boilers and four-cylinder, triple-expansion piston steam engines, when that was tested she was indeed too slow.  Then the boilers were replaced with four (smaller and more efficient) water tube boilers, she exceeded her 26 knot contract speed.  But she was never expected to manage 32 kt.  See below.<br>HOWEVER...  The story about cavitation was right, just misapplied.  The problems with cavitation <b>really</b> became a problem when Charles Parsons started running his steam turbine technology proof vessel SS Turbinia.  The single turbine originally fitted ran at high revolutions per second, and resulted in massive cavitation due to the high shaft speed.  Parsons replaced the whole engine and propulsion solution with a three shaft system, although the shafts were still turning at the same high speed.  To reduce the cavitation, smaller propellors were used to reduce the tip speed, each shaft having three propellors.<br>The first Royal Navy <b>turbine-driven</b> torpedo boat destroyers all had similar problems, and used a variety of propellor systems to allieviate the cavitation.  The best known of those ships was <b>HMS Viper</b> - which at 32 knots, was the fastest military vessel in the world when tested, and therefore the ship you had heard about... but really, Turbinia was THE vessel used for the research..  Viper had four shafts, each with two propellors.  By the time a turbines were applied to a ship that was quite large, the direct connected turbines had a large diameter, and so were reasonably efficient in ships like HMS Dreadnought, SS Lusitania and SS Mauretania.<br>The solution was to slow the shafts down relative to the turbines.  That was achieved with reduction gearing, and then improved further with double-reduction gearing.  This allowed meeting the hydrodynamic needs separately from the high turbine speeds that are necessary for efficient operation.<br>The story is quite fascinating if you want to look into it further.  Parsons also did research into hull shapes, and that research led to modern transom-sterned planing hulls.<br>By the way, SS Turbinia, and her turbine power plant, is still to be seen in the Newcastle Maritime Museum in the UK.

And it is a neat trick. Apart from cavitation bubbles in brains (that is horrifying) and destruction on ships propellers (woah, that is fancy, knowing where these come from) there is one facet you did not really touch on, but that is of high importance for that trick!<br><br>Cavitation bubble ARE violent, but where does the energy come from? Ok, your moving hand, but where is it stored then to be released upon collapse of the bubble?<br>- First, the vacuum of the bubbles provides the space for water, driven by air pressure, to move into (potential energy)<br>- upon the bubbles collapsing that potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy, the water rushes in! (the whole column has to move)<br>- when the water column hits the bottom of the bottle the water is slowed down and the kinetic energy converted to, again, potential energy. That is in that case stored in the water by compressing it (it IS slightly compressible), increasing the pressure also in the glass (although you could also think of it as an inelastic shock exerting a force on the bottom, since it is mostly directional)<br><br>My point: you NEED enough water to store the energy of your arm! Doing that with only a shallow puddle won&#39;t work, because it is ripped apart by air, instead of being pushed by it. But with a little more water there is not so much energy stored in the water (more mass =&gt; more potential energy). You have to fill up the bottle rather far! (works good with water, because of high coherent forces between the water molecules! The column doesn&#39;t just break apart. Salt water should work better, while we are talking about that; adding intermolecular forces as well as mass!)<br><br>And underwater? The sea&#39;s surface does not rise to come rushing back in on the propeller (well it might in shallower water, unnoticable by the eye). But since water can be compressed a little, there is a pressure gradient going out into the water, which stores the potential energy, making the water around the bubble rush back in.

Any designed in restriction in either one of those will cause unnecessary cavitation which can spell an early demise for the pump - whether it is a centrifugal pump or a positive displacement pump.<br>This even comes into play every once in a while in speed controlled hydraulic systems, where restricting the flow of the fluid in some type of fluid filled cylinder without a properly sized orifice for the fluid involved can cause premature failure of the cylinder. In those situations, we typically restric the outflow of the fluid - not the inflow.

Unlike, as with propeller cavitation, the cracking/popping sound occurs as a gas bubble is formed - not as it collapses - and is the reason why a joint can&#39;t be re-&quot;popped&quot; for at least a few minutes. This is because the &quot;pop&quot; is the sudden release, or gasseation, of previously dissolved nitrogen from the fluid into a bubble rather than gasseation of the water molecules themselves. To &quot;crack&quot; the joint again it is necessary for the nitrogen to re-dissolve in the joint fluid and attempting too soon will not achieve the required sudden drop in pressure because the gas bubble will expand as you try.<br><br>BTW, this process is completely harmless and has no effect on the joint surfaces, in case you were worried!
