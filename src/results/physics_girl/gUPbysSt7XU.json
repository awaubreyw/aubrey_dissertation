I work for a company that does LiDAR, bathymetry, thermal, hyperspectral and aerial imagery. There are a few other things we can do, too, but those are our main specialties. I&#39;d love to tell you more as remote sensing is so helpful. The projects I typically on are for utility companies. We can tell them of the specific 4,367 trees that are within a danger zone distance of power lines after we collect the LiDAR, clean it up, classify everything and factor in specific dimensions and the swing and sag of power lines.

At least not in the ocean (they used to get broken relatively often and repairing them was difficult). Nowadays we dope the optical fiber with certain elements (like erbium) which absorb light of certain wavelengths (which forces their valence electrons into higher orbitals) and amplify light of other wavelength (when disturbed by a photon of the right wavelength, a valence electron will drop to a lower orbital and emit a second photon identical to the original one). Basically, in addition to the data, you fire a second laser into the optical fiber and the entire cable becomes one giant amplifier. Much more reliable and faster (and cheaper for long cables) than repeaters.", "comment_date": "2017-01-15T01:02:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leopold Tong", "comment_text": "lol he slid into her DMs ;)", "comment_date": "2017-01-14T23:13:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hafiz Khan", "comment_text": "but you do sing really good tbh", "comment_date": "2017-01-14T18:55:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mishary 20", "comment_text": "the problem in fiber optics in my country is its cost <br>it&#39;s extremely expensive \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc94", "comment_date": "2017-01-13T22:11:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Honey Boom", "comment_text": "i&#39;d so do this if laser pointers weren&#39;t illegal here", "comment_date": "2017-01-13T00:52:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "2ubelazy", "comment_text": "No laser safety!

For most people this means FTTC (Fibre to the cabinet) installations at best, so a roadside cabinet is serviced by fibre and then distributed to homes using the existing copper network which works reasonably well as long as you don&#39;t truly live out in the sticks. The problem is that communications companies are spending lots of money to try to keep their copper networks somewhat relevant and charging customers more for the privilege (certainly in the US anyway, where fibre upgrades received government subsidies in the 90&#39;s but whilst the money was taken, the networks weren&#39;t upgraded...). On the other hand, fibre as a medium is far from being saturated and as a result, can be upgraded by changing the boxes at either end for faster equipment as newer technology develops, if only the communications companies would lay fibre lines to every home sooner rather than later so we can keep up with countries like South Korea!", "comment_date": "2016-12-22T16:47:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prashanth", "comment_text": "If only you&#39;d have shown this 4 years earlier, I would&#39;ve scored higher on my physics paper.", "comment_date": "2016-12-22T16:47:45Z", "likes_count": 63}, {"comment_by": "lacreation8", "comment_text": "Even though I want to major in psychology, I might minor in physics!
