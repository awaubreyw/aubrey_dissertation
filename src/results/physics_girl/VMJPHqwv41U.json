And methane is 80 times more dangerous than co2, and that with the amount of Forrest fire smoke in the air eating the hydroxyl radicals before they can neutralize the methane we&#39;re going to have a huge spike in global heat.

Average Temps on land are already above 4 to 5 c higher. The ocean is steady catching up faster each day. 1.5 is a cruel hoax. You should be using your platform to get people prepared for beyond 4c . As we know is heading our way much faster than predicted as every data point is far worse than every worse case scenario.  Dude it could all go in a matter of months if not weeks once critical melt is upon us. You should try and get data from expeditions counting the amount of methane release in the laptov sea.

Cauz magnets can last up to a lot of days something like 100 years or 90 years or so... So will the wheel spin for so long?

The ice there tends to be a methane clathrate and it&#39;s extremely fragile and sensitive to temperature changes. If that starts to melt, we&#39;re in serious trouble. Worldwide, there&#39;s more than enough methane clathrate to reproduce the PETM (Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum). In other words, an 8-12C rise in global temps. Even though methane only has a short life in the atmosphere, it&#39;s the extra CO2 that gets outgassed that&#39;s the long term worry. CO2 has a long latency in the atmosphere (100-1000 years) and after the methane does its trick, the CO2 will linger for a long time and do even more damage. That&#39;s why the PETM lasted so long, the CO2 levels were up around 800-1200ppm for over 100K years. How that would affect the modern world as far as the climate and such goes is up for debate, as the circumstances the world was in back then are different to now. Sea levels were higher then and the world was warmer to begin with. The geography/geology of the planet was also different. So, how all that extra GHG would react to the present situation is still a matter of research. In any case, though, if it were to occur it would be an utter disaster.

The former things have passed away.\u201d This is from Rev 21:4 and this verse is in the Bible to give us hope for the near future. That is correct; the NEAR future. It is very easy to sense that world wide problems are fast multiplying, and the reason is that the ruler of this world (Luke 4:5-8) knows very well that his time of rule is soon to end. The future is indeed bright, for those who understand and have made the changes needed that will permit them to survive the Great Tribulation. We are told in the Bible that a GREAT CROWD that no man can number will exit the GT (Rev 7:9). Jesus told us; John 11:26 \u2026and everyone who is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all. Exercising faith in Jesus means to obey him. This is why we have the warning in John 3:36 The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; the one who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him. This is very simple. Why did Adam die? Nothing has changed since the beginning. Those who refuse to obey King Jesus now will not live through the Great Tribulation. Those who chose to obey Jesus WILL live through the Great Tribulation. If you want to know more, please email me at rich5151@<a href=\"http://gmx.com/\">gmx.com</a>.

Early Christians celebrated no state holidays and refused all military service. \u201cA careful review of all the information available goes to show that, until the time of Marcus Aurelius [who ruled 161-180 C.E.], no Christian became a soldier; and no soldier, after becoming a Christian, remained in military service.\u201d\u2014The Rise of Christianity, by E.

You are very professional and only state facts. What people are missing is, climate change used to be called global warming. Why isn&#39;t it called that any more? Because scientists let it know that, the whole globe isn&#39;t warming. Some parts are warming, some are cooling. The climate started changing in December of 2012. It&#39;s a natural phenomena that has happened many times over millions of years. Even without people, the change would happen. When this change was predicted back in the 70&#39;s (when I was a teenager), I remember all the talk about pollution, and  how we were on our way to an ice age. Back then, they said the pollution would prevent solar radiation from warming the planet. But, it turns out, we are on our way to a tropical age. No one has yet found the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere needed to cause this change. It all has to do with the wobble of the earth, as it spins. This wobble came to a zenith in December of 2012, and started to wobble in another direction, changing weather patterns and the jet stream. I moved to Texas in 2013 and, that is when Texas started having the worst winters ever. A lot of people around me, blamed me for bringing winter here from Pennsylvania. lol. But, actually, the air in the U.S. has been getting a lot cleaner since the clean air act of 1972. But, if you tell people they caused it, instead of panicking, they will divert their attention to working on cleaning up the air and not worry about it being a natural process. Actually, records through scientific excavation has shown, that plants and animals thrive during periods of tropical climate in the past. It&#39;s actually not something to be afraid of. But, of course, humans don&#39;t like change and will panic at the slightest hint of change. Just look at what happened when headlights on cars changed. Thousands of complaints. The change to 4G and now 5G, promotes warnings of doom and global, bloody, horrific deaths. Some people still scream that high power lines are giving every living person cancer!

As the earth warms up to a point where evaporation becomes super saturated and the winter sets in it dumps so much snow on the ground to which the earth can not melt it back. This is what we call the start of the ice age. You will still have hot days on earth yet in the north this freezes over. Once this cycle slows down and all of that snow melts down you end up with a very swampy area with lots of lakes, rivers, ponds, swamps. As the ice age comes again it will freeze many of these water logged areas and create permafrost.Every year some sort of planet, tree or organic thing builds a layer over the permafrost which then insulates its. Over thousands of years enough dirt and material collected from the rains, winds and growth cause the build up of material over the permafrost. During these cycles more water logged areas become permafrost in the winter and as growing season come around they freeze over again. 50 thousand years of doing this creates permafrost.", "comment_date": "2022-05-02T02:15:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RAW TOPSHOT", "comment_text": "So they just opened up the excuse for mass population reduction.<br>Awesome...

Here are some  questions for the physics girl - Since Hansen proclaimed the dangers of the rise in CO2 in June of 1988, how much has the earth warmed? What is your source for that value? Are your global warming numbers based on actual data or extrapolations? One number I have recently heard was 0.13 c/decade and I believe that comes from actual satellite data. Your heroes like Nye and Kerry can cry about the extreme changes in sea level rise without giving one value.

Atmospheric CO2 levels lack the temperature forcing leverage to steer climate.  Using rough math estimates atmospheric CO2 is less than 1/2% on average of the temperature forcing effect in earth&#39;s atmosphere.  A recent paper on Arctic warming proposes the Atlantic Ocean&#39;s warmer waters have been increasingly migrating into the Arctic Ocean razing the temperature of the Arctic Ocean over the last 120 years.  Ocean water heat is a huge climate steering force and does have the leverage to create the warming effects in this video.  That doesn&#39;t mean that is the primary cause, but it is a mechanism with the overwhelming temperature forcing leverage needed to warm the Arctic. \u00a0<br><br>About 1% of the troposphere is water vapor. \u00a0Water vapor has a CO2e of 18.  Water vapor H2O gas is considered 18 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas temperature forcing agent than CO2.    Tropospheric water vapor is not adequately accounted for in the United Nation&#39;s International Panel on Climate Change reports.  Water vapor varies greatly in the troposphere (lower atmosphere) from nearly zero in Antartica in the winter time to a little over 4% when 100% humidity at 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F). \u00a0<br><br>Treating CO2 and H2O gasses as ideal gasses, which H2O is not, but it is close enough to show how impossible it is for CO2 to play any serious role in atmospheric temperature forcing, tropospheric water vapor is 25 times\u00a0(1% H2O gas / 0.04% CO2 = 25) more present than all the CO2 in earth&#39;s atmosphere.  With a CO2e of 18 this means tropospheric water vapor is 450 times (18 X 25) more of a temperature forcing agent in earth&#39;s atmosphere than all the CO2 in earth&#39;s atmosphere.  All the other greenhouse gasses add up together to be less than temperature forcing effect of\u00a0atmospheric CO2.\u00a0 Giving all the other greenhouse gases a sum total temperature forcing effect the same as CO2, which they are actually less, provides a result of CO2e of  450 tropospheric water vapor + 1 CO2 + 1 other greenhouse gasses for a total of 452 CO2e.   From this total  CO2&#39;s leverage as a temperature forcing greenhouse gas in earth&#39;s atmosphere is 1/452 or 0.221% or less than 1/4%.   Since water vapor varies greatly in the troposphere and H2O is far from an idea gas stating CO2 is less than 1/2% of the temperature forcing effect in earth&#39;s atmosphere is likely to remain true when degrading the less than 1/4% results due more accurate methods and lower water vapor.  These calculations do not include stratospheric water vapor, which can have little effect on warming the earth or the water vapor from the burning of fossil fuels.  <br><br>The water vapor from the burning of fossil fuels for the period it is in the atmosphere has a greater greenhouse gas temperature forcing effect than the CO2 placed in the atmosphere from the burning of the same fossil fuels that produced the water vapor.  The water vapor in IPCC reports appears to only be stratospheric water (the stratosphere contains nearly zero water vapor) and the water vapor from the burning of fossil fuels.  From an engineering perspective it is likely more insightful to think of the earth&#39;s warming as ocean warming.<br><br>Atmospheric CO2 at levels of 10 to 40 ppm is thought to be at saturation for converting high energy ultraviolet radiation high up in the stratosphere into lower frequencies better able to warm the earth.  CO2&#39;s ultra violet energy conversion to lower frequencies is thought to be responsible for 50\u00b0C of earth&#39;s warming.  Without this warming earth would be a snow ball and has been in the past.

Explosion is probably cold rather than hot, meaning no ignition of Methane gas and resulting flames. More tests and samples are being collected. <br><br>Areas are very remote. More have been found by air than on foot. Population of Siberian Indigenous inhabitants is small compared to vastness of areas. Even people living there have never seen first hand any explosion, but have heard them. By the time they get to source of noise, crater is already there. Some large pieces of ice and still frozen tundra have been tossed hundreds of meters away.

Trapped Methane (there is huge resources of Methane in Russia) expand when temperatures rise. A cap of frozen tundra has kept Methane securely encapsulated. Rising temperatures soften tundra. Rising temperatures cause Methane gas pressures to rise. Eventually Methane gas is rapidly and explosively released. <br><br>Maybe they need to put lots of cameras with motion detection in areas.
