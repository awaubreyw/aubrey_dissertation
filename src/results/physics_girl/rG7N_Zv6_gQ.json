Back in the early days of Power line development the linesmen had to ground out Newly built Power lines not yet connected to the grid because they would build a static charge and linesmen would get killed from coming in to contact with a line so they started grounding the lines with giuide wires and chains at the very start of the job. Could this be Tesla&#39;s way of getting free energy? but back in tesla&#39;s day they didn&#39;t have the technology we have today with battery storage and resistive control of higher voltages. Static is low current high voltage but if you can lower the flow of the voltage using a resistor that would increase the current flow for a Battery bank and it would slow the time it took for the capacitor to discharge and could continue to produce current and voltage for days if not years even at night as long as their is air movement over the bare wires.
