A qualified yes, because reality in itself is fundamentally unknowable. We may be able to mathematically model it, but we cannot understand it. <br>\t2. Maybe or maybe not, but the question is irrelevant. Having a single reality as a first principle is unnecessary for physics to proceed.  <br>\t3. No, because there is no reality. Reality is an illusion<br>\t4. No, because there are multiple realities. Realities are reproducing like bunny rabbits. <br><br>As untenable as having a single reality is, none of these other options are any more appealing. Why can&#39;t we have our cake and eat it to? <br><br>I am a bit of an optimist, so I think we will eventually be able to make sense of QM (and relativity and the standard model).

Superposition does not mean &quot;both dead and alive&quot;! Later in the video, the author says &quot;that was Schroedinger&#39;s point!&quot;, but it is obvious that she has not even bothered to read Schroedinger&#39;s original paper and just replicates the most common misunderstandings about the problem. The point made by Schr\u00f6dinger was not about &quot;simultaneously&quot; living and dead cat, but about an interplay (incoherence) between descriptions of macroscopic and microscopic phenomena in Quantum Mechanics. Unfortunately, most popular presentations of the paradox are like that, and even professional scientists (who never spent any time seriously learning about the problem) tend to believe they are correct. It is so frustrating to see fellow physicists just go to YouTube and publicly spread bad science based on sloppy education and hasty research. I am shocked to see such an award-winning, popular science communicator join this group. Judging from comments, thousands of misguided people walked away from the computer screen, even more confused than before watching the video, but actually believing they have learned something true. YouTubers should feel some moral obligation to seriously prepare their content because of their influence and the way they shape understanding of science.\u00a0<br><br>If you want to understand what the paradox was about, I recommend you to read the paper by Schr\u00f6dinger, which has been translated into English (for non-German readers). If you prefer a popular explanation, the book by Jim Baggot &quot;Quantum Reality&quot; contains a very accessible (but serious) description of interpretations of QM. The &quot;state of physics today&quot; (citing the poll of 150 physicists, &quot;interpretation does not matter, the math works&quot;, &quot;physicists have no idea&quot;, etc.) provided in the video just reveals that the author does not know what she is talking about. She falsely attributes her lack of understanding to the whole community of physicists, which I find deeply appalling.\u00a0<br><br>Finally, an electron is not a &quot;physical particle&quot;? What does &quot;physical&quot; mean then? No, Copenhagen Interpretation says that the &quot;position&quot; is a classical term that does not accurately describe the micro-world.

Perhaps reality is simply &quot;solid&quot;, an infinite number of &quot;worlds&quot;, which largely don&#39;t interact, but provide enough interference or influence to make the electrons behave so strangely. <br>It may be that energy/matter &quot;particle/waves&quot; &quot;time share&quot; reality.

When broken, its contents would spill onto the floor of the box and eat through to the outside. In this then, there would be no observer opening the box but rather a chain of interdependent events which would at their end, in effect, be reaching out to the observer after the fact. In other words, the acid leaking from the box would only be possible were the cat dead and only dead. No dead cat, no leaking acid to alarm the observer that he might turn to observe. To illuminate further\u2026.that necessary for the Schroedinger version of this scheme is that there be no consequence of events of the cat\u2019s state as either alive or dead or even potentially one or the other. The cat\u2019s state as alive or dead is the end of the sequence of events contained within the box. In my version in which the cat\u2019s state is nested within a line of other deterministic events, those subsequent to the cat\u2019s state cannot be realized materially unless the cat were dead and only dead. The observer would not have looked at all but for the process having in a sense \u201creached out\u201d to alert him to its presence. If as might be claimed that his observation would cause the wave form to collapse and the condition of the acid dripping to manifest then how could it have been manifest already that it might capture his attention that he might turn to observe it then to cause the wave form to collapse so that it could be dripping which it was in the first place? This makes no sense and defies the same brand or current of logic by which the experiment was initially defined. I would venture that if this cannot be resolved by the proponents of superposition, one then has to question the ability of composite entities to be in superposition, ever. So, we see that here is no wave form here and thus no superposition of the cat. A great deal of physics would fall away in the exposition of such an error with this superposition theory, not merely inviting alternative ontological possibilities but rather demanding their consideration.

At a larger scale, you could say that ignorance (being unaware of the contents of the box) maximizes the possibilities of the universe (i&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s backwards to how reality actually works). The chance for the particle to decay has nothing to do with whether you observe it or not. It is self-determining (according to a type of ordering we humans perceive as &#39;random&#39; or unpredictable; just because we don&#39;t understand something well enough to predict it, doesn&#39;t mean it is &#39;disordered&#39; or &#39;random&#39;, only that the complexity of the ordering mechanism exceeds the &#39;resolution&#39; of our comprehension or awareness), not determined by your measurement. If the Copenhagen interpretation were true, you could PREVENT decay by depriving the particle in question of the resolving external measurement. If nothing measures it, it can&#39;t decay. I think that&#39;s self-evidently in direct contradiction to what can be readily observed: the universe does what it does, whether or not we are aware of it, and whether or not we look at it. Choosing to ignore something will not prevent it from proceeding along its natural progression. Pretending something does not exist, will not preserve the possibility that it doesn&#39;t. Either it is, or it isn&#39;t. The Schrodinger&#39;s Cat superposition would actually be an illusion (a &quot;quantum phantasm,&quot; if you will...) because either the particle has decayed, or it hasn&#39;t; you just don&#39;t know what&#39;s in the box because you haven&#39;t looked, and so you assume answering &quot;both at once&quot; is a suitable answer, but it&#39;s incorrect, because only one possibility can be true. There are two acceptable answers to the question &quot;is Schrodinger&#39;s Cat dead or alive?&quot; One is &quot;yes&quot; (because it is EITHER dead OR alive); the other is &quot;we don&#39;t know because we can&#39;t predict it and haven&#39;t looked.&quot; Just because you don&#39;t know, or can&#39;t know, which of two possibilities is true, does not mean both can be true at once. <br><br>However, cats are not exactly &#39;quantum&#39; objects, so despite the valid point being made with the thought experiment, it&#39;s a bit dubious from inception. <br><br>The point is: just because you do not yet know why something you imagine is impossible, does not mean that it remains possible until you discover why it can&#39;t be.

I\u2019m offering matter theory for sale.  I will now prove to you that matter theory is useful, by using some of its logic to permanently solve the problem of the incorrect interpretation of probabilistic quantum theory.<br>1 interpretation of probabilistic quantum theory is that, like probabilistic quantum theory, reality involves possibilities.  This interpretation is incorrect.  Probabilistic quantum theory involves possibilities.  Reality does not.  In reality an object is only ever observed having 1 trajectory.  But writing and solving a probabilistic quantum theory equation for the trajectory of an object determines numerous probabilities of possible trajectories of that object.  This occurs because probabilistic quantum theory intentionally determines only unspecified general solutions of problems, and these unspecified general solutions turn out to be probabilities of possibilities.  If probabilistic quantum theorists determine some probabilities of possible trajectories of an object, and then, instead of stopping there as they normally do, they continue, and properly solve for all the object\u2019s unspecified variables, such as, in example, specifying the object\u2019s exact initial position vector in reality, and specifying its exact initial speed vector in reality, then their unspecified general probabilities of possible trajectories of the object reduce to 1 specified exact trajectory, which is the object\u2019s 1 trajectory observable in reality.  All the probabilities of possible trajectories of the object, which never existed in reality, will have been eliminated.  So, all the probabilities of possibilities some people misinterpret as representing reality, are instead only intentionally unspecified general solutions of probabilistic quantum theory, out of which, at most, only 1 specified possibility can represent observable reality.<br>As you mentioned in this video, the confusing interpretations of probabilistic quantum theory seem to originate from various physics theorists trying to understand the surprising results of various particle 2 slit experiments.  In my video, \u201cParticle 2 Slit Experiments Explained By Paul Marostica\u201d, I use a limited version of my unifying theory to simply and logically explain the results of these experiments in a completely new way, completely contradicting all the incorrect probabilistic quantum theory explanations.<br>I put all this thinking together in my video, \u201cQuantum Mechanics Intervention\u201d, in which I humorously explain much of the illogic in the various misinterpretations of probabilistic quantum theory.  This includes Shrodinger&#39;s cats.<br>If you appreciate my logic here, and in my 2 videos, perhaps you could inform your viewers, so they can learn from my thinking, to think more logically about physics.  This could help me advertise my theory.  I would be happy to consider an interview.  I hope you will seriously consider and reply to this comment.

The thing is, in QM one is dealing with state descriptions that are only capable of providing probabilities of where a particle is, because more precise information is inherently unknowable. And a physical scenario A where we can at most predict that the particle is 50% likely to be at position x1 and 50% likely to be at x2 is a different physical scenario to B the one where we can predict that it is 100% likely to be at x1 and 0% likely to be at x2, which is in turn different to C where its 100% likely to be at x2 and 0% likely to be at x1. Scenario A is a superposition of B and C, and this does not mean that the scenario is either B or C and we don&#39;t know which, A,B and C are three different physical scenarios. But, this also doesn&#39;t mean that in the 50% split scenario A that the particle is in some sort of limbo, we are still dealing with standard knowledge based probability, but it is a case of different physical scenarios corresponding to different probabilistic predictions. Even though A is a different physical scenario to either of B or C, it is still the case that the particle is either at position x1 or x2 but we don&#39;t know which and can&#39;t know unless a measurement takes place which changes the whole physical scenario. Trying to interpret the superposition as the particle being in limbo is one of the things that produces irrational nonsense. With the cat there is the additional complication that it is a multi-particle system which is not correctly modeled as simply two situations alive vs dead. See for example &quot;From Micro to Macro Quantum Systems&quot; by K. Kong Wan for a treatment on how to deal with cats and why it&#39;s nonsense to even talk of a superposition of an alive or dead cat.", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T13:17:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "2fathomsdeeper", "comment_text": "Best way to solve Schrodinger&#39;s cat is shake the box, and the cat comes out dead every time!", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T06:15:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Village Idiot", "comment_text": "Schr\u00f6dinger just didn&#39;t like cats \ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T04:51:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blue Magoo", "comment_text": "Why 1/2 and 1/2 ?

Foundations-illiterate physicists (i.e. almost all of them!), steeped in the antiquated mathematical physics and quantum foundations of their textbooks, and their folklore, typically can&#39;t even get right what Schr\u00f6dinger was doing in his 1935 &quot;Cat paper&quot;: there was no Copenhagen Interpretation for him to criticise then! What he was actually doing - quite correctly - was warning against a naive, &quot;psiontological&quot;, interpretation: &quot;It is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally restricted to the atomic domain becomes transformed into macroscopic indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct observation. That prevents us from so naively accepting as valid a \u201cblurred model\u201d for representing reality.&quot; But of course far more damaging than such historical errors is this persistence of the idea that QM is very weird and difficult to interpret, and the serious conceptual errors - &quot;werewaves&quot;, &quot;particles in two places at once&quot;, various entanglement related nonsense - that accompany it.

The state of the particle collapses when it interacts with the physical world, that&#39;s what they mean by observing. It&#39;s a bit surprising that somebody who studied physics takes this &quot;experiment&quot; seriously", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T07:14:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kishan C", "comment_text": "oh no! all cats are sold out!!!

If one puts a detector on the slits, it&#39;s interacting with the electrons. Because if not, the electrons just could&#39;t be detetced: they have to deal with the conservation of energy law. It means that in order to trigger something (whatever it is) in the detector, you need some sort of energy. When detecting electrons, this energy must come from them, either directly or indirectly. Electrons do have an electromagnetic field, which is probably how the detectors work, I don&#39;t really know, just guessing. So imagine a detector detecting a magnetic field I think it&#39;s obvious that this will flatten the curve (pun inteded) of the electron&#39;s flight. It may even align them in a certain direction, so that the previously chaotic trajectory is now much more direct. Removing the detectors will let the electrons of each slit interact with both each other and also those being in the air they&#39;re moving through. AlphaPhoenix just released a video (as of 2021-12-17) about how electrons interact with each other. They&#39;re pushing and pulling each other over quite long distances. Therefore I just don&#39;t get it why the double-slit experiment is being cited as the big &quot;we don&#39;t know it&quot;? To me, it seems all clear: The detector of electrons just cannot be treated as the mysterious third socially distanced person that watches without interacting, because it actually IS interacting with the electrons. It&#39;s not like watching an iron magnetized ball flying through the air where the lightrays reflect towards your eyes where you capture a tiny tiny percentage of them, which ovbiously won&#39;t change anything to the object. Detecting electrons isn&#39;t detecting something that reflects off them no matter if you &#39;Re watching or not. It&#39;s like pulling on the magnetic field of that iron object itself. So it interacts. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m no physicist but only an interested layperson and maybe I am not smart enough to grasp all of this (please help me there), but maybe physicists just stopped thinking outside the box?", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T03:51:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian Reinisch", "comment_text": "what is funny that I do think all about the cat is wrong.<br>having said that am not so sure the &quot;theory&quot; is correct?<br>so, is the theory correct or the cat wrong?", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T03:36:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ladiesman2048", "comment_text": "Sold out already!?

In waves, it happens all the time. Like, if you hit a drum, what you hear is a superposition of many many frequencies, giving you the overall pitch and timbre of a given drum. - Mathematically speaking, it&#39;s literally just an addition. You directly add &quot;pure&quot; (sinusoidal) waves on top of each other and get an arbitrary wave shape.<br><br>In quantum mechanics, it turns out information (such as whether cat is alive or dead) is encoded in a wave, the amplitude of which gives the probability of what state is correct. And in a sense, evidence towards one outcome or the other is just multiple such belief states in superposition, each slightly cancelling out one possibility while boosting the other. If you do this enough, you can arrive at a near perfect belief about the cat. Say, it is alive. (Yay!)<br>Such evidence might be that the box bumps around a bit, that you can hear the cat through the box, that the cat&#39;s body heat seeps out of the box... - Very very subtle information can be enough to significantly bias your belief about the cat&#39;s current state. So it needs to be incredibly well-isolated from the world to make this work. Essentially no information can seep out of the box or else the whole thing is spoiled.<br><br>Note, I talked about beliefs which can be personal. It&#39;s not quite arbitrary beliefs: It should be rational ones, based on the information you get. I.e. if you have some current believe, and are presented with new evidence, you will update your belief according to the strength of the evidence. But it <b>is</b> personal.<br>To see this, just imagine <b>nested</b> boxes. The innermost box contains Schr\u00f6dinger&#39;s cat. The next box contains Schr\u00f6dinger pondering the fate of his cat, and outside of that, you have Wigner, a friend of Schr\u00f6dinger.<br>If Schr\u00f6dinger&#39;s box is isolated enough from the outside world, Wigner can&#39;t know whether the cat is alive or dead, even if Schr\u00f6dinger already opened the cat&#39;s box. Schr\u00f6dinger, at that point, already knows the cat&#39;s fate (it&#39;s dead :( ) but for the rest of the world, and Wigner in particular, to know, his box needs to be unsealed first.<br><br>In order to exploit any of these Quantum phenomena, you need to know when to expect them.<br>One interpretation that makes this way of thinking particularly explicit used to be called Quantum Bayesianism, but got shortened to the very cute QBism. I like that particular interpretation quite a bit. - It basically starts with the classical Bayes&#39; Rule and modifies it a bit to make it amendable to Quantum Mechanics instead.<br>The other one I&#39;m fond of is Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) which also makes this quantum information relative to a given observer.<br>They are all in a camp of QM interpretations that essentially say, in the tradeoff between reality* and locality**, it&#39;s reality that needs to go<br><br>* reality here means &quot;objective&quot;, observer-independent reality. &quot;Real&quot; stuff is whatever doesn&#39;t change no matter how you look at it. In particular, a measurement of it can&#39;t affect it.<br>For Schr\u00f6dinger&#39;s Cat that&#39;d mean its fate is predetermined all along whether it is observed or not.<br>Copenhagen kinda implements this in a limited way, effectively saying a single observation of any observer is enough to &quot;lock in reality&quot;: What one observer discovers is gonna hold true for all observers. But the observation itself may break reality for an instant, causing a new reality in which a superposition gets destroyed in favor of a clear fixed state.<br>QBism and RQM go further and allow instances where different observers may not even agree on the same outcomes.<br>It&#39;s not quite the same thing, but intuitively you could perhaps see this hold if you consider General Relativity and how it is clearly dependent on an observer&#39;s frame of reference what outcomes might end up being observed.<br><br>** locality roughly means Einstein is right and information can&#39;t be sent faster than the speed of light.<br><b>nonlocality</b> would mean that, in cases of entangled pairs of particles, if you measure one particle, the information of the result of that measurement travels possibly all the way across the universe <b>in an instant</b> (i.e. faster than light. infinitely fast, even) to make the other particle have the correct state according to the way the two particles got entangled.<br>That may be appealing to some, but imo it overcomplicates the issue at hand. I.e. entanglement is really a single piece of information that is independent of a later measurement: A decision is made, how the particle pairs are created. If you happen to know of the decision, you <b>already know</b> &quot;If you measure state x, the other particle will be in state y&quot;, well before the particle arrives in your detector. It&#39;s only paradoxical if you think of it from the uninformed perspective: &quot;I see that every time detector 1 measures x, detector 2 measures y. How do the particles coordinate???&quot; but that&#39;s just a matter of you personally not knowing a thing about the history of these particles.<br>At any rate, if you rather let go of this in favor of an absolute, observer-independent reality, you&#39;ll prefer things like Pilot Wave Theory.<br><br>I think the oft-contemplated Everett Many Worlds Theory solves this issue by having a distribution of realities, all of which come to pass, but only one of which a particular version of you has access to, so I <b>think</b> technically speaking it&#39;s also in team reality breaks. But I&#39;m not actually quite sure.<br><br>One final thing on Cophenhagen: I believe this one has effectively been ruled out now, with the discovery of a new set of Bell-like inequalities that directly pit against each other the following four properties: (as per the paper &quot;A strong no-go theorem on the Wigner\u2019s friend paradox&quot;)<br><br>- Quantum Mechanics is consistent (its rules always apply)<br>- Experimenters can freely choose their experiments (free will exists)<br>- physics are local (as discussed, no faster than light information flow)<br>- <b>outcomes of measurements are absolute, objective facts for all observers</b> (If I think find the cat is alive, you must agree with me once you observe it)<br><br>That last thing is an assumption Copenhagen makes. And at least one of the above must be wrong. And rejecting any one of them destroys Copenhagen. So it can not be correct.<br>As discussed, RQM and QBism are not affected by this, and neither would be Pilot Wave Theory (I think) or Many Worlds.", "comment_date": "2021-12-17T14:01:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Larry Bloom", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bn-NXgOOk&amp;t=4m27s\">4:27</a>  A Wave Fuction?
