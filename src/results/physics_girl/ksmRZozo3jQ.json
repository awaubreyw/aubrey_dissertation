I can only find subatomic test results, e. g. radioactive decay/muons, but I can not find test results at a higher level, by measure of testing the behavior of chemical elements.  For example,  let there be an atomic clock measuring time, down to the nanosecond, paired along with a closed system aquarium growing a crystal from a mass of chemical gas measured to exact atomic weight, down to the atom.  Employing your &quot;space-scraper&quot; as an imaginary model to test a speculative hypothesis, if two similar aquariums and atomic clocks where placed in the building, one pair set in place at the top floor, and the other set at the bottom, when comparing the weights of the two grown crystals, after many years, between the two aquariums, would the top crystal weight more, be heavier in mass?  I assume the top crystal would weigh more if the time dilation effect observed in the atomic clock is demonstrative of physical/chemical properties.  I would be interested to see test results from non-subatomic clock experiments, as well as electrical tests, to affirm time dilation.  Are there are any such alternative tests to read about the GTD subject?<br><br>My imagination is &quot;seeing&quot; a possible issue, but I don&#39;t know how to communicate it, other than with a not so great pseudo &quot;science&quot; experiment based upon a silly example:  let there be a room with two clocks measuring time, one clock with a &quot;pendulum&quot; based from liquid water, and the other clock using a mechanical spring as its &quot;pendulum.&quot;  When the room temperature is lowered below freezing the water clock slows to a stop, and when the temperature is heated above boiling, the water clock dramatically speeds up, all the while the clock with a mechanical spring ticks along at, more or less, a consistent rate of speed.  In other words, I wonder if the concentration of gravity alters atomic decay in an observable manner, but does this gravitational effect also equally change the rate of chemical reactions and vapor kinetics for non-radioactive elements, or electricity?<br><br>Cheers, Jeremy", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T22:03:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matija Gaspar", "comment_text": "@physicswoman you made it very clear how centrifugal force is a fake force, that one needs to &quot;invent&quot; to use newtonian physics....

There is only one force acting in the system and that is gravity. The penny is simultaneously moving laterally with constant velocity, and accelerating down towards the Earth. It never gets closer to the Earth though because its lateral motion ensures that the curving of the Earth&#39;s surface away from it, exactly matches the distance through which it falls. This is a hard thing to put into words and others have done it better. Sketches help too.<br><br>There&#39;s talk on here of centripetal forces, but that doesn&#39;t help really since they only have meaning with circular motion, and as we know orbits under gravity can be elliptical or even hyperbolic. So I think notions of circularity in these discussions don&#39;t help. Cometary orbits for instance can be highly elliptical, so much so that when they are far out in the solar system such comets may actually look as though they are falling towards the sun. The key word is &quot;falling&quot;. This is really what the penny is doing even though its motion is actually circular.<br><br>This is interesting now. One guy below was talking about centrifuges. Imagine you&#39;re standing in a cradle that some giant is swinging around on a rope. Just like standing on the Earth you feel a floor beneath your feet and it feels like there&#39;s a force pulling you &quot;down&quot; (or outwards if you prefer) to that floor. This is why the notion of centrifugal force is so popular - because we&#39;ve all experienced it. So why in the ISS aren&#39;t the astronauts thrown against the further wall of their space station? In both cases there is only one force acting, the rope wielded by the giant, or gravity in the ISS. And yet the astronauts drift weightlessly whilst you in your cradle are anything but. The difference between these two situations is as follows. The centripetal force applied to you by the rope is applied via the cradle floor. As you go up through your body, slice by slice, each slice applies and reacts the forces to the slices above and below, just like standing on the Earth. So it&#39;s like a pile of books on a table. The uppermost book only feels itself whereas the lowermost has to carry the force of all of them to the table. On the ISS however, the force of gravity isn&#39;t applied to an astronaut locally, through a floor or wall. It is applied to each and every atom and elementary particle of his body simultaneously.. So there is no stacking, slice upon slice. Every slice experiences the exact same force as every other. It&#39;s as though, instead of a single solitary rope, gravity has a vast number of ropes all pulling with the same acceleration on every particle of the astronaut&#39;s body, simultaneously.", "comment_date": "2016-12-02T22:52:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NorthMustang", "comment_text": "I&#39;m gonna laugh when it&#39;s proven to everyone that faster than light travel isn&#39;t impossible...
