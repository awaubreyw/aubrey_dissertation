How far does a star have to be from the sun to keep from destroying the Earth when it goes supernova.  I realize there are several kinds of supernovas, so the answer may be too involved for this format.  For example, stars less than 3 times the sun&#39;s mass, are probably incapable of doing so.  I read a debate 20+ years ago in a series of a sci-fy magazine editorial sections, using back-of-the-envelope level math.  Which seemed to reach several different conclusions.  This was before Gamma Ray Bursts were an item, and Type 1-A&#39;s were seen as standard candles, etc..  So that might explain the discrepancies.   It would seem to be more than an academic interest, since there are several stars of qualifying mass within a hundred light years, and several late in life candidates within approximately 1000 light years.
