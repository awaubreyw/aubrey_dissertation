Let&#39;s get some math down. We assume that the spool rolls without slipping, so there is static friction, not kinetic friction. By applying newton&#39;s second law of motion, we get \u03a3F=ma=&gt; F-2\u03a4\u03c3\u03c4=m*a. This is equation 1.By applying the law for rotational movement, we get \u03a3\u03c4=\u0399\u03bf\u03bb*a/R. \u03a3\u03c4 is the sum of all torques, \u0399\u03bf\u03bb is the total rotational inertia of the spool.  So we have 2\u03a4\u03c3\u03c4*R - F*r=Io\u03bb*a/R. We&#39;ll call this equation 2. Keep in mind that Forces and torques are vectors, as is acceleration. If we add the two, and solve for a(acceleration), we get : a=F*(1-r/R)/(m\u03bf\u03bb+\u0399\u03bf\u03bb/R\u00b2). This is always bigger than 0. It&#39;s always a positive value. Thus the spool goes backwards (We set the direction of F as the positive one). That&#39;s the solution in a nutshell.

However, we quickly see that the situation is impossible because the outer circumference of the spool is greater than that of the wound rope, which means the spool must move at a greater speed than the rate of change for the distance between the hand and the rope. Thus, the only scenario left is that the spool rolls toward the person&#39;s hand. <br>In contrast, when the rope is at an angle, the speed the spool rolls does not have to be the same as the rate of change in length between the hand and the spool because the angle the rope is pulled at can change. <br>I have no clue if this makes any sense w/o pictures...", "comment_date": "2017-05-26T19:13:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BritainRitten", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59R1WN4tHrM&amp;t=1m18s\">1:18</a> &quot;Not wrong, *surprising*!&quot;<br><br>Woah, that&#39;s an genius way to turn something that could hurt your self esteem to something that makes you excited and interested in learning more!", "comment_date": "2017-05-26T19:06:12Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "taramas \u30bf\u30e9\u30de\u30b9", "comment_text": "She looks cute with those braids haha!

I imagine holding the rope horizontally on the one end with my hand while the rest of the rope and the wheel is exactly as presented on this riddle. Then, I push the wheel the other way keeping the rope stretched. Because on a rotating disc the points closer to the edge travel a greater distance than the points closer to the centre, the rope unwinds at a speed smaller than the linear speed of the wheel. While the wheel rolls it unwinds some rope but because it is somewhere in the middle of the wheel the released rope is less than the distance the wheel travels, so the wheel pulls the rope and my hand to the same direction. if the rope was on the center of the wheel then it would pull my hand with the same speed the wheel moves horizontally. If the rope was winded on the edge of the wheel, it would simply unwind and my hand would stay in place.<br><br>In the opposite perspective, like when pushing the wheel pulls the rope to the same direction, pulling the rope will push the wheel to that direction too.
