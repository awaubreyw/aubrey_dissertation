A car&quot;s ignition system had contact points, a condenser (capacitor) and a coil (inductor). When the ignition was on current was supplied to the capacitor and coil, both of which stored electrical energy. The starter motor turned the crankshaft to force the pistons and valves  to cycle through their phases, drawing in fuel-air mixture and compressing it. The contact points conducted current until. a lobe caused them to open a small gap that interrupted the current flow. The magnetic field in the coil collapsed causing a spark across the small air-gap in the selected spark plug igniting the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder and causing a power stroke to turn the crankshaft.", "comment_date": "2022-01-26T16:47:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kol Kemboi", "comment_text": "Lenz Law\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 plus some wiyad tesla coil physics", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T20:32:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HyperChannel", "comment_text": "The magnetic field collapses after the power is switched off.

The act like a reservoir of magnetic energy. When we apply current, there magnetic field grow progressively by rotating each magnetic domain, which are random initially. As more and more domain rotate, the electric energy gets stored as magnetic field. Eventually, all magnetic domain are aligned, we have reached saturation. At that point, the electric energy in the coil become a wasted as heat.<br>When removing the electric source, the inductor attempt to maintain the same current. It will raise the voltage as much as possible until it succeed to force the same current as before. As the electric energy flow out of the inductor (being spent as heat and light in the electric arc on the switch), each magnetic domain return to their original position.<br><br>When all magnetic domain finally return to their rest angle, the inductor stop providing electric current, so the arc in the contact of the switch stop.<br><br>In the case of high voltage transformer, like still used in any car to create the arc on the spark plug, the  natural attempt to reach the voltage is used to get about 120 volt from the 12 volt of the battery. This is the voltage that we can measure on the primary side, where the contact (or transistor) send pulse synchronized with the rotation of the cam shaft. The secondary is made of about 20 times more turns then the primary, thus raising the 120 volt to the 2400 volt needed for the spark plug.<br><br>In case of CRT TV which needed 25 kilovolt to accelerate the electron on the screen, the same &quot;flywheel&quot; effect is used to increase the voltage from 120 volt pulsed DC to 1200 volt short spike on the primary and then 10 kilovolt on the secondary. A voltage tripler is then used to reach 25 kv, about 5 kv being lost from the high impedance of the coupling capacitors. The first &quot;all solid state&quot; TV appeared in 1976 when a high voltage transistor (1500 volt) was finally successfully built.<br><br>For switching power supplies, the kick back (flywheel) effect of the inductor is rarely needed. Instead, it is the constant current which is exploited by using low impedance output to force the voltage to remain under tight control. Fast PWM pulses are used with the width of the pulse constantly adjusted using negative feedback loop to maintain a fixed voltage while responding to variable current from variable load. A typical laptop quickly alternate between 1 amp and 3 amps, sometime changing the load current many times every second. The PWM pulse width is effectively modulating the total energy entering the switching inductor in order to adjust the current as required by sudden start or sdtop of CD rom motor, video card rush current triggered by different scene in a video game, etc", "comment_date": "2017-12-09T08:02:52Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Tanishq Bhatia", "comment_text": "Why is the spark green though?", "comment_date": "2017-12-05T00:39:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Federative Mapper Holiday", "comment_text": "FIRE!", "comment_date": "2017-12-04T13:29:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abhipsha Sahu", "comment_text": "I wish I knew Dianna in real life, she&#39;s cool", "comment_date": "2017-12-01T10:41:23Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "NoThanks", "comment_text": "i have one more question..why is it green?", "comment_date": "2017-11-30T19:50:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Saurabh Narvekar", "comment_text": "Keep up the bubbly energy and a child like curiosity!

Generators make energy when a moving magnets lines of flux pass through an inductor generating an emf(voltage). When inductors are first turned on it initially has no field but then as current flows, it develops a field which has to grow. The growing field is the same thing as a moving magnet in a generator from the inductors perspective so it develops an emf which leads to a current in the opposite direction to the current from the power supply slowing it down like resistance(inductive reactance). Eventually, the growth of the magnetic field cutting through the inductor slows decreasing the generated opposing voltage leading to a decrease in opposing currents letting current flow from the power supply with minimal resistance. Now if you stop current from flowing, the fields magnetic lines of flux begin to collapse and again are like an external magnets lines of flux moving through the inductor making it generate current. Although current is now flowing in the same direction as the initial flow from a power supply. These effects from the lines of flux growing or collapsing and then cutting through coils is how current behaves like it has momentum which has to be built up and then released.", "comment_date": "2017-05-15T23:49:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diljot Singh", "comment_text": "Hello I love the host girl she is my dream girl", "comment_date": "2017-05-15T17:07:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phizicks", "comment_text": "the magnetic field collapses back into the coils which induces a high but short voltage spike.", "comment_date": "2017-05-15T13:04:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Souvik Bhattacharya", "comment_text": "This might be completely unrelated but was the spark really green-ish\u00a0blue (as it appears in the video) or is this an aberration caused by the camera?

The voltage which can be produced by the coil in order to maintain the current is infinite. In real conditions it&#39;s limited at first place by the parasitic capacitance between the windings which capacitance is charging and the peak of voltage is lowered to some finite value. And if that limitation is not enough it can jump between the windings ruining the coil. So that&#39;s about it, remember it&#39;s impossible to change the current through a coil abruptly.

The induction story doesn&#39;t describe why you always get an arc. Of course you can argue that no circuit really has L=0 mH. But even without that argument you get an arc: when you break the circuit there is a potential difference over the gap. At first that gap is extremely small so that a discharge can happen very easily. That creates a conductive channel (plasma) that will be visible as an arc. And because it is already conducting, it will keep going. So you don&#39;t need the masses of energy, or momentum, to be able to &quot;jump the gap&quot;.

In fact, this problem can become so large (think Farads of capacitance) that you need what are called pre-charge resistors to slowly charge up the capacitors before disconnecting so as not to waste power.

So the magnetic field collapses.  As it collapses, the field lines pass through the conductors.<br><br>We know that relative motion between a conductor and a magnetic field will cause a current to be induced in the conductor.  This is the law of induction.<br><br>So the collapsing magnetic field will induce a current.<br><br>Because the circuit is open, the energy of collapse doesn&#39;t cause a large number of charge carriers to flow at a low voltage, but instead causes a smaller number of charge carriers to flow at a higher voltage, creating an arc through the air.<br><br>This is conservation of energy.<br><br>Question for the Curious:  Does the current induced  by the magnetic field collapse flow in the SAME or OPPOSITE direction as the current that created the magnetic field?
