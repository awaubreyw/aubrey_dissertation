The magnetic properties of oxygen were intriguing on paper and to get a better feel for it we made a small amount of liquid oxygen and everyone was amazed at how the stream would bend when we poured it past a giant magnetron magnet. Of course, that magnet could not be turned off and we had to take other precautions in the lab when we took it out of it&#39;s big drum holder - you didn&#39;t want to be wearing your mechanical watch or other ferrous jewelry anywhere near it. We were looking to see if oxygen concentrations could be measured using oxygen&#39;s response to pulsed magnetic fields inside a tuned cavity and even what it would take to make a device to extract oxygen from the air magnetically. It was going to take a lot of power to extract usable amounts of oxygen from the air magnetically but experiments building prototype sensors were very promising.
