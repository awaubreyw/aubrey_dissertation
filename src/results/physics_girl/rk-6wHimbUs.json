Also, the majority are now seamless which means they got rid of the weak point where the two halves would converge. The grading of the ball also matters. If you&#39;re using a 3 star ball which is much rounder than, let&#39;s say a 1 star (training ball), you get more stability, spin and speed due to less friction.

The energy goes with the square of velocity, so when you&#39;re going twice the speed you have 4times the energy (as you&#39;ve actually said in the video...). In that case your total energy change would be pretty much double of your initial energy, which results in a speed change equivalent to approx. 113kph into the wall. It&#39;s a common misconception, where people say hitting someone on a highway head on at 60mph is an equivalent to 120mph into the wall...here&#39;s what it would really look like:<br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7dG9UlzeFM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7dG9UlzeFM</a>", "comment_date": "2020-04-12T15:51:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mewcancraft", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk-6wHimbUs&amp;t=11m45s\">11:45</a> Maybe it&#39;s good to clarify what a &quot;G&quot; is, for the unaware viewer; 4700 Gs is a big number, but if someone were to ask you &quot;what does that mean, 4700 Gs?&quot;, you&#39;d probably want to be able to explain what it means. Let&#39;s go Mark Rober style, here:<br><br>So, imagine a 1 kg (approx. 2 lbs) packet of sugar being dropped from a tower (say, 44 meters) with the packet sufficiently streamlined to not experience much air resistance. Let&#39;s measure the velocity of that packet of sugar every second. <br>The moment we drop it, we know its velocity is still 0 m/s. What does that mean? It means that, if we magically turned off gravity, the packet would seem to float at the same height forever. (We now turn gravity on again.) After 1 second, the packet has sped up and is falling at 9.81 m/s (let&#39;s round that to 10 m/s from here on out): that means that, if we were to turn off gravity again, the packet would this time keep falling instead of hovering in place, but it would not keep falling faster and faster. It would move down at a constant velocity as if somebody were lowering it with a rope, and it would traverse about 10 meters every second. If we looked at the packet after 2 seconds of having experienced gravity, it would be falling at 19.62 m/s (about 20 m/s), and after 3 seconds, 29.43 m/s (about 30 m/s). Coincidentally, that&#39;s also when the packet reaches the ground of the 44 meter-high tower.<br><br><br>As you might notice, our packet&#39;s velocity - remember, that&#39;s the constant distance it would be traversing every second if we turned off gravity - keeps increasing per second by about 10 m/s. We say that it &quot;accelerates at 9.81 m/s\u00b2&quot;, and we call that number &quot;g&quot;, the &quot;gravitational acceleration on Earth&quot; (close to sea level).<br>Now, if we dropped a 2 kg packet, it would obviously be falling way faster after 1 second. To be precise, it would fall twice as fast, at about 20 m/s. After 2 seconds, it would fall at about 40 m/s, and so on.<br>If we lived on an Earth where gravity was twice as strong, our original 1 kg packet would speed up during its fall as much as the 2 kg packet does on our own Earth. Key insight: when speeding up due to gravity, we can compare how hard the force of gravity pulls per kg, with the acceleration it&#39;s giving per kg. This is why you&#39;ll see &quot;g&quot; expressed as a measure of &quot;force per mass&quot;, because, although it&#39;s a handy number to use for acceleration, it&#39;s also handy to describe the force of gravity (in units of N/kg, but humans have no good reference of what a Newton of force is, unlike of velocity).<br><br><br>So, if someone tells you something causes &quot;4700 g of force&quot;, what they mean is that, if you imagined that the described force (in Diana&#39;s example: air-pushing-force) was gravity acting on a 1 kg packet of sugar on some outer-space Earth, that outer-space Earth would make a tiny 1 kg packet of sugar speed up as fast as our Earth speeds up a whopping 4700 kg. Yes: it would be an outer-space Earth where our 1 kg packet of sugar would reach the ground as fast as a pickup truck would back here on Earth (although you have no good reference of this, because when people drop pickup trucks, the bottom acts like a sail and thus the truck falls way slower than it would without air), which is in approximately 0.044 seconds - 5 of those could happen in the span of one blink!", "comment_date": "2020-04-12T15:23:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neal Rivenbark", "comment_text": "I love how her being a girl is half of her identity.

The problem is storage right? What if we try to store the antimatter with the help of strong magnets surrounding it? I mean think of a special vacuum box, the walls of the box are made up of magnets(normal neodymium style or electromagnets, whichever is easier cause I don&#39;t know if the electrons passing through the electromagnets are gonna have any influence on the antimatter or not). So this creates a sort of magnetic levitation situation. If antimatter is the opposite of matter, then certain kinds of antimatter with ferrous properties should be susceptible to magnetic force. Now, if we manage to put antimatter like that, then it isn&#39;t coming into contact with any matter or air. That would mean we could potentially store large volumes of antimatter in smaller, more compact shapes, like a sphere or a box. This also makes transportation easier cause the magnetic force will keep the antimatter insulated no matter(pun not intended) how vigorously the box shakes, the antimatter shouldn&#39;t come in contact with the walls of the box.
