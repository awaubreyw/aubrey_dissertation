Made me think of education in the 14th to 19th centuries, peasants stayed dumb as rocks, and the aristocratic moneyed guys were able to pursue their leisurely studies and perhaps it&#39;d have stayed that way, but for the Reds, the Socialists who saw the class struggles and the fiefdoms and feudal systems where the poor made the rich richer and richer.And even today, were it not for student loans(which many TpooperPublicans want to do away with, even though what was supposed to help poor folks is now a giant rock of debt around their necks). I am happy to see more women graduates though. This is a gender that at one time inheritance was at the whim of a male arbiter who could just keep it to himself, a gender who had no choices except through their husbands(in 1970s a single woman alone in an apartment was either a kept mistress or a hooker, so ran the prevailing thought, even Gloria Steinem had trouble as a single woman and journalist). Now education is there and requires effort only. One big thing IMHO was Gutenburg&#39;s printing press that superseded the book copiers, who made mistakes, wrote and interpreted for themselves(especially Xian texts), and was a very slow process, but didn&#39;t matter since only priests and rich could read anyway. Gutenburg made it so many copies could be made quickly and passed around and you only needed to learn to read to understand strangers who had ideas that you&#39;d never know of. So, then ideas of Roman and Greek philosophers, and the Enlightenment thinkers(why GOP hates the French, for they were the disseminators of the Enlightenmennt thinkers, Baron d&#39;Holbach comes to mind)were to be had by all. I have to laugh when I hear Xian nation talk when if you read both US Charter and Dec of Ind what you see is man not god deciding his fate, Enlightenment thinking straight from the Founding Fathers, not Xian preachers.AND from Gutenburg&#39;s nascent press we all became at least able to educate ourselves if we made the effort, and today there&#39;s no excuse for ignorant, there&#39;s too much there to learn from.", "comment_date": "2014-09-11T18:08:07Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "nash984954", "comment_text": "Thnx for this video, even 2 years after and still great.
