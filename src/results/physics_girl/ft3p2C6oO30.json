Though, I would like to mention that one of the reasons that our manned space program is presently stalled is because we place so much emphasis on the making sure that the astronauts return safely, that the cost of all the safety precautions makes the program prohibitively expensive, and the end result is that we end up doing very few manned missions, or no manned missions at all.  This is not the fault of the astronauts, as they have always indicated that they are willing to risk their lives to help advance the frontiers of space exploration.  This is simply due to the political leaders who are concerned about the public relations repercussions of losing astronauts in the program.
