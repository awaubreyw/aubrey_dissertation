It&#39;s likely the blackholes don&#39;t have mass because they are holes. They likely form via galactic amounts of mass orbiting something another celestial body some distance away. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find galaxies orbiting galaxies. Since space is three dimensional I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the  lensing effect is could by these objects orbiting our position as well as another body giving these galaxies or bodies of light the lense effect. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if whiteholes are the point which light &quot;escapes&quot; the blackholes. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the whole thing looked similar to a vortex in draining bathwater. A bathhole, if you will. <br><br>I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m wrong and in that case maybe don&#39;t use a word that&#39;s the opposite of what you&#39;re trying to describe. Such as antimatter. It&#39;s not matter. You&#39;re not looking for an object if we keeping using that term. Likely it&#39;s just culmination of forces on matter that creates the illusion of antimatter. Is the 90% space inside of an atom made up of matter? <br><br>Science is the best tool we have to understand and even the term science has been misused, it&#39;s a method not the study itself. I have used deductive reasoning to come to these conclusions and while I don&#39;t have the mathematical skills to use as proof I do have language and the power of mental illustration to demonstrate. Just because I can&#39;t do the math doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t understand the principles of physics. How else am I able to predict my next step and catch myself during the falling process? Or adjust my angle and timing and power in order to increase the distance of a throw? <br><br>I feel that the super masses that we&#39;re currently calling as blackholes probably more than likely exist. But they wouldn&#39;t be holes. I believe that what we are trying to observe is more likely what I&#39;ve described. However, I find it&#39;s easiest to learn when one keeps and open mind to all possibilities and doesn&#39;t remain attached rigidly to one idea on a question we still don&#39;t really know the answer to. A theory can be as agreed upon as everyone in the world agreeing and until its proven its still just a theory.

It creates a magnetic field large enough and powerful enough to protect it from our sun&#39;s radiation and it deflects or burns up rocks that threaten to collide into it at once again unfathomable speeds.  Now again, earth moves around in a circle, an insanely large diameter in terms of size and distance. This is the key. Magnets.

So, when something exists time must pass, it wouldn&#39;t exist if time wasn&#39;t passing so whenever you plop something in the middle of a field of space time must pass for that object to be there at any moment in which we can refer to as a moment. Now since a space has been defined by an object to exist within it the most unhindered rate for the passage of time would clearly be a postulation of the space in absence of  the object, therefore the rate for passage of time for the object, its frame of reference must be a dilation relative to its mass. Of course only one object would form a singularity with no way to balance the equation so let&#39;s just say there are several masses at the same time and for our purposes never a time where there were less than several objects at the same time. Each would dilate the rate of time relative to their masses as impact upon the space which they have defined. Now, take light as a propagation upon the space undefined by objects, being massless it has a constant velocity being its unhindered propagation upon the space. Having a constant velocity, nevertheless when passing close enough to fall within the frame of reference of any of these objects time dilates. How do you maintain velocity and yet take longer to get somewhere in a straight line? Take a curved path. The space isn&#39;t being warped, gravitation is simply the inconstancy of time. Anything travelling in a straight line, as all things wont to do must be affected in the same way. Why does everything have wont to travel in a straight line? When you stand still, in the middle of emptiness, time is still passing, therefore you are falling. Things always fall in a straight line. It is the wont of passing time.<br><br>Everything about relativity is about time, it was the entire key. It used to be time was a constant, this changed to make the speed of light a constant so everything became about time, all the changes to an intuitive view of physics became about time. Gravitation is time, it&#39;s basically conservation of energy related to time, of course things want to go slower, it conserves more energy. You&#39;re never actually floating in space, time is always passing so you are always falling, the only sense you get of not falling is if you&#39;re in a frame of reference not of your own but added to a greater mass so your sense of stability is to the frame of reference, but you are both falling. None of it is about space warping, all of it is about relative time. Kind of why space warp engines for interstellar travel are ridiculous, but at the same time interstellar travel is perfectly accorded by relativistic travel. Most of the sci fi hyperspace travel is actually depicted as relativistic travel for the craft and they just break the rules by combining this with a Newtonian set of rules for the rest of the occupied universe, so when you reach your destination the same amount of time has passed for everyone else, they use the one frame of reference so break the system there but the hyperspace travel itself is just relativistic length contraction. Again all about time.<br><br>Time is the centre of it all. It can&#39;t flow backwards and must pass without introducing a moment of total nonexistence of the universe. At least it means interstellar travel is certainly an accomplishment we can make with our current understanding of physics no problem. It&#39;s just a one way trip in terms of any relationship with beings which are left behind your frame of reference to accomplish the travel. It also means we could propagate humanity all over the universe but each group would accomplish such separation by relative frames that they would never coexist as an intergalactic spanning civilisation, they would each be unique ones separated by possibly millions of years. Maybe we are starfarers after all and all our cousins out there are separated by millions of years in the past and future, none existing remotely near the same frame of reference to ever know of each other.<br><br><br>Well that&#39;s me and my Yr10 education anyway \ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2021-08-02T11:45:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suburp212", "comment_text": "Keep going.

What are your thoughts on light propulsion? A not too recent report from one of NASA&#39;s engineers by the name of David Burns came up with a theory on using helium ions in to somewhat of a helical engine/particle accelerator. My question is more about I have seen light sources burn hotter and brighter in vacuum chambers. If you had rapid fire light beams coming from a particle accelerator could that be enough to make thrust in space. And I&#39;m imagining more like you tie a handful of straws together and blast light in rapid constantly from a particle accelerator. I think the thing I would change the most is what ion I would be using. Since light carries photonic energy and we are trying to reach near light speeds for space travel, it would seem that at least to me we use what travels the speed we are trying to reach by way of converting it to thrust momentum Newton force. The formula used with helium gave way to 90% reachable speed of light. As where light photonic energy ions would be less in mass and close to reaching around 99.9% speed of light using a particle accelerator.

I am currently writing a book where I am working to make things as scientifically correct but it is a science fiction story so obviously it is going to have things that are really not true. One thing that I want to get right: if the universe is a fabric of space time, can it be bent (theoretically) on itself to cheat the space time continuum? Like warping space time to travel faster than the speed of light. say like a piece of paper. it would take you x amount of time to draw a line from one end to the other but if you fold it in half, the line between point a to point b would only take a millisecond at best. would that be possible when talking about the space time continuum?", "comment_date": "2021-08-01T20:22:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Albrat Gaming", "comment_text": "I remember there being a mention of this effect been seen during a solar eclipse.
