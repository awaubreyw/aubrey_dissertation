Remember, you ONLY get the right answer AFTER the right-hand rule.  The left-hand rule gives you the wrong answer, BUT there is no cause in a right-hand rule (mnemonic device).  Linear spin velocity and linear tilt velocity are perpendicular vectors, and perpendicular vectors DO NOT affect one another, so conservation of angular momentum is made up from a bad analogy.

Let&#39;s think about unidirectional force. There are a few pretty compelling but weak examples. The simplest is to take a rotating disk and place another rotating disk near its perimeter. Pulses of torque can be applied to the outer frame by either mounting the second disk asymmetrically (traditional) or by applying torque through timed acceleration and deceleration of the inner frame. I&#39;ve experimented with this and had some really counterintuitive results. It&#39;s hard to describe the setup... If you replace the mass of the inner frame with a gyroscope, it will very preferentially align itself with the rotating frame of reference its attached to. Specifically, if you spin up the gyros and then spin up the outer frame, the gyros are still locked to the outside frame of reference. But, when torque is applied from the rotating frame of reference, the gyro locks to that. I think that if this was properly examined, it could be like Star Trekian impulse drive.

For example, the pressure in different regions of the system is different when a gas expands quickly.\r<br>\r<br>Yes, I also agree with that. We cannot directly find the work done in such a process, because we don&#39;t know what pressure of gas should we take, but I think, even if we cannot calculate this directly, we can calculate this indirectly like we do in chemistry. In chemistry for example, when we find the work done in irreversible compression, we can find how much work is done by the surroundings on the system because the pressure of the surroundings almost remains the same. Let&#39;s assume +W amount of work is done on the gas, so it means that it has increased the internal energy of the system by +W (assuming no heat is released), so it also means that surely the work done by the system on the surroundings will be \u2212W; to absorb that much energy, it has to do \u2212W amount of work on the surroundings, and there is no other thing from which energy can be exchanged.\r<br>\r<br>So, all I want to ask is: Why we don&#39;t do it like this in physics?
