We&#39;ve all seen or done the experiment with the candle in a shallow dish of water, and then the candle is covered by a glass. Water rises into the glass because, we are told, the oxygen has been consumed. HOWEVER, as the O2 was consumed, CO2 was produced, so why does the water rise into the glass? You&#39;d end up with the same number of molecules of CO2 as you had of O2 to begin with, and those molecules would be BIGGER.
