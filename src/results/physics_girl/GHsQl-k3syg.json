Whether the object in question is an asteroid or a planetoid or a dwarf planet or a terrestrial planet or a gas giant or a brown dwarf or a star and all the stars of varying magnitudes and whatever else I neglected to list, each one is like a seed in a garden metaphorically speaking. Some don&#39;t bloom. Some seeds don&#39;t turn into trees. Some seeds turn into flowers or other things but atoms form into molecules and then molecules form into larger structures, and on the astronomical level when objects get so big that they float about in space and they&#39;re orbiting other things or other things orbit around them, these all have the potential to have become stars if they could have pulled enough matter towards themselves. Or sometimes small celestial bodies collide with other celestial bodies and together make something bigger. Most of this happened billions of years ago. Nowadays cuz the universe has been cooling down there&#39;s not as much activity as there once was. Imagine if we could take all the other planets and moons and the asteroid belts and other matter and throw everything in our solar system at Jupiter. Perhaps we could get Jupiter to a large enough size to sorta jump start it so it&#39;d have so much mass that it could turn into a small star, or maybe just a brown dwarf, but it&#39;d be bigger than it is now. Maybe that&#39;s how stars form, by drawing enough mass towards themselves to become stars. There&#39;s probably more variables involved tho cuz I think this is also how black holes are formed.

I, however, do not fall in love so easily.  First off, Pluto has nothing to do with whether a star is a star (or not.)  Pluto was &#39;demoted&#39; [as opposed to being &#39;reclassified&#39; - which is what ACTUALLY happened, although precisely no one seems interested in that little FACT] because, as we learn more about the area called the Kuiper belt, we see other &quot;Pluto-like&quot; objects out there in the same region, &amp; we realize that Pluto is simply; 1) too small (there are other things out there in its size range &amp; THEY aren&#39;t ALL planets, &amp; 2) too far away, in a region where there are lots of other things that are ALSO not planets.  This has nothing to do with whether a star-like object has enough mass (and of the right sort) to begin to fuse matter as it becomes more compressed though gravitational collapse.  It&#39;s always helpful &amp; non-confusing when people can avoid mixing their metaphors - or their concepts.  Now that the little stuff&#39;s out of way [ha ha - I guess...], we can tackle the main issue.  It&#39;s important to note (which you didn&#39;t) that there&#39;s an important distinction here.  Speaking size-wise, it&#39;s much easier to tell from the top down - than from the bottom up - whether a thing is a star or not.  This distinction may seem subtle, but it matters.  I haven&#39;t the space or time [ha ha again - I re-guess] to go into it here, but it IS true.  Once, we though that Jupiter was SO BIG... [How big was it?]  It was SO BIG, we thought it MUST&#39;VE been (at least, nearly) a failed star.  Well, learning has a way of kicking in - often via discovery.  We&#39;ve now seen objects out there that are several times the size of Jupiter [hot super-sized extra-solar Jupiters abound!], &amp; now we know better.  So we&#39;re learning just how big a small thing can be &amp; still not be a star.  But on the other end of the scale, we have many trillions of examples of things that quite clearly ARE stars - &amp; we can tell how big (&amp; sometimes, how small) they are, so we have plenty of examples of that.  Anyway, I&#39;d just like to add that I greatly enjoy watching videos about science topics.  But it hurts my little heart to see inaccuracies - especially by people who ought to know better.

You say they don&#39;t fuse hydrogen, but there is fusion occurring in their core. To the best of my knowledge, heavy hydrogen is the easiest element to fuse. Perhaps what you mean is that brown dwarfs only fuse heavy hydrogen, but can&#39;t fuse normal hydrogen. But, if this is the case, what would be the difference between a red dwarf and a normal star? My guess is that, while a red dwarf can not fuse normal helium, it can fuse heavy hydrogen to helium3.<br>Of course, my biggest problem was trying to figure out why stars don&#39;t explode when they first begin fusing normal hydrogen, and even how they fuse normal hydrogen. I have yet to read of an experiment in which a proton to proton collision results in deuterium. The solution that I hypothesize is that because protons are heavier than electrons a positive charge builds up in the core of the star. In a normal star this positive charge becomes large enough to result in a stability inversion between tritium and helium3. This results in the cycle of tritium capturing an electron becoming helium3, followed by an energetic proton knocking a neutron free, recreating the tritium. Then the free neutron is captured creating a heavier element, generally being captured by normal hydrogen to create deuterium, which will generally fuse with another deuterium atom creating either helium3 plus a free neutron or tritium with a free high energy proton that will often collide with helium3 resulting in tritium plus a free neutron. The rate determining step for this process would be electron capture by helium3, which is a reaction with a thermally independent rate. In other words, for a normal star, the main reaction at its core is effectively a cold fusion reaction, which explains why it doesn&#39;t explode, as would be expected from thermo-nuclear fusion.", "comment_date": "2018-05-18T03:13:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maria Nystr\u00f6m", "comment_text": "How does your little planet spinn? :o Is it floating? :o", "comment_date": "2018-05-18T03:05:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dont ask", "comment_text": "My God your stunning...", "comment_date": "2018-05-18T02:44:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dont ask", "comment_text": "9.....?<br><br>That&#39;s what I thought \ud83d\ude0e", "comment_date": "2018-05-18T02:41:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fernominal", "comment_text": "Hmm.<br>You mean the Brown Dwarf binary sun <br>(that, maybe never ignited) <br>to; &quot;The Sun?&quot; (our sun)<br>But what&#39;s the name of our Sun?

You guys cover interesting topics and your charm and enthusiasm make it fun to watch and learn. Since I can remember, I have been interested in a wide range subjects, fields, information, knowledge, and wisdom. Science has always been near the top of that long list. Just like most, I quickly soak up anything taught to me in this area. Especially, when it comes to such intriguing fields as Astronomy, Astrophysics, Cosmology, Biology, Botany, etc. About 5 or 6 years ago, I stumbled upon an Electric Model of how the universe works as an alternative to the current widely accepted standard model of the universe which is what students are still taught in school these days. A few examples of how these models differ: An electric model points to stars and planetary bodies acting as anodes &amp; cathodes supplying the ginormous amount of energy coming from stars through what is called a Birkeland Current, while the standard model&#39;s heavy reliance on gravity causes atomic fusion in the core of stars supplying this huge source of energy through convection to the surface and radiating beyond. I like to think of sunspots as similar to a pupil of an eye where we can peer deeper into the sun. Observations have shown significantly cooler temperatures through sunspots in comparison to the corona. This would seem unlikely if constant fusion or convection where at hand in supplying all this light and energy. I have found the Thunderbolts Project to be the greatest source of information, research, and experimentation of an electric model of the universe. Check it out! It is very interesting, interdisciplinary, and simply makes a lot of sense. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XadqnsNFjoo\">https://youtu.be/XadqnsNFjoo</a> <br>PS: I think you&#39;ll enjoy it", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T15:10:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "metal4", "comment_text": "Pluto is a planet.

So here is what I think : The emission spectrum of usual stars mostly deviates from blackbody spectrum because of lots of weird stuff going on in them other than thermal emission but in the case of brown dwarfs, since there is no nuclear fusion and the density not enough to make weird stuffs happen , I think it is safe to assume brown dwarf as a blackbody and then its lambda max(wavelength at maximum emission) can be used to calculate temperature . So basically to confirm that some body is a brown dwarf , it is important to analyse the whole spectrum and then match it with blackbody spectrum.", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T03:33:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin Pratchett", "comment_text": "Love your stuff, one of the great things is that you have now got my 13 year old daughter interested in your show!

An ostrich or a penguin is still a bird, but it&#39;s not prototypical. It&#39;s on the periphery of the category. People almost universally (at least within a single culture and language) identify the prototypes the same way. But since we don&#39;t intuitively work off of strict definitions, the things on the periphery between categories (like red dwarfs in this case) can be very difficult to categorize. This is part of why operationalization is so important in science and scientists often use words very differently than the rest of us. As a scientist you have transform those vague intuitions you have about similarity to a prototype into categories using a strict, observable set of criteria which put each thing into one category and not the other (which is quite the challenge given our sometimes inconsistent intuitions and the inherent messiness of the universe.)", "comment_date": "2018-05-16T20:12:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "steve g", "comment_text": "For such a smart person she should know that BMWs are junk.
