The video itself and the most of the comments are a playground to joyfully discuss the matter.<br><br>It was somehow a surprise to hear the simpler (but correct) explanation based on Newton\u2019s third law.

The only correction that I would point out is at min <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPO3W081Hw&amp;t=2m00s\">2:00</a> she says that a \u201cbuildup of air\u2026 \u2026creates a higher pressure on that side and pushes the ball\u201d, which is equivalent to the lower side of a wing, or intrados. More important than the higher pressure, is the lowest pressure produced at the other side (upper side of a wing, or extrados). The net difference from the location atmospheric pressure is higher at the \u201cextrados\u201d than at the \u201cintrados\u201d, thus more important for lift (or Magnus force in this case) is the extrados.
