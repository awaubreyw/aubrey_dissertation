Really, the weakness lies in the inability to force Jade to make intermediate measurements (which seems to be impossible without some form of bit-commitment or oblivious transfer, which is proven to be impossible without standard cryptographic assumptions). Additionally, if you had bit-commitment it&#39;s possible for each party to just commit a single bit, and then xor both of them after both bits are committed so they can&#39;t change.

Since each bit can be measured exactly once, there is a chance that the random bits match the missing bits from the correct polarizer, both columns match, and you have to do it over.  So, two questions:  What is the random chance of a match on both sides, based on the number of bits?  And:  Can you arrange the bits, or limit the set of usable binary numbers, to ensure this chance does not happen?", "comment_date": "2019-09-19T17:14:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Markxxx", "comment_text": "You two are awesome together.", "comment_date": "2019-09-18T06:32:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Curiously condescending Cornchip", "comment_text": "Or you could always... charge your phone...", "comment_date": "2019-08-31T14:02:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Someone Human", "comment_text": "im so lost...", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T16:32:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jaya Marks", "comment_text": "best photon ever", "comment_date": "2019-07-28T23:40:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "otherwords 1", "comment_text": "Is there an error in this video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjFkIy1GTlk&amp;t=5m35s\">5:35</a>? She says that, if person A had been cheating and had in fact used diagonal filters, person A could prove her innocence by reading off the &quot;diagonal&quot; column. But the diagonal column of the person B will not match that of person B, because person B will may wrongly record vertical photons (coded by person A as 1s) to be 0s if they don&#39;t pass through -- assuming we&#39;re using the 1-valued diagonal filter -- or to be 0s if they do pass through -- assuming we&#39;re using the 0-valued diagonal filter.

Which works if person B guesses diagonal and wants to know they weren&#39;t duped; person A would clearly only know the rectilinear data if they had knew the state of all the photons themselves. But consider the opposite case: person B guesses rectilinear when person A used diagonal and wants to know she hasn&#39;t been duped. Person A <b>can&#39;t</b> -- with certainty -- read off person B&#39;s diagonal filter because of the probablistic nature of diagonal polarization.

Are you actually stopping one photon that is 45\u00b0 offset and then allowing one through, as described. Or is the crystal lattice of the polarizing film absorbing the energy of the light proportionally to the relative angle? The best way of thinking of it that I have been told is that each photon makes it through the filter, but it has the horizontal component of it energy absorbed by the polarizing film. Such that when its 0\u00b0 offset it passes fully through, at a 45\u00b0 the horizontal component is equivalent to 1/2 its energy is absorbed, and at 90\u00b0 the horizontal component is the full energy of the light, and thus is fully absorbed. <br>This is a very interesting topic to me, and I think that its something that is often misunderstood or portrayed poorly, because its very difficult to explain to people.", "comment_date": "2018-03-22T12:40:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "No Stuff Know Stuff Chris Stahl", "comment_text": "Physics Girl.
