The video explains that we should see nodes, and how those nodes arise, but it misses how we know exactly where those nodes have to be (i.e. what shapes we will see on the plate).<br><br>Those shapes are eigenfunctions of the wave equation on a plate. Specifically with neumann BCs on the boundary defined by the plates shape, and a forcing function at the location of the actuator (maybe a delta function if you assume the actuator tip&#39;s diameter is negligible). So by solving a fairly straightforward pde we can predict exactly where the nodes will be for any given eigenfrequency and by looking at the eigenvectors we can get a sense of the preferred dimensions of this system.<br><br>Admittedly this is a bit uninteresting to most viewers, but I think it is still useful to remember that there is no physics without math, and the math here is quite beautiful.", "comment_date": "2016-03-25T20:14:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PXRB", "comment_text": "mechanical vibrator<br>if ya know wat i mean XD", "comment_date": "2016-03-23T17:00:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremy Smith", "comment_text": "Makes learning fun,<br>my family and I thank you", "comment_date": "2016-03-22T23:29:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raymond Daubney", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not a scientist but I enjoyed this.", "comment_date": "2016-03-22T21:50:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jon Saw", "comment_text": "Do you have the link for the 3D one they did in Tokyo?", "comment_date": "2016-03-20T04:38:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CLARIAN KEN", "comment_text": "if you are the one floating and at the center would you be able to hear the sound?", "comment_date": "2016-03-18T09:41:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spike Maan", "comment_text": "SOme of the frequencies made me cringe, halp", "comment_date": "2016-03-15T14:32:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Abadi", "comment_text": "I like it, thank you for your time.", "comment_date": "2016-03-14T03:00:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Afloat Fob", "comment_text": "Destiny logo at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYoxOJDrZzw&amp;t=4m09s\">4:09</a> lol", "comment_date": "2016-03-11T04:22:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dumpfellow", "comment_text": "Hi,<br><br>Is the distance between the patterns same as the wavelengths.
