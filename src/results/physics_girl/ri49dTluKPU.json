We know it&#39;s denser than water, so while we&#39;re holding the rock the water displacement is a function of the mass of the rock. If the rock is barely denser than water, then there will be virtually no displacement while holding it. But if it&#39;s super dense, say a big chunk of lead, there will be considerable displacement. Once the rock is dropped in the water, however, displacement is now a function of the rock&#39;s volume irrespective of it&#39;s mass. So, if we have a rock that is barely denser than water, the displacement from its volume is likely to be greater than the displacement caused by its mass due to gravity, and thus the water level would rise. If the rock is incredibly dense, however, then the opposite is possible, the displacement from it&#39;s mass due to gravity will exceed the displacement from it&#39;s volume, and when the rock is tossed in the water the overall water level will decrease.

One is that gravity pulls on all mass at an equal rate, and the other is that air resistance is based on the shape of the object.  This makes it seem like they will be the same, but it isn&#39;t.  It is a ratio question.  Both objects have the same air resistance (say, -1) and that air resistance has to be overcome.  What is overcoming that air resistance can be modeled as the conversion of potential energy stored being converted to kinetic energy.  While all mass is pulled equally, the one with more mass will have more energy being converted while overcoming the same resistance, therefore it accelerates faster.<br><br>For the boat question I think the key to the riddle is that the rock sinks.  Floating on water is dependent on water displacement.  If you have 1g of mass that needs to float then you need to have a boat that can displace 1g of water (well... plus the weight of the boat... but that does not play into the equation).<br>If that 1g object is larger than (or equal to) 1g of water, then it will float (or be buoyant) on its own.  This means that weather it is floating on the boat, or on top of the water (or on a layer of water while buoyant), that it will displace the same amount of water and the water level remains the same.<br>If that 1g object is physically smaller than 1g of water (ie, more dense), then it will sink.  This means that it takes a larger volume of water (though the same mass) to make it float in the boat.  Dropping the rock in the water will displace less water than it would in the boat, so the overall water level will go down rather than remaining the same.<br>For a better mental image, lets think of a more extreme example.  Say the rock has the same volume of 1g of water, but has a mass of 1,000g.  In the boat you would have to displace 1000g of water, but once under the water it only displaces 1g of water.  The amount that the boat rises is going to be far greater in volume than that of the rock itself.", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T12:28:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IceMetalPunk", "comment_text": "When you&#39;re floating, you are displacing an amount of water whose weight equals your weight. So when holding the rock, you&#39;re displacing an amount of water with weight equal to the sum of weights of you, the boat, and the rock. When you drop the rock, now you&#39;re only displacing water with weight equal to your weight plus the boat&#39;s, so the water level will drop. While the rock displaces water as well, it doesn&#39;t float, so it displaces its own volume&#39;s worth of water now rather than its weight; since it sinks, that means it&#39;s more dense than water, which means its&#39; volume of water weighs less than the rock does.
