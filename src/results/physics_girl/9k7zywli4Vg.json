This is really applied physics and easy to understand. But what I wonder: Do we really need magnets on both ends of the battery? You showed that the coil itselfs produces a magnetic field once the &quot;circuit&quot; is closed. This magnetic field should be able to push the battery forward, as long as there is &quot;flowing electricity&quot;. Would two pieces of round iron (touching the coil) attached to the battery\u00b4s ends be enough?<br>We know that when moving iron towards a magnet it gets attracted. But will a electro-magnetic field be enough to attract iron or do we need a magnet?<br>To invert the experiment: we could say: World\u00b4s simplest power plant. Using a magnetic coil and let a small iron ball run through it. This would induce electricity, right? we just need a &quot;consuming device&quot; at the egde of the coil, like a small lightbulp connected with wires to both the ends of the coil... Would this work ? Greetings and best wishes!

Thousands are making them and that free energy debunker guy actually proved they work until he deliberately overloaded his crude model. A generator pulls energy from the ether with magnetic fields flows it out of the system in power. Mechanical advantage with pulley sizes is real phenomenon. I think the flywheel generator with mechanical advantage pullies and flywheels is a working phenomenon. It&#39;s not a thermodynamics issue. As a gasoline engine driven generator doesn&#39;t convert petroleum power directly into electricity, it relies on kinetic transfer to the copper coils and magnetic field. The power supply is endless if the generator motor is turning. The energy comes from the ether of space not from the magnets or copper nor gasoline nor rotation.
