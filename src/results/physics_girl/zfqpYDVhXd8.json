Science has always assumed evolution, but there is a small group within the microbiology community that believes that isn&#39;t possible in the time between the formation of the Earth and the oldest fossils. It has been recently revealed that some sixty tons of dust fall from space to the surface of Earth each and every day. 90% of it comes from within the solar system, but about 10% is interstellar- originating from other places within the galaxy. Chances are that some very small amount of that 10% originates from other galaxies- and so it&#39;s certainly possible that the very first life on this planet did not evolve here, or even evolve within the solar system- but that it arrived here from somewhere else in the Milky Way. It will be very interesting to see precisely what life we do find in other parts of the solar system, and exactly what it has in common with life here- because if it is similar enough (say, the presence of RNA) than that will potentially be a step toward proving that all life has an interstellar origin... meaning that there is life quite literally everywhere across the galaxy, and also across the universe.

Scientists just believe in something when is convenient. We have already understanding to understand that Jesus came on a spaceship and departure on a spaceship. He will be back commanding a fleet of spaceships. The word &quot;cloud&quot; in the Bible is a misunderstanding in translation. The ancient saw spaceships but didn&#39;t know how to name it so they used something they new. Cloud was the word they had for something dark flying in the Sky.
