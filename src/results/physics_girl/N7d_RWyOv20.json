These weather phenomena feature counterclockwise rotation due to Coriolis forces. So, your graphics featuring clockwise rotation more correctly describe tropical cyclones in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans and typhoons occurring in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. A rather interesting aspect of your side-by-side counterclockwise-clockwise cyclone depiction VERY nicely matches the overturning circulation that occurs within a single cyclone, regardless of the hemisphere. Air inflows at low levels at the surface and, due to convection, rises near the centre of the vortex at the eye wall. Subsequently, you see the outflow at the high levels near the tropopause as the air mass cools. The overturning aspect sees the cooler air falling earthward at the outside, thereby causing the close--proximity opposite rotations. Instead of it being two cyclones side-by-side, however, it&#39;s a SINGLE cyclone as viewed as a cross-section. If you look straight down at a cyclone, it&#39;s effectively a vortex ring with a few additional interesting features, such as feeder bands.", "comment_date": "2019-06-10T05:45:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shiroyasha", "comment_text": "This is so cool!!", "comment_date": "2019-06-08T14:34:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PLATONU", "comment_text": "hhahhhah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7d_RWyOv20&amp;t=7m52s\">7:52</a> new type of friendzone, the physics friend zone", "comment_date": "2019-06-08T14:22:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rosie Jenner", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd81\ud83d\udc3e\u2728\ud83c\udfa9\ud83d\udc8e\ud83c\udf00\ud83d\udc41\ud83c\udf2c\ud83c\udf0dMalta - Super acoustic- inner earth - limestone ( chalk is conductive to plasma - spirit showing me ) <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFAJcvXPA\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFAJcvXPA</a> ...... then this video on FREQENCY of stars - this is aligning and tuning the Human instrument subconsciously = natural sounds and shapes etc ... we are all very out of tune currently as a sphere shaped planet - with many wrong angled - echooo - what I call the auric field I see this on everything my dyslexic mind sees the hu the echooo the auric field .

See, the rings are spinning at every point equally fast when produced through a round hole, but when you use a square as outlet of the cannon, I think it is difficult to get a stable vortex, because the corners have more flowing material, which results in a pressure difference inside of the ring. Normally the round shape forms equal forces to cancel each other out very symmetric, but a square is a more complicated form, which could lead to instable vortexes. And the ones that form will quickly decay into a round shape, because of the differences in pressure.

You can sort of see this in your graphic, but also since it is not from a full CFD simulation, it&#39;s not going to be perfectly accurate. This means that if two hurricanes get closer together, they will orbit faster because the velocity is higher closer to the center. In the case of the vortex ring, since the directions are going the same, the inside velocity is faster, making the vortices move faster.

Every single time we tried, the ball would interfere with the ring, even if the ring was clearly much larger than the ball, as in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7d_RWyOv20&amp;t=2m14s\">2:14</a>. We kind of thought the vortex ring would expand over the ball, but finally realized that vortex ring is spinning so that the air on the inside of the ring is moving forward, so it drags against surface of the ball. Sad.<br>- The leap-frogging rings at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7d_RWyOv20&amp;t=2m17s\">2:17</a> were surprisingly hard to make because small currents in the air tend to send the vortices off an a different path. The reason they leap-frog around each other is the same reason hurricanes spin around each other as shown at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7d_RWyOv20&amp;t=4m52s\">4:52</a>. <br>- We shot a smoke ring at a 1-inch pipe, a rope and a thin wire. The pipe killed the vortex. The wire passed right through the vortex with no effect. The rope sometimes killed the vortex ring, sometimes not, depending on how strong the ring was. We wanted to quantify this interference, but alas, I have to start working on a video about black holes. Get pumped.<br><br>Thanks for watching, y&#39;all!
