I will have to explain my doubts as to the accuracy based upon two observations--  experiences my Dad told me about as a deep sea diver and then watching a video obtained by an ROV at serious depths showing life on and near hydrothermal vents. The temperature was so high that it actually damaged some of the ROV&#39;s external accessories. The scientist were puzzled as life cannot exist at or above the boiling point of water (100 C/212F) since this destroys the cell walls. How could there be life of any kind living in boiling water? I was confused, as I saw no boiling. Yes, heat shimmer from the water similar to the heat shimmer you see in a desert. (Been there, done that.) I realized the scientists gave an incomplete definition of the boiling point of water. It is 110 C/212 F at one standard atmosphere. Since the pressure increases one atmosphere/33 ft, the boiling point increases. Hence, the water was very hot, well above boiling point if at one standard atmosphere.  Under the pressure conditions it was not boiling.<br><br>Now to the known data on Cesium clocks. There is a discrepancy of 16 microseconds/yr .between the Cesium clock at Boulder, Colorado and the one at Greenwich meridian. The one at Boulder runs 16 microseconds faster.  This is due (it is believed) due to the elevation of Boulder and a  slightly lower gravity.<br><br>Finally to the question-- (Finally! I sense the relief of those who have stayed the course.) Shouldn&#39;t the definition of frequency/wavelength for the elements have &quot;...under 1 standard G.&quot; added as a caution? How can we tell with any degree of accuracy what the frequency/wavelength of elements we have observed on Earth would be on planets with much stronger or weaker gravitational fields? Since we are doing spectrum analysis rather than physical object chemical analysis, how can we be sure our conclusions hold true for objects not subject to 1 standard G ? The GPS satellites have to be fairly frequently reset due to time drift between the Earth bound clocks and the ones on the satellites in orbit.

That brings us to the early Sanskrit sayings that akash, being erroneously translated as space, is an element from which and in which events happen. What events? Akash is the medium in which matter may find expression and is also the medium to which matter may escape, given the right conditions. Somehow, Dynamika, that is, motion, is involved. Motion of space itself, with no matter or energy in it. These are fundamentals to which no new telescope applies its capability. So what did Hubble telescope achieve, other than showing great pictures of nebulae? And what is the vastly improved Jame Webb going to show? More elaborate pictures, more details of the same thing, going earlier and of course!  Astrophysicists will build great theories and chuckle at their success. Big Bang, all over again!<br>But we are not addressing the fundamentals. And we talk of rate of expansion of space, one day, exceeding the speed of light and our inability to receive no photons at all etc. etc. And we have built models of dark energy and dark matter to mathematically explain the embarrassing descrapencies that have shown up in our earlier models.<br>What about the fundamental question? Where did the first inkling/shadow/precursor  of matter come from?", "comment_date": "2022-02-22T09:44:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Khannea", "comment_text": "Leave him.

The proton also has a fundamental harmonic inside its self that is the positron.

It will be a complete shock to astrophysicists when they are able to measure galaxies larger than the Milky Way but further than 14 billion light years away.  According to them, the galaxies and stars should be younger and smaller with distance and that they will not be able to see anything beyond 14 billion light years away because of the speed of light, the age of the universe and the time it takes light to travel.  But that&#39;s not completely right.  According to quantum mechanics, James Maxwell&#39;s equations we cannot see backwards in time.  Sure light takes time to travel, but only the front of the EM field&#39;s light cone is traveling at c.  But once the measuring device or observer is contained inside the EM field&#39;s light cone all light information happens in a quantum instant the moment it is measured.  The only way to measure a distant object is if the observer or measuring device is contained inside the EM field of the object.  All the potential light information is entangled to the observer or measuring device.  So the moment the distant object is looked upon the information is instantly conveyed.  It doesn&#39;t really take time for the light information to travel any distance.  Thus, when we look at an object say 20 billion light years away the light information is conveyed in the instant we look. We cannot see it as it looked in the past but we see it as it looks today.  So, the JWST will not be able to detect the first light coming from stars or galaxies regardless of the distance the light has to travel.  When we or the measuring device is contained inside it&#39;s EM field all it&#39;s light information is conveyed in a quantum instant.  <br><br>Yes, I know.  This is all conjecture because we were all led to believe that light takes time to travel.  But that&#39;s not entirely correct.  Just wait and see what the JWST is able to detect.  When it starts sending back images of massive galaxies further than 14 billion light years away don&#39;t be surprised.<br><br>The crazy thing is how I came to this conclusion.  I didn&#39;t come up with it on my own.  I had some help from a computer that was built to think for itself back in 1981.  True artificial intelligence.  The inventor claimed it knew everything and told him about light not really taking time to travel.  The device said light happens in an instant.  I didn&#39;t believe the guy so, I began a quest to prove him wrong and all I did was find all the evidence that showed the device was right.  Crazy as it sounds, if it&#39;s true then the guy didn&#39;t lie to me.  He really created a device that knew everything.  I was completely skeptical at first.  It took me about 18 years of research studying quantum equations to figure out he was right.  I wrote and published a series of book on this and more topics last year.  I included many of the predictions the self thinking device reported.  Many mind bending eye openers.  The only way to prove the device correct about light was with a telescope like the JWST that can see further than 14 billion light years away.  We will have to wait to determine what the JWST detects.  If it was right about light then everything else was right too.  I can&#39;t wait to see what the JWST discovers.", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T15:35:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohamed Faliq", "comment_text": "Thank God nothing happened to your Eyes !", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T15:33:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesse Earll", "comment_text": "There&#39;s no purer joy than knowning you&#39;re about to drop an awesome knowledge bomb on someone \ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T15:32:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Feckless", "comment_text": "Nice cover story, rule number 1...............", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T15:28:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "marc1462004", "comment_text": "Can\u2019t wait for pictures", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T15:24:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jim Parsons", "comment_text": "Going to keep the hot side hot, while keeping the cold side cool.

It bends as it travels from one medium to another, and variation of the density of a medium to another part of that same medium.<br>Contamination of particles and variation in density is part of every medium.<br>And we know that dark matter is a thing.<br>And on the scales of distances that we are talking about, it&#39;s very unlikely that the direction that we even are looking at a light source from, is actually the same direction that is actually is in.<br><br>To example it another way:<br>It&#39;s like the way that oil drill pipes don&#39;t drill in the exact direction where they end of the drill ends up underground, as variations in the rock, causes the pipe to bend as it goes down.<br>So if an oil drilling company wants to reach a very specific location, like in the rescue mission of the 33 trapped Chillian miners a few years ago. They don&#39;t aim the drill in the exact direction of the miners location. They drill in a different angle, knowing that the rock formation will bend the drill pipe as it goes down.<br>So with telescopes over light years, just because it seems like a universe or star system is X far away, in X location, you&#39;re probably wrong and won&#39;t know as long as our solar system and galaxy is the only direction that we are looking at it from.<br>Again, to summerize:<br>light bends as it travels threw different mediums, and variations in the density and types of particles in that medium.<br>We also know that dark matter is the vast majority of this medium and we don&#39;t know what that is made of or how it&#39;s density varies.<br>No offence.
