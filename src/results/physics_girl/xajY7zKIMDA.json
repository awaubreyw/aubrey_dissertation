Then in itself that would be a contradiction.<br>Because, we cannot have something exist that cannot exist within our physics.

Assuming you can contain another set rules of physics within it.<br>I think somewhere within quantum positioning of quarks I think they would create an extra dimensional energy and which is probably the foundation of all electrons.<br>I think it would involve the hyper positioning of quarks in a quantum state then, make a sphere out of it.<br>A quantum quantum....<br>Somehow in the double double negative or double double positive the unknown and unmeasurable energies will compound.<br>Then from the byproduct energy from that will create an extra dimensional self-sustaining anomaly.<br><br>So everything is moving away that is observable right?

Of course, this could be simply the result of harmonious synchronized paths of any properties in question. Ultimately, I think balance is the key. I think the universe is expanding because at some point everything was compacted into the tiniest of spaces and could not be contained anymore so everything was forced away from each other like an explosion. It makes the big bang theory seem more likely, but as I said I think the answer is more simple and less complicated.

I understand completely how an expanding universe would allow &quot;faster than light&quot; travel however I don&#39;t  understand why they would disappear. What I do see is tha cosic microwave background is still visable and presumably more distant than any galaxy. It is also my understanding that red shift is a function of time in that the apparent time of a higher speed object away from us is slower than a lower speed object. Therefore the apparent speed of a distant object would be subject to time dilation and as it approached the speed of light the apparent time of the object would also approach zero. So while the red shift might go to one cycle an hour type radio wave  there would still those radio waves coming from tha galaxy and the cosmic microwae  background  would be longer waves still.<br><br>This has huge implications for dark energy as the apparent excelleration of the speed of expansion would appear greater if the time as dstance and not time dilation were considered. I do not know if expansion would still show as acceleration or not but as I hear your discussion I hear time dilation pop in and out of the conclusion depending on the particlars. And I have not found anyone definitively  addressing that point but the idea that the light would fade and not continue to red shift I  cannot see, and following Einstein&#39;s reasoning for red shift being bound to time dilation inextricably means there is no point that there is not radiation.<br><br>This would also mean that if you somehow went faster than the speed of light you would appear to red shift and go ever slower even as those inside the ship would see time slow to a crawl back home.", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T21:11:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Tyler", "comment_text": "You and your videos rock.  making dry history and science dynamic and interesting.  thank you", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T17:24:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guy Chocensky", "comment_text": "So the universe expands faster than the speed of light and we never be able to see beyond our observable universe?<br><br>So really the speed of dark is faster than the speed of light.", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T15:11:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phospho Philite", "comment_text": "Imagine if the space was like water in a pool then the big bang as a bom .

Maybe as the loss of resources in the observable universe becomes total, that would signify the death of the cell... Maybe life is so rare because it&#39;s a specific type of resource for the cell, like the nucleus. To further that analogy, if we become space faring, and reach a distance farther than the observable universe, that could signify the nucleus splitting and the official birth of a new cell...

Many are most likely wrong because there are so many fundamental principles of physics that remain to be discovered and which, if known at the moment of the making of this video, would make it and its conclusions so different... The giants of this universe ( civilizations which are much older than ours, by many millions of years ) know that, for example, the speed of the spirit, the speed of thought if you prefer knows no limits. If your sweetheart lives on a planet millions of billions of light years ( or more ), the moment they send a thought of love to you, then you will receive this thought instantaneously no matter how far from them you are. <br><br>The extremely advanced civilizations of this universe are centered on the fundamental notion and knowledge that there IS a God, the Focal point of all creation. During the 19th century, the most important revelation from God to Mankind ( here on earth ) took place and the two central characters of this all encompassing revelation made it clear that knowledge is far greater than what the greatest scientists, thinkers, philosophers and others can even imagine. He hath said that if he were to reveal all the knowledge imparted to him by God, Human intelligence would be consumed and mankind would cease to exist. It will take half a million years for another equally powerful revelation to be sent to mankind, in the meantime every thousand years, other messengers from Him will appear but they will reveal much less than what they did on our planet during the 19th century. Their teachings do, of course, include elements of physics that may seem mind boggling but for example know that it is possible to transform gold into any other element of the periodic table ( those presently known and those not yet known ) and back and that is just a tiny example of what He revealed. Know as well that there is no disease or ailment, no matter how serious, that can&#39;t be completely cured. He predicted the problem of global warming and its cataclysmic consequences more than 160 years ago ( and of course nobody listened ) and many other problems which could and would threaten the very existence of mankind and the two main personas of this revelation had never been in a school ever, Yet all what they had predicted came to pass and those in a more distant future will also take place.<br><br>As one of them said, only the Spirit is important. Energy and matter are not and while we are still like babies who only began scratching the surface of knowledge very recently, He encouraged the use of the scientific method for advancing mankind&#39;s knowledge but he also emphasized that there were other pathways to enlightenment in all fields of knowledge. A French mathematician and philosopher ( Gaston Bachelard ) said during the 20th century that the 21st century and all the following ones, will be Spiritual otherwise they will not be ( i.e. the end of mankind will occur if it doesn&#39;t turn to the ultimate source of knowledge, i.e. God )  Only by doing this, by turning to Him will mankind finally thrive, become one of the Giants of this Universe and also become the Space Faring Civilization He wants us to become. Then, and only then, will mankind enter its Golden Age.

In other words space is a kind of fluid and depending on radiation it expands or contracts, the same way has molecules expand or contract based on temperature. Light photons can travel throw most mediums but not all which can give the illusion of loss. Even with the red shift, both gravity and different mediums in space can create illusions of expansion. Other possibilities are that galaxies collide with other galaxies which can cause the illusion of super fast expansion. The last factor is time in relation to speed, which just adds a new variable.

Except the road is being stretched apart. <br>So if per second the road is stretched faster than the car can travel, it will not reach any further. Or this is what it will approach in the limit. (This is at least how I understood it).<br><br>Now my weird brain starts thinking from the cars perspective: Me in the car will still drive at constant speed, but the city on the horizon is pushed away from me at the same time. <br>Wouldn\u2019t that make it feel like, for me, the car is constantly slowing down more and more until it eventually aproaches 0?<br><br>So relatively speaking, instead of space expanding, could you also say the speed of light is decreasing as light travels? <br>Doesn\u2019t that also mean that light is losing energy? Like you explained in the \u201cis energy always conserved\u201d video you referred to.<br><br><br>In your slinky analogy the road (slinky) is stretched by a force from your hands, and in space it is stretched by a force from dark energy. <br>Though the material the slinky is made of does not increase, neither does the material in your stretchy pants. Rather the voids in between the material are getting larger.<br>Now going on a stretch here (pun intended), could I also see this dark energy as voids, maybe some sort of medium, in a high energy state, that is pushing space apart? <br>Like a loaded spring, or a compressed gas? I guess not right? Since the expansion is actually accelerating. (Though I suppose a point on the spring can also be seen as accelerating as the spring unloads until eventually the spring will decelerate again)<br><br><br>Coming back to the point of view of the car, could the dark energy maybe be something that is slowing the light down? <br>Like air resistance, a medium that light has to push through with resistance.<br>Crazy thought: perhaps space is not expanding, but full of something that can grind photons to a halt. And that something is over time increasingly more capable of stopping it (accelerating). Making us see less and less far into space.<br><br>I know not much is known about dark energy so I guess I don\u2019t really expect an answer to that.

So imagine a 2D grid with a couple of circles on it to represent pockets of matter. Each grid is spaced apart by some unit length. At the start we could imagine 3 circles of diameter 1: one is at the center of our grid (0,0), the second is one unit to the right (1,0), and the third is 10 units to the right (10,0). If we are the circle at (0,0) then when we observe the other two circles, they appear to be 1 unit and 10 units away, respectively. Then imagine some later time where all matter shrinks in size the same amount, but stays exactly at the same original grid locations. From this global perspective we can see the circles all have diameter 0.5 and are all at the same locations on the original grid. From our perspective on the now shrunken circle at (0,0) though, we have unknowingly shrunk and thus so has our local &#39;yardstick&#39; with which to measure distance. So we look at the sphere originally at location (1,0) and see that it is now actually at (2,0) because we and our measurement devices unknowingly shrunk to half the size, so we would say it has some velocity of 1 unit per elapsed time. Similarly the third sphere which was originally at (10,0) is now at (20,0) and we would conclude it has velocity of 10 units per elapsed time. Thus things that appear further away appear to be moving further away faster and faster<br><br>does that make any sense to anyone? I haven&#39;t seen it phrased this way, but it sometimes makes it easier for me to intuitively understand. Put a bunch of circles on a 2D surface, keep them all at the same global location, shrink them all, then zoom in onto any one of them so as to keep it &#39;locally&#39; the same size, and you would see that all of the other circles look to be moving faster, the further away they are<br><br>Similarly, if you could theoretically observe the entire universe all at once from some global perspective, you would simply see it is static in size and that everything inside is just shrinking in place. For some reason this makes more sense and brings me a little more peace than the idea of infinity expanding further into infinity. <br><br>could it be that all matter is actually radiating out energy that becomes this &#39;dark energy&#39; and expands the space between us? And that radiation causes matter to actually shrink in size? And we just don&#39;t observe it because it is very weak and/or the forces holding us and our local galaxy together are so much stronger that we can&#39;t measure it yet? <br><br>what a time to be conscious", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T00:17:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Power", "comment_text": "Actually, it was probably Milton Humason who was sitting in the cold taking pictures of galaxies at Mt.

I understand that the concept of observable universe is effectively the ability to receive information from that part of the universe and the non observable part is moving away from us faster than light so we will never be able to get that information. However let me propose a situation.  Take 3 observers in the universe. A, B and C where A &amp; B overlap and B &amp; C overlap but not A &amp; C.\r<br>\r<br>Observer A should never be able to know about C, but B knows about both A and C.  And since A can receive information from B isnt it possible for B to relay data about C.  But that seems impossible because the light information cant come any faster than directly from C to A.

As the farthest star moved away its light remained continuous, so the farther away it got the more distant in time the light reaching us was, BUT there was always a continuous stream of light no matter how slowly it got here. Even though the star is traveling faster than light (How fast exactly? I can&#39;t find that!) its light has always been traveling in an unbroken stream.
