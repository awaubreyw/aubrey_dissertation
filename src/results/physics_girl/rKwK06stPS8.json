The total energy of a bouncing ball is equal to a term containing its velocity (KE) and another term containing its position above the ground (PE). So since these 2 terms sum up to consonant if the velocity increases the hight decreases and vice versa which totally describe the bouncing ball system.<br><br>That&#39;s way for me at least I love to understand the work-energy-power concepts starting with energy not work. Work is the change of energy. So in our system the change of KE between 2 points is the work between them (remember the total is consonant). And since any increase in KE comes from PE for TE to remain consonant. The work W describes how much PE was converted to KE from point 1 to point 2.<br><br>From this you get that power is just the rate of this transfer (how fast it was) by dividing over the time from point 1 to point 2.", "comment_date": "2022-02-04T20:45:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Gilling", "comment_text": "im studying for a AP physics test, and this was so so so so so so so so so helpful, ur amazing thank you", "comment_date": "2022-01-26T00:47:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K\u00fcbra Kocyigit", "comment_text": "You&#39;re so cool and pretty.
