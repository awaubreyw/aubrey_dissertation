This happens in the sink, on the hood of a car, and I&#39;ve even noticed it in urinals, as well as molten solder (tin and lead). The Hydrogen atoms in water are bonded at a 107 degree angle with a covalent bond to the Oxygen, so even plain water will do this. I was able to set up an apparatus with nearly 100% floater generation, and also used dye to study the droplets. Interestingly, the addition of soap (or any surfactant) simply causes the floating droplets to flatten out, and they will often merge creating &quot;drops&quot; nearly 2cm in diameter. I also played around with pH, but that had no effect on the phenomenon. If I remember right, the air gap is just a few hundred Angstrom, close to the wavelength of yellow light - one experimenter used diffraction rings from a sodium lamp to measure the distance. Any dust or particulate on the surface of the liquid tends to pop the bubbles so that they either don&#39;t form, or are extremely short lived.<br>One of the coolest things about this is that if you introduce a static electric field, the phenomenon disappears! Apparently this alters the surface polarity enough to prevent the electric charge drop levitation. Run a comb through your hair and bring it near the liquid to watch this, or just stand on a bathroom mat that makes static when you rub your socks on it: when you bend over to get a close look at the drops, they all disappear!<br>The only research I was ever able to find on this came from two Scientific American articles in the old &quot;Amateur Scientist&quot; column (I would not be the person I am without reading that during my childhood). I was able to disprove most of the theories in those articles, but never came up with a full theory that explained all the behavior I observed.", "comment_date": "2019-05-23T21:08:28Z", "likes_count": 33}, {"comment_by": "Amy Sanchez", "comment_text": "In the movie BFG are the bubbles in the frobscottle drink anti bubbles?", "comment_date": "2019-05-21T22:48:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Taylor Neill", "comment_text": "I thought it was the hydrophilic part of the molecule thats in contact with the water?", "comment_date": "2019-05-18T15:20:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Markiyan Hapyak", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude02!!!

The mechanism was drive by the bubble having a lower temperature than the water surface.  The bottom of the bubble is slightly heated due to it&#39;s close proximity (but not touching) with the water surface.  Heating the bottom of the bubble increases it&#39;s surface tension which pulls the bubbles surface down.  The surface tension &quot;powers&quot; a torrid circulation pattern in the bubble.  Since there&#39;s a no slip condition with the air that&#39;s in contact with the bubble, the bubble drags air underneath it.  If the circulation is fast enough, it&#39;ll suspend the bubble above the warmer water surface until the temperature equalizes, killing the circulation and causing the bubble to drop down into the water surface.

Since water molecules attract one another through hydrogen bonding such as the partial negative ends attracting the partial positive ends of water the outside surface of the water droplet will either have the partial positive or the partial negative end exposed.  If the surface of the main body of water the droplet falls into is the same polarity, either both partial positive or partial negative, then repulsion will occur and the droplet will stay intact like a bead on the surface.
