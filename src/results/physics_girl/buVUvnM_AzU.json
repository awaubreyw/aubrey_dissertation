Usually when haphazardly storing away your cable by quickly rolling it up you actually end up applying extra tension to the wires inside the cable, decreasing their lifespan. The alternative to the figure 8 is to simply coil your cable in a single loop while respecting the natural state of the wires inside. Hold one end of the cable in one hand, as you make the first coil you can feel how the cable resists twisting one direction (usually resulting in the part of the cable you&#39;ve coiled already starting to deform/twist), while twisting in the other direction &quot;agrees&quot; with the tensions already present in the cable. Make your coil, respect the natural flow of the cable, and also make sure you coil on alternating sides. So the first coil goes on the outside of the hand holding the end, the next on the inside etc.<br><br>Ok maybe just do the figure 8 instead of deciphering my description. Either way, your headphones and other audio cables will last you many more years if you get into this habit :) most of my headphones as well as my guitar cables that got lots of abuse when I still gigged pre-covid survived for multiple years regardless of the price I bought them at, including a pair of \u00a35 headphones I&#39;ve been using as a reference when mixing the past 5 years :)", "comment_date": "2021-05-23T13:50:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Riku Lappi", "comment_text": "Open the rear side windows, not front.

Anyway I realise that a car tends to cool faster if you opened windows which are diagonally opposite (front left and rear right, or vice versa), as compared to opening all the windows. See, in opening all the windows, the air flow is turbulent, and not much air that comes into the car is actively forcing more air out of the car. However, my theory is if you were to open only diagonally opposite windows, whatever air that comes in from the front window immediately pushes air out of the rear opposite window(while driving, of course). The air that&#39;s pushed out in turn sucks more air in from the front thanks to the negative hydrostatic pressure created.<br><br>Were you to open both windows on the same side it would be akin to blowing over a cup - only a tiny fraction of the air you blew over the cup&#39;s mouth actually goes into the cup and forces air in the cup out.

The trick to test if glasses are polarized by using a cell phone screen only works with LCD screens.  If a screen uses OLED technology, a polarized filter has basically little or no impact.

OLED screens are self-illuminating and require no polarizing filters to produce an image.)<br><br>2. The figure 8 is a variant of the over/under technique that professionals use when winding cables.  The basic idea is that wrapping a cable/rope/hose this way automatically removes the twist created by wrapping in the first place (one loop creates, the next loop removes), rather than adding a new twist with each loop like you get with the way most people wrap their cables.
