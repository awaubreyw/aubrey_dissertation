I did ask a guy from the youtube channel &quot;Kurdistan Planetarium&quot;: So if (at least) three (Jupiter) Moons are almost in the same orbital plane, will those three moon shadows once have met overlapping each other? <br>The response: Watching my Planetarium program i have seen many such eclipses on Saturn moons too (Saturn and Neptune are said to have such eclipses more seldom, they are rather rarely spotted). Titan eclipsing Mimas whilst both eclipsed Enceladus, the shadow on Enceladus was very peculiar a Heart shaped shadow, resulting from overlapping by two moons. So yes it is possible on our planets with many moons. <br>So what does that optimize possible half-life on that &quot;snowey&quot; pretty or handsome Enceladus? <br>Mid-sized Mimas might had gotten some effect, like a (soft) shock from big Titan. The sharp ending of the frequent light seems to influent fragile ice or toline. The double moon eclipse as it would be seen on Enceladus or behind it will be calculatable and visualizable, but who&#39;d manage that? I&#39;d deeply enjoy to be astouned about such math. There is a picture of Ganymed eclipting over the Great red spot. <br>A video of earth eclipsing the moon <a href=\"https://www.der-mond.org/fileadmin/user_upload/videos-desktopversion/NASA-Mondfinsternis-vom-Mond-aus-gesehen-Original.mp4\">https://www.der-mond.org/fileadmin/user_upload/videos-desktopversion/NASA-Mondfinsternis-vom-Mond-aus-gesehen-Original.mp4</a> , making the moon appear reddish on earth. &#39;kinda like Charon making shade over Pluto, or the other way round? <br>Since the three described moons/meen of Saturn are regular moons/meen , all regular planet meen orbit in about the same orbital plane. It&#39;s rather likely to spot or calculate moon-shade effects with those than with irregular moons/meen. Most (regular) meen are tidally locked, always facing the same side, like earths moon. Saturn&#39;d have 24 (bigger) regular moons. Phoebe is the so-far only bigger irregular (Saturn) moon. Wikipedia has a site &quot;regular moons&quot;. The &quot;rolling Greek&quot; Uranus might never have Meenshade on its gas, and Neptune is just too further off. <br>Furthermore, there are three shepherd moon pairs (thou&#39; the one around Uranus will never shade). And more than ten asteroid pairs discovered yet, almost like (90) Antiope, or Sila and Nunam. Both types will bear nice eclipses like occultations aswell. But it&#39;d be a little like predicting when asteroids collide, right?

From my understanding, this is one way we detect exoplanets. However, in the solar system, the planets&#39; orbit is tilted by 6 degrees compared to the sun and 60 degrees to the galactic plane (rotation of stars around the center of our galaxy). This would make it very difficult for our planets to be seen passing over the sun from other stars. Our sun is relatively old compared to other stars in our solar system (wobble tends to reduce misalignment over time). So how many planets from other stars remain unseen using the &quot;transit method&quot;?<br><br>PS:  From the Earth, transits due to Mercury occurs about 14x per century (next one is due in November 11th 2019) and Venus only four times every 243 years (last occurred in 2012 and next is to occur in 2117) and our orbits are nearly aligned (inclination of 7 degrees to the ecliptic for Mercury and 3.4 degrees for Venus) !", "comment_date": "2017-08-20T04:30:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aloe Moss", "comment_text": "I have 93% coverage", "comment_date": "2017-08-19T04:46:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NGFL YT Official", "comment_text": "TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE August 21, 2017", "comment_date": "2017-08-19T00:54:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sleepy Dog", "comment_text": "Also, what would happen if you shone a light/laser on the dark side of the moon during a solar eclipse?", "comment_date": "2017-08-17T15:00:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sleepy Dog", "comment_text": "Hey Diana, try this out:<br><br>Twist the head of an old toothbrush until it breaks off.<br><br>It&#39;ll be very hot at the twisted ends", "comment_date": "2017-08-17T14:57:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Munoz", "comment_text": "Good luck watching the eclipse.

Well PG, total eclipses have been occurring here for over 4 billion years, well before the moon came into registration distance with the sun,\u00a0and, as you do point out, will continue to occur for the next 600 My. The moon doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;exactly the right size&quot; to have a total eclipse: It only has to be the right size or larger (as you point out correctly in the case of Pluto, where Charon is way larger than the minimum total eclipse size). And further, in fact the moon is just a tad smaller than it needs to be to have an exact co-incident total eclipse (depending on the varying distances of sun and moon to earth). So, you can say it is amazing that we experience an eclipse with only the solar corona visible, but in fact\u00a0total eclipses (eclipsi?) have occurred long before the moon receded to parity size with the sun. Cheers Physics Girl, and still love ya anyway :). p/s: Here&#39;s a question for you: You know that experiment where you take a disk and use it to cast a shadow and there is a bright spot in the center of the shadow?
