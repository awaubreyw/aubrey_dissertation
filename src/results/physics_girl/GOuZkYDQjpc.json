This &quot;Invisible stuff&quot; was said to make up 95% of the known universe and it accounted for the way galaxies etc moved.  Saying that 95% of the visible universe wasn&#39;t there was to say somewhat overwhelming and confusing. Essentially my thoughts on the creation of the Universe still agreed with the current theory of the big bang.<br><br><br>  Now my thoughts and feelings begin. <br>  I have always had this problem with the concept that the Universe and time began from nothing, &quot;something from nothing&quot;..............that doesn&#39;t work for me. So, what was the singularity that our Universe was formed from made of ? <br>  Time was said not to exist before the big bang, nothing existed. Well what if something did ? My thoughts are this.<br>   Before the big bang there was, (this is now my terminology) The Dark Universe. This consisted totally of dark matter and it is uniforme in nature, there was no light but this matter has exactly the same properties and gravitational values as our Universe. This Dark Universe&#39;s size in comparison to our Universe is massive.   Somehow some of this dark matter coalesced to form an exceptionally dense region, this area continued to become more dense and this is what ultimately went on to become the singularity that formed the big bang. The &quot;Big bang&quot; went on to produce &quot;New Matter&quot;.  This matter went on to produce light an I now use the term the &quot;Light Universe&quot;.<br><br>  The Light Universe then inflated as we have theorised and gone on to form our &quot;Known Universe&quot;. The Dark Universe is still there, unchanged and gravitationally acting on our now Light  Universe, It is essentially the fabric or foundation of our Light Universe. It provides that extra impetus on the galaxies etc that make up our Universe. <br><br>As I hypothesised earlier, the Dark Universe is huge, so massive that it would allow for multiple Light Universes. In fact it could well be millions or billions of them. <br> <br> Another thought on the consequences of this is the problem of the unification of the theories of Quantum Theory and Einstein&#39;s theories of  relativity. Just perhaps Quantum theory may relate to the Dark Universe and it&#39;s atomic structure and Einstein&#39;s  theories may relate to the Light Universe, but that is way out of what I can understand.<br>  I would love a reply to this with your thoughts Dianna, even if it is to say that I have no idea of what I am talking about. <br>  Love your channel.", "comment_date": "2020-08-07T13:38:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H N Nagarathna", "comment_text": "Same like 3b1b hello...
