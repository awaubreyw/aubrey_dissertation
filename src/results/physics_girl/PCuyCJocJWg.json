This machine could create anti-particles in any quantity and quality whishes.<br><br>There is a lot of evidence, documents, video, photo and mails recognize as authentic by graphologists and physiognomists. The pupil of Majorana named Rolando Pelizza was who assembled the machine based on his master unconventional math and physics.<br><br>Pelizza tested this machine from 1976 for Italy, USA, Belgio, NATO and it worked but they wanted the machine as weapon and he refused billions dollar offers from government because Majorana wanted this machine applied only for human social development and never as weapon. <br>There is in internet the design scheme for build the machine but only Pelizza and Majorana know how o make the machine works and need to know the formula or the machine is useless.<br><br>Pelizza was persecuted and even jailed in latest 50 years by secret service who stolen the machine many times every time it was assembled by Pelizza. This machine have some gold and platinum parts and assembly one of them cost around 90k dollars, Pelizza counted over 300 of this machine destroyed during the test before the final version or stolen by secret service. Anyway Pelizza died few months ago and seems he destroyed the formula before die but seems Majorana successfully realized a variation of the phase 4 (space-time translation) e could go basically in another dimension and come back younger so probably Majorana is still alive now but he got kidnapped in 2007 by secret service so i guess we would never see him and his machine anymore, this machine could fix all human problems and hurt all business of big corporations.<br>RIP Pelizza<br>Goodbye Majorana", "comment_date": "2022-04-28T02:45:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Harmen Shah", "comment_text": "Is that so easy to enter CERN?

H2O. Now.. think about it... The universe is boolean at it&#39;s smallest constructing elements. Either true or false ultimately. But the beginning obviously wasn&#39;t false.. so what prevented a paradox with the two particles? Also, matter cannot be created nor destroyed, so this kind of &quot;universal boolean&quot; rule is only relevant to scenarios involved with time. Essentially &quot;potential scenario x2&quot;.

The proton vibrates exactly 180 degrees out of phase to the electron generating the energy density of PLUS 1.602 x 10^(-19) Ampere Seconds. Antimatter therefore must vibrate with exactly mirrored energy to its counterpart. The overlaying of the energy waves would cancel them, &quot;deleting&quot; matter. Kinda like the double slit experiment where, when maximum and minimum of the standing wave combine, the result is bright and dark spots when observing the wave characteristic of light.

But what was happening though is that these matter and antimatter photon things would collide but when the collide the matter always met with antimatter and vice versa so they would cancel each other out and I\u2019m pretty sure that once the opposing ends would meet they would kinda just stop existing. And these two ends where drone to each other like opposing ends of a magnet so there where so so so many billions and probably even trillions of these collisions happening all the time. but then for every billion photons being created there was one photon having matter on both ends of it with no matter so now when the matter and antimatter photons would meet these very few matter matter protons then there would be two matter left over since the matter and matter would meet leaving two matter cause they don\u2019t cancel each other out. But eventually all the dark matter in the universe seemed to exist but I\u2019m not positive but I\u2019m pretty sure that there is still a bit of dark matter and it is not being destroyed any more sense the participles have stoped colliding so fast that they destroy each.<br>Any way I\u2019m pretty sure that no one will see this comment but if you do I hope that this explains what she said at the beginning a bit better .

We experience the Universe and all its matter as a contiguous space, which we associate with being a massive sphere.  Expanding or not, for that matter sphere to be balanced by antimatter, the antimatter would need to encapsulate the matter like the foam in a fitted equipment case hugs the equipment it protects.  But we observe no evidence of this, so we abandon it.<br><br>But what if we didn&#39;t?  What if, instead, we consider that there might be a corresponding &quot;antidimension&quot; in which the antimatter resides?  The necessary interactions between matter and antimatter may occur as needed, but we observe these interactions ONLY from the third dimension (and fourth, when observed over time) with which we are familiar -- THAT&#39;S why we can only observe the EFFECTS of antimatter, but not antimatter itself.<br><br>So as far as matter is concerned, it IS balanced by antimatter, just not visibly for us, and vice-versa for antimatter.

By their own admission they call it dark matter because it\u2019s a complete unknown (dark) to them, and finally \u2018matter\u2019 because they think everything is matter/atoms. To a hammer everything is a nail, and to an Atomist, everything is matter. In short, so-called \u2018dark matter\u2019 is a cryptic euphemism used to get around mention of the Ether which even the priests of Quantum admit is at least 70% of the universe if not more.<br>DIELECTRIC<br>The primary half of the conjugate field modalities of the dielectric and the magnetic field. The inertial (capacitance, energy) or dielectric torsional, and lastly the circular magnetic. Dielectric is the capacitance potential of counterspace. Dielectric loss is defined as magnetism, increasing potential terminating towards and into counterspace is so defined as increasing of the dielectric inductance or charge. The smaller the space, the higher the dielectric, or capacitance. Space is the attribute of the magnetic which itself is the absence of, or discharge of the dielectric. Counterspace is the medium of the dielectric which is the presence of the Ether under torsion, or as meant dielectric charge.<br>The so-called electron is merely one unit of dielectric inductance as so conceptualized by Atomistic ignorance. J.J. Thomson considered the electron the terminal end of one unit line of dielectric induction. The dielectric manifests from and vanishes into counterspace, whereas magnetism manifests space itself, which while having no properties, has the attribute of magnitude &amp; the measure of time, or lag. The plane of inertia is the dielectric 45 degrees from magnetic flux and 90 degrees from gyromagnetic precession where force is inverted to increasing potential, or counterspace, the terminal of the dielectric. The dielectric is Ether under torsion, the magnetic is Ether under polarization, which is ultimately true field holography and that which gives mass and magnitude to all things.", "comment_date": "2020-12-16T07:23:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Gammon", "comment_text": "This would be immensely scary in volume.

I&#39;m not fully certain but isn&#39;t it the following?<br> Antimatter is NOT the rarest &quot;substance&quot;, not at all, it&#39;s not even rare either. Antimatter is supposed to exist in almost the same amount as there is normal matter. Yes there is a subtle imbalance, however, in theory there is a particle of antimatter to any particle of matter, antiquarks - quarks, anti electrons (positrons) - electrons. The thing is, that positrons, anitmatter, only have extremely short lifespans, hence, they are almost impossible to capture, not even to mention the difficulties in containing them. In conclusion: Just because we cannot store or create considerable amounts of permanent/semi-permanent forms of antimatter doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t a lot of it. Positrons get annihilated quickly, but as matter, antimatter cannot simply disappear. There is enormous amounts of antimatter out there, yet we can&#39;t really use or handle it the same way we do with conventional matter.", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T22:05:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "torben andersen", "comment_text": "Maybe When the universe Was Made almost all antimatter become matter", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T11:40:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Husam Malek", "comment_text": "&quot; from everything we create a couple &quot;  Quran", "comment_date": "2020-09-12T16:03:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Conkright", "comment_text": "Is there?

All of this happened immediately during the bang, ejecting antimatter, matter, etc at speeds exponentially faster than light, which ripped apart the bounds of its own existence and created the universe we see today, literally ripping it across the &quot;sky&quot;. Contrary to the popular belief, &quot;the&quot; universe isn&#39;t quite infinite in itself, it doesnt go on forever if you can move even a little faster than its actually expanding you could reach the end of it eventually, and then you enter into an entirely unknowable dimension. But unless you can move at even a speed thats faster than the universes expansion by a miniscule degree, it will indeed appear infinite. Perhaps you&#39;ll see it one day, though you&#39;ll need to realize the formula for creating the &quot;artificial&quot; gravity of science fiction, artificial in quotes because there is no such thing as true artificial gravity, that spinning fair ride has nothing to do with actual gravity itself.

Let me tell you about a guy who was God came down here to crush the head of your friend Lucifer.  By being the perfect sacrifice God forgives all of mans sin just for asking and believing in him.  Jesus Christ came down here so one day we all may be reunited with God and not letting Lucifer near us.  He allowed his very own people to sacrifice him on a Cross three days later he defeated death (Satan Lucifer however you prefeer).  He is sitting at Gods right hand as we speak.  Folks this is no fairy tail its true and time is drawing near for him to return if you are ready he will take you out of here before the wrath of the creator is upon this earth.  If you dont know him now would be a good time to learn about him.  God Bless you Physics Girl I just prayed for you and good luck.<br>He loves you more than you know as well as any other person who reads this.  One cannot deny the world is in chaos.

As a matter of fact, anti-matter decays back into matter within just a few seconds, by beta-decay, if not contained in a strong magnetic field.

She was an unknown kid sitting on the snowy sidewalk outside the Swedish Parliament and I built her website for her as a Christmas present. She gave me a thumbs up in the heart on Twitter I will always cherish. I saw her passion, and I knew she might change the world with just a little help. I was right and a few months later she landed on the cover of Time Magazine and you can learn all about her at GretaThunberg (0rg). Today, there are over six hours of videos from scientists all around the world at her website which explain all life including humans will be extinct in well under a decade, perhaps just a few years. An ice-free Arctic in a year or two guarantees an abrupt spike in temperatures due to loss of latency heat cooling coefficient inherent in ice, loss of reflective albedo and exponentially accelerating methane emissions causing more superstorms, wildfires, droughts and rainbombs which will lead to widespread crop losses, already happening, famine, riots and collapse and then extension when skilled labor stops maintaining 1,600 nuclear facilities including 450 generating stations and toxic plants all around the world, already leaking and destroying our rivers, oceans and habitats. Meanwhile, Plankton levels are down 50%, which means our primary oxygen machine is broken and our backup oxygen machine, the Amazon, is being mowed and burned flat by Brazil&#39;s Bolsonaro. Meanwhile, vertebrae biomass is down 60%, insect populations are down 50% to 90% depending on region and fisheries are crashing \u00a0wow wow whales and dolphins are beaching to send us a message.

(The Golden Age of the 20th Century was when that witticism was new-ish, and you could still ambush people with it).<br>Anyhow, back on track with my train of thought, it seems clear why the universe does not contain macro- amounts of both matter and antimatter.  It can&#39;t.  One of the two HAD to dominate.  Locally, I suppose it would be possible for either to dominate, at least temporarily.  If some of the energy released in matter-antimatter annihilation ultimately reappears as matter (or anti-), then the incompatibility should continue to be thrashed out until one or the other is entirely depleted.  It seems unlikely that the ultimate winner should be decided randomly, because the two forms of matter aren&#39;t really chiral.  Some of the fundamental laws of the universe show &quot;handedness&quot;\u2014 electromagnetism \u2014 which must, in some as yet mysterious sequence account for the apparent chiral anomaly of matter-antimatter.

Half, if not most of this is unrelated but I thought it was interesting:<br><br>If antimatter had negative mass then when you tried to push a positron into a container with a positively charged plate, it wouldn&#39;t work. This is because of f=ma, or a=f/m, if you try to repel the positron into said container with a positively charged plate, the negative mass actually makes the acceleration negative as well, so the positron heads <b>towards</b> the plate. As this does not happen, we know they don&#39;t have negative mass.<br><br>Negative masses also still fall in normal gravity, however. f=mg, so the negative mass means the object is pushed by gravity.<br>But again, as a=f/m, the negative mass means this pushing force accelerates the object toward the positive mass.<br>So the reason for antimatter falling upward wouldn&#39;t be negative mass, but some other property.<br><br>As far as I can tell, negative mass must be impossible. This is because while positive masses attract negative ones, negative masses repel positive ones. The pushing force exerted by the positive mass on the negative one must, by Newton&#39;s laws, mean that the negative mass exerts a pushing force of equal magnitude on the positive mass. As its mass is positive, it is indeed repelled.<br><br>So we have an object being repelled by another object, which is itself being attracted to the first. They will follow each other, accelerating ad infinitum. Now let&#39;s attach this system to the end of a pole, with a generator in the middle. Infinite free energy as the two follow each other in a loop, turning the generator to produce energy. Infinite free energy is of course impossible as per the laws of thermodynamics, and so negative mass must be too.<br><br>I could be wrong, so look it up if you&#39;re interested.", "comment_date": "2019-11-14T19:58:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T", "comment_text": "What does 2700 trillion dollars every mean?
