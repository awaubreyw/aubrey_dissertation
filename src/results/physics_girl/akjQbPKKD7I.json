I am doing my extended essay in the magnus effect assumed as a parabolic movement to study the force that experiments the ball during a soccer free kick. It is a topic that I am really passionate about, because I really like soccer and physics. The plan was to record the curve of the ball from a drone and analyse the video in the programe tracker, this is very similar to what you did in the video.  Nevertheless, I could not record the videos, and now because of the COVID \u2013 19 and the quarentine that will be extended indifinitely I can not record the videos because I do not have the necessary space nor the drone. I want to know if it was possible that you facilitate me the videos you recorded from the drone of the ball number 1 (soccer ball) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akjQbPKKD7I&amp;t=306s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akjQbPKKD7I&amp;t=306s</a> to advance in my exploration.

Thanks for the video.<br><br>I have been trying to understand how Magnus effect works on &#39;paper flying tubes&#39;- when thrust forward with clockwise spin from throwers point of view, it gets lift as well as lateral turn, ofyen to left and sometimes to right. I cant figure out how the forward going spinning tube deflects air to get such a trajectory.

It has a raised seem dividing it into two hemispheres. I guess the rubber band on the shiny ball has a similar effect. Cricketers shine one side and let the other get rough. That way you can get it to curve either way depending on which way up you hold it and how fast you get it to spin. You can also effect the flight of the ball if you spin it round a horizontal axis. This is also used by baseball pitchers to make the ball stay up or dip depending on which way it is spun. I&#39;ve read some interesting Ph.

Why does the increase in the velocity of the air on the bottom change the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent? Even at a higher velocity, the ball is still smooth, and velocity is only relative, isn&#39;t it? Especially when viewed in light of all the possible velocities available in the universe, from infinitely slow (you can always be slower, I think - it&#39;s like the object that moves half the distance to its goal with every step, and so it will never get there; so you can always cut your speed in half and never stop) to the speed of light, potentially. The relationship between the velocities of both sides of the ball is virtually nothing. Or the same for the water? Why is it laminar at a lower volume than a higher as it leaves the faucet? Don&#39;t all forces increase or decrease evenly (Not sure I worded that right)? For example: Why does traffic on the freeway, assuming no bottlenecks on the freeway such as decreasing numbers of lanes or intersections, slow to a crawl when there is more of it? It&#39;s obviously drivers behaving differently in terms of speed, changing lanes etc, each with their own mind as they make decisions. Theoretically bumper to bumper traffic could travel at hundreds of miles per hour or more if every driver is going the exact same speed - no turbulence. But the air molecules don&#39;t have minds, they just all behave the same way.<br><br>Diana, It would be cool if you presented that as a topic for an upcoming video.", "comment_date": "2016-06-12T22:18:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raffy Sonata", "comment_text": "How does bouncy ball have boundary layer?", "comment_date": "2016-06-11T01:31:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miloslav \u010c\u00ed\u017e", "comment_text": "I see a super hot girl, my expectations for a quality video drop... the more I was surprised about how great the video actually was, awesome job.", "comment_date": "2016-06-10T11:17:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "San Samman", "comment_text": "I will unsub to you i dont like your vids ...", "comment_date": "2016-06-10T07:31:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diamonddrake", "comment_text": "Okay, you said &quot;scientists consider gases to be fluids&quot; in a very apprehensive way.

I don&#39;t really think that is correct and here is an example of why; an airfoil. <br><br>The principle as you see which causes the ball to turn is the same which gives an airfoil lift, which is a pressure differential caused by the curvature of the ball and the fluid flowing over it&#39;s surface. This causes a lower static pressure on the top side than the bottom which causes the ball to curve. The pressure differential itself is caused due to the dynamic pressure at the top of the ball to be higher than the bottom which then causes the static pressure at the top of the ball to be lower than the bottom where static pressure is the main cause of the direction change of the ball since that is the only macroscopic force (with enough magnitude to impact the trajectory) that acts perpendicular to the ball&#39;s surface (where dynamic pressure acts parallel to the surface of the ball in this case, think of the ram effect in ramjets as an analogy). Also, it makes sense that the dynamic pressure at the top would be higher since along a streamline, the particles would experience a greater positive acceleration due to the curvature of the ball which causes a larger velocity. (also an Aerospace student here :-) woot woot!!! )<br><br>Also, for the smooth bouncy ball, I can&#39;t say I agree with the explanation once again because we can&#39;t visually confirm the direction in which the ball spins.

Just because you hit the ball the same way doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that it will spin and therefore react the same way! I hope you try this out!!! :)<br><br>Btw, my above explanation can also be used to explain why top-spin in tennis makes a ball curve downwards or putting a back-spin on a tennis ball will make it travel farther since once again, it&#39;s the same train of logic with dynamic/static change while stagnation pressure remains constant<br><br>I don&#39;t see how the air particles would impart their momentum on the ball and cause the ball to turn, even when using a control volume analysis.", "comment_date": "2016-05-25T02:38:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sergio Guzman", "comment_text": "Make a video about knuckle ball!", "comment_date": "2016-05-25T02:32:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tubester4567", "comment_text": "This effect is used in cricket too.
