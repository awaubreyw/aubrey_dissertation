Let&#39;s say the rocket is massive and the gas being ejected are not of sufficient velocity to apply a force necessary to overcome the force of gravity. So all you&#39;ve done is to reduce the contact force of the rocket with the ground, but the rocket would not launch and hence it&#39;s vertical velocity would still be zero and its momentum would still be zero. The issue as I see it is that you don&#39;t have a closed and isolated system and thus the conservation of momentum would not apply.

I contend that more energy is required to accelerate to 60 than is required to slow the vehicle to 0.

Actually, momentum is dealing with mass, and the relative difference in the direction of travel that is taking place within space-time.  If you start by looking at motion in its simplest form, the rest are mere details.  For starters, every object that exists within the 4D environment known as space-time, is in motion, and the magnitude of that motion is exactly the same as the magnitude of motion that photons of light have as they move across space. In turn, all that can be changed, is the direction of travel that takes place within the 4D space-time environment.  Let&#39;s call that magnitude of motion, &quot;c&quot;.  So your car, for instance, is currently in motion with the magnitude being the &quot;c&quot; magnitude of motion. Unlike light however, a percentage of that motion is across the dimension of time, and the remainder is across space. If your car was truly at rest in space in the space-time environment, its entire motion would be across the dimension of time.  Anyhow, if you make a simple geometric representation of this ongoing &quot;c&quot; motion of an object, you will immediately see the cause of the Special Relativity(SR) phenomena, and you can also use it to derive the SR mathematical equations, including deriving the Lorentz transformation equations, and you can complete this simple task in mere minutes.", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T06:25:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J Bielic", "comment_text": "You&#39;re getting pretty good at catching.", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T03:53:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hod sinay", "comment_text": "you have said around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CRhdbDkwXM&amp;t=19m23s\">19:23</a> that the sand stops, but it realy shouldn&#39;t stop, because we are at a no friction land surface.<br>of course part of the sand will slow down or speed up because of in-sand friction, but the overall sand momentom will not decrease, therefore the speed of the train in relation to the earth will stay constant.
