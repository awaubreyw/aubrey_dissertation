That means life in a bunker underground.   Any time you go outside it is like stepping into the remains of an old nuclear war or living in a uranium mine area...outside the actual orebody.<br><br>The skies are &quot;hot&quot; in a radiometric sense.  The &quot;hot&quot; charged particles would age you and probably would eventually make inhabitants sick many different ways. <br><br>So....here are a few Q/A&#39;s from NASA work...see references below.  The Problems are lifted from the NASA work and clarified a bit.<br><br>Problem 2 - By what factor is the average Dose in space during the cruise to Mars<br><br>greater than the ground-level Dose rate on the surface of Mars?\r<br>Answer: About 415/215 = 1.9 times higher in space...(almost 2x).<br><br>That means living on the surface of mars is a bit safer...roughly two times safer than space. . <br><br>Problem 5 - If an astronaut remained on Earth, the normal background radiation dose\r<br>rate is 3 milliSieverts/year. How many equivalent years of normal Earth exposure\r<br>would a single trip to Mars produce?<br>\r<br>Answer: you get 0.88 Sieverts cumulative space dose and staying-on-mars dose over the 960 day trip = 338 milliSieverts/year. So it equals 338/3 = 112 years!<br><br>In that same time...if you stayed on earth the whole 960 days of trip time you would have gotten...of course, 2-3 years of earth dose instead of 112 years of radiation exposure from a normal space/mars round trip dose rate.<br><br>But what about just living on Mars like a homesteader?   Using the NASA numbers....<br><br>Walking around on mars gives you 0.7 mSv/day and over the course of 365 days (an earth year) we get :   365days/year  x 0.7mSv/day = 255 mSv per year (on Mars).  On earth we expect to get 3 mSv per year.  (millisieverts) <br><br>255/3 = 85   Living on Mars is 85x earth dosage using the NASA numbers<br><br>These are very general estimates...but<br><br>If I walked around earth with say a gamma ray meter (a scintillometer) and found an area that was 85x normal...I would know I was in a &quot;hot&quot; area.  I would start hunting around in cracks and crevices for hot spots to test for uraniferous material.  10x is nothing but 100x is worth looking at if you were hunting for radioactive material here on earth.  Really hot uraniferous ore grade material is 10,000x and pegs the meter.<br><br>It would not necessarily be dangerous at least crudely if your 85x came just from gamma ray type sources but it would be kind of &quot;hot&quot;.  There would be radiation that is worse than gamma, it is cosmic energy coming from star bursts etc. so the radiation exposure on mars is worse than 85x.

Also: the surface contains a chemicals called perchlorate and hydrogen peroxide - not in very high concentrations. But they effectively make UV light 10 times as deadly. Anything you would plant (even it didn&#39;t die from frost) would be killed by the ground. Eating it would poison yourself. No water. Poisons soils.  Very low atmosphere and no oxygen . Deadly cold.

At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_lhfFKF-G0&amp;t=4m34s\">4:34</a> your friend says that Mars doesn&#39;t have a moon like Earth to stabilize it. But Mars has 2 Moons Phobos and Deimos. They may be smaller and irregular shaped than earths moon, but Mars is also about 1/2 the size of earth. Both of Mars moons orbit much closer than Earths moon with Phobos, the larger of the two being the closest. I would imagine that the gravitational pull of the two moons of Mars might have a grater effect or about the same as Earths moon has on the Earth.<br>Also with the liquid core of the earth compared to Mars not having one. I can see where that could produce the magnetic field that Earth has and the reason for the reversing of that field. But back when I was a kid in school, the scientists were saying that Earths liquid core was the reason for a planets sustained rotation. But that must not be true as Mars and several other planets that are known not to have a liquid core also rotate on it&#39;s axis.

These are fine criticisms for someone who for whatever reason felt like we might be able to openly walk around and breathe the open air on Mars&#39; surface.  That is obviously not the case for those many enthusiasts today excited about colonizing Mars.  We know very well that we&#39;ll need habitats and pressure suites.  However, once you accept that, Mars looks pretty good.  <br><br>There are also many great opportunities for a great life in a Martian colony.  Once you accept you need habitats that are air-tight, well insulated, and shielded from radiation, there emerges an opportunity for a growing paradise.  That is a space where you can walk around in your socks and pajamas all day with no worries of mosquitoes or harsh weather to deal with.  Inside the habitat, you will do lots of gardening and cooking, and building tools, furniture, clothes, etc.  You will have greenhouses with indoor waterfalls and pools in which to swim.  You probably grow plants using regolith after heating the water ice out of it and washing it 3 to 5 times to removes the salts and then fertilizing.  But you will also use aquaponics with a near perfectly closed loop of fish adding nutrients to water for the plants.  Algae will clean your water and also,  together with the plants, produce large amounts of oxygen to breathe.  You will use carbon filters to clean the air and fans to circulate it.  You will probably use hydrogen gas for heating and cooking (as it also destroys any CO buildup).  Outside, you&#39;ll have a smelter and foundry for the extremely abundant ore-grade rocks all around (especially iron and nickel).  You will then have a small wire mill for making electrical wires or cables, rollers for making sheet metal.  You will send DC current through red hot metals to form permanent magnets used for electricity generation.  You may build any number of vehicles for exploration and regolith collection outside.  You&#39;d probably use compressed CO2 for energy storage for vehicles and outside tools, as well as water batteries, inside the habitat.  In addition to fish, you&#39;d likely have chickens, crickets, and honey bees.  You&#39;d have personal quarters but also large greenhouses built with tempered glass bricks and/or PVC membranes.  PVC can be mass-produced from chlorine + CO2 in a high-pressure steamed enclosure.  <br><br>One way is to build corrugated steel walls and re-enforced lifted floors and roofs, similar to how shipping containers are made... except add overhanging roofs will regolith over the top to shield the habitat and to allow windows on the sides to look out, without being exposed to the radiation.  One could also melt out a palace in one of Mars&#39; glaciers, using insulative membranes for grow rooms.  Or, find the flow exits to lava tubs and build inside there.  You could use inflatable walls to seal off two ends, spray hot plastic on the rock walls to ensure an air-tight seal, and build whatever you want in there....  Mirrors can be used to direct larger amounts of sunlight in through special corridors or through fiber optics cabling.", "comment_date": "2022-02-21T18:29:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shiladitya Biswas", "comment_text": "Now I know where Veritasium gets all his crazy Science ideas from.", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T01:15:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ed19601", "comment_text": "being a planetary geologist, specialized in mars, is no doubt interesting, but it seems like a totally useless  occupation.

Volcanos of that size eject a LOT, and for a planet the size of Mars, it shouldnt surprise anyone that if the core was ejected thru volcanism, it eventually lost all of its heat and source material from within.<br>This would explain why Mars once had lots of water on the surface, and now has an abundance of iron oxide and dust, as well as explain the magnetic signatures of ancient rocks discovered and thrown to Earth.", "comment_date": "2021-05-14T03:39:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tyrind", "comment_text": "So what is suppose to come out of a Mar&#39;s volcano if Mar&#39;s doesn&#39;t have a molten core?", "comment_date": "2021-05-14T00:40:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bavani Sankar", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sure Physics Girl would spawn a lot of young Sheldons who would worship her and want to be like her.", "comment_date": "2021-05-14T00:09:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Black intoDeep", "comment_text": "Raquel...\ud83e\udd70 wow super fine and smart.

Humans are walking ecosystems containing tens of thousands of different bacteria and viruses. We live in balance with these organisms because they&#39;ve evolved with us. But creating a reproduction of this ecosystem may be hard to achieve; also mutation rates would likely be increased by radiation exposure. What we do know is that keeping the ISS clean and healthy has proven quite problematic because the ecosystem is so hard to balance. Mars lacks not only a magnetosphere but also a ozone layer; this combined with the thin atmosphere contributes to making radiation a major issue. Coupled to that, the sun periodically flares; potentially wreaking havoc on a Martian colony. A word about radiation.

A power source that will not go away at random times will be good. nuclear is being used on the newest rover as it will not suddenly just stop working. The thing is due to the lower pressure on Mars and the lack of stuff we know can be used for nuclear energy that energy material will have to come from Earth or Venus.

Even if there are hydrocarbons available on Mars (which is not at all dependent on life - see the lakes of hydrocarbons on the surface of Titan and quantities of methane present in various atmospheres in the solar system), the problem is that the available atmosphere is not suitable for combustion of such fuels. With the low availability of atmospheric oxygen, it would be folly to use imported or chemically generated oxygen to combust hydrocarbons, when that oxygen is desperately needed for other purposes (like creating an artificial earth atmosphere for Martian residents and visitors). It would also require enormous energy to release oxygen from Mars&#39;s oxygen-rich minerals.<br>The only source of energy that would reliably produce energy for Mars exploration would be nuclear. That would mean the importing of nuclear fuels that have a sufficient density of available energy to make their importation worthwhile.

There, Earthlings will experience near Earth gravity as they speed around the planet every four Earth days with the Venusian wind. Colonists at 50 Km altitude would not require much protective clothing against the somewhat acidic atmosphere of mostly CO2. <br><br>A Venusian colony would be an ideal place for human enterprises that could go horribly wrong.

Without our moon, life would not exist here. the gravity of mars and the lack of a magnetic field makes it almost impossible for Mars to hold onto the lightest elements causing it to loose Oxygen and Hydrogen which of course are the building blocks of water.

Especially with no water around there wouldn&#39;t be anything to stagnate Radioactive decay through phases. Here on Earth in France there are caves that go through periods like this. They warm up, melt snow and ice and then stagnate due to the water filling the caves. At least, as I recall. It was in a Science video I had watched years ago. But, the point here is that Mars would need to have liquid water to impede the decay rate. Otherwise it would run its course, cook off and then finally end. This may have been what fueled Mars early volcanic life. But with no tektonic system there isn&#39;t any continuous friction and pressure change. If the core of the planet goes solid. That is the point that the planet will begin a continual temperature loss. It will either need to take in more heat than it loses or it will degrade permanently.

To truly Terraform Mars, we would have do some pretty horrific things to it.  Planetary bombardment  by asteroids from the asteroid belt is what I remember someone suggesting.  This would accomplish several things. It would introduce new metals to the planet, it would increase the mass=gravity to help prevent the loss of gases, trigger a global upheaval and disruption of the surface of the planet&#39;s surface.  Volcanic activity might ensue which could lead to greenhouse gas event. The disruption of the surface would allow the new material to sink to the planet&#39;s core. With a new increase in mass, then pressure might be sufficient to remolt the cold core and allow a reformation of a magnetic field.

Since we need the iron anyway to build there, we can release the oxygen into the atmosphere. Another bit source of oxygen is water on mars. We would not have to get the atmosphere as thick as here on earth. Here on earth only 2\u00b41% or the atmosphere is oxgen. So if we had 1/5 of the pressure we have on earth, but it is almost pure oxygen, we would  still need some kinds of suit because of the low pressure, but it can simply filter oxygen from the air. That at lest makes working longterm on mars possible. Last but not least we could live in pressurized habitats.

So your basic structural elements like walls, floors, windows, supports, and balloons could be made in situ, anything else like metals would have to be shipped in. That is unless you can develop mining and refining equipment that operates at 450 degrees. unlike Mars; Venus has a generous atmosphere and you won&#39;t get zapped by deadly radiation. And i would take a 60C(140F) sky city over the dark and brutally cold Titan. It goes to show how important aiming for interstellar travel is. It would be nice to have more than one planet that has both an atmosphere and a temperature that our technology can easily operate(and you know, support life). EG temperatures warmer than -100C and cooler than 100C. Mars meets that temperature criteria but it lacks any real atmosphere, basically larger version of the moon. Venus sky city is probably the only place other than earth where you can have windows in your Apartment and natural sunlight shining in. Pretty much the rest has you fully enclosed in many feet of radiation shielding. Though with enough power one could look at earth for clues on how to shield from radiation. A strong enough magnetic field to protect the crew and residents of a ship, colony, or station", "comment_date": "2019-09-13T05:09:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bassem B.", "comment_text": "I see that pun in the end card.

With Starship or the much bigger Starhip 2 that may follow we would easily get a gigawatt  reactor up there. It doesnt need much shielding, just bury it in the ground deep enough, like in lava tubes or place it at the wall of the  craters. Use explosives to collapse the crater walls above it so its buried and shielded. It just has to be strong enough to withstand the rocks falling on it. <br><br><br>Use multiple of these on the crater walls, and shield the whole thing agains cosmic rays and charged particles. And you may even create a plasma cieling to trap a high pressure (1 bar) earth like athmosphere in there. <br>Span wires over the crater, create a mesh. Use sufficient power that any gas coming near this mesh gets ionized.
