So you have a low (or lower, it still needs to be fairly high to discharge at all) voltage low current discharge that happens relatively slowly. Your demo actually shows this quite well, the discharge is much faster (higher current) when it is metal to metal than when you put a piece of meat in between, which has a much higher resistance.<br>There is also a very limited amount of total charge released, so the amount of energy actually being transferred is very low.", "comment_date": "2019-10-12T06:25:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ThatRandomGuy", "comment_text": "Struck not stuck \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-10-10T03:48:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Princess Buttercup", "comment_text": "You look so much like your dad.", "comment_date": "2019-10-08T14:37:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Opstad", "comment_text": "Cool!<br>But how did he get stuck? ;)", "comment_date": "2019-10-07T00:31:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kwan Lowe", "comment_text": "If you don&#39;t me asking, what profession did your father pursue?", "comment_date": "2019-09-26T23:27:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Subhendu Kumar Mandol", "comment_text": "Very nice conversation.

Your charged bowl apparatus is essentially a capacitor having capacitance in the tens of picofarads.  The shock sustained from discharging it will be of high voltage and high current meaning it actually is quite powerful, which you can see by how bright and loud it was but the duration (and thus the integral energy) is so small that it can&#39;t seriously harm you or your ham.  (BTW, your ham spark was weak because having the ham in contact with the bowl creates a site for corona loss to leak your charge away.  It defeats the purpose of using a bowl at all. Try putting your grounded ham man at the end of the stick and drawing the arc to him instead of from.)
