And since it was God\u2019s Holy Spirit that created the universe, does not seem likely that his spirit is in everything?

He found that in the solar system, about 45 percent of this force is from dark matter and 55 percent is from normal, so-called \u201cbaryonic matter.\u201d This suggests a roughly half-and-half split between the mass of dark matter and normal matter in the solar system. \r<br> \u201cThis is explained by the fact most of dark matter is in the outer parts of our galaxy, far from our solar system.\u201d\r<br>\u201cIf spacecraft move through the dark matter long enough, their trajectories are changed, and this is important to take into consideration for mission planning for certain future missions,\u201d Belbruno said.\r<br>However since the vast majority of dark matter encircles our galaxy like a halo, what do you suppose would happen to a hypothetical space traveler trying to escape the confines of our galaxy.\r<br>Would the gravity asserted by the huge dark matter affect the ship and its passengers? \r<br>As the ship approached the edge of the university would the gravity pull it toward the geographic center of its torus imprisoning it and crushing the passengers?", "comment_date": "2022-04-03T21:42:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Menhennett", "comment_text": "I thought that the analogy at 8.15 was so clear it could be 40 % bird and 60% cake batter. lol", "comment_date": "2022-04-03T20:25:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edward Demedeiros", "comment_text": "Wanting and wishing won&#39;t create anything.

Meaning the orbit gets faster but the gravity is the same, it&#39;s not impossible to have the exact same amount of mass orbiting another mass all at different speeds, meaning it wouldn&#39;t need to run away, it just tags along and continues being part of a system is my thoughts! - Orbits are free falling kinda, now because there is a Mass circling another mass, and lets say nothing to collide with and slow it down, it is possible the Mass that&#39;s orbiting the Mass that&#39;s pulling won&#39;t rip apart as the pulling to begin with is &quot;Uniform&quot; thus it likely can achieve faster speeds just based on this fact alone!", "comment_date": "2022-03-06T14:28:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TRUTH", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23localsun\">#LocalSun</a>", "comment_date": "2022-03-06T10:50:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "A Mara", "comment_text": "I love the way she says <br>&quot;Here s a fun..

Perhaps we have largely evolved to perceive the world through senses (physical sensors) that are easier to perceive, simply because the matter/energy we can perceive happens to resonate sensors comprised of matter (a sensor is performing its function when it is resonated by energy) and since dark matter/energy does not readily resonate much of anything we&#39;re used to perceiving with biological and mechanical sensors it&#39;s working on a longer wavelength where length correlates to dissonance along an axis of higher dimensional space. <br><br>Perhaps the question is; what are these attractors that guide this 95%/5% split of &quot;resonance/dissonance&quot; (regular matter/dark matter and energy), or is there an attraction field that guides a correlation/interaction between some measurable form of dissonance and dark matter/energy correlated to their wavelengths. Perhaps this &quot;attraction field body&quot; serves as a sensor/mechanism that is resonated by dark matter/energy and thus holds the key in finding the correlation between parameters like wavelength/dissonance/space time tuning and emergent organization if the attraction field body is assumed to have a function that correlates to some measured emergent reverse entropy where the input is biased towards entropy/dissonance (dark matter/energy). <br><br>So I think the solution will be discovered using machine learning categorization/clustering. The first step is to find predictive patterns in a dataset of galaxies with and without and varying levels of dark matter/energy, labeling them, and training ML to predict the amount of dark matter/energy of a galaxy based on data from all the available measurable components of a galaxy viewed through all types of telescopes.

If you can&#39;t even comprehend dark matter, then your &quot;evidence&quot; is equivalent to a hypothesis that&#39;s barely supported by the data you can&#39;t crunch. The speed of parts of a galaxy do not point to the existence of dark matter, simply because without being able to observe dark matter, we can&#39;t with any certainty estimate how it affects &quot;normal&quot; matter, if even at all. This is wild speculation I would rank on the same level of &quot;if there&#39;s wind, its evidence of god&quot;. I&#39;m not saying dark matter doesn&#39;t exist. I&#39;m saying that if it DOES exist, it is too far out of our comprehensive reach at this time to do anything but random speculation regarding it. But to be clear, just because a galaxy&#39;s edges behave different than you&#39;d expect, or anything for that matter, doesn&#39;t mean you populate the theory with an unsupported idea. Now, based on what science says about what they believe dark matter to be, it appears to act almost like a liquid, which would tend to evenly distribute throughout the universe, similar to the water in the ocean. Currents here and there, different densities, etc etc, which would make it difficult for galaxies floating in the same &quot;dark matter soup&quot; as everything else to be absent of the soup within which they reside. Let me be blunt. Science is tripping over their shoelaces over conventional physics and quantum physics, and our &quot;solar system&quot; deep understanding of gravity. Tripping over our shoelaces means we don&#39;t fully understand what&#39;s right in front of our faces, and this, my friends, is clue number one as to why you have no  comprehension of dark matter. There are scientists that dispute the properties of electrons and protons. So let&#39;s work out the kinks of our local understanding before we try to dip our toes into the intergalactic composition of the universe, shall we?

If they were the mass of a large planet, rather than a star, then their individual impact of stellar motion would be less, so you might not be able to measure the effect on stellar motion so easily, but they would be spread so widely and there would be so many of them, that you would likely have quite a few in the solar system, which would cause measureable effects on the <b>planetary</b> motion. This last point is only hypothetical, ie it is possible, that there are lots, but that there just happens to be very few  in our vicinity of our solar system, although that seems pretty unlikely to me. The most likely candidate then, is that the biggest they can be is the sort of size that would not cause any noticable effect on planetary motion. Of course, the less massive they are, the more of them that you need, which is why the most widely accepted candidate would be a weakly interacting massive particle, ie, a heavy particle, that does not interact with anything, except gravitaionally. This means that they can be travelling quite fast, and are only very weakly bound gravitationally to other objects,  much like other particles, such as photons, and solar wind charged particles that are too light and travelling too fast to be kept captured by stars, so if their velocity were larger than the normal stellar escape velocity, they would pass straight through most stars, but could not utimately escape the gravitational well of the galaxy. This last point is actually quite important, since if they were not travelling that fast, then they to would get trapped by the stellar gravity and you would have a large contribution of Dark matter particles trapped in the centre of stars which would have a noticable effect on stellar evolution which we don&#39;t see.", "comment_date": "2020-12-18T17:26:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neil Williams", "comment_text": "Excellent work Dianna Sophia and Imogen  very well done \ud83d\udc4f", "comment_date": "2020-12-18T15:34:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "frogsframes", "comment_text": "&quot; Testing the Strong Equivalence Principle: Detection of the External Field Effect in Rotationally Supported Galaxies. &quot; Whadja make of them apples Mr Newton?", "comment_date": "2020-12-18T11:27:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HouseClubber75", "comment_text": "What if dark matter are objects in a  parallel universe that can interact with ours gravitationally but not via electromagnetic fields.

And then you have formations of galaxy, stars and planets and also the orbits as all the celestial bodies will move with the vortex motion of ether/dark matter and will be at rest with that vortex motion.", "comment_date": "2020-11-08T11:29:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "celestrio", "comment_text": "Something that I have been wondering, could the reason why we don&#39;t understand many things about our universe,  such as this video&#39;s topic, could it be because we are applying the laws we discovered to all the universe&#39;s laws?

But say a planet like Planet Zeta (made up name ) has it own life but its environment is entirely and vastly different that if a human set foot there, the human will not survive, however,  its native inhabitants would be doing just fine). I&#39;m leaning towards the conclusion that every star system with its parent star and planets has its own set of physics laws that will have our scientists rewrite our science books; some sharing likenesses, somewhat similar,  and something entirely different.

Yes, Vera could be correct, and the solution to what dark matter is may be more complex than we can imagine. In which case we will have genuine difficulty grasping the reality that makes up our experience of this universe. On the other hand, that solution is just as likely to be so simple, as to cause us great consternation wrapping our logical deductive reasoning around it. And all this is, of course, if the original and subsequent observations of stars moving, faster than had been previously predicted, around the edge of our galaxy is correct. Perhaps we don&#39;t see only five percent of the universe. It is possible that this assumption is wrong. No matter how many times we use old math, or new math, to convince ourselves otherwise. It is still possible in 2020 that all we see is all there is. Until we have a unified field theory that is always accurate. (IF we ever have a UFT.) Until then the template through which we seek to understand this universe will be lacking. And unfortunately for the ardent physicists out there I have some disturbing news. Or it will be disturbing, IF you accept it as true. 1) It is entirely possible that the universe is far, far stranger than we can imagine. With some of the Laws of Physics applying themselves in some places and not in others. Without ever having to give an account of themselves as to why they behave so strangely. 2) Each of us may experience some parts of our lives in this universe the same way as other people do. And others amongst us experiencing parts of their lives in an entirely different fashion. 3)The instruments of detection we use may not be designed as we assume. Our senses may not be designed to bring our brains information, from which to come to conclusions and then make decisions. But they may instead be designed to filter too much information out from our still developing and evolving minds. Which brings up another dilemma we must consider. Is the mind the construct of the brain ? Or is the brain merely the temporary residence of the mind ?<br>Take psychic phenomena, the metaphysical, as an example for just a moment. Most people I have met have never experienced a single episode of telepathy or precognition. And the vast majority among them then believe that no such experiences are possible. But I have had several experiances of this nature, and occassionally in anothers good company, so as to give veracity to the phenomena. Until Quantum Mechanics evolved, I found it difficult to explain these incidents in any scientific term. However, I now believe that, not only does quantum entanglement open the door for instantaneous communication across the galaxy. Making possible communication at FTL velocities. (You can stop laughing now.) Anyway quantum entanglement also makes it possible to explain some psychic phenomena, such as clairvoyance. ( Yes, I&#39;ve had those experiences as well. ) The laws of physics that we believe operate on a stellar level, and those that operate on a subatomic level don&#39;t yet agree. But perhaps they are not supposed to, or perhaps they are. Maybe the sages in India are right. And everything is consciousness ? But what is that ? You are in an extraordinary field of research at an extraordinary space in time. You lucky girl. Thank you so much for the show.

He was both an electrical engineer, and an astrophysicist. He applied what he knew of the laws of electrodynamics as laid out by Maxwell, Ampere, and Faraday to what he saw in the cosmos in what are still considered to be &#39;unconventional&#39; ways, one of which was to interpret the rotation of spiral galaxies according to everyday electrodynamic principles. They even named some plasma phenomenon after him (Alfven waves), and he also was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on magnetohydrodynamics, although he later went on to revise his understanding of electrodynamics to essentially revoke his earlier postulates on MHD.<br>Anyway, Alfven noted that the rotation of spiral galaxies behaved like a Faraday disk, or a homopolar motor. Essentially, if you pump an electric current through a plasma,  it will rotate due to the Lorentz Force. Since the galaxy is a big pool of plasma, it whirls due to the Lorentz Force but cannot escape because of the concurrent magnetic field created by the initiating electric current. This would also explain the &#39;how&#39; of spiral galaxies, as well as the &#39;why&#39;.<br>An interesting sidenote to the above is that there is an almost equal amount of visible plasma as there is hypothesized &#39;dark matter/energy/etc&#39;. Simply by considering basic nuclear chemistry and the behavior of dipolar atoms in electromagnetic fields, one is able to explain: the observations of the matter at the edge of galaxies and why they do not slingshot away into the void; the bipolar geometry of stellar systems/galaxies/galactic clusters/etc; the axial alignment of visible galaxies; magnetic fields at all scales of observation in the cosmos; high frequency emissions of cosmic objects of all scales. The list really does go on and on...<br><br>The list really does go on an on and on. Just as Hannes Alfven, who is known as the Father of Plasma Cosmology, applied his knowledge of electrodynamics and the behaviors of plasma to astrophysics, I would encourage anyone interested in astronomy and astrophysics to consider taking a course in either Nuclear Chemistry or even just Basic Electricity.

And he told where to look for it, the bending of light in a gravitational field. On May 19, 1919 astronomer Arthur Eddington took a photograph of a constellation that lined up behind the Sun during a solar eclipse, and it confirmed Einstein&#39;s prediction of light bending in a gravitational field. The background star images moved away from the Sun as if you were viewing the constellation through a huge positive lens. Einstein described the mechanics of this observation by imagining a series of elevators rising from the Sun\u2019s surface; light enters the elevator at a higher level on the far side, and then it exits at a lower level on the side closest to us. As light traverses elevator after elevator, its path bends so that the star\u2019s images appear to be at a greater angle away from the Sun (\u201cThe Evolution of Physics\u201d \u00a9 1938 by Albert Einstein and Leopold Infeld page 220.)\r<br>\r<br>Mass slows time which alters the distance matter can travel in comparison to less mass areas. Elements can be identified by the light they radiate due to the unique number and position of electrons in their electron energy-shell levels where photons are absorbed and emitted, resulting in dark spectral lines distinguishing each element. Using these spectral lines as light-wave-length markers; light-waves red-shift for each element when coming from a massive star, this means that light from specific elements travels farther in comparable length when coming from the slower time-rhythm with fewer seconds compared to the surroundings of a massive star. The fabric of space stretches as illustrated in gravitational embedding diagrams toward the center of mass allowing light and matter to move farther/faster using less energy toward the comparatively slower time-rhythm. Gravity is a change in uniform motion which is why heavier objects fall at the same rate that lighter ones do, the elevator is moving at a set rate and all objects are moving to the floor at that set velocity.\r<br>\r<br>When you have elevators rising from all gravity sources in a galaxy, mass is traveling in multiple directions at the same time. As does a spinning gyroscope gain kinetic energy to stabilize its axis of spin; acquiring energy by moving in multiple directions at the same time endows mass with more resistance to movement then you would expect when comparing apples to oranges. This is what keeps a rotating galaxy in lockstep when comparing inner to outer orbits.

In practically every current popular theory, be it, String, M, Emergence....name your poison,  the math suggest multiple (number depending on your favourite theory) dimensions which are hard to even contemplate with our 3D minds and as I would imagine, impossible to detect with our 3D instruments. We have no idea if we live in a single universe or a multiverse. If we say we live in a single, inescapable universe and we are seeing particles constantly pop in and out of (our) existence, then they have nowhere to go except to these extra dimensions. This should render them undetectable while there, but still within our universe. For the purpose of simplifying  my question I will now make some unsubstantiated assumptions. If say there are a total of 11 dimensions as some theories suggest and particles are not only popping from &quot;here&quot; to &quot;there&quot; but from say the 5th dimension to the 8th and the10th dimension to the 7th etc...and these particles are roughly evenly distributed through these dimensions would that not make the majority of normal garden variety matter and energy, undetectable at any given time but still contributing its mass and energy to the universe? We believed in and searched for the Higgs boson because of the Higgs Field. Some people are still looking for the legendary Graviton. We say that gravity is weak because reasons blah blah but what if it is incredibly strong but happens to exist in the 6th dimension along with the missing Graviton. So if gravity is so strong that its affects are felt here, all the way from the 6th Dimension and Dark Matter and Dark Energy is all garden variety matter and energy which we cannot perceive because of their current location, Is there even any hope of us understanding the answer much less finding it unless we evolve into inter-dimensional beings?

Some areas of space between galaxy&#39;s have much more gasses, dust and etc. between them than other galaxy&#39;s.  This creates LESS  force of vacuum (Less evidence of dark matter and its observable effects). Other areas of space have very little gas, dust etc and this creates a GREATER force of vacuum (more evidence of dark matter effects).  So it goes like this..if two galaxy&#39;s are separated by 100 light years for example, with very little gas, dust etc between them they will have greater rate of separation (acceleration) away from each other than 2 similar galaxy&#39;s of same mass and distance but with much more gas, dust etc.  because it is less of a vacuum. Dark matter is an unseen force just like gravity in the way it cannot be seen but we clearly can see its effects. The vacuum of space creates a &quot;push&quot; on distant objects. This &quot;push has a quantitative value based on absence of matter. The more matter in a given area of vacuum would equal less &quot;push&quot; created by the vacuum.

The Shaw Prize is much like the Oscars, a self congratulating award for theories which are just that, theories. I digress....Gravity is not the only influence in our universe. You may not get funding if you start out challenging consensus science but sooner or later, you learn consensus is not science and you are open to observe and state your theories. The peer review on this is overwhelming lately. To say &quot;plasma and electricity does exist in the universe but it doesn&#39;t do very much&quot; is like saying lightning doesn&#39;t produce ozone in the upper atmosphere or magnets have minimal attraction to ferrous materials..Have you ever put a magnet to an iron meteorite? Super powerful force! Climate scientists have accepted the global electric circuit as effecting weather. 2 entities refuse to get on board with these scientists findings. I will leave it up to you to figure out who they are. Science is open to all possibilities and we are recreating measurable results in the electric universe.

Those are LOADED MATTER.<br><br>The explanation comes from simple geometry. When the Universe is a hypersphere, there is an extra unaccounted for acceleration: Hypergeometrical Acceleration, which is given by v.c/R_0  where R_0=13.8 GLY, the 4D radius of the Universe.<br><br>Since it is an acceleration and not a force, matter that is traveling on the right velocity at the right distance will be LOADED into the galaxy and be held tenuously by this force. Notice that the velocity is exactly the Hubble Velocity at that given distance. You might object that the Hubble Velocity is a radial velocity (running away from us), but that is because you don&#39;t understand the meaning of angular momentum.<br><br>In my theory I used the Silver Surfer Paradigm to explain motion. On the footprint of each particle is a region of space (Fabric of Space or FS) that can be twisted and slanted (like a surfboard). The normal to that FS defines where the particle will land in the next step of the stepwise expansion of the Universe. Each step is equal to the de Broglie (actually, modified Compton Wavelength) of a hydrogen atom (0.19 femtometer).<br>Not unlike a surfboard, the FS can be slanted forward and twisted around the axis of the surfboard.  <br>Hence a body traveling at velocity v would have an angle of slope alpha such tan(alpha)=v/c<br>Interaction with Gravitation would add a rotation ( around the axis perpendicular to that slope)  to that FS until the body is in orbit.<br>This means that a body in orbit has a velocity that is NOT TANGENTIAL but OUTWARDS RADIAL.  The tangential motion is the result of the rotation angle.<br><br>So, not unlike other galaxies, all objects in orbit are actually running away.

Worth considering, my friends: My first thought while watching this: dark matter is probably better to think of from a different angle, an angle that more closely resembles quantum fields, and considering dark matter not to be actual matter, but an energy that has an effect on it&#39;s surroundings. No matter the scale it is viewed at. Further, you described an idea about how it is possible that gravity behaves with more intensity at a different scale. Instead, it&#39;s possible that dark matter has little to no effect, and simply does not even show itself therefore, except at larger scales, like the scale of several thousand worlds and stars together(matter clusters). In other words, if you are looking for it with people eyes, it cant be found. If there were some being that existed so large that our galaxy could be held in it&#39;s hand, that being could use some kind of device (like an electron scanning microscope but a dmsm) that would print out a scatter plot looking paper that shows where in that galaxy the dark matter is, and how much space and dark matter would be necessary for the dark matter&#39;s effects to enact.  Therefore, dark matter has exactly zero effect on the state of Texas, or even earth, yet the dark matter is found there in several places. But the dark matter that is in Texas, and Indonesia, and in the core of Pluto, and in the photons flying here from the Sun, and in the mountains that are on planets in different systems, and that little bit over there all on it&#39;s lonesome in the vacuum between our galaxy and our nearest relative as a whole have an effect within their matter cluster and that effect centralizes itself in the center of that galaxy cluster and has shells that each display different qualties.

Idk perhaps darkmatter is involved if darkmatter is normal matter but a different time frequency has claim to it.

Time may have a pausing effect beyond the blackholes radius of effect. Then darkmatter kinda clumps up and speeds up the matter do to frequent collisions. Time appears to speed things up closer to the blackhole, but it&#39;s not do to darkmatter as much. I just wanted to get this idea out there so that scientists will study the possibility.<br>Not only do blackholes create time frequencies but they are also the 1st and 2nd dimensions of space. Solid matter appears to pause at the event horizon then maybe it&#39;s because time is moving faster beyond it. I suppose this means we are actually inside of the blackholes radius of effect, we are inside of the blackhole.<br>Which brings me to think other Galaxy&#39;s appear to be paused from this distance.<br>Time speeds up the closer you get to a blackhole and slows down the further we get from a blackhole.<br>Passing beyond the event horizon speeds up your time then passing through the singularity turns you to pure energy before spitting you out onto a different time frequency.

The so called Universal Constant has been more and more shown to be a local phenomenon and totally not uniform.  We are not being honest about our uncertainty in our calculation of gravitational redshifting due to our not being sure about where all the mass was near the photons that traveled to our detectors on their billions of years journeys.  Currently it is standard to hand wave in an assumed negligible value for these mass effects.

The gravitational attraction with distance would look something like a roller coaster.  At first glance, it would appear that this suggestion literally as stated,  contradicts our observations of the red shift, but actually it does not.  It is too complicated to explain why at this time.  This a suggestion, and I am not dogmatic about it.

Laboratory experiments looking at the interactions of very small plasma filaments have produced, in miniature, every single rotational pattern for every single type of galaxy we see in the night sky, with the exact same rate of rotation for both the inner part of the spiral and the outer part, just as we see when we observe galaxies. Gravitation is not the chief mover here, though it is, of course, a factor; but we need to take it into account in due proportion. Electromagnetism is many millions of times stronger than gravitation, and its effects on all manner of celestial bodies has been proven. Gravity is a weak force, and it is even called that in physics, and yet people are giving it the lion&#39;s share of responsibility in the models they formulate to explain how the universe works, while they practically ignore the effects of electromagnetism in this context. One of the things which stochastic electrodynamics predicted is that the rotational axis of every star and galaxy would run parallel to plasma filaments. This prediction has been proven correct. Gravitation based models of cosmology have never predicted this nor do they have they any explanation for it.

What if dark matter travels faster than the speed of light? Imagine a projectile fired from a gun. We can predict where that projectile will be at some future time. Sharpshooters use this prediction to hit a moving target. Now imagine the projectile has a velocity greater than C, call it C+. (We&#39;re breaking Relativity now, but this is just a &quot;what if&quot;.) The projectile would move forwards in space as before, but backwards in time relative to an observer. It would not be like running a video in reverse (back in space and back in time). Instead, the bullet would strike a target before it was fired. If it was a tracer round the observer would be able to watch the bullet from the impacted target back to the weapon that fired it (traveling the distance at a C+ velocity). If dark matter was actually like that we would observe constant unexpected collisions followed by an &quot;oh, it came from there&quot; explanation. But if the faster-than-light high-energy state prevented it from interacting with normal matter and energy, if it simply passed through normal matter and energy, its gravitational effects might be the only evidence that it exists at all - an instantaneous gravitational blip, then nothing to observe. Scientifically, we usually observe an effect, then go about finding the cause. If we&#39;re observing Andromeda&#39;s rotation we are seeing it as it appeared 2.5 million years ago. The associated time-traveling dark matter would be more than 2.5 million light-years away from the observation point 2.5 million years in our past.<br><br><br>This isn&#39;t a theory. This isn&#39;t even a hypothesis. It&#39;s a &quot;what if&quot;. Interestingly, this would mean that most of the matter in the universe would be hurtling back in time to the Big Bang, not away from it. That raises more questions. Where did that mass of future matter/energy come from? Why do we assume our direction in time is &quot;forward&quot;? If dark matter travels faster than light it has a higher energy state than conventional matter. Conceivably, our matter lost energy and &quot;slowed down&quot; until it started traveling &quot;backwards in time&quot;.

Second, I heard one issue realized is in order to create the Higgs boson attempted at CERN is that we would need the equivalent of a collider that would be the size of the outer orbit of Pluto so they can&#39;t create the Higgs boson at CERN.  The third item is very interesting a statement made by the person you questioned at CERN studying dark matter that similar to the possibility of a star collapse creating a black hole is that it is possible dark matter could create a black hole.

Because we don&#39;t know what to look for and help is needed from a theoretical viewpoint. The way forward is to think through the way in which dark matter formed. To do this we have to revise our understanding of galaxy formation. In the Big Bang theory the proposal is that galaxies form by the clumping together of hydrogen, helium and dark matter under gravity and when a clump of hydrogen becomes sufficiently dense the nuclear reaction starts and a star is formed.<br><br><br>Although many simulations have been done to mimic this process, the results don&#39;t quite look like the observations and it doesn&#39;t explain why spiral galaxies are rotating. To solve the dark matter problem we need a complete rethink of the evolution of the universe. One of the serious problems with the Big Bang theory is that it does not conform to the law of conservation of energy.<br><br><br>Suppose that matter formation took place over an extended period of time when the universe had already been in existence for billions of years. A finite spherical region of space with no curvature in the radial direction but with curvature in the circumference direction is expanding and this releases energy as the tension in the fabric of spacetime increases due to the expansion. When the tension reaches a critical level the energy is released and a galaxy forms.<br><br><br>It is this galaxy formation process which creates intense bursts of gamma radiation and some of the energy released from the fabric of spacetime condenses into neutrons. Some of these neutrons immediately bond together because their axis of spin is in line (neutron groups) while single neutrons decay into protons and electrons and then form hydrogen. These neutron groups are what we have observed as dark matter. So now we have a cloud of hydrogen and dark matter which has formed as a spherical region in an isolated location in space. This is how the universe looks - a set of isolated galaxies in locations which form a definite pattern and with no trace of any residual gas cloud or connecting filaments.<br><br><br>Now we know what to look for as dark matter, namely neutron groups, we realise that we have already created dark matter in the lab. When experiments are performed in the lab to measure the decay of a neutron by two methods (bottle and beam) the experiments give different results. This is because under certain experimental conditions the neutrons will bond together and therefore not decay.<br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/5009126/The_evolution_of_the_universe\">https://www.academia.edu/5009126/The_evolution_of_the_universe</a><br><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/5038836/The_Unification_of_Physics\">https://www.academia.edu/5038836/The_Unification_of_Physics</a><br><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/5927513/The_Spacetime_Wave_Theory\">https://www.academia.edu/5927513/The_Spacetime_Wave_Theory</a><br><br><br>Richard", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T07:28:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "12345 678910", "comment_text": "no titles", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T07:19:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathaniel Toms", "comment_text": "Dark matter is a funding source.

What I find intriguing about it is that it can explain galaxy rotations without adding dark matter or without arbitrarily adjusting variables to match observation.  Mike McCulloch just uses the the hubble diameter at the time the light left the galaxy, the speed of light, and the visible mass and it checks out.

This just sounds like electrical charges and currents that are moving on the scale of light years.

The reason that the edge of our galaxy whips around at such a higher speed than the center is because you are looking at an electrical current that is whipping around the point charge at the center of the galaxy.   And yes - these electrical currents do stretch for hundreds of thousands of light years.   Just look at some of the spiral arms - they even look like electrical filaments.   The simplest analogy - a galaxy is a huuge example of ball lightning.   With some gravity thrown in.   While most MS scientists view the galaxy as opposite.   A huge amount of gravity with some electricity thrown in.   This is why they need to come up with 95% of the universe being undetectable dark matter to make such a ridiculous theory work.

In some galaxies, it&#39;s the result of wrong measurements due to stars getting temporarily pushed along by galaxy arms or out of the galaxy during a collision of two galaxies, with us being at the right time and angle to see it without the correct context or the usual averaging out. And in a few galaxies, it might even be interstellar civilisations clouding their stars from our view with lots of solar panels or such. I&#39;m also not sure whether current simulations account for the effect galactic arms have - not only the slowing down or speeding up when getting in and out of one, but also their gravity making them add to the pull from the center. Another possible effect might be from dust moving into the galaxy and &quot;pressing&quot; stars closer to the center, causing a rapid increase in spin.

Coupling gravity being the way that massive bodies in a locality of other massive bodies will couple together gravitationally tending slightly towards equilibrium.  Giving somewhat of a dampening effect as bodies in each direction provide balancing of the curvature of spacetime.  That curvature of spacetime is where gravity emerges, as GR tells us, and is not a force by the typical definition of a force.  The coupling of gravity in a sea of massive bodies leads to an edge where massive bodies tends to tapper to be a shore.  The coupling effect is one sided at the shore.  That steep gradient leads to a compounding effect.  The curved spacetime keeps the outer bodies moving at faster speeds.  This effect may be greater for disk galaxies than for elliptical galaxies, as coupling may maintain its effects through curvature of spacetime with a strong 3D shape while a shape approaching 2D does not have as much dampening, lending the edges of the disk galaxy to increasing compound-like gravity.", "comment_date": "2019-12-08T12:53:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fractal_Mind", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a girl and I like science, I&#39;m not funny, but I am hot.<br><br>YouTube algorithm : \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d 1mil subs NOW", "comment_date": "2019-12-08T12:48:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Valdagast", "comment_text": "Clearly this is because the universe is 6000 years old.", "comment_date": "2019-12-08T12:47:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Tabor", "comment_text": "Anyone who can relate the universe to cake batter has my vote.", "comment_date": "2019-12-08T12:42:23Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "jormalepik1", "comment_text": "We dont know what dark matter really is but we have calculated how much and where is exists.

For a star to reach the escape velocity it has to accelerate beyond the effects of gravity, not travel fast enough. There is a difference. Measure the star&#39;s acceleration to determine if it is fast enough to escape the galaxy&#39;s gravity. <br><br>The image of M87* made by EHT is CGI. It&#39;s based on the predictions made by general relativity. The image transitioning from the black hole to the rest of the actual data clearly shows it is CGI. The colors do not even match up, whoops! Clearly CGI. <br><br>Gravity is not the only explanation for the movement of stars so far away from the galaxy&#39;s core. There is another way to move stars through the vacuum of space. Currents of electricity,  movement of magnetic fields, even particles move and follow along EM field lines. So why wouldn&#39;t stars? Gravity is not the only force able to move mass through the vacuum of space! Besides, they are using general relativity to explain the movement of stars and the theory is only able to explain the movement of a few stars. The movement of our own sun as it orbits the galaxy&#39;s core cannot be explained using general relativity. Bet you didn&#39;t know that? <br><br>Our sun moves at about 500,000 mi/h as it orbits the Milky Way&#39;s core.  According to GR it should only be traveling at about 1 mi/h. The nearest star is over 4 light years away and doesn&#39;t have enough mass to produce any affect at all. The moon&#39;s gravity has more of an affect on the sun&#39;s movement than the nearest star does. So what is causing our sun to travel at such a high velocity? Because it cannot be explained by general relativity. <br><br>I understand gravity and can easily rule out missing gravity or mass as the cause of our sun&#39;s movement. Dark matter can easily be ruled out as a cause. For instance. If dark matter were real then the only force being applied to regular matter was gravity. This would mean that all mass would be pulled towards it at the same rate without regards to the weight of the mass, just as the acceleration rate for mass is 9.8 m/s\u00b2, without regards to the weight of mass of the smaller object. A bowling ball falls at the same rate as a feather in the vacuum of space. Proven in experiments. This means the small planets orbiting the sun would experience the same acceleration rate as our sun. And because the planets would be closer to dark matter than our sun each would have irregular orbits around the sun, increasing in velocity as each got further away from the sun between every orbit. And this does not occur! The internet claims that the planets are too small to feel any effect from dark matter and I say wrong. The weight or mass of the smaller objects does not matter. Gravity causes a bowling ball and feather to fall at the same rate! So distance should make a difference with the planets and other objects in our solar system inching closer and closer to so called missing mass. Yet it does not! No change in their velocity when they get closer to dark matter, which astrophysicists claim to be located just beyond our visible galaxy. <br><br>If I&#39;m right about the action causing the movement of stars and galaxies then the acceleration rate of a star or galaxy should be the same. We should find a universal acceleration rate for stars and galaxies. The velocity of a star or galaxy is not determined by the mass of the object and how far away it is to the largest mass but instead by how old it is. The older the star or galaxy the faster they should be moving. Stars and galaxies that spew million mile per hour solar winds (energy) should all accelerate slowly at a constant rate over time and all follow the same magnetic field. A specific universal acceleration rate needs to occur to every star and galaxy. I proposed if each of their acceleration rates were the same then it would be evidence to support this bold hypothesis. We can simply deduce what that acceleration rate would be by taking the age of any star, say our own sun and dividing it by it&#39;s velocity. t/v. Real simple math.<br><br>The sun is about 5 billion years old, (+/- 500 million years) and is traveling about 500,000 mi/h (+/- 50,000 mi/h). The acceleration rate comes out to be about a 1 mi/h increase every 10,000 years. Like I said, if this acceleration rate is universal then the acceleration rate for our Milky Way galaxy should be the same as our sun&#39;s. Our Milky Way is said to be 13.7 billion years old (+/- 500 million years) and is traveling about 1.37 million mi/h (+/- 50,000 mi/h) towards what they call The Great Attractor. Take 13.7 billion and divide it by 1.37 million and the acceleration rate is a 1 mi/h increase every 10,000 years. I then went on and measured some of the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and got the same acceleration rate, a 1 mi/h increase every 10,000 years! Thus showing more scientific data that fits my hypothesis that it is not mass that is missing or gravity but something else that takes time to build.  <br><br>Dark matter is a dead horse. That&#39;s why every time any research is done that dead horse leads to a dead end!<br><br>This hypothesis goes even deeper with many predictions. Like the oldest stars should be found furthest from the galaxy&#39;s core. Same with dwarf galaxies. The oldest stars should be found furthest from its core. This changes everything even how galaxies form over time, not from the outside in. instead from the inside out. The youngest stars should be found near the supermassive black hole in the core. The amount of mass those stars contained would not determine their age only their movement. According to the theory of general relativity their movement should be based on their mass, not by their age. If right then stars gain their velocity slowly over great time. The increase in their velocity can never be measured in our short lifetimes. It would take 10,000 year to gain 1 mi/h thus their velocity would always appear as a constant.", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T22:50:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hans Hoerdemann", "comment_text": "What a bunch of nothing burgers here.", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T22:46:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rozey Bossy", "comment_text": "dark matter= we understand, but actually we understand nothing at all", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T22:45:53Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "PalimpsestProd", "comment_text": "omg I just noticed the joke in the credits box at the end... have those been there all along?", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T22:44:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "abu aumar Alharthy", "comment_text": "And because whenever we rise to space and cannot absorb it, so if we look at ourselves and what is smaller than us, so we cannot absorb the vast voids between matter and the atoms and nuclei inside it, etc. There is also space on top.

Quantum Field Theorly leaves out gravity entirely.  The graviton has never been found.  So why are we so darn sure gravitational force ought to diminish exactly by the square of the distance, that if it doesn&#39;t it ought to imply there&#39;s invisible matter everywhere?  Premature speculation.<br>In fact, it would just be premature speculation if there was a lot of consistency to the observations;  but in fact sometimes the observations appear to contradict dark matter to such an extent that they need to postulate a dark energy being repulsive, and which dark energy we also know nothing about;  and then we go from premature speculation to downright absurdity.<br>Yes, sometimes the outermost stars in galaxies seem to go around the galaxy almost as fast as the more internal stars, as if the galaxy were a solid. But if that was due to more mass being present at or around the center of the galaxy than the black holes there could possibly account for, then we&#39;d observe the innermost stars moving far faster than they ought to as well.  No matter how much mass you assume, stars should move faster if they are closer to the mass, and more slowly if they are farther away.  However, one very common phenomenon observed in spiral galaxies is the &quot;bar&quot;.  Barred galaxies have a radial bar, like a spoke, and then the spiral arms begin from the ends of those spokes.  There is no way to think about stars following gravitational rotations, and yet being more concentrated towards a straight line across the galaxy.  And the same thing was observed in the rings of Saturn, with radial stripes sometimes visible.  I profess no answer to any of these perplexing phenomena;  all I&#39;m saying is that there&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t know and it doesn&#39;t seem to me that inventing dark matter AND dark energy, both undefined, in order to explain why a baseless, centuries-old &quot;law&quot; is not being followed, seems absurd to me.

The link is at the end of this statement.<br>The original theory was built on the Saul Perlmutter, Adam Riess Nobel prize winning paper on Type 1A Supernovae.   However, it seems there might have been an error in the paper that gave them the Nobel Prize.  A new paper was recently published, or &quot;re-published&quot; from 2016 but now again in 2019 which states that the Universe may not be expanding at an &quot;accelerating rate&quot; at all.  Yes the universe is expanding from our point of view due to a doppler red shift because of the relative movement of &quot;our&quot; universe&quot; but this paper has now analyzed over 1000 type 1A Supernovae from all across the sky and has found fault with the 1997 paper of Saul Perlmutter and Adam Reiss. <br>           Could they have been wrong after all?  This newest paper was peer reviewed and published in a very venerable physics journal and has questioned the conclusions of the original 1997 conclusion that the universe is accelerating.  See Sabine Hossenfelder&#39;s recent video for more.  This is an ongoing study which may lead to a retraction that the universe is indeed &quot;accelerating&quot;.  Afterall, dark energy supersede the agreement that energy is forever constant.  In other words, energy and matter were created when the universe first existed and there should be no additional energy added.  It&#39;s as if Fred Hoyle was correct afterall.  That is, the universe is static and energy and matter is constantly added to correct for a stable universe, NOT.<br>            If we believe in Dark Energy, then we must believe that there is some source of an external source of energy that is forcing energy into our universe like somebody blowing air into a balloon.<br>As if there are tiny gas tanks that have valves that are opening to expand our universe at an expanding rate.  There is NO evidence of Dark energy nor Dark Matter.  Thus the question:  Was Saul Perlmutter and Adam Reiss correct?  The new paper asks serious questions, which were peer reviewed.  I predict in a few years, the issue of dark energy and dark matter will be disproven.  Why?  It&#39;s a simple guess based on the latest peer reviewed article.

I dreamed about it when I was six years old, before scientists announced it. I&#39;ve also experienced time dilation and other phenomena. It&#39;s what led me to study qabalah and transpersonal psychology in general. I was looking for answers about what I experienced. A black hole is essentially a torus and like the universe itself, doesn&#39;t really exist. It&#39;s a paradox and related to Bohm&#39;s Implicate Order. Once science pulls its head out of its own collective hubris, they just might figure it out. Science is like a flashlight shining in the dark, seeing this and that but not putting all of the pieces together. Empirical evidence often reverses itself. Another paradox? ;-)", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:30:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gijs wiersema", "comment_text": "Great video!", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:29:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "astro chemistry", "comment_text": "maybe the laws of physics are just wrong o_o jk jk... unless", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:28:15Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Jim Fortune", "comment_text": "I like that she used Siri to confirm her answer, not to give her the answer.", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:26:29Z", "likes_count": 506}, {"comment_by": "\ua9c1\u0f12Duchi\u0f12\ua9c2", "comment_text": "<b>Fun Fact:</b><br>The Big Bang was just Michael Bay directing the Universe", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:24:06Z", "likes_count": 115}, {"comment_by": "Krumple Themal", "comment_text": "Dark matter is just gravitational lag.", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:23:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "God is good", "comment_text": "She is awesome", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:22:18Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Yeetur McBeetur", "comment_text": "I am hoongy <br><br>I must <b>CONSUME</b> all of M I L K Y W A Y giant space bar.", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:22:01Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "\u99ac\u6559\u6388Francisco XIE", "comment_text": "Without me, Milky Way still exist", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:21:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Do you see a floating sandwich?", "comment_text": "Saw that M64 was the background galaxy so I had to click \ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:21:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wanpakudanpu", "comment_text": "Hi", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:20:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "-Not Kev-", "comment_text": "Answer: Milk.", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:20:33Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Cl0p38", "comment_text": "Hello, and happy Merry Physicing!", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:20:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "New Message", "comment_text": "I thought this was gonna be about nougat.", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:20:25Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "noxabellus", "comment_text": "&quot;You&#39;re watching physics, girl.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:20:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "colaGlase", "comment_text": "My brain is happy rn \u2728\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89<br>I feel smarter already \u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:20:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tim Karlowitz", "comment_text": "I am a simple man:<br><br><br><br><br>I see Physics Girl-video, I click", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:19:56Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "ADLG", "comment_text": "Milk", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:19:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Xeridanus", "comment_text": "Not first", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:19:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "sumit saini", "comment_text": "Hii i am from India and here is 3:49 am and there?", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:19:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PandaBear Gaming", "comment_text": "Eyyyyyyy", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:19:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Silva", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udc4b", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:19:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Just Some Bigfoot With Internet Access", "comment_text": "Maybe that&#39;s the milk that dad is getting", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:19:22Z", "likes_count": 21}, {"comment_by": "colaGlase", "comment_text": "Notification squaddd", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:19:20Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Bradley Cox", "comment_text": "Love your vids!!!", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:19:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Your DIY Channel", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd17", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:19:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vijay Jain", "comment_text": "ayyy first", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:18:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kracken", "comment_text": "First", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:18:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hammy 90", "comment_text": "Yo", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T22:18:51Z", "likes_count": 3}]
