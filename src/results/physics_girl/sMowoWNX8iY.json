The valley there is at around 8&#39;900 feet ASL and the launch area at the top of the (typically snow skiing) mountain is 12,200 feet ASL.  If you are healthy and have good oxygen absorption, then flying up to 16,000 feet ASL was no big deal.  Not for most of us, at least.  <br><br>However, on one occasion I climbed out to 20,000 feet ASL.  My medium quality analog hiking altimeter was not properly &quot;pressure compensated&quot; so I thought I was at only 17,999 feet ASL.  17,999 is how high a hang glider can go, legally, in the US.  <br><br>It just happened that a friend, who had the very best equipment (in this case altimeter), later told me that when we flew by each other (about 20 minutes earlier) that we were very close to 18,000 feet.  My altimeter told me I was at around 16,000 feet so I kept climbing - for about another 2,000 feet.  <br><br>Once I got to, what I thought was close to 18,000 feet, I wanted to test myself for hypoxia.  I started by seeing if I could remember the words to a favorite song.  I could, but then I remembered that some people who had strokes could sing but not talk, so was that the best test?  I then decided to simply count down from 10 to 1.  I did it very quickly the first time - because I missed a couple numbers!  I did it a second time and noticed skipping a number.  The third time I went slow and remembered all the numbers, but I also knew that I was suffering from hypoxia.  <br><br>I proceeded to do a steep banked spiral dive for about 4-5 minutes bringing me down maybe 3,000 feet.  I felt better there and ended up having a nice landing a while later.  Once on the ground I asked that friend of mine how high we were when we crossed paths in the sky and he told me we were close to 18,000 feet ASL.  That&#39;s when I realized why I had the symptoms I had and also to not trust my mediocre analog hiking altimeter with HIGH altitude readings!  <br><br>One fellow who I was familiar with didn&#39;t go anywhere near as high but ended up still being hypoxic during landing.  He thought he was touching down when he was 30 feet high.  He came down hard and was knocked unconscious. Luckily he didn&#39;t break any bones.

Humans that live at sea-level to say 3 or 4 thousand feet, are physiologically tuned to that pressure (heart and blood vessels adjusted to that pressure). If you get to 25K feet, you are putting blood vessels at risk (especially in the brain). They will be at risk of bursting and or leaking.

Yes, taking deeper breaths more often will blow off more CO2, but doing that doesn&#39;t mean oxygen will automatically replace it. The reason his oxygen level increased was twofold. One, by forcefully exhaling through pursed lips, you&#39;re opening more alveoli, which are the tiny sacs in the lungs where oxygen and CO2 are exchanged in the blood. Increasing the number of open alveoli allows more gas exchange. Also, by forcing air out through pursed lips, he&#39;s increasing the pressure in his airways at the end of his exhalation. This is called PEEP, or positive end expiratory pressure.  This helps increase blood oxygen levels. Lastly, he&#39;s helping expel residual air in his lungs that normally wouldn&#39;t be expelled during normal breathing, allowing more oxygen rich air to enter his lungs.", "comment_date": "2021-05-16T14:46:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N7NobodyCats", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMowoWNX8iY&amp;t=5m17s\">5:17</a> theres an extra 0 in the &quot;15k&quot; feet.... so rn it says &quot;15,0000&quot; should uhhh maybe check that out lol", "comment_date": "2021-05-16T12:17:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "morphman86", "comment_text": "Blaine has done amazing things with his body in order to pull off his tricks, and I have no doubt that he has pushed the human body to the limit, but even with that, surely some of those claims are bs, right?<br>Like being able to keep O\u00b2 levels at 99 in extreme conditions, when there&#39;s physically not enough oxygen there...<br><br>I&#39;m glad he knows his own limits though, even if he&#39;s keeping those to himself to sound more butch.

Pursed lip exhalation is a common technique used by mountain climbers.  It works because it increases the pressure of air in the lungs allowing more oxygen to enter the blood.  It does not diminish the CO2 in the blood unless you also hyperventilate (breathing more rapidly and/or deeply than normal).  Hyperventilating to lower the amount of CO2 does not create any more &#39;room&#39; for oxygen in the blood - they do not compete for space.  Hyperventilating will only minimally increase the amount of oxygen in your blood.   The technique works to help you hold your breath longer because the primary drive to breath is CO2 build-up, so purging it allows more time before it builds up high enough to make you breathe.  However hyperventilation can be very dangerous because it increases the risk of passing out from hypoxia before the CO2 drive-to-breathe kicks in.  Lowering the CO2 through hyperventilation also increases the pH of the blood.  Although raising the pH does slightly increase the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, it is also thought to be the primary cause of HAPE and HACE and is partly counteracted in mountain climbing by taking diamox.<br><br>He also claimed that Sherpas are &quot;always&quot; fine in the death zone without O2.  Not true, they die there all the time and most of them still use bottled oxygen at the highest elevations.  The people of Nepal have developed genetic adaptions to life at high altitude.

The &quot;death zone&quot; is actually a point where you can survive for a time (depending on how well you&#39;ve acclimated, of course), but your body actually shuts down processes that aren&#39;t immediately necessary to survival -- like digestion -- due to that lack of oxygen.  (You don&#39;t just suddenly stop breathing.  I know you didn&#39;t say that, but I think it may come off that way to some people.)  Climbers making a summit run on Everest typically don&#39;t even try to eat in that region, because your body can&#39;t process it anyway.<br><br>So you don&#39;t die instantly (or in a few minutes), but it&#39;s true that the clock is ticking, and you only have so much time before you need to be back down far enough that your body can resume normal processes.<br><br>For someone in good shape who has trained for it -- i.e., most people attempting to climb Everest -- they typically have several hours they can survive in the death zone, at least as far as oxygen is concerned and as long as other medical problems don&#39;t pop up (e.g., a pulmonary edema or something).  And, as you definitely mentioned, cognitive function is greatly decreased, so that can lead to making bad or downright bizarre decisions, which can also obviously lead to disastrous results.<br><br>As implied in the video and earlier in this comment, the specifics vary from person to person, and even situation to situation.  Factors include: your personal biology, how well you&#39;ve acclimated during that trip, hydration, nutrition leading up to the summit run, how hard you push, clothing, weather, anxiety\u2026 pretty much everything.  Yes, Sherpas tend to be better prepared to deal with that, partially because they&#39;ve lived at higher elevations for many generations, and partially because the ones aiding climbing expeditions tend to have a lot of experience actually doing things at more extreme elevations.  But non-Sherpas have made it to the summit of Everest and back without supplemental oxygen, too; it&#39;s just less common.", "comment_date": "2020-09-07T04:58:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Potato Imaginator", "comment_text": "Physics Girly&#39;s name : Dianna<br>and Princess Dianna of Themyscira = Wonder Women<br>=&gt; Physics Girly == Wonder Woman ??<br>Nuuu ;-;<br>All hail Illuminati", "comment_date": "2020-09-07T03:42:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheAlphaMing", "comment_text": "Thank you for this.", "comment_date": "2020-09-07T03:40:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cory Aguilar", "comment_text": "David prepared his body for years to do this.", "comment_date": "2020-09-07T03:36:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KP Kelly", "comment_text": "I\u2019m about 75% sure he did this, 25% that it was an illusion.", "comment_date": "2020-09-07T03:15:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DIY SAM", "comment_text": "He&#39;s not worthy of your attention.<br>Didn&#39;t someone got to like 140,000 feet a few years back?", "comment_date": "2020-09-07T02:53:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BlueOak1", "comment_text": "Where are those balloons now?!?!", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T22:44:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frank Gulla", "comment_text": "Dianna, a wonderful video.
