Ultimately, yes, these waves are damped by non-restorative frictional forces which turn mechanical energy into heat.

The second bounce should be 1/2 the full distance of the drop and so forth. <br>I noticed that when the tic tac drops from whatever height it is set and does a small bounce, that the energy used for its second bounce is the height of what it could be calculated if it did a normal bounce.

You bring this great wonder, enthusiasm and sly self-awareness to your objective explorations and experiments.  It&#39;s always a better day when you post a new episode!<br><br>As for this topic, the phenomenon can also be clearly seen in american football.  Some punters will put tumble-spin on certain kicks specifically to mess with the other team and &quot;fish for fumbles.&quot;  With the added horizontal energy of a kick, the ball may travel in a shallow trajectory and then high-hop way over the receiver&#39;s head, bounce back towards the kicker, sideways, and so on.", "comment_date": "2018-05-05T00:08:13Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Bryce Ring", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4ySPDvebes&amp;t=4m06s\">4:06</a> How many ex-boyfriends are cowering after that comment?", "comment_date": "2018-05-05T00:06:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Leite", "comment_text": "Lockheed Martin makes weapons and profits from war, oppression and slaughter.

This is just an idea I had while watching this video, please feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong. So according to Heat transfer, heat flows only one way, from a warmer mass to a cooler mass. So, what if the the tic tac hits a warmer surface than the amount of energy it loses as heat so that once it gains its kinetic energy the heat from the warmer surface is transferred to the tic tac instead. What I&#39;m trying to say is that this newly gained heat should restore or maybe even increase the initial amount of energy lost as heat during the first surface impact, therefore once the tic tac starts spinning and hits the surface the reduced translational kinetic energy of just moving in a straight line which in my theoretical scenario instead of losing energy as heat it will gain energy as heat which should increasing  the rotational kinetic energy therefore it will transition into an increased potential rotational energy (faster-rotations/more-rotations) so that once the tic tac unspins by bouncing again such increased rotational energy will be available again allowing the tic tac to go higher than the initial altitude at which the tic tac was drop every single time.

One day, from boredom, I placed my cellphone between the strings and the guitar hole (I don&#39;t know its name ) with the screen facing upwards (I had my guitar over my lap and I was able to look the strings) and the &quot;north&quot; of the phone was aligned with the &quot;north&quot; of the guitar (the head).

I tried putting my phone perpendicular to the strings and it didn&#39;t work.

But this means that our physical reality is made up of discrete amounts of this smallest distance, right? But in mathematics, we can infinitely divide a line into smaller sections.

We label some points of interest, say 0, 1, 2, 3, and pi. Now, this physical line tries to capture/represent these distances.
