You have touched on a subject, that has some controversy surrounding it, in the Audiophile field.   Why do speakers with fairly small magnets driven with a vacuum tube amplifier, produce more bass, than a transistor power amp driving speakers with large magnets and stronger magnetic fields.  At the resonant frequency of the speaker, the speaker cone and voice coil are out of phase by about 90 degrees of the voltage driving them.  Tube amplifiers attempt to supply a current proportional to the input signal voltage, (to the amp),... because the current is maximum when the voltage crosses the zero voltage crossing, and the older style tube amps with coupling transformer, and lower negative feedback, have a lower damping factor, the bass at the resonant frequency comes through fine, even though the speaker exhibits it&#39;s highest resistance at the resonant frequency.  In a  transistor amp where the output voltage tends to follow precisely the input voltage, the 90 degrees out of phase signal at bass resonance to the speaker, provides negative feedback to the speaker, just as the cone is going towards it&#39;s maximum excursion,  and damps the speaker which ceases to be driven, and is beginning to generate a back electromotive force.  In addition, as the Voltage signal from the amp goes to zero, the current also drops to zero so the speakers motion in response also tries to go to zero.  Looking at the phase relationship when the output signal is highest, the mass of the speaker cone and voicecoil, has enough inertia as a whole, at low frequencies such that they are just starting to move, even though the voltage applied to them is at it&#39;s peak.  So even though two amps  (one tube, and the other transistor) may seem to have identical frequency response, and power driving a resistor, the tube amp, when checked with a microphone, will deliver more bass into a fairly resonant speaker, (high &quot;Q&quot;) with identical voltage output (measured with the resistor load).  Transistor amps tend to always deliver the same voltage output as the input, while tube amps also show a loading effect, meaning the output voltage drops under load, and the voltage and current output will increase, (also out of phase) into a highly reactive load,.. this is also partly the result of how hysteresis in an output transformer can release energy, when the signal applied to it crosses through zero after having been driven to the point of &quot;charging&quot; the transformers iron core.  All in all The transistor amp behaves more like singing directly into the PVC pipe (pressure loading), versus singing across it, like it is a flute, which is more the way a vacuum tube amplifier would behave.", "comment_date": "2022-03-28T03:17:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mathew Johnston", "comment_text": "I wonder if you could look at abrasss intrument as to achieve certain notes the length of tube is changed which of course gets a pseed this issue. like a trombone.", "comment_date": "2022-03-25T06:49:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marc Alvarez", "comment_text": "Go to Cycle World and read Kevin Cameron.<br>He is their tech guy, a physicist, i believe, and engineer who has some articles about the history of resonant frequency of 2 and 4 stroke engines and exhausts, and why some racers made power from smaller motors that were tuned to the resonant frequency of their air chambers.<br><br>Seriously, the old guys a genius who just happens to be a &quot;mechanic&quot;.<br>Heres a video of him.<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r53UrV7cKp0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r53UrV7cKp0</a>", "comment_date": "2022-03-22T19:55:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zay", "comment_text": "Ive always noticed this while trying to see like my vocal range or something but I thought I just needed to practice those notes or something?", "comment_date": "2022-03-17T08:22:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The_Doomer", "comment_text": "Too many different &quot;loads&quot; on the vocal cords for me. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T17:24:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Desert Rain", "comment_text": "Loving your videos!!! \ud83d\ude0e", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T04:45:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Santy Clause", "comment_text": "Is this the principle of a noise-cancelling Helmholtz Resonator ie. an exhaust silencer?", "comment_date": "2022-02-04T15:12:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bob M", "comment_text": "I definitely noticed this phenomenon when I was a kid.

You will hear voices having trouble singing a note or two near their personal break.  Often times, we learn to control the break with added tension on our voice.

That cracks arent accually only affected by the natural ressonance but mostly of how the vocal nerve works. Female nerve works in a way that it can send signals to the higher frequences but it doesnt work the same way on a whole scale. That is why on certain points you will experience those cracks, however female voice cracks on the different frequencies than male. Females cant reach lower notes bacause of their voice nerve construction and other ressonance space in their bodies. Males on the other hand thanks to the different nerve, throat and ressonance spaces construction are able to sing lower notes. However higher they sing it is harder to do so.

Well, technically you can have resonance in a tube with two closed ends;  it would act like a dipole.  But anyways, so the vocal cords are like a closed end and the mouth is the open end.  But if we try to sing into a resonant pipe, we are creating a high impedance (closed) end as we place the pipe against our lips, leaving the far end as the low impedance end (open).  But in so doing we are turning our mouth into a high impedance end, whereas it would be the low impedance end, when we are singing. To make things worse, the load is not purely resistive, as it would be if you are trying to sing into a tightly compressed fiberglass-filled pillow, but rather a reactive load that acts like a weight above some frequency, and as a spring below it, which is what a resonant system does.", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T05:59:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Making-a-Mulligan", "comment_text": "is this why some peoples&#39; voices crack during puberty? their vocal tracts&#39; natural frequency is changing and they cant compensate?", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T14:45:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Lorse", "comment_text": "Now you are a real YouTuber", "comment_date": "2019-12-03T09:39:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Particle_Wave", "comment_text": "The same thing happens when playing brass instruments, but with your embouchure (lips) instead of your vocal cords.

A REALLY good saxophone player can force the horn to play in it&#39;s upper octave (double resonant frequency) without opening the octave key by &quot;tuning the vocal track&quot; or shaping the back of their throat. Think of the raspy sound of the sax in &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; (Benny Hill used this tune all the time) That, at least the original recording, is a saxophone playing the upper octave without the use of the octave key. Although a trombone can bend notes mechanically and brass instruments can be forced into double resonance, this &quot;resonant tuning&quot; is more easily achieved with reed instruments where the vibrations of the reed also resonates into the player&#39;s vocal track. Benny Goodman was known for his ability to bend the notes of his clarinet at least two full steps, if not more. The problem is, once you stumble on to this control over the instrument, one can overuse it. Bending notes on a saxophone can be dynamic or it can make it sound like you broke something if you do too much of it.<br>P.S. I&#39;m thinking that the dead zone of the tube, i.e. &quot;the impossible note&quot; is where it shifts into double resonance and the anti-node of the wave (point of maximum amplitude) is located at your vocal cords. This would be like trying to vibrate your spring analogy from the middle of the spring, causing an interference wave (180\u00b0 out off phase) that deadens your vocal chords.", "comment_date": "2019-10-29T10:19:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Bihari", "comment_text": "Why were you holding a tube and thinking about resonant frequencies?<br><br>What were you doing that you became so bored that singing into a tube was more engaging?", "comment_date": "2019-10-29T08:10:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dunkelelf3", "comment_text": "i&#39;m playing didgeridoo i don&#39;t need info on that :D", "comment_date": "2019-10-29T04:46:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Opstad", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t that be the same thing as destructive interference?", "comment_date": "2019-10-28T15:49:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "parker benz", "comment_text": "Just tried this, but it did not happen to me.

Usually amateur singers have a break between the two.  Trained singers can make that break either nonexistent or very small.<br>Here&#39;s the theory: an amateur singer is NOT tuning their vocal tract resonant frequency to the note they are singing.  When they sing lower notes (chest voice), their vocal folds are vibrating slower than the resonant frequency of their vocal tract.  When they sing higher (head voice), their vocal folds are vibrating faster than the resonant frequency of their vocal tract.  They break when their vocal folds are at the same frequency as the vocal tract.<br>There are two strategies a trained singer could use to avoid this break.<br>First, they might change the resonant frequency of their vocal tract dynamically, so that as they switch notes from chest to head voice, they quickly drop the resonant frequency of their vocal tract to avoid getting the two at the same frequency.<br>A different and perhaps superior strategy would require changing both ends of the vocal tract, which will require not just using your mouth to alter the top end but also using your chest muscles to alter the bottom end.  A resonant standing wave in the vocal tract will have nodes -- places where the pressure or velocity amplitude is zero.  If one of those velocity nodes is where the vocal folds are, there is no way to couple energy from the vocal fold into sound.  That&#39;s why you can&#39;t sing the note.  But if you get the zero-pressure maximum-velocity node on top of the vocal fold, you get maximum energy coupling.  I suspect that well trained singers have learned to dynamically alter their vocal tract to line up a max-velocity node on their vocal folds at all notes, eliminating the problem of the break between chest and voice entirely.", "comment_date": "2019-10-05T20:40:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adventures with Frodo", "comment_text": "You contridiced your self.

When you ascend in pitch, there comes a point to where you hop to the next partial, because the tubing prefers to vibrate at some frequencies after others. This is how brass instruments work. It&#39;s very easy to be around the frequencies in the harmonic series, but anything outside of it is very difficult to be able to play. There&#39;s too much to explain with the harmonic series to explain in a comment, though, so just know it is a multiple of the base frequency.<br><br>When a soprano singer changes the shape of their mouth/throat, it causes the overall shape and size to change, resulting in a change in pitch. This would be how they use it to change.<br><br>Next time you sing through a tube, just pay attention as you ascend.

Speaking of tubes I play didgeridoo. If one listens carefully many harmonics can be heard within the primary - what you call natural frequency, also known as the note or key of the didge. If you listen very deeply you realize that the didgeridoo produces an inconceivable number of harmonics (parallel notes) tha seem nearly infinite. Here&#39;s the part you may find interesting: if one sings into the didge whilst playing the drone (primary note) the instrument itself, whether bamboo or PVC, will vibrate in deeply resonant ways and when the sung note is a natural harmonic of the root note - an A didge played while the E note (the 5th) is sung the instrument gets loud at a particular frequency and vibrates at a different &quot;speed&quot; than the primary note. I would much rather demonstrate than describe. Talk to a didge player and ask them to sing different harmonics whilst droning. Animal noises do interesting things as well sung into a didge - I like the Kukaburra sound which I have heard in many native recordings (they probably prefer &quot;the original people&quot; to &quot;the ab-original people&quot;).

Just perusing the comments while I have it paused at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F64xcPKKES8&amp;t=1m35s\">1:35</a>.<br>WHY?! You ask?<br>Here is what I believe is happening, having only taken High School physics, and learning online some pop-science pseudo-physics.<br>The frequency of the sound they are making is causing pressure to build up inside the tube. Lower sounds, like in a didgeridoo, can flow more freely out of the tube because they aren&#39;t bouncing around so fast, which is why it&#39;s easier to make a lower pitch. When you get to the higher pitches, the frequency increases, and pressure builds up to a point where a higher amount of the waves are actually bouncing back into your mouth and into your larynx. When you finally reach the pitch, you&#39;ve reached a &quot;breakeven&quot; point wherein the air molecules are bouncing at a frequency that is the inverse of the pitch you&#39;re trying to produce in larynx, so it comes out muffled.<br><br><br>Since the tube is rather uniformly smooth, the waves are more consistently bouncing back and forth. This is why it doesn&#39;t work with your hand, as it&#39;s both too short, so you&#39;d have to produce a VERY high pitch, and it&#39;s not as smooth a surface, so even if you were able to produce a high enough pitch not enough of the waves would be bouncing back into your larynx. <br><br><br>A better way to illustrate this would be to imagine you have air molecules in larynx that vibrate in a consistent manner in order to produce the pitch. When the pitch gets high enough, those same air molecules are vibrating in such a way that actually &quot;cancels&quot; out the pitch you are making. Active noise-cancelling headphones do the same thing. They produce an inverse sound wave in order to cancel out the incoming sound waves.<br><br><br>It&#39;s either that, or the wavelength of the pitch nearly perfectly matches the size of the tube, causing it to &quot;miss&quot; the tube entirely when it comes out. Since you&#39;re used to the pressure beforehand, the instant release of pressure causes you to make that sound because you&#39;re pushing more than you needed to at that moment.", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T21:45:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jess Stuart", "comment_text": "This is an awesome video!

Let\u2019s say you are in the middle of two resonance frequencies f1 and f2, the vibration modes for the two frequencies excite simultaneously with opposite phase resulting in destructive interference. Your vocal cords drive the sound frequency, and all oscillation modes of the pipe can be excited in some extent according to the distance between the mode\u2019s frequency and your voice frequency. And the excited oscillation with the specific mode has some definite amplitude and phase relation with your driving voice. Because your voice frequency is greater than f1 and smaller than f2, the f1 vibration mode will be at around opposite-phase and the f2 vibration mode will be at around in-phase with your driving sound.

Neat thing there, since pretty much all consist of plastic parts these days, is that the resonance of the materials directing the airflow can be tuned to improve intake charging. We tend to think of the air going into a motor as a steady pull but it is actually in the form of discrete pulses as the intake valves open and close. That sets up pressure waves upstream in the tract, which, as you&#39;ve shown, can either enhance or interfere with cylinder air charging. It&#39;s a subtle effect on a powerful motor, but if you&#39;re trying to wring every bit of performance out of it, you will consider it. When the intake resonance matches the cylinder charging requirements at peak power it can give it a noticeable bump.

Resonant frequency of the cabin, being expressed by the roof panel, as they aren&#39;t as stout as they used to be.

If you asked someone who play the brass instruments, you would get more information, they already knew a fixed length pipe can only give you certain notes on a scale. For example, if you play on a F-French Horn, you will get  (middle C) F-A-C-(Eb)-F. You can see the F-A-C-F is an arpeggio of F scale (equivalent to Do-Me-So-Do). You can not get the notes in between F and A...etc. The (Eb) means, you can get an out-of-turn Eb, normally we don&#39;t use it.  This is why their instrument have valves which changes the length of the pipe to get the full scale. It is complicated but brass players know it well. <br><br><br><br>In 18th century, the horn does not have valves, they call it natural horn, but Mozart wrote 4 concertos for the horn with full scales required.

Any tube of length &quot;X&quot; will be capable of producing a set series of notes which are a function of the length &quot;X&quot;: the fundamental (the lowest note it can produce) and a series of increasingly higher notes called harmonics, all of which follow a specific mathematical pattern (Diameter is also a factor, but for our purposes here, it is negligible). The tube will easily transmit vibrations (produced by the player&#39;s lips) at frequencies which correlate to the harmonic series, while other frequencies will have a harder time passing through (though you can coax out certain notes if you don&#39;t mind sounding like a dying whale). But there comes a point where the source of vibration - the player&#39;s lips (or vocal cords as it applies to the video) cannot continue to vibrate without &quot;jumping&quot; up (or down) and skipping some notes. We call these different levels of vibration &quot;partials&quot; and they are vital to brass instruments like trumpets, trombones, French horns, tubas, and so on. It&#39;s all very similar to the way string players hit high harmonic tones by gently tapping the string at a special point called a node - only you can&#39;t sing into/through a string in the same way she sings into the pipes in the video. And before the trolls come out, yes, woodwinds use partials/harmonics, too - just not as extensively. I saw someone mention using a speaker to test this same phenomenon. About that - if you include the speaker as part of a sealed system inside the tube, you MIGHT get these results, but it would have to be a completely closed system in the same way that a brass player&#39;s lips and the tube of the instrument are sealed (or where the singers in this video have the tube shoved up against their mouths). If the system isn&#39;t sealed, there would certainly be no effect - but if it IS sealed properly, then... maybe. My guess would be that you might get similar results if you kept the volume low, but you could probably get the speaker to overpower the tube effect at some point.

What is happening is that with your mouth sealed over one end and blowing, the tube acts like a closed pipe. Because of the way the air vibrates in that kind of system, the 2nd order harmonics are inaccessible. Thus there is a gap in the frequencies it can produce. If you keep going up, it will jump into the 3rd order, skip the 4th, and then higher into the 5th order harmonics. This is how an instrument like a Clarinet operates. The interesting thing is if you uncap both sides of the pipe, like in a flute, then it can play all harmonic registers because the flute mouthpiece is open, and air can move in both directions. In a conical bore instrument like a saxophone the widening angle of the tube walls also allows for all harmonics to be accessible. But with close ended, straight bore pipes, we miss the 2nd and 4th harmonics. :) Thus the fingering for a &quot;G&quot; in the lower register plays a D in the 2nd (3rd harmonic) register. Where as on a saxophone a B is the same fingering in both registers.

On a BBb Tuba the &quot;open&quot; harmonic series is Bb, F, Bb, D, F, Bb... etc.  Adding valves will add lengths of pipe that will augment the air flow and allow new harmonic series.

Brass instruments are the best example. Instead of singing into the tube, the player&#39;s lips act like the vocal cords. While there is some flexibility to what frequency the player&#39;s lips can vibrate, they only will resonate at the harmonics of the open pipe. If this pipe were conical or had a bell flare, the effect will be different. Something else that is interesting from a physics perspective is the effect of a stopped Horn (where the Horn player inserts their hand into the bell of the Horn to block the air leaving the instrument). In stopping the instrument, the frequency is lowered to a half-step above the next lower harmonic.<br><br><br>Towards the end of the video, you mention how singers match their vocal tract to match the frequency of the note sung.

It&#39;s that &quot;all choked up&quot; feeling many people get during intense emotion, but some people (myself included) can get the same effect during an otherwise normal day.<br><br><br>It&#39;s related to this video because backpressure is one way to get breathing again. When you manage to get a breath in, purse your lips and hold your hand over your mouth to increase backpressure when you breathe out, and breathe out as forcefully as you can through the smaller opening. That backpressure somehow helps the vocal cords get back into sync again, and after several minutes I&#39;m usually OK again. It used to take me a lot longer to recover before a speech therapist taught me the technique.<br><br><br>The point being, I agree with Prof. Wolfe that the likely culprit of your &quot;can&#39;t hit the note&quot; effect is indeed backpressure on the vocal cords. I have repeated evidence that my &quot;can&#39;t breathe&quot; episodes are significantly (measurably) changed by backpressure. The amount of backpressure is of course much greater in my case than the backpressure from the resonance in the tube, but then again the behavior change is also much greater (can&#39;t hit the note vs. can&#39;t breathe).<br><br><br>So there ya go -- another data point.
