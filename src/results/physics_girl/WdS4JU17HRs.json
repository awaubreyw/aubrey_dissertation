Obviously jumping straight to the full, actual details would be ridiculously overwhelming, but in my opinion it would have been more meaningful to explain that the chip hooked up to the sensor turns the input into information about where the touch is -- X, Y coordinates, size of touch and intensity of touch -- and then <i>that</i> information is passed to the processor which can decide that a touch at a particular place on the screen <i>means</i> a poop emoji. Also, that binary you listed out isn&#39;t the actual character code, it&#39;s encoded in a special format created to let older systems support more than 255 unique characters. I looked it up and as a straight number, the poop emoji (official name &quot;Pile of Poop&quot;) is U+1F4A9, which in binary is 00000000 0000001 11110100 10101001. When computers talk to each other, they usually use a different &quot;encoding&quot; called UTF-8, and what you showed is the poop emoji in UTF-8 -- but the computer can&#39;t directly process the data in that form, because the bits of actual data are spread out unevenly across bytes and different characters can be different numbers of bytes long.

UTF-8 is used for storage and interchange, but not generally for internal representation; for that, it&#39;s much more likely to use something like UTF-16 or UCS-4.

In reality, the chip is most likely figuring out the coordinates of where you&#39;re touching. This then gets sent to the operating system (still simplified), which then notifies the app that is currently displayed. The app figures out what touchable widget is at those coordinates, finds out it&#39;s the button for &quot;insert the U+1F4A9* character&quot;, then adds that character to the string in the text box. Later on, assuming whatever protocol the app is using requires UTF-8 encoding, it converts the whole string to UTF-8, so that U+1F4A9 gets converted to the representation shown at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdS4JU17HRs&amp;t=4m14s\">4:14</a>.<br><br>* &quot;U+####&quot; is standard human-readable notation for Unicode code points, with the value in hexadecimal.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdS4JU17HRs&amp;t=4m31s\">4:31</a> Hehe. &quot;Roman alphabet&quot;, you say, as it clearly shows a Greek letter. :-D A very appropriate letter, though.", "comment_date": "2018-06-04T09:20:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chakshu Punj", "comment_text": "Screen is full of diamond grid, that&#39;s ok.

Plus they are often disturbed by other electric signals including switching power supplies. Even with relatively good, original brand power supplies some phones start to miss touches.

We may call this capacitive reactance also capacitive impedance. By measuring transferred charge from one electrode to another by formula above (you may imagine it as a resistor), where one pairs of electrodes sending RF signal with fixed strength , while other pairs measuring voltage transferred by VARIABILITY of capacitive reactance depending of how much capacitance is added by conductive object (fingers, metals...). This scan is very fast, and usually uses more than one scan to be sure where exactly your fingers touched, then compare the result and MCU (MicroControler Unit) make decision how to interpret readings.

I like your channel. I have a fun thought experiment about relativity that I&#39;m not sure what the correct results would be. It could be a nice idea for one of your future videos. I hope you could make some animations to help me visualize it. I am one of your subscribers. ;) <br><br>The experiment goes like this:<br><br>Suppose there is an infinite plane of lights flashing on and off periodically, for example on for 5s and off for 5s (no gradual change), and all the lights are flashing in unison. An observer is looking at the plane of lights at a distant L perpendicular from the plane. What would the observer see if the observer is a) at rest relative to the plane b) moving away from the plane c) toward the plane d) parallel to the plane at a constant speed v (possibly greater than speed of light) and e) accelerating in the mentioned directions? Also, f) how should the lights flash in order for the observer to see them flashing together and g) how would it change if he starts moving?<br><br>My guess is that he sees concentric circles of on and off lights spreading out instead of all the lights flashing simultaneously. Another variation of the problem is to replace the plane with a sphere enclosing the observer, but that&#39;s probably too much to ask.

The full details of that process are more than any one person knows off the top of their head<br><br>A basic overview of the networking aspect is that the phone constantly senses nearby radio towers (each at the center of a &#39;cell&#39;, thus &#39;cellular network&#39;) and chooses one to connect with, typically based on signal strength.  The phone and cell tower communicate by sending electromagnetic waves outward from themselves in a spherical shape.  The antennas on the cell tower focus their signal energy in one part of their spheres (horizontally outward from the tower in specific directions), while the phone&#39;s antenna is intended to distribute energy evenly in all directions because it doesn&#39;t know where the tower is.  If you picture a sphere with your phone at the center and the nearest cell tower at the outer edge, the ratio of the size of the cell tower&#39;s antenna to the surface area of that sphere tells you the tiny fraction of the phone&#39;s transmitted energy that&#39;s received by the tower.  The weakness of the received signals, combined with the fact that there are often millions of other signals of different types overlapping in all directions, means that there needs to be very complicated methods of filtering out noise, as well as extra data being sent for error detection/correction, and serious legal regulation to separate and restrict the use of the electromagnetic field<br><br>When connected to this wireless cell network, the phone sends the text data enclosed by packet data (the start and end of the packet, in terms of time they&#39;re sent, enclose the text data), which is like an addressed envelope around your text so the network knows where to deliver it to.  Once received by a computer at the cell tower, this packet might actually get put inside another packet with better address data once the network figures out where in the world the recipient is.  The packet of data is then placed into a &#39;frame&#39; of data, which is more like a train car than an envelope, and this frame is sent as bursts of non-visible laser light into an optical fiber.  The packet will be removed from the frame and examined at another node in the network, then sent off again.  This process may be repeated many times depending on how far away the person you&#39;re texting is, until the packet gets to the right cell tower address and is sent to the recipient&#39;s phone", "comment_date": "2016-10-07T01:40:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "paulo marcos trentin", "comment_text": "Awesome!", "comment_date": "2016-10-07T01:40:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ballin' Angel", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udca9 \ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2016-10-07T01:39:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ballin' Angel", "comment_text": "Agh this is so insanely cool!!!
