My whole focus is on pure mathematics, but i think in future my works might prove helpful in theoretical physics, so i am studying physics as well. Now my question is: how should i be studying physics? what should be the strategy? do i need to read or do i need to solve from books like University Physics by sears zamansky/resnivk halliday? I feel like solving physics is all about application of the things studied,  that said, if i contribute to physics,  i want to come up with new physics, new research. So should i be solving all those questions as i feel like they are not relevant in my case.<br>In my opinion, after i move into advanced mathematics,  i will be able to grab physics from there onwards, and spending ltim now solving these questions won&#39;t make much of a difference. Am i correct?<br>Does solving every question at this stage a prerequisite for coming up with new research in physics, or can a mathematician contribute directly at a later stage in physics, once he has all the math.", "comment_date": "2020-09-20T13:33:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nishta Kasundass", "comment_text": "Ignore air resistance;<br>Physics students shout of joy.", "comment_date": "2020-09-20T10:05:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rajat Kumar", "comment_text": "Can you please make a series on THEORY OF RELATIVITY. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23physics\">#physics</a>", "comment_date": "2020-09-20T08:36:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hope4Today9 Now", "comment_text": "I&#39;m having that aha moment when one realizes that little boys don&#39;t need to waste coffee to understand 2D motion.", "comment_date": "2020-09-20T08:27:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rajat Kumar", "comment_text": "I FALL IN LOVE WITH PHYSICS \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2020-09-20T06:53:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Doug LaVigne", "comment_text": "Just a suggestion for future videos: consider using the formula sheet provided during the AP Physics 1 exam.

I feel like this can cause confusion for students when extending the concepts beyond the typical textbook problems and connecting the dots to other kinds of motion like orbits. The motion is still elliptical in ballistic motion as with orbits, but the distances traveled are short enough that the distance from the Earth to the object remains nearly constant in the problems and the curvature of the earth is also negligible. When the distance is treated as constant and the acceleration of gravity is always parallel to the y-axis, the equation does indeed simplify to a parabola, but this breaks down for significantly large motions.
