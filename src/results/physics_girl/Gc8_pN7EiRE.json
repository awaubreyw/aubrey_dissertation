[{"comment_by": "AdrienLegendre", "comment_text": "Best tips: 1) Link variables to needed equations: Write a column: descriptive name, variable = value (or =? if value not given), and dimensions. e.g. rocket acceleration, a= 3.2 m/s^2. Link each variable to a relevant equation. The solution will be a product or sum of the identified equations.  2) Dimensional analysis. In the column, find a given variable that shares one or more dimensions of the answer, use that variable or a reciprocal of the variable.  Find the next variable as a factor to remove any unwanted dimensions.  This will tell you what factors must be multiplied together to get the right answer.  Example: The answer is velocity (m/s) so I need something with (m) or (s) so I choose acceleration (m/s^2).  I need to remove seconds so I multiply by time (s) to get the needed answer&#39;s dimension so (m/s)= (m/s^2)*(s) or velocity = acceleration * time. 3) Unfolding:  Replace the answer by its definition i.e. a sum or product of variables.  Look to the column and substitute values as needed to get the answer.", "comment_date": "2022-08-23T01:45:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Don R.

Like if you have horrible test anxiety, you should be able to have your homework grades be worth more than your exams, or if you&#39;re like me and struggle with regularly having the energy to do weekly homeworks, you should be able to have the exams be worth more than the homeworks.  You&#39;re the one paying to go to college (at least here in the US), so you should get to decide how you are graded.<br><br>For example, in me senior year as a math undergraduate I took the complex analysis series.  The courses had homework assignments due each week but they weren&#39;t graded.  You were encouraged to do them, but obviously they wouldn&#39;t impact your grade if you didn&#39;t.  I did not do a single homework for those courses whatsoever.  And of course I got an A in those classes because I aced the midterm and final and didn&#39;t have any missing or hastily finished homework assignments weighing down my grade.  Fast forward to winter 2021, as a graduate math student I recently finished a functional analysis course where there were graded weekly homeworks that in total weighed almost as much as the final exam.  I turned in 5 out of the 8 homeworks, but I got an 88%, 108%, and 95% on the two midterms and final respectively, and I earned a B for the course.  It just demonstrates that you can learn everything you&#39;re supposed to learn for a course and still be shortchanged because the structure of the course prevents some learning and preparation styles from succeeding.<br><br>tldr: you shouldn&#39;t have to develop an elaborate studying scheme or cram an entire semester&#39;s worth of material the night before an exam to do well in a course if the exam freaks you out, and you shouldn&#39;t be forced to turn in assignments in a consistent manor if you&#39;re unable to develop that kind of incredibly robotic habit from the get go.

I was sitting there - in the middle of the exam! - dropping my pencil off my desk in 26-100, trying to get some insight! There were too many unknowns in my mind. How does the pencil even start falling off the desk? Is it pushed at its center of gravity? Was it pushed it at its uppermost point? What about the impulse imparted? Were you supposed to assume an infinitesimal deflection in the angle and evolve the motion from there? Were you supposed to assume some initial conditions and write the general expression? ...<br><br>In retrospect I think the problem with the exam was not so much not understanding the physics, or how to do the math, it was recognizing what simplifying assumptions the problem writer intended.
