The last time a solar flare knocked power out in a mass portion of the world was during the Cold War, America believed Russia had interfered with our systems and we were very close to dropping a bomb on them.. so it is dangerous in alot of other ways as well.", "comment_date": "2022-06-23T04:56:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "steve j", "comment_text": "You can always say it may be worse but it could just as likely be better sort of like Schrodinger&#39;s cat , until you observe it you don&#39;t know .", "comment_date": "2022-06-22T21:55:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cat DaddyChris", "comment_text": "@Physics Girl My Hypothesis: There is an ever increasing quantity of water on earth, created by the interaction of the solar wind, and Earths Ozone Layer.", "comment_date": "2022-06-22T20:35:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chinedu Okonkwor", "comment_text": "Hey.

Are we ready for a CME?  <br>I hope so.  President Trump ordered the electric grid operators to harden their equipment that serves critical infrastructure, such as military bases.  It is not too hard to do: add dc current sensors (Hall Effect transducers) and protective relay logic that is looking for a quasi-dc ground current.  If the summation of dc current pulses lasts longer than 1 minute, trip the breakers or switches that normally connects this transformer to the grid.  Backup protection option:  put temperature sensors on the magnetic core and transformer frame.  If either gets too hot, trip the breaker or switch.  <br>Leave the breaker tripped for at least 10 minutes, then evaluate whether it is safe to close.<br>Why trip the breaker?  The quasi dc causes overheating, which damages the insulation, resulting in a short circuit, causing a fire.  The transformers that are high priority for this protection are huge.  The waiting list for building one of these is NORMALLY 9 months or more.  If we have many of these transformers fail at the same time, then WOW!!!  How long will it take to build just the biggest, most important transformers?   Shutting down the grid for 10 minutes is not as disruptive as 9+++ months. <br><br>I am a Retired Professional Engineer, electrical protection.

When the Romans were in Britain (40BC-380AD) they grew citrus fruit in the north.   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Warm_Period\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Warm_Period</a>    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period</a>", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T14:58:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SaNa KhAn", "comment_text": "You are really inspiring! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T14:42:44Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jim Catanzaro", "comment_text": "I hope it hits us let\u2019s get it over with", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T09:33:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vz", "comment_text": "youtube university is undefeated", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T05:28:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Koko", "comment_text": "Imagine being an introvert and talking with her in the car \ud83d\ude2c <br>I&#39;d be just saying oh all the time and when it feels like I&#39;m not listening I just ask something about the topic lol", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T04:29:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mama Shant", "comment_text": "Aren&#39;t we electric in some way.

And there was a timeline actually that points out towards 2040. My information is second hand from someone that actually was related to an engineer working for nasa.

Take 11:00 A.M. for instance and understand that 6 months later to the exact 11:00 am is now facing away from the sun, not toward it.  At this 6 months later at 11:00 A.M. we observe daylight when day should instead be night.  Many may not agree with what I and other awake and aware folks are saying, but my buddy the sundial does, and the sundial does not lie, as the trusty sundial (provided the small, localized and very close to the earth sun is not blanketed out by clouds) shows the same exact shadow position at 11:00 A.M. every single day, 365 days of every single year after year after year after year.  Push aside all the film-sets, absurd props, fairy story mathematics, convoluted conjectures, and theoretical stupidities and the REAL math proves that the earth is not &quot;orbiting&quot; around the sun.<br><br>Another instance of real math is that two airplanes traveling the same exact speed, one at an altitude of 3,500 feet and the other at 35,000 feet, cannot both have the same travel times from point A to point B.  Draw the angles, because the one at 35,000 feet is having to follow a much larger distance because the arc is much larger, well, that is if it&#39;s following the &quot;curvature&quot; like the mainstream tells us.  The two aircraft cannot in any circumstances have the same travel times.  Why?  Real math/real trigonometry/real physics prove it.<br><br>Lastly, did anyone happen to observe the ridiculously thin door with no seal whatsoever on the capsule door that supposedly protected J3ff B3z0s and his complicit bunch of other fellow actornauts from the &quot;vacuum&quot; of &quot;outer space&quot; for the supposed short time they were in that harsh &quot;vacuum?&quot;  Or was it all done on a film-set?  I have spent many hours analyzing the video footages frame by frame and I reason the latter is the truth.  So many tangents, so many truths.  The truth is stranger than the fiction that masquerades-around in its place.<br><br><br>&quot;Who controls the past controls the future.

Wouldn&#39;t it just trip the breaker and any excess voltage would go into the 4&#39;+ metal ground rod that&#39;s normally on modern systems incase the house gets struck by lightning? If it is installed properly it is the shortest route to ground from the power box so it shouldn&#39;t go through your home devices no? Homes during the Carrington even never had gfi breakers or ground rods. Most items plugged into these modern systems should actually be ok. The problem is that all the power lines everywhere would just melt because they are miles and miles long. Anyone with their own power solutions on their property  (solar/wind) would be ok. Everyone else would have to ask themselves if it made sense to pay to replace/repair the old dated power infrastructure or instead switch to smaller and in that situation cheaper renewable systems. Could be God&#39;s way of forcing us off the fossil fuel power solutions because we will be too cheap to buy a septillion miles of copper and aluminum cable to get those systems back up.

I mean it makes sense when you think about it that a strong solar storm could affect certain biological systems in mammals or even animals of all sorts. Many people are struggling with mental instability and I strongly suspect it&#39;s because we&#39;ve lost at least 20% of the magnetosphere, or more at this point, and the magnetic north and south poles are migrating when they only used to engage in mild wandering. Things are changing on a massive scale, but some propose that the poles began their recent migration around 1859 and the Carrington Event. Edit: Not that the Carrington Event CAUSED the pole migration and weakening magnetosphere. We all know correlation doesn&#39;t equal causation.

What intoxicating vanity. Let me tell you about our planet. Earth is four-and-a-half-billion-years-old. There&#39;s been life on it for nearly that long, 3.8 billion years. Bacteria first; later the first multicellular life, then the first complex creatures in the sea, on the land. Then finally the great sweeping ages of animals, the amphibians, the dinosaurs, at last the mammals, each one enduring millions on millions of years, great dynasties of creatures rising, flourishing, dying away -- all this against a background of continuous and violent upheaval. Mountain ranges thrust up, eroded away, cometary impacts, volcano eruptions, oceans rising and falling, whole continents moving, an endless, constant, violent change, colliding, buckling to make mountains over millions of years. Earth has survived everything in its time. It will certainly survive us. If all the nuclear weapons in the world went off at once and all the plants, all the animals died and the earth was sizzling hot for a hundred thousand years, life would survive, somewhere: under the soil, frozen in Arctic ice. Sooner or later, when the planet was no longer inhospitable, life would spread again. The evolutionary process would begin again. It might take a few billion years for life to regain its present variety. Of course, it would be very different from what it is now, but the earth would survive our folly, only we would not. If the ozone layer gets thinner, ultraviolet radiation sears the earth, so what? Ultraviolet radiation is good for life. It&#39;s powerful energy. It promotes mutation, change. Many forms of life will thrive with more UV radiation. Many others will die out. Do you think this is the first time that&#39;s happened? Think about oxygen. Necessary for life now, but oxygen is actually a metabolic poison, a corrosive glass, like fluorine. When oxygen was first produced as a waste product by certain plant cells some three billion years ago, it created a crisis for all other life on earth. Those plants were polluting the environment, exhaling a lethal gas. Earth eventually had an atmosphere incompatible with life. Nevertheless, life on earth took care of itself. In the thinking of the human being a hundred years is a long time. A hundred years ago we didn&#39;t have cars, airplanes, computers or vaccines. It was a whole different world, but to the earth, a hundred years is nothing. A million years is nothing. This planet lives and breathes on a much vaster scale. We can&#39;t imagine its slow and powerful rhythms, and we haven&#39;t got the humility to try. We&#39;ve been residents here for the blink of an eye. If we&#39;re gone tomorrow, the earth will not miss us.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>\u2015 Michael Crichton", "comment_date": "2022-04-26T22:05:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": ":Wade-barry :Dallaire.", "comment_text": "The SUN is a local light and heat source.

The voltage changes for a solar storm can only build up over tens to hundreds of kilometers and the only equipment affected are the big transformers connected to long distance powerlines to step the power up / down to the voltages we use at home.

Love your videos, but there&#39;s very little physics of electricity in this one.  Explain please! Let&#39;s the see the math of the magnetic lines inducing the voltage that cause damage. You can sum it up in a couple sentences! I was kinda off put by the doomsday-ness of your video but no science to support the damage forecast. You said, &quot;x trillion dollars damage!&quot; with the look of a scared child instead of a scientific mind that questions theories and blanket statements.<br><br>Magnetic field lines that cross electrical wires induce a voltage. Does the solar wind cause the earth&#39;s magnetic field to shift, and thus there is induced electrical current generated in the millions of kilometres of wires? ...even then, every transformer along the way is a step down transformer, EXCEPT for the step up transformers at the generator. Those are only meters long. Not kilometres-long. So if additional voltage is applied to the high voltage lines, it&#39;s stepped down. The major transmission lines carry 500kv, which is then stepped down to 14,400v at the the sub stations.  Then at the housing, it&#39;s stepped down again to 120/240 or 120/208.  Going from 500,000v down to 240v is a 2000:1 step down in voltage.  So to increase enough voltage to cause damage would take an increase on the transmission lines of like 20,000 volts! To get 300 volts, where there was 240, is an increase of 125,000 Volts on the transmission lines!!!  When lightning strikes transmission lines, it only occasionally causes big damage, and it&#39;s on the order of the megavolt addition. So... Yeah, the sun&#39;s big, but 20kv is a lot of voltage to add. Even for a thousand kilometres of wire. A LOT. Especially by a slow moving magnetic field. I might be wrong. I don&#39;t know about how the magnetic field of the earth is affected. Maybe it bumps around enough to cause a lot of volts? Dunno. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that much. <br><br>Someone&#39;s going to say, what about the watts or amps?  Nope. Amps are decided by the resistance in the lines.  If there&#39;s enough voltage to blow out the insulators, around the lines, there will be a short, and then current goes through the roof.  But the current goes to ground by the shortest means necessary. Sooo... 20kv to increase by 10 volts on the customer side. Maybe it&#39;s enough to cause something get damaged... But not my fridge or dishwasher. Maybe my TV and computer...  But then not if there&#39;s a surge protector installed.<br>I&#39;m totally open to being corrected!

However during Apollo missions and cameras looking at the earth you are not able to see any such Aurora at any time. What is interesting is Earth has a Norther Lights Aurora. But also the Southern lights Aurora. The problem is at no time can you see either of these Aurora and according to the data many solar events happened during Apollo flight.

There are actually two radiation projection periods as the sun&#39;s magnetic poles rotate, (not switch) over two 11 year cycles. <br><br>Each pole to pole change, as observed and recorded by variations in the sun spot activity or number of sunspots as far back as the 15th century, give rise to solar maxima (winds) when each pole faces the solar elliptic and heat, sunspots and CMEs at their maximum when the poles are perpendicular to the solar elliptic. While generally solar maxima (winds) produced high levels of sustained radiation to produce the auroras and induction into copper infrastructure like electrical grid systems that may cause transformer burnouts, it is when the poles are vertical that the earth receives the more intense heat radiation.<br><br>CMEs occurring when the sunspot activity is at it maximum when the sun&#39;s magnetic poles are vertical or at 90 degrees to the solar elliptic (planets) and will increase in intensity as the solar activity increases up to the 24th century.<br><br>During solar maxima, the radiation is more intense but the heat generated and emitted towards the planet is less, causing less evaporation of the surface water, therefore less rainfall and a period of droughts. At the height of sunspot activity (45degrees later), the increase in heat from direct radiation, sunspots and CMEs, increases the evaporation of earth&#39;s surface water producing greater rainfall and flooding, sometimes severe, for either of the events. This cycle of wet and dry or flooding and droughts is easily observable around the world, especially in countries like Australia and can be observed in your chart for cycles 11, 22, 44 and 88 years. <br><br>If you extend and extrapolate the graph out further it will show up a 1408 year cycle which will take the current earth weather patterns severity to the mid 24th century before it starts to wind down again.

I think that deserves a second look. A very interesting look I might add. <br>Abstract<br><br>Alignment of serial epidemiological, physiological, including electrocardiographic data with variations in galactic cosmic rays, geomagnetic activity, and atmospheric pressure suggests the possibility of links among these physical environmental variations and health risks, such as myocardial infarctions and ischemic strokes, among others. An increase in the incidence of myocardial infarction in association with magnetic storms, reported by several investigators from Russia, Israel, Italy and Mexico, accounts in Minnesota for a 5% (220 cases/year) increase in mortality during years of maximal solar activity by comparison with years of minimal solar activity. Magnetic storms are also found to decrease heart rate variability (HRV), indicating a possible mechanism since a reduced HRV is a prognostic factor for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Longitudinal electrocardiographic monitoring for a week or much longer spans in different geographic locations, notably in the auroral oval, further suggests that the decrease in HRV affects spectral regions other than that around 3.6 s (0.15-0.40 Hz), reportedly associated with the parasympathetic nervous system. Differences in some associations are observed from solar cycle to solar cycle, and as a function of solar cycle stage, a finding resolving controversies. Coordinated physiological and physical monitoring, the scope of an international project on the Biosphere and the Cosmos, seeks reference values for a better understanding of environmental effects on human health and for testing the merit of space weather reports that could prompt countermeasures in space and on earth. Physiological data being collected systematically worldwide and morbidity/mortality statistics from causes such as myocardial infarction and stroke constitute invaluable data bases for assessing changes within the physiological range, for detecting environmental effects and for recognizing endogenous as well as exogenous disease-risk syndromes.

Higher resilience due to less centralized generation and vulnerable/expensive distribution, and less opportunity to dump the &quot;waste heat&quot; into our atmosphere (as of this writing, about 1/3 of all energy produced goes out a cooling tower).<br>  <br>Think about it - during a hemisphere&#39;s summer months when sun is plentiful, PV and solar heat can meet the needs of a given building.  During a hemisphere&#39;s winter months when the sun is less available, a combined heat and power system can burn natural gas locally (starting with digester gas from sewage treatment and landfill reclamation) and you get the benefit of a heat output from an electricity generation source to heat the building while converting a more harmful form of greenhouse gas (CH4) into a less harmful type (CO2).  Extra electricity can be used to drive a heat pump for additional heat rather than storing in another form - because you should be using a dual-mode heat pump anyway (air conditioners we are all familiar with are single mode).  Naysayers will claim solar thermal heat doesn&#39;t work well, but that&#39;s probably just down to poor system design - in North America, it works even in Canada and Alaska when done right: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJMOM01NA40\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJMOM01NA40</a><br>  <br>Abundance and &quot;out-of-sight-out-of-mind&quot; generation results in waste.

The first trips to the moon collected the proton emissions on the surface of the moon trapped in the glassed surface points. That information was considered classified til a few years ago. Because of the fact that there are micro novas of our sun on a timely basis, yes catastrophic events. Biggest missing information, you never once talked about the magnetosphere of the earth and its relationship to the suns cycles. Your completely wrong on the depth of sun activity recorded, Grand Solar Minimums as we know historically have shaped grow zones and weather patterns at times over hundreds to thousands of years and historically show the exact timelines of empires falling all over the world due to famines and associated issues with water and so fourth, pestilences etc. Staying away from that would make sense because you are not going to get that education from any sources in academia, as they completely undermine CO2 emission based reality that is being utilized presently since the micro nova information was fully extrapolated in the seventies, namely after the information was deemed classified. Further they are now tracking and have been recently the UVC on the ground not due to gas emissions, but due to the weakened magnetosphere during this grand solar minimum, and once you understand how that affects the magnetosphere over periods of time you will get the full picture. Why the full picture? Because currently all of the planets are via the galactic influx dropping or flipping their atmospheres, not due to animal farts and oil and energy production or emissions, but due to the fact that we are in a fuller patterned system, not simply egotistical centers of the universe. Further, its utter hubris to imagine anyone will reshape the atmosphere via mandate and expenses put on the common man at activity levels. It is pure idiocy to believe this when you have the full facts, and that is why you are not given them or taught to think along those levels. Until recently the &quot;Climate system&quot; didnt even include the sun, and only grudgingly now do they include it and the magnetosphere, but of course grossly undervalue and downplay the reality that it is in control, not man.

One of the biggest problems is that since the Carrington Event, our Earth has lost about 20% of our magnetic field strength and it continues to rapidly (and exponentially) decrease in field intensity. The Earth&#39;s magnetic field is its main shield against Solar and cosmic events/energies.  That means, it wouldn&#39;t even take a Carrington level CME or combo Solar event to send us all back into the pioneer days. <br><br>   It is truly not a matter of if, but when at this point, especially as the field gets weaker and weaker. The entire grid system would need billions of dollars of upgrade and protection, and even that wouldn&#39;t create a sure certainty of these not being taken completely out. <br><br>    And Solar activity absolutely affects humans and human health on multiple levels and in various different ways. There is A LOT of scientific literature about that. For some examples, vehicular accidents are noted to increase during periods of intense Solar activity, heart attacks and strokes go up, mental illness issues increase, and anecdotally speaking, I almost always know via body symptoms, when there has been at least X class, Earth directed flares. Basically I get super tired and brain foggy out of no where, and sometimes more irritable than usual and I&#39;m a pretty chill/laid back person for the most part. If it is strong enough, I also get a headache, of which I&#39;m not prone to normally at all.  There are even research studies that have found a correlation between collective events of human violence and increased Solar activity (flares, CME&#39;s, large sunspots, strong solar wind, etc).  <br><br>    Not so fun fact...  Remember those anomalous very well preserved via freezing mammoths that are roughly around 12, 000 years old or so?  The only phenomenon that can explain their unusual deaths and preservation is something like a Solar micro nova. We&#39;re talking a Solar event that makes the Carrington one look weak.  Why do I say this? First, you have to understand how anomalous their preservation is.  We know that these, before their demise, were munching on flowers and grass, which very strongly implies that it most likely was no colder than 40* F or so, and more likely to be 50* and above.  <br><br>   Mammoths have a shite ton of thermal mass. If you try to freeze a previously alive mammoth with normal methods and temps, even well below freezing, you&#39;re going to get flesh mush because of how much thermal mass there is. This is because large water crystals form and freeze degrading the flesh. It had to drop to around -120* or more, and stay that way for at least a couple days, for these to freeze as well as they did.  Remember, previous to their demise, it was no colder than 40*. We&#39;re talking a some 160* (at least) sudden and semi sustained drop in temps. <br><br>   There is only one mechanism known that could possibly do this. If there was a sufficiently strong Solar event where the Sun spewed not just a massive amount of plasma but also significant matter in our direction (there are Stars observed to have recurrent micro novas that spew straight up dense matter btw), the combo would rip away large chunks of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere on the Sun facing side of the earth. When the rest of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere rushes back into to re-equalize, you would get a Boyles Law type super cooling from the gas pressure differentials created. Here&#39;s the interesting thing though about these Mammoths, and which further supports an enormously powerful Solar event: These Mammoths did not die by freezing, but by what seems to be massive, violent flooding. For example, clear signs of asphyxiation AND things like their massive pelvic bones being ripped out and twisted. Mangled up whilst drowning. There is not much in nature that can so mangle a Mammoth, except massive, violent flooding or dropping from large heights. <br><br>      Meaning, what happened first, before the super cooling, was a super heating and melting of all those massive glaciers that were around them and presumably to the north of them whilst they were munching away on flowers and grass.  So first you have a super heating leading to massive flooding, and then you have the super cooling right after. They had no chance.

Not to mention the issues with elevators. Major cities will become major evacuation sites as in some cases millions will need to be moved out in a matter of days. The same issue is true in many residential areas. If you can see your towns water tower, it doesn&#39;t fill itself. Pumps fill it and then it supplies the pressure to push the water through the local lines. So people in those areas will not have running water either and be dependent on potable water being delivered. This alone could be one of the biggest parts of the disaster.

As she mentioned, the storm of particles smashes into our magnetic field, most of the energy goes into compressing the sun-facing side of that magnetic field and diverting the charged particles to the poles where they smash into atoms in the upper atmosphere.  That HUGE moving (smashed) magnetic field induces current into the thousands of miles of copper and aluminum wire crossing the continents.  This causes super high voltages and currents to be induced and overloads the transformers which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and take months or years to replace.  We should know anywhere from days to hours that a super-storm is coming (because the light gets here before the solar wind does) and be able to &quot;unplug&quot; the power stations from the grid before the storm hits us and I believe that&#39;s the only way to save the grid -- shut it down for the short period of time it takes for the storm to pass.  Sure, everyone will be without electricity for hours but it&#39;s better than weeks or years...

But the last big solar superstorm comparable to the Carrington event was in 1921.  Additionally thanks to tree rings and ice cores we now know of some storms which appear to have made the Carrington event and those like it look tiny in comparison being at least some 10 to 20 times stronger in the case of an extreme event in 775.  Other super Carrington events which were somewhat weaker are known from 660BCE and 995, with events comparable to the storm of 775 having been identified around 7176 BCE and 5259 BCE.  In other words these geomagnetic storms are far more common than we used to think. <br><br>Also as a fun fact about geomagnetic storms it turns out the Sun isn&#39;t the only thing which can produce them as superflares from young &quot;nearby&quot; magnetars in the Large Magellanic Cloud or Milky Way are also powerful enough to induce geomagnetic storms  such as the event on March 5th 1979 caused by a magnetar within LMC N49 known as SGR 0525-66 , another two events originating from within the milky way  from SGR1900+14  which struck Earth on August 27th 1998  and  SGR 1806-20 which struck Earth on December 27th 2004. As the closest of these events was only several tens of kiloparsecs away (~40,000 light years) and were able to  induce geomagnetic storms comparable to weak CMEs from our Sun it indicates these are truly extremely energetic flare events. In fact we have been able to observe such flares from extragalactic sources at Mega parsec distances though thankfully without geomagnetic storms and these flares may even be linked to at least some of the events known as Fast Radio Bursts according to observations by Chime raising truly alarming prospects about how powerful such flare events might be from magnetars far closer than  tens of kiloparsecs from a  planet especially as evidence suggests magnetars burn out the extreme magnetic fields that power such events within around 10,000 years.  We are talking about flares that come from 40 to 50 thousand light years away but are still powerful enough to induce weak geomagnetic storms on Earth... That is F-ing insane and if FRB&#39;s are linked to these flares as seems likely then there are examples out there so powerful that faint radio echoes can be seen from giga parsec distances.  The power of nature is is incomprehensibly awe inspiring.<br><br><br>Regarding the Space X satellites falling out of orbit one important detail missed is that atmospheric gravity-buoyancy waves have been shown to serve as the counterbalancing force to counteract the inflation of Earth&#39;s thermosphere due to solar activity (aka these waves induce cooling in the thermosphere)  Early 2021 when the flare hit Earth the Northern hemisphere was experiencing a strong Sudden Stratospheric Warming Event which cuts off the coupling of these waves and the upper atmosphere as these waves dampen out in the stratosphere instead of propagating into the mesosphere and thermosphere meaning the Earth&#39;s thermosphere cooling response is severely impaired meaning the rate of  cooling is greatly slowed down. This meant that the normal atmospheric expansion compensation methods used by low Earth orbit satellite operators didn&#39;t work well.  I recommend looking up work by Erdal Yiggit which looks into these effects after showing that the effects of these waves can&#39;t be neglected in the upper atmosphere thanks to the effects  momentum conservation and energy conservation induce on these waves amplitudes as the atmospheric density decreases.", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T02:31:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CHUNCHAO CHANG", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/XHyAO7ngHZg\">https://youtu.be/XHyAO7ngHZg</a>", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T02:31:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jedi Vacuum", "comment_text": "2.6 trillion dollars is nothing compared to what we spent in one month", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T02:31:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul S", "comment_text": "if it happens in the winter it could be very bad for NA", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T02:30:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eve Crowley", "comment_text": "The book of Revelation already warns us and has done for over 2000 years that solar flares will strike individual people and consume them in the latter days.", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T02:30:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caleb 439", "comment_text": "every video should have a &#39;cute break&#39;!!!!", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T02:30:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aramis419", "comment_text": "&quot;CME&#39;s - like the one we&#39;re expected to have, very, very soon, have the potential of frying the electric grids of the entire planet and can sent satellites spiraling out of control!<br>Our sponsor?

Direct hits and near misses (near enough that they actually cause issues) are bad, but they&#39;re rare just by virtue of Earth being such a small target.<br><br>Personally the scariest thing I find about all of this is that while all of the civil systems go down, many modern militaries are going to be just fine.  At some point in the cold war, people realized that a nuclear bomb detonated in orbit over an area would create a huge pulse of radiation that would disrupt electronics - this is the easy way of making a weaponized EMP.  And since it&#39;s an excellent way of creating incredibly widespread disruption, it was considered a likely component of a first strike, so various militaries who faced the issue of trying to figure out how to make WWIII survivable started including the necessary electromagnetic shielding into most of their equipment.  Ideally this would be a good thing for helping with the recovery from a solar event like this, but given the degree to which it would disrupt civilian life, we&#39;d likely have anarchy, which would likely result in martial law to impose order, and historically militaries that are given the power to police a country tend not to give that power up easily.<br><br>Ideally all of the infrastructure we rely on would have the same electromagnetic hardening the military uses - it&#39;s not exactly difficult to set up for things that don&#39;t transmit/receive radio signals, and it&#39;s not a military secret.  It&#39;s just a decent sized layer of metal shielding.  But covering the entire power grid in a layer of electromagnetic shielding would be exceedingly expensive because there&#39;s a LOT of power grid to cover.  And this version of &quot;ideal&quot; is ignoring that.  <br><br>Perhaps a better solution would be to have strategic reserves of equipment such that you could get the majority of the grid back online in the handful of days it takes to swap out all of those parts rather than the years of having to manufacture everything from scratch (and possibly having to deal with the issues of getting the factory and various shipping systems up and running before you can even start manufacturing and distributing the necessary equipment.", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T02:06:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Alhazred", "comment_text": "I like that Physics Girl always seems to give a person the benefit of the doubt and asks first if they already have some understanding of what she&#39;s about to explain to them. \ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T02:06:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Stevens", "comment_text": "I came for science, I stayed because of the dogs", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T02:06:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lorenzo Falorni", "comment_text": "Time to buy gold", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T02:05:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pablo Quijada Salazar", "comment_text": "This would be devastating.

I am happy that you know your physics but you might wish to also learn a little bit about modern electronic engineering design. Today we are far more aware of the damage a solar flare can do so almost 90% of all satellites (depending on their function) are EMP shielded, only the smaller cube like satellites might end up being damaged by a solar flare as witnessed by the fact that when many of Elon Musk&#39;s satellites were damaged not too long ago, none of the larger  others out in space ceased to function. Here on the ground we have the same situation in which Electrical Engineers have also designed their power plants, transformers and so on to also be resilient to a Solar Flare.  In short, the Carrington event will never happen again. So what we have in you is a person not unlike some in 1999 who despite repeated efforts to be told otherwise by IT experts continued to state that come the year 2000 all computers would cease to function due to the Y2K bug; as we know nothing happened but people like me made a fortune out of suckers like you who despite being told it was not needed continued to demand a software patch (which didn&#39;t really do anything) at some very high prices.  Moral of the story?  Science has more than one field ... But if you want something to be scared about just think of the solar matter that accompanies a flare, it never travels far but there is no reason why it shouldn&#39;t .. a raging fire capable of reaching all the way to the Earth&#39;s surface and able to cook your pretty skin clean off your bones ...

It seems to me the actual answer has something to do with the inner workings of the sun. My guess, only a guess, is the poles flipping and the spots are caused by a wobble in the sun&#39;s spin...maybe internally only. That not only does the equator spin faster than the poles but there&#39;s different layers inside spinning at different speed and it could be wobbling. That anything this massive as poles flipping and spots must be a really big force. And that t happens in such a regular time frame tells me it has to be gravity related.

We were driving on the newly minted I-540 when my dad asked me &quot;what is that glowing light in the sky? Is that the Northern Lights?&quot; We were both confused a bit by this bright, green glowing phenomenon being seen at that latitude. But, we were able to confirm that it was indeed the Northern Lights. Aside from the rare sighting of the Aurora Borealis in Raleigh, NC, our confusion about what were witnessing stemmed from the fact that 99% of the time the Aurora is shown on TV, video or film it is a lie. A bit harsh, I know, but stay with me: Pretty much every time you see it the colors are moving and dancing across the sky. In reality, they don&#39;t do that, unless you film/video the Aurora over time and then play it back speeded up several times.

We are approximately 480,000 years overdue for a geomagnetic polar flip -- and we have evidence from the Mid-Atlantic Trench that up until the last polar flip, we were flipping our poles every 50,000 years or so, as made evident from the cores pulled from the Mid-Atlantic Trench, which contained high concentrations of iron, cobalt, nickel, and magnesium. They tested the magnetic alignment of these cores, and found they flip-flopped.<br><br>However, there is one thing to also keep in mind: We had a severe geomagnetic flux event only a couple of years ago. What ended up happening is that the magentosphere weakened over Brazil -- leading to the wildfires there -- and caused a severe lightning event in northern California, in the US, where it was recorded that over 10,000 lightning strikes hit a 2-square-mile area in an hour. That tells me that the EMF, the magnetosphere, weakened over Brazil, then &quot;bunched up&quot; over California, and the lightning strikes were Nature&#39;s way of balancing things back out.<br><br>And I&#39;m not exactly worried about plasma. I&#39;m worried about microwaves. The same energy the cooks food can cook this planet if we lose our EMF. However, strangely enough, by hitting the Earth&#39;s EMF with ionized energy, it actually makes the EMF stronger. This leads to an actual cooling down trend of temperature, globally, despite this pseudoscience going around about anthropogenic climate change. Mankind cannot, nor will not, have control over climate, when nature herself puts out more &quot;pollutants&quot; in one volcanic eruption, than mankind does in a year. And when you have 2,000 eruptions around the Pacific Ocean&#39;s Ring of Fire every year, on average, what ends up happening is that nature puts out more pollutants in a year than mankind has in 2 millennia.<br><br>But the point is, if you&#39;re going to be looking for a solar storm of any kind, then 2025 is not the year to do it -- begin in 2030.", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T22:05:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miku Trash", "comment_text": "4-10 years to repair it all, if it&#39;s ever repaired.
