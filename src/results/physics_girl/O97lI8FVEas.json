Crash helmets amplify, and improve upon, the solution evolution arrived at for direct impact deceleration (ie. the skull and the \u2018padding\u2019 of cerebral fluid) but in so doing they undo the solution that evolution achieved for mitigating fatal brain injury caused by the torquing forces that are applied by a glancing blow.  An off centre blow to a helmet strapped securely to your head causes your skull to rotate at the same speed as the helmet.  This speed, if sufficient, could leave your fluid suspended brain a victim of its own inertia; creating fatal torsion at the brain stem.  Evolution addressed this problem by giving us a flexible (and if all else fails, tearable) scalp.  Some of the energy from an off centre impact is absorbed by the pliant elastic scalp, lessening the rotational acceleration of the skull, in turn lessening the torc applied to the brain stem.

I feel like it would have been much better if this episode could have been broken down to at least two episodes and you could have calmly gone through each topic. Also,  you go on a lot of little tangents talking about crumple zone, time dilation, and other fascinating physics concepts, but I think this only confuses/distracts students from what they are supposed to learn.<br>As a teacher I understand the struggles of trying to show how cool physics is and teach something tangible at the same time, but I think you would do a lot better focusing your material a bit more. I have a very small YouTube channel and I totally understand your struggles, I hope I&#39;m not discouraging, I just see how a few tweaks can lead to massive improvements :).<br>Looking forward to the next episode!", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T16:06:34Z", "likes_count": 65}, {"comment_by": "Mayur Valvi", "comment_text": "Gotta love graphs \ud83d\ude06", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T15:31:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Philip Y", "comment_text": "Physics is the Pot of Gold at the end of the Rainbow of Delusion and Confusion.

It\u2019s important if you think about standing on a subway train.   While at the station, you stand perfectly vertical.  But when accelerating at a constant acceleration, you need to lean at a constant angle.  But you can\u2019t instantly change your lean from vertical to leaning into the acceleration.   So, if the train departs with constant acceleration (what they focus on in school), all the passengers almost fall over.  The answer would be a constant slope in acceleration to give us time to lean, followed by constant acceleration.  Then a constant negative slope in acceleration down to zero acceleration as we settle into cruising speed (constant velocity).  It\u2019s not taught, I think.   Also, I think it partially explains how wrinkled the sheet metal sides of the train are.  My question to you is, \u201cWhat is the physics name for the slope of acceleration?\u201d   It\u2019s important enough to have a name and be taught, don\u2019t you think?

Short notice: Why is g called gravitational acceleration? Because it accelerates objects down when you let them fall with zero start velocity from a height. But acceleration and deceleration are actually just a point of view, a matter of the perspective.<br><br>Now you can calculate: <br>1. After how many seconds does velocity become zero? <br>2. What displacement has been achieved then, at what distance would a rocket be when it&#39;s velocity becomes 0 if it could start with such a velocity?<br><br>And again, this is a simplified model. Did you know? The Earths&#39; g isn&#39;t constant, only at Earth&#39;s surface. The gravitational acceleration becomes 1% less in about 32 km height. When you go higher, g becomes lower. And that&#39;s where things become more complicated and rocket science starts to become, well, rocket science.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>spoiler<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>1. Delta v is g*t, in deceleration g just has to be taken negatively to get a negative delta v. The goal is to get from 8000m/s to 0 m/s, that mean delta v is -8000m/s, g also taken as -10m/s the negative signs cancel each other out. That means t is -8000 m/s divided by -10m/s^2 = 800 s, or just with the numbers simply 8000/10 = 800.<br><br>2. Delta x is v0*t+1/2*g*t^2. Again we need to take -10m/s^2 for deceleration. Putting in the time from step 1 above, 800s, we get to <br>8000m/s*800s-1/2*(10 m/s^2)*800^2 s^2 = 6,400,000 m - 1/2*6,400,000 m = 3,200,000 m = 3200 km.<br>Just the numbers: 8000*800-0.5*10*800*800 = 10*800*800-5*800*800 = 5*800*800  = 3,200,000<br>Just the units (dimensional analysis) <br>m/s*s for the vo*t term checks out as m. <br>m/s^2 * s^2 also checks out as m. So we&#39;re fine with the units.<br><br>And now check that against the 1% gravitational change after already 32 km height, we&#39;re exceeding a height that justifies the constant g assumption. The physical model is too simple. But we get an estimate. When you look up orbit heights of satellites, they range from a few 100km up to 36,000 km for geostationary orbits.
