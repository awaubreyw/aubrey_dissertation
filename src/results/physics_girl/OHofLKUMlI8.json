It&#39;s a reference frame thing, combined with statistics.  Each time a particle is scattered upstream and then back downstream across a shock front, it picks up an increment of velocity/energy related to the difference in temperature between the heated (shocked) side and the ambient (unshocked) side.  Rare particles scatter back and forth very many times and build up incredible energies.  My master&#39;s thesis was a Monte Carlo simulation of astrophysical shock acceleration aimed at explaining the power-law spectrum of the high energy tail of the cosmic ray energy distribution, back in the 1980s.
