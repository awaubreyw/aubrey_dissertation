It looked (do not ask me why) like you had gone surfing so I gave it a quick see and finished your shiner video.  Your video was interesting but not entirely accurate.  You did not consider the buoyancy issues of bubble infused seawater (suds) and its density differences from still water.  <br><br>One physics issue with surfing waves over ten feet (or so, even overhead waves sometimes) is that suds are generated  when the lip crashes into the base that change the density of the water in the impact zone.  Too many drownings occur each year because gremmies try to swim through the suds above them.  To surf big waves, you have to train to hold your breath for about 2 minutes for ten foot waves and about 3 minutes, or more, for 15-20 foot waves.  <br><br>The reason for this long period is because you have to wait for the suds&#39; bubbles to rise to the surface so the water becomes dense enough to swim to the surface.  With the bubbles, your body stays at the depth of equilibrium and trying to swim up is like flapping your arms to fly on dry land.  Then once you reach the surface, you have about enough time to take one breath before you get caught in the next wave and the suds generated by that water on water impact.<br><br>In that 5-15 second period, you have to orient to the various safe zones available to you depending on the break.  Then you have to do it all over again.  Soon (it has to be or you drown), you realize that you can swim under the suds to the various safe zones; and then you train for how to swim fast underwater.  So much fun!<br><br>Now I realize that I am describing the extreme conditions of advanced surfing, but it is only to give you an easy to empathize scenario for the physics of the washing machine as we call the crashing waves you enjoyed.  It also may help you realize the skill required for water men and women who live to tell about it.  They may not have the physics knowledge you regularly present in your videos, but they understand enough to survive in very adversarial conditions.

The world is mostly covered with water, so obtaining water isn\u2019t an issue. Tidal energy, solar and wind energy are all constant sources of energy. Parabolic mirrors create massive amounts of heat that can boil sea water in order to desalinate it by way of thermal solar distillation. The common issue with desalination is the byproduct of brine or super salty waste water. This water is pumped back into the ocean can harm the ecosystem. My question is: If we can create massive oil pipelines that run from Canada through the United States into Mexico, then why can\u2019t we create pipelines that carry the brine to salt mines, similar to where they store nuclear waste??? I\u2019m going to research this more, but salt and salt seems pretty reasonable to me. What do you think? The same can be done with fresh water, massive pipelines can supply areas inland, instead of robbing local ecosystems of their precious resource that\u2019s needed in order to maintain a natural balance for plants and wildlife. These pipelines can also fill water reserves that can be used as batteries by way of pump-storage, a technique that is utilized all over. This doesn\u2019t seem like rocket science. It only takes enough people to agree on a better way of thinking that can help everyone.\ud83e\uddd0", "comment_date": "2022-04-02T14:43:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Optimist Prime", "comment_text": "Well, being smacked in the face is the trend right now!", "comment_date": "2022-04-02T14:20:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L K", "comment_text": "Physics, take a Beagleboard and install a solid state gyro on it and install python code.
