Was everything you ever did without purpose and never really mattered, or will you just stop existing after your heart beats for the last time? Think about this, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real, place of eternal bliss. Hell is real, place of eternal torment. You&#39;re gonna spend eternity in one of those places. God&#39;s will is, that nobody would perish. One day every single one of us has to stand before the Holy Righteous God to be judged, how we have lived our life. The only way to get to Heaven is if you are without sin, and every single one of us has sinned. That is why God in His love and mercy sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. He left Heaven\u2019s Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a holy perfect sinless life, was condemned unjustly to death while being innocent, was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf, for there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, but Christ, the spotless and unblemished Lamb of God, the Perfect Sacrifice once and for all, died for us, so we may be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God, after the fall in Paradise by satan&#39;s tempting, through the Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Calvary, in His everlasting love towards every single one of us.<br>\u00a0<br>If you truly repent and ask for forgiveness of your sins from Jesus Christ, and believe with all your heart, that Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, rose from the dead by God\u2019s power on the third day according to the Scriptures, and by faith receive Him as your Lord and Savior, through the Royal Blood of Jesus Christ you will be saved, and are born again of the Holy Spirit. Every sin that weighs you down, even the ones you never dare to speak of, will be forgiven. Repent, believe, follow Christ, and you will spend eternity in Heaven with our Holy King, where is no more death, sorrow, pain nor crying.<br>\u00a0<br>John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son (Jesus Christ), that whoever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>\u00a0<br>John 14:6 - Jesus said unto him, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father (to Heaven) except through Me.\u201c<br>\u00a0<br>Book of Acts 4:12 - Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men (only Jesus Christ), whereby we must be saved.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 10:9-10 - That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart, that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 10:13 - For whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD (Jesus Christ), shall be saved.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 8:1-2 - Therefore, there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus (born again of the Holy Spirit), who walk not after the flesh, but after the (Holy) Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.<br>\u00a0<br>1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.<br>\u00a0<br>Ephesians 2:8-9 - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>\u00a0<br>Isaiah 1:18 - Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br>\u00a0<br>John 10:10 \u2013 (Jesus said:) \u201cThe thief (satan) cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\u201c<br>\u00a0<br>1 Peter 5:8 - Be\u00a0sober, be\u00a0vigilant;\u00a0because your adversary the devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.<br>\u00a0<br>Ephesians 6:12 - For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>\u00a0<br>The LORD bless you and keep you; The LORD make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; The LORD lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.<br>\u00a0<br>In Jesus Christ Holy and Mighty Name.

His test which he did not correctly explain is one of over half a dozen tests that must first be done as these muscles can be extremely hard to find and a specialist does it with you for this exact reason. In some cases like obesity a CT scan or a ultrasound may be needed to find it. You are not a doctor because you can use google just because you couldn\u2019t see it after this guy said do my badly explained test does not make it fact.<br><br>Plus it\u2019s actually better to have the muscle. This guy is giving bad facts. The facts are that the muscle is a very helpful one that can hold a lot of weight. However it\u2019s on the upper body and humans have become very docile in that way. We barely use our upper body. So that muscle is almost invisible. For those that don\u2019t have it they are not more evolved or special. Not having it won\u2019t harm you but it really doesn\u2019t help. People with that muscle have more chance to be stronger mountain climbers, weightlifters or if there\u2019s a lower body accident those muscles can very safely and easily be transplanted and have been used to give people second chances at walking, standing and running. <br><br>But no you are NOT more evolved or special if you don\u2019t have it. The studies most recently done by the doctors and scientific community suggest having those muscles is a way better thing and evolving not to is out of inactivity. I would not be proud of that. Again though less than 30% of people have one of those muscles only and about 30% of that 30% are missing both. None of you guys are likely this group.

What he is doing it&#39;s called  Schaeffer  test, the other way to check it is called the Thompson test, but this is just a exterior visual test, so people who has a lot of fat in that region, or the meaty part on the hand side will not show it, also there are people who develop an inverse with a distal belly, a bifurcation, some will have it under  another muscle, some will injured it and break it at some point if it is more fiber than muscle because some cases It&#39;s just a tendon with no muscle, and there are also more variations that can happen, as double, inverted, central, bifid, double or triple headed, etc, etc.; it may show aberrancy of attachment at its origin or insertion, or the muscle may be completely absent and be completely tendon as I mentioned, it depends on the development of the baby/toddler/enfant/child phase, depending on the function you apply to it through your life, the muscle will adapt accordingly.

If you die in your sins you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there\u2019s good news, Though we broke God\u2019s law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross. \u201cGod so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes (trusts) in Him should not perish but have everlasting life\u201d (Jn. 3-16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses.  if you\u2019ve made it this far, please, repent and trust in Jesus and what he did for you on the cross. You have a promise from the God who cannot lie that he will forgive every sin you\u2019ve committed or ever will commit and grant you everlasting life as a free gift.", "comment_date": "2022-03-29T06:18:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Major", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t it technically be considered adaptation instead?", "comment_date": "2022-03-29T06:17:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "otoniel calix", "comment_text": "We get more grip strength", "comment_date": "2022-03-29T06:17:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "18hours a day", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t have it but still i can climb pretty easily", "comment_date": "2022-03-29T06:17:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Sanabria", "comment_text": "All opinion, not one fact.

No one comes to the Father except through me.&#39;\u201d<br><br>\u2013 John 14:6<br><br>One of the challenges Christianity faces today is the revival and promotion of the notion that \u201call paths lead to God.\u201d What that means is, a belief that different nations, throughout time, have developed their own concept of what God is and who God is through their different religions, and that these are all legitimate paths leading to the same God. It\u2019s the idea that these gods are all the same one spirit by different names.<br><br>One path to the truth<br><br>The holy Bible teaches a different concept. All God\u2019s and paths are not the same. There is only one true God.<br><br>Jesus brought the truth to mankind. That good and evil exist in the universe. That pagan beliefs in idols and false gods are the sinful methods of evil forces trying to lead mankind away from the truth \u2013 the truth that there is only one true God.<br><br>Jesus said\u2026<br><br>\u201cAnd ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\u201d<br><br>\u2013 John 8:32<br><br>One job for mankind<br><br>Jesus said that God has given mankind one job \u2013 to believe in Him.<br><br>\u201cJesus answered, \u201cThe work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\u201d<br><br>\u2013 John 6:29<br><br>Why is Jesus the only true way to God?<br><br>Mankind\u2019s sin has separated us from God. God\u2019s holiness prevents mankind from having communion with him. God cannot be in the presence of sinners. It is only through Jesus sacrifice, in paying the penalty for mankind\u2019s sin, that mankind could be pardoned from it.<br><br>\u201cFor even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d<br><br>\u2013 Mark 10:45<br><br>Because Jesus is the only human being who ever lived a sinless life, he was the only one able to pay the price for mankind. Because of the fall of man by Adam and Eve in the Garden, every human being thereafter is born into sin. We are literally born sinners \u2013 stained, infected with sin.<br><br>\u201cTherefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned.\u201d<br><br>\u2013 Romans 5:12<br><br>Redemption through Jesus Christ<br><br>Unlike mankind, Jesus, being born of a virgin through immaculate conception. Jesus was not born into sin.<br><br>Therefore, Jesus must serve as our intercessor. Only with Jesus as our representative, can we be cleansed from sin and be made worthy to have communion with the Almighty God.<br><br>All the good deeds in the world will not change or erase our sins. They must be forgiven through God\u2019s grace, and God has determined this comes through the belief in his son Jesus Christ.<br><br>\u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\u201d<br><br>John 3:16<br><br>Accept no imitations<br><br>\u201cJesus answered, \u2018See to it that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name, claiming, \u2018I am the Christ,\u2019 and will deceive many.&#39;\u201d<br><br>\u2013 Matthew 24:4-5<br><br>Jesus warned about the very thing we are seeing in the present day. There are forces trying to eliminate a belief in Christ by weakening His importance.<br><br>The idea that \u201call paths lead to God\u201d eliminates a need to believe in Christ. It is the very deception that Jesus Christ himself warned about.<br><br>Scripture tells us that without a belief in Christ, there is no path to God. Christ is theonly path to God, and without a belief in Christ \u2013 we will not receive salvation, we will not be granted eternal life.<br><br>\u201cAnd we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true\u2013in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.\u201d<br><br>\u2013 1 John 5:20<br><br>Scripture clearly tells us that there is no other path \u2013 accept no substitutions.<br><br>Accept Jesus today as Lord and Savior <br><br>If you confess their mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you shall be saved<br><br>--Romans 10:9", "comment_date": "2022-03-22T06:00:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "humongus_weeb", "comment_text": "Only one of my hands have it, it&#39;s quite odd", "comment_date": "2022-03-22T05:51:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jehganwl", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t have it which would explain why my arm started hurting from using a hole puncher earlier \ud83d\ude44I\u2019m so pathetically weak.", "comment_date": "2022-03-22T05:50:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "piggieswithstrawberrys", "comment_text": "I dont have it.
