That\u2019s because the DNA inherited from parents are so random. What\u2019s even crazier is that you can have ancestors that you share no DNA with because over time that one ancestors DNA gets diluted and then one day a child is born that just did not inherit that small part of that parents DNA. So you could be white and have a Chinese ancestor from hundreds of years ago yet have no Chinese heritage. At least as far as DNA goes.

So, seeing Africa on your ancestry report does not necessarily mean you have ancestors from Africa. It means you have similar DNA to some of the populations living in Africa CURRENTLY, who may themselves have ancestry from other parts of the world. There are many modern populations with European ancestry in Africa (aka white people living in Africa), with some of the largest in Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa. There are also many populations with Indian ancestry in Africa because the British often used Indian people as administrators and laborers in their colonies. So again, in Kenya and South Africa you find large populations of people with Indian ancestry.

The African, Balkan and German disappeared, and there was 41% Italian rather than a measly 16%. The rest of the 50% from my mother&#39;s ancestry was mostly Greek, which makes sense.

Kim&#39;s obviously lighter in skin colour, but you both share a very similar lip/mouth/smile shape, similar eyes &amp; even your personalities are similar. The funniest part is, my gf looks exactly like Kim &amp; she&#39;s a truly natural stunner too &amp; the best part. My gf who looks like Kim, her DNA result was almost identical to Kim&#39;s &amp; yours. My gf is a mix of mostly European &amp; Indian, some African, Asian &amp; a few other bits &amp; pieces. I&#39;m blown away actually &amp; i immediately contacted my gf to share this upload with her, bec i was that stunned. Great genes you both have &amp; what a wonderful upload. Please have the rest of your beautiful family tested &amp; then you can all compare &amp; if you&#39;d be willing, share with us. Also, what i&#39;ve learnt from watching your upload, we&#39;re all more connected &amp; more similar than different &amp; we don&#39;t need to be biologically related.
