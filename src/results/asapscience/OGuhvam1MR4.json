They will have much better retention and recall compared to a person who stayed up late cramming for 6-8 straight and slept 4-6 hours, or especially someone who got up early and crammed for a few hours straight right before the test. Best of the best? Split study on T-2 days, then split study the day before, and you&#39;ll be able to recall things with as little difficulty as possible. It is remarkably noticeable. Try it! Also be sure to jot down vague notes during lectures. Don&#39;t write a verbatim lecture transcript for Christ&#39;s sake, just major concepts and important details. Hearing and seeing the lecture activates sensory pathways. Going further to write it down your own way (loosely, paraphrased, condensed) activates your cognitive frontal lobe areas much more, and it activates your motor cortex, your basal ganglia, and your cerebellum.
