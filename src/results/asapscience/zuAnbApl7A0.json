Don&#39;t get me wrong - I agree fully that work needs to be done in bridging gaps and improving diversity, for the benefit of all! <br><br>That being said. From this vid the key concerns I&#39;m picking up are a) the statistical uneven representation of groups and b) unconscious and institutionalised biases. Now, certainly these two are significant. I&#39;m not sure that on their own, these 2 factors dig deep enough into the problem to root out and address it&#39;s cause. <br><br>Let me give an example. I am honestly not confident that diversity quotas in workforces really address the issue. The reality of quotas is that, as was touched upon briefly in the video, there IS a risk of less qualified individuals entering into roles with advantage over others. But perhaps more than that, it&#39;s almost &#39;forced&#39; diversification. Over time you could say that forcing the institution to address and change its lack of diversity will have a feedback effect which changes institutional biases from the inside. Maybe that&#39;s true! I can see the logic there. However the perspective has a significant issue in my mind, and that&#39;s the assumption that institutional biases are the only/main significant cause. <br><br>Anecdotally, I&#39;ve seen and heard some disturbing statements in my work wherein colleagues have been hired into roles on a diversity basis. I&#39;ve watched it happen, I know it&#39;s real, and I do have a problem with other - demonstrably more capable - individuals being denied valuable opportunities on the basis of promoting. The risk here is real but arguably invisible harm, especially in fields like medicine and healthcare. I&#39;ve seen the impact. As I say this is an anecdote. But it is also a real concern that I don&#39;t feel should be dismissed.<br><br>I agree fully with promoting and enhancing diversity, it&#39;s so important and marginalised individuals have so much to offer and that is also being denied. My point is, we need to take these statistics, look at these biases, and root out the deeper causes no matter what those figures are. As the guys state in this video: a &#39;good&#39; scientist will take any result and allow it to mold their perspective. A similar approach is vital to truly addressing these inequalities. <br><br>I make no claims as to what these root causes may be. But systemic racism and statistical imbalances aren&#39;t, in my mind, the beating heart of these inequalities. In some ways I can see them as symptoms. And if we want to cure this chronic issue, we need to weed out the cause. <br><br>Just some food for thought! I&#39;m super interested to hear some other perspectives.

For example, the stereotype of Asian students is that they are good at mathematics, and the stereotype of black students is that they are talented in sports and music.  I think in terms of stereotypes, each race is relatively fair. The problem facing society now is that other races also want more social status, but the position in the world is limited, you want to climb by yourself  Going up, you have to replace other skin colors.

Hiring minorities, because they are minorities, is racist. I&#39;m a minority in STEM, and yeah, there&#39;s a lot of white people. Why? Because they are the ones who pursue these paths. When you take a minority group, and then only a small percentage of that group pursues a career in STEM, you end up with huge disparities that can&#39;t be blamed on racism. If anything you have to blame public schools. Which I don&#39;t even want to get into right now. You know how to change this without being racist? Instead of forcing inclusion, through racist hiring procedures; encourage more minorities to pursue these fields. If more minorities pursued these fields, then the numbers would eventually normalize. You are focusing on the wrong part of the issue. My graduating class of physicists will be 12 people with 2 minorities; our professors conversely are 8 with only 3 of them being white. Yes, anecdotes are not evidence, and I am sure you could find examples of all white professors, and all white graduating classes; that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the issue can&#39;t be fixed by adding more racism. Instead of fueling the fire, encourage more minorities to take an interest in science at a younger age, and then help to nurture that. Too often do I hear the cry&#39;s of &quot;I hate math&quot; or &quot;I hate science&quot;. This is what we need to focus on. In my high school, most of the minorities hated school, and didn&#39;t care about learning, so of course I ended up hanging out with predominantly white kids who were smart and enjoyed school like myself. There is a mentality within some of these communities that needs to be changed. I specifically am Hispanic, and I know that in a lot of these communities, being smart and knowledgeable can be seen as a bad thing. It is a very toxic environment to try and develop learning in. People like you need to learn about the nuances of these issues instead of focusing on the wrong part of the problem and just virtue signalling in order to make yourselves feel better about your white guilt. The issues regarding how minority groups view intelligence in their own communities doesn&#39;t get talked about enough.

There were things I agreed with, but may I suggest a slightly different take on this. I am a 17 year old girl, and I&#39;ve almost finished my first two years of college as a chemistry major, so this type of thing comes up around me a lot because people feel the need to emphasize the fact that I am a women in a STEM field. Because of the idea of equal outcome instead of equal opportunity, when I apply to a college or try for a scholarship I am more likely to get into the college or receive the scholarship, which I think is ridiculous. I think the best way to work towards solving the issue instead of just making another issue would be to keep things anonymous. Let the people reviewing your application for whatever you&#39;re applying for see your records, like grades and achievements, but don&#39;t mention race or gender. I think it is INCREDIBLY important that everyone have equal opportunity, but you can never truly have equal outcome. I come from a family who&#39;s women prospered in education; my mother has a PhD in mathematics, my Aunt has a PhD in psychology, and there&#39;s more examples. And yes, they faced bias, my mother was flat out told that it might be hard to find an assistantship because she&#39;s a women. But I think we&#39;re now turning it around into discriminating against white males especially, and that&#39;s NOT a good way to go. Just because someone is a man doesn&#39;t mean they should have an advantage against me as a women, and vise versa. I have a passion for science, and one of my pet peeves is when politics start messing with things. I will forever fight for true equal opportunity, however equal outcome is not something that can be guaranteed.", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T23:25:10Z", "likes_count": 79}, {"comment_by": "a4yster", "comment_text": "&gt;&gt;No indigenous people. <br>Bros, this is very USA-centric view.

No we don&#39;t. We don&#39;t <b>need</b> to impose diversity in everything. You don&#39;t need to see a certain dominance in a certain field in society as a necessary problem. The sad truth is that these days everything where there&#39;s a dominance of mostly white male non-minority people, certain groups tend to see that as a problem. It reeks of misplaced political correctness, especially because there&#39;s no easily identifiable mechanism that would explain that certain demography. I live in a country where <b>every</b> person has the same opportunities of becoming a scientist regardless of background, as long as the person seizes the opportunity and there&#39;s still a significant difference. Do you then <b>need</b> to address such a difference? No, we don&#39;t. Especially, because those who want to address such differences often resort to the horrid concept of &quot;positive discrimination&quot; as if discrimination ever could be positive. Try explaining for instance to someone that <b>he</b> can&#39;t become such or so because there are not enough <b>she</b> that want to become. I shudder to see this positive discrimination in action. As an example: in my country electoral lists <b>must</b> be equally composed of men and women, which has the very unfortunate consequence that lists get filled with incompetent women figureheads simply because parties don&#39;t find enough competent women who want to be on an electoral list. The era that you couldn&#39;t attend university because you were not of the right demography is now at least a few decades ago. Unless you can show me a clear discriminatory mechanism like that creating a certain demography in science now, please accept it and move on. Again, it&#39;s not because in a field a certain demography has a dominance that there&#39;s a problem: In the first half of the 20th century physics was dominated by people of Jewish descent.

It would also be interesting to see percentages (by ethnicity) for how many people are actually IN STEM fields, and maybe also what the percentages are for the general population.  If the percentages of minorities in STEM fields is lower (and I would guess that may be the case), it would stand to reason there are fewer with YT channels, working at FB, etc.  I am not implying that minorities are any less capable, but they may have more problems getting into some colleges, or finding good positions after college, etc.  There is also the possibility that some groups may not WANT to (statically speaking) to study certain fields.  I know that probably sounds racist, but I think different cultures value certain things more than others, and this influence what fields different ethnicities gravitate towards.  Are there more Hispanics in construction because there is a cultural value placed on working with their hands, or because it is a good career they can get into (due to sociological reasons)?  I honestly have no idea, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was some of both).<br>I believe systematic racism does exist, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the only problem.

But that&#39;s what a language is, a alive being, always mutating itself to meet the needs to express something. <br>From what I was told, the -x at the end make it hard to people with some kind of disability with their vision understand what is written, since they use the accessibility option of screen reader, and the -x at the end is impronounceable both in Portuguese and Spanish, and it also  sounds like a term that anglophonic people coined, not really a thing that was created genuinely and organically by us.<br><br><br>So yeah, to be more inclusive, you could say Latine or just Latin American Person/people.

As a young woman about to start college as a math and physics major, to know that there is this much hate for diversity in STEAM is hurtful to say the least. I have been discoraged countless times, to enter physics with the only reason given being that I am puerto rican woman, so it would be &quot;too difficult for me&quot;. This is dispite the fact that I almost always had the highest grades in math and science, and the fact that all my teachers said that I&#39;m &quot;naturaly talented in it&quot;.  Whenever I have conversations about astrophysics with my best friend (also a woman) on the train, we always get dirty looks from men. Most of the time (there are exceptions don&#39;t get me wrong), if I start talking about physics to a group that is predominately male, they will assume that I don&#39;t understand very basic and intuitive ideas dispite the fact that I have read countless books on the subject. If I start discussing a topic like dark matter or black holes, they will always try to silence me or one up me. (side note they never do any of the things I just mentioned to other males). On top of this, my calculus teacher (an absolutely brilliant woman) dreamed of becoming an engineer. The only reason why she is not an engineer today is because the employer literaly told her, &quot;Your perfectly qualified, but a woman can&#39;t do the difficult work of engineering&quot;. I can go on about my experiences and the experiences I&#39;ve heard from others, but I think you get my point. Wether you want to believe it or not, there is still an obserd amout of discrimination in STEAM, and it is this discrimination that prevents minorities (who are just as compitent) from entering their desired feilds. This is a discussion that needs to happen, and is something that needs to be understood by everyone in the community (men, women, ect). Until the day comes were nobody will be assumed to be less compitent, capable, or intelligent based soley on their gender identity, race, sexual orientation, or ethnic group, I will not stop fighting for diversity in STEAM.

The problem I have with this is that science as an institution and as a process strives to remove bias from itself and has come a really long way in doing so.  Focusing on this in today&#39;s culture is a bold step in the wrong direction.  A scientist may be a racist bigot who wouldn&#39;t know a post hoc ergo proctor hoc fallacy if it bit her in the backside and gave her &quot;hydrophobia&quot; ( a fallacy this video seems to be guilty of)  But there is no barrier preventing a charismatic black man with a penchant for science from thriving on YouTube, or in the scientific community at large.

Dude&#39;s got some funny ideas but he&#39;s always entertaining. <br><br>Now if you want to start talking about classism... That&#39;s an other topic but the fruit it bares will actually sustain an intelligent conversation and possibly effect positive change.  People like to make this about race because it&#39;s conceptually simple and solutions seem easy.  then when nothing changes they misdiagnose the problem as, &quot;Well I guess we must still have too much racism!&quot;   Racism isn&#39;t the reason Black people don&#39;t have allot of upward mobility.  Its a combination of a lack of wealth and the cultural influences (like this video) that come with that, as well as the perpetual stereotype that racism is a much bigger deal than it really is.  Ironically this video is part of the problem.  As long as we keep focusing on racism and telling people that this is the problem and where you should focus your energies. They will keep trying to find solutions to that problem and get no where.  Then, when it doesn&#39;t work, they say things like, &quot;Why bother getting into STEM, when its full of racist Bigots who won&#39;t let you succeed?&quot;  You&#39;re not helping people, you&#39;re hurting them with this BS. <br><br>TL:DR This is fallacious and its Ironic that they are point to, fallacious, bad scientists while they perform more fallacious, bad science of their own.", "comment_date": "2020-08-21T16:02:34Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Piotr Zaleski", "comment_text": "This is AMAZING how through 12min of of video there was not a single argument.

This is not to say, I think the Top 25 are all excellent science communicators but it is a little disheartening to see they are all white: we really need to think about the pathways that bring people to that position and how we can create new pathways that bring diversity in.<br><br>Journalism is one of the least diverse career fields in the US with about 70% of journalists being white. Science writing, which includes science journalism and PIOs, is almost 90% white according to a National Association of Science Writers survey in 2018.

This is a problem that NASW members acknowledged and are committed to telling more diverse stories. That may be all good and fine but there is the problem of perspective: they are going to tell these supposedly &quot;diverse&quot; stories through a white lens.

There are probably different reason for why certain people have more followers but whatever those numbers are, those are the people who are doing it better for those people. In this situation nothing much can be done by the viewers. If people want this changed, they either have to step up and do more/better videos or those with high numbers need to help advertise. Some people may also have a lot to say but don&#39;t have the personality to make it popular. This is a tough battle. <br><br>And secondly, any business with less than around 80% white people is being diverse.

You need to put numbers into context. What is the absolute number? People could look at that and think, &quot;Wow Facebook is being kind of racist.&quot; Based on the numbers they are over hiring other races than white, should that be of concern? If there were 100 people in the country and you said, we are only hiring 44 white people, you will be short about 35 people. <br><br>Racism is for people who can&#39;t think and need to be told what to do.

There is much more separating men from women and even that we are trying to hide. I understand the point you are trying to make and I think it is a good point.

Energy sources and consumption, food production and distribution, rising sea levels and the impact on coastal communities (I live near San Francisco), pretty much everything involving the Arctic Ocean... I focused mainly on logistics and auditing in my previous career, and those analytical skills will prove useful here as well. Geology was my third option, but I found that it requires a <i>lot</i> of advanced Calculus, which I haven&#39;t even looked at since I was a teenager. I&#39;d basically have to relearn it from scratch. And given how we don&#39;t know how much longer the pandemic, remote learning, and financial benefits will last, I want to get as much done as I can.<br><br>In the meantime, my channel isn&#39;t science-focused; it&#39;s just a collection of various videos I&#39;ve recorded during my adventures abroad. Check out my playlist on Iguazu Falls, the largest waterfall system on Earth! Or my ride on the Shanghai Maglev Train, the fastest train on Earth! I&#39;ve also taken tens of thousands of photos. Beaches, mountains, jungles, glaciers, deserts, volcanoes, ancient ruins, UNESCO sites, you name it, I&#39;m up for it.

I have a degree in Zoology and I can easily say that Animal Science is by far one of the most common scientific fields for women to have a career in. When I think about big names in the field, Jane Goodall and Diane Fossey are among those that helped to shape what the field is today. Many people that are within this field are here because of their pioneering work and were able to learn about it because of how extensively their careers were documented and displayed. I hope that in the future we will have more diverse representation in varying fields of science that is well appreciated and easily accessible for generations to come!", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T21:52:58Z", "likes_count": 64}, {"comment_by": "malik saddaf", "comment_text": "Thank you for talking about this.", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T21:51:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guillaume Thevenot", "comment_text": "Honestly this is a wrong debate.

Well represented and sound facts.<br><br>If for some odd reason anyone reads this, note that it will make very little sense if you haven&#39;t watched the video first :)<br><br>Claims and some of my thoughts:<br>1. White doctors treat black people differently<br>    - This is unacceptable! Should be discussed and handled!<br>2. Black people and syfilis experiment<br>    - Absolutely unacceptable! We can and should not tolerate this! Not solely because they were black people - but because it&#39;s a blatant violation of human rights!<br>3. &quot;Nature&quot; on trying to understand humans, and including few black and asian people<br>    - I have not read it, but on the face of it, it seems wrong, and it should at least be heavily debated to combat bias.<br>4. Research on research<br>    - I would find more information on this interesting. It&#39;s a major problem, if racist tendencies are the issue.<br>5. Diversity paradox<br>    - It&#39;s interesting, and just another argument for the value of diversity!<br>6. Google and Facebook&#39;s workforce seems to indicate racial bias.<br>    - It may seem so. I would love to focus on the proposed solutions to this issue.<br><br>Proposed solutions:<br>1. If scientists are surrounded by all white scientists, then it&#39;s a good time to bring up diversity<br>    - Well, hard to disagree with.<br>2.  Highlight more scientists or science communicators of other ethnicities.<br>    - I&#39;d hate for that to be necessary. I would love if we could just highlight the good stuff and not think about ethnicity at all, but maybe that&#39;s an outright naive thought... so sure :) It does make me kinda sad that the world perhaps cannot function like that by itself though.<br>3. Proposed solution to point 6 above: Hire more diverse people and create a culture and environment where people of different cultures actually want to work for these companies (Google, Facebook etc.).<br>    - I can agree with that - the conversation seems important at least. But I&#39;m not sure I understand how this should be implemented? Quotas? Encouragement? Financial encouragement? I would love something a bit more specific, to better understand what is proposed. I would really like to understand so I can try to form an opinion on the suggestion.<br>4. (I see that there is somewhat of an answer to my question in 3.) Public access to the breakdown of race and gender representation in specific jobs in specific companies.<br>    - I can understand that you&#39;re curious about who is building the algorithms (mentioned in the video) - I think that it could be interesting to review that data too, and maybe investigate the results of the algorithms and why they give the result that they do.<br><br>Question:<br>1. You cite a paper that says: The more diverse last names there are on scientific research, the more likely those papers are to be cited more often - which points to &quot;diversity = better quality science&quot;.<br>     - My question here is - how do I or how do you know, that you&#39;re not biased yourselves in that assessment? I mean, if diverse papers were cites less than none-diverse papers, wouldn&#39;t you then conclude that &quot;citing&quot; is biased in favor of white people and then, by extension, that frequent citings are not an indicator of high quality science but bias against people of color? I&#39;m just curious to learn your thoughts here.<br><br>Lastly you say:<br><br>Representation matters - well, I do not have a hard time believing that.

It all comes down to wealth inequality and inequality of opportunity. Yes, that correlates strongly with race, gender, and sexuality because of the past. And that&#39;s what I consider to be a useful definition of institutional racism. In that sense, institutional racism is as inarguable as inequality itself, because that&#39;s all it is - a phenomenon you notice when studying inequality. The problem has racist origins, but the solutions can be rather indifferent to race (policies can be purely based on equalizing financial equality). I don&#39;t actually like to use the term in this way though, because when people hear the word &quot;racism&quot; I think they can&#39;t help but ascribe it to human behavior, rather than an attribute of a system (which is what this definition is).<br><br>If you&#39;re talking about a hiring manager unconsciously favoring a white person, that&#39;s a totally different discussion. That is racism which has its roots in the human mind, which is what most people think of when they hear the word. We need to separate the two ideas of unconscious bias in individuals and what that adds up to in the larger system, and disparities that have their root in inequal opportunity (possibly because of racist myths, policy, etc.) or else we&#39;ll never get anything done. Both things are a problem, but I think we&#39;re constantly talking past each other because they are so different, require different solutions, some are harder to show than the other, etc. <br><br>I think this video doesn&#39;t do a great job at separating the two, or at least making mention of how important financial inequality is with regard to these problems.

While it begins with diversity in science education it quickly sways of to talk about systemic racism in general and not focused on the subject at hand.<br>Second, the sources chosen are repeats of what you hear in EVERY SINGLE ONE of these kinds of videos. While they are famous examples, basing the whole argument of systemic racism on only a few papers is the same unscientific fallacy causes such as climate change deniers use. Science is not based on single studies, but on the consense of a lot of reproducable studies, so searching for a bit more diversity in papers would be appreciated. In addition, it is known that being told the same information time and again can lead to strengthening of disbelief and dismissal regarding this matter.<br>Third, you completely forgo the reasons behind the representation mismatch. In the case of famous science youtubers, people from purely english speaking countries have an enourmous advantage, just based on the language compability. That leaves mainly the USA, the UK and Australia as main competitors. with the UK and Australia being predominately white, all the diversity comes from inside the USA, which IIRC has a black population of 10~15%. If you include the education suppression on minorities, not seeing a diverse set of personalities in the top ratings is to be expected. As for women, the nature/technical science branches sadly are still predominately studied by men, naturally lowering their presentation in science education.<br>The facebook/google workforce/leadership argument is overstating the matter.

Presuming that a real or perceived\r<br>relationship between things means that\r one is the cause of the other. or the sharpshooter fallacy Cherry-picking data clusters to suit an\r<br>argument, or finding a pattern to fit a\r presumption.  Just because there is a gap in preformance between whites and blacks does not mean the cause is racism.  There is also a gap between Asians and Whites where asians are out preforming whites.  Does that mean the institutions are bias towards asians and racists towards whites.  Also i believe this video implies the Black or white fallacy.  Where two alternative states are presented as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist.  For example it implies that either the most popular videos are majority white which means racism or that there is diversity(but does not say how much diversity is enough) therefore the institution is not racist.  So you are either diverse and not racist or not diverse and you are racist.    Aslo the way that you define racism is important.  To most racism is belief that other groups are superior or inferior due to some physical attributes.  If this definition is used which is quite specific, than things that can&#39;t think or believe can&#39;t be racist.  Sure a system can be designed and implemented by racist people but the system itslef is not racist.  The problem with this definition is that it is much harder to know if someone is racist because knowledge of their beliefs and thoughts are required.  But if you broaden the definition and make it to were any gap between races is racism then you asign racism no longer to people but to the systems, language, laws that people create.  This means that any &quot;thing&quot; can be racist as long as there is some difference between races.

It literally just says &quot;For Asian and Black chemists, the wage differential is largely due to discrimination&quot; and that&#39;s all! Check it by yourself, there are no arguments. <br><br>For the statistics about Google and Facebook etc... :<br><br>Both companies emerged from white Americans and most of the country is white.

Nobody holds them away from STEM via the quantity of melanin they hold. They choose another way. <br><br>In fact, if I had to summarize the whole &#39;privilege&#39; concept, it comes down to &#39;the results gained from successful execution of good choices....repeated... over and over&#39;. <br><br>If a person never makes those good choices to be put on a good path, that&#39;s on the individual or the mentors not fully explaining they have opportunity. <br><br>Systemic bias occurs when the mentors intentionally do not show those under their control that there is a better way up and out. If they willfully propagate the idea that you are stuck in one place and can&#39;t get out, they are saying you are not as valuable as those that are favored. That is the true haughty  supremacist attitude that poisons the mind of so many. They give an idea that...&#39;you are a victim, your worth is less, let me give you these benefits to soothe your pain. Vote for me next time to keep benefits coming.&#39;. Instead, the mentor should give idea that...&#39;you are a high value person, with high worth, you will be a great contributor to others lives, the world is best when you are at your best, let&#39;s find out what you are good at and develop those talents that you can use so that will help others.&#39;<br><br>Unfortunately, in IT (and the different STEM fields) there is a &#39;right stuff&#39; that prohibits everyone from choosing as an available option. Not everyone can do programming, create database schemas, edit DNS zone files, setup subnet masking, etc. This doesn&#39;t make one better, but skilled to do the task.

There has been enough research that, even though the western world is multicultural and that creates different subgroups in the population, the actual reason for specific groups actively not participating in certain fields of study/work is because in early life they are often discouraged; nurses are white women, cleaning people are Latina, doctors are white men, and rubbish collectors are black men. These set-in-stone images are part of our upbringing.<br><br>The problem with this is the solution. The fairest, most individualistic solution is to remove all biases and let everyone figure it out for themselves. Sadly, that is not how the human mind or society works. Whatever job you think of in your mind creates an image of someone you&#39;ve seen doing that job (or a voice or smell or feeling for blind people). This is just our brains&#39; way of understanding concepts. This means that biases in certain fields perpetuate themselves by everyone (minorities and the majority alike) semi-automatically. The only real solution, which isn&#39;t 100% equal but the only way to get the desired equitable outcome, is to artificially control diversity to open up these industries. This way, a more diverse group of people are inclined to follow education in non-diverse fields in the short term and in the long term we change the culture so that children who grow up in &quot;the new world&quot; might not feel pressured in one direction or the other. Eventually the mandated diversity isn&#39;t necessary, because the fields are already diverse, but to get there we&#39;ll have to force society into it.<br><br>An example of how this has worked in the past is Women doing &quot;men&#39;s jobs&quot; in the US during the second world war. Women, who were supposed to be stay-at-home mums according to societal norms,  were actively encouraged (or shamed through propaganda) to work in factories, shops, on farms, etc. Both the idea of women in the workforce became a point of feminist pride and, as a woman, working in a factory was a point of personal pride. When the men came back from the war and wanted to change everything back, the women rebelled, because society had changed to include them and now they didn&#39;t want to go back. They were too proud (positive meaning of proud). <br><br>As seen in the example and experiments galore, we must first change the society and then our values will follow.", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T18:02:11Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Alexis Day", "comment_text": "Hey ASAP Science!

Both of these scenarios are bad, in scenario #1 something is stopping the &#39;non-white-men&#39; people systemically  from pursuing science and in scenario #2 if there are enough &#39;non-white-men&#39; science people but not famous, then there is some kinda bias. I believe that with if both groups are provided the same treatment, then there would have been equal representation provided the sample is large enough.<br><br>And if something is stopping this natural ratio from happening, then forcing that in the name of diversity is required up to certain level to solve this is my opinion. <br><br>A good example is Indian caste system, a few upper class has been oppressing the other classes, practicing untouchability, denying them education and other basic rights for over 2000 years. And the result - despite the lower class  being the majority population (~70 to 80%), had very limited representation in all the fields like politics, management, law, art, media, education, you name it. And what did India leaders do? they put in reservation laws that made it mandatory for educational institutions and most government jobs to allocate x% to lower caste. This was done around 70 years ago and things have gotten better, this has encouraged people from families who never had any education to get educated, it relieved the effects of years of oppression. It drastically changed the lives of oppressed people.<br><br>If a set of people have been dominating something for a long time, its gonna take a long time for its effect to go away even if the current setup is an unbiased one and things like forced diversity programs are gonna speed up this effect to go away quickly.

I just wanted to quickly pop in and add my thoughts on this topic to the conversation. First off, I&#39;d like to thank Greg, Mitch and the ASAP science team for putting out this video. Even though our ideas don&#39;t necessarily run along the same road, we are all heading in the same direction, that direction being equality. To see such arguing in the comments can make one a little disheartened, and therefore I think that we need to really sit down as a community and have a civil conversation. You have provided the start to such a conversation; let me, along with the rest of the viewers, be the next ones to take up that mantle. We are eternally grateful that you have taken the step to introduce this important issue into the lines of conversation in your community of next-generation scientists. <br><br>If it is alright with you, allow me to start off with the points which I agree with! Systemic racism is a very real issue in today&#39;s society, and I think that we can all concur with that statement. And indeed, we as a society need to be making steps towards equality. However, it is how we choose to achieve our collective goal of equality. If you&#39;ll allow me to insert an example: an ideal world, employers would hire solely based off of an individual&#39;s skill level; this would be a world in which factors like race, ethnicity, religious beliefs and such held no weight in the evaluation of a person&#39;s hire-abilty. However, in the real world, within corporations and similar collectives, we can be- even if it is unconscious, biased in our decisions. It is a fault that people from all around the world hold. Now, we have put forward many measures to try and combat this racism, including laws and checks and balances systems. This is where my point of view on how to deal with the problem differs from some of the those which the video presents. Please, do correct me if I have misunderstood what you have really conveyed! At timestamp <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuAnbApl7A0&amp;t=8m51s\">8:51</a>, the video talks about hiring more diverse people and creating promotion opportunities for them! I agree! We do need more diversity in the field, as the statistics in the front half of the video clearly show. However, here is where I&#39;d like to offer my opinion. Does adversity make a better employee? This may be an extreme example, but it is a truth in our society nevertheless. If companies had to follow a plan of recruitment where they had to maintain a strict percentage of diversity, would that really solve the problem? If a coloured and a white individual, both of the same skill level, apply for the same position, should the company hire the coloured individual simply to maintain that percentage of diversity within the company employees? (although that does beg the question of which the employer should really be hiring, as both ways would seem to be biased. Please, anyone who&#39;s reading this thread, I&#39;d love to hear your ideas on how to solve this issue!) In my opinion, I think instead of &quot;forcing&quot; equality in the workforce, we should really be tackling the most fundamental of issues. We are all born equal, but it is these social factors that start introducing disadvantages into the lives of some. I think that the way to work around this concept of forcing equality may be to start making alterations to the educational system. Putting children on a equal playing field at a young age will rid them of these biased ideas which they may have otherwise carried with them into their adulthood. Xisumavoid, a lovely youtuber, does an amazing job explaining this concept, and I really do recommend giving his video a quick whirl and watch if you&#39;ve got the time! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjMciDEjWgM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjMciDEjWgM</a> <br><br><br>Once again, I feel the need to thank Mitch, Greg and the team for putting together this video. People are bound to disagree, and instead of battling it out, we should use this video and the subsequent comments section as an opportunity to foster a healthy debate. Only those rational enough to engage in such conversation with those who disagree, are the people who are capable of making a change. This topic is so important in today&#39;s society, and I am beyond glad to see it being discussed in the scientific community specifically as well. As a young, Chinese, bisexual girl entering high school, I&#39;ve always dreamed of one day working in STEM, and in my years of academic study, I&#39;ve developed a passion for biochemistry that I hope I will be able to pursue in my latter years. Seeing role models like Greg and Mitch fight for the next generation of young scientists is such a heartwarming feeling, and for that, I must go a step further and extend my personal thanks to you. May I even toe the line further, and crown you the Queens of Spreading Science and Love. Please, I&#39;d love to see people in the comments, and maybe even Greg and Mitch join in this conversation! We are so far from reaching our goal, and every shared idea contributes to our collective goal. One day, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll achieve it.", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T17:26:06Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Mikey", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_size#Biogeographic_variation\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_size#Biogeographic_variation</a><br><br>but this is true?", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T17:25:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noble", "comment_text": "Do you guys realize that diversity for the sake of diversity is kinda racist?

By complaining about things like the lack of women in STEM fields, the only way to solve that problem would be to put a priority on women. So, as a result, you are then hiring people based on their gender which is sexist. This is already a problem as there was a study that found that the ratio of men to women being given a job with the same qualification when applying to STEM field jobs were 1:2. The exact same could be applied to race, from the video it can be interpreted as &quot;hire more POC because they are POC&quot; which again is racist and also goes against one of the ideologies of Martin Luther King. Not to mention, you need to take location into the evaluation. If you look at Europe for example, black people will be the minority so don&#39;t expect a 1:1 ratio of workers. Can&#39;t forget either that just because there are fewer people in a field, doesn&#39;t mean you can just force them said filed. Human beings have a choice on what they want to do. So we shouldn&#39;t put pressure on girls to go into STEM field subjects if they don&#39;t want to. Finally, isn&#39;t it funny how you talk about how men dominate the STEM fields but yet women dominate psychology and in some cases biology to. Why is it that when a subject is male-dominated it&#39;s bad but when it&#39;s female-dominated it&#39;s good?", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T17:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "a panda on yt", "comment_text": "Omg i was so scared for a sec!<br>When the video notification popped up it only showed &quot;we need to talk about div...&quot; I thought about things that start with div... and I was so scared becouse i thought that they were getting a divorce or something 0~0 (i dont even know if they are married or not lol)", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T17:24:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bilboswaggings19", "comment_text": "so? should i unsub from you to help the numbers /s... i mean just look at top channels and its not that diverse, especially at the start of youtube", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T17:23:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hrithika Shetty", "comment_text": "Wow this was a complete blind spot for me!<br>Love from India!\ud83d\ude1a\ud83d\ude1a", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T17:23:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laura Weber", "comment_text": "Here comes the tar pit of a toxic comment section \ud83e\udd22", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T17:23:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Chiomento", "comment_text": "You could open your channel once a week or a month, to people with YouTube Channels with less views.

It&#39;s pretty obvious that it&#39;s a reflection of socioeconomic background. You can argue if that&#39;s due to institutional racism or it in combination with personal choice, but the job breakdown is always going to be a reflection of socioeconomic background that will be skewed more in favour of personal choice. This is for a few reasons:<br><br>There&#39;s an incentive on the part of whatever the institute is to have the best and brightest people working for them regardless of race, a racist institution won&#39;t be able to compete with a non-racist institution simply because they&#39;ll have access to fewer candidates. <br><br>Poorer people have less access to education, this is the unfortunate reality, but a race with a higher representation in this poorer demographic will have lower representation in higher skilled jobs. STEM institutes can&#39;t fix this problem simply by hiring based on race because if they do they will not be hiring the best candidates and will not be as competitive as possible. Poorer people essentially just have more hurdles on the path to success, while this isn&#39;t good, this isn&#39;t going to be fixed directly by employment, grants or scholarships will help, but this is a societal issue, not a STEM issue. If you&#39;ll pardon the pun, the root of the problem needs to be addressed but you are focused on the stem. Also, I doubt that simply seeing someone that looks like you succeeding isn&#39;t as helpful as actually being given the oppurtunites you need to succeed. <br><br>Finally, you&#39;re not taking into account what an individual wants to pursue. The point at which one considers themselves to be successful is in part shaped in relation to the success of one&#39;s parents. This could in turn effect the aspirations of those in high skilled jobs that come from a disadvantaged background and essentially just make them happier with less relative to those at the highest heights of whatever institution they work for. A similar trend is misinterpreted as sexism in the gender earnings gap; women, for whatever reason, tend to be happier than men at the same level of income. This means that men are more likely to ask for a promotion and contributes, along with hours worked and other factors, to the disparities in pay between men and women. I&#39;m not saying these things are the rule but you&#39;re dealing with huge numbers of people. Another example would be the success of many Asian people relative to other races in the United States.<br><br>TL;DR: it&#39;s not as simple as racism, there&#39;s a mireade of constantly shifting factors that result in this outcome.
