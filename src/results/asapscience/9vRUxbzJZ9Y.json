If he revealed a wrong door before you choose, then what are your odds of picking correctly. 50%. Just because you are asked to choose again after picking once, doesn&#39;t change that you are still choosing between two doors, so you are just as likely to have the car behind your door as it is to have the car behind the other door. Another way to look at the problem would be to look at it as a series of random guesses to two different questions. The first question is choose one of three doors. What is the probability that you choose a correct door and make it to the next question? 100%. We know this because he will always open a wrong door that is not yours, so you have a 100% chance of making it to the next question. The next question is choose one of two doors.

Let&#39;s use a deck of cards because it&#39;s easier to understand with more than 3 choices.  Most people are thinking of it this way: if the player chooses 1 card and the dealer exposes a losing card, the choice is between the player&#39;s 1 card and the remaining 50 cards.  If you switch to the 50 card pile (minus the player&#39;s card and the exposed card), you have a 50 in 52 chance of winning (NOT a 51 in 52, as people think in the 3-door example because the exposed card/door is out of play).  But that&#39;s not the game.  The game is the dealer spreads out all 52 cards.  The player chooses 1.  The dealer then flips over a card.  If the card is the A\u2660, the player loses.  If not, then the player can either keep their card or choose ONE of the remaining 50, giving the player a 1 in 50 chance of picking the correct card, whether they keep their card or picks another.  The player&#39;s chance doesn&#39;t change by switching cards, ALL of the cards have a 1 in 50 chance of being the correct card.  Each time the dealer exposes a card, that card is out of play, so the player&#39;s chance of winning goes up, but only slightly.  But the player&#39;s chance of winning never exceeds 50%.  The player has a 1 in 52 chance of losing in the first round (if the dealer exposes the A\u2660, but that doesn&#39;t mean the player has a 51 in 52 chance of winning. If the player&#39;s card is exposed at this point, they still only have a 1 in 51 chance of it being correct.  If they switch cards, that card still only has a 1 in 51 chance of being the correct card.<br><br>Each round, if only losing cards are exposed, the player&#39;s chance of losing decreases, but only by 1 in the number of items left.  In the last round, the player still only has a 1 in 2 chance of winning, not a 50 in 52.  Those other 50 cards have been removed from the equation as they are exposed.<br><br>Let&#39;s extrapolate this back to the &quot;3-doors&quot; example.  The player chooses 1 door.  A (ONLY ONE) losing door is exposed, which takes it out of play for the next round.  In round 2, the player is still left with a 1 in 2 chance of choosing the correct door, whichever door they choose.", "comment_date": "2022-07-30T19:09:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dienekes", "comment_text": "As explained, this is not a mathematical problem, but a psychological one.  The host could also be trying to tempt you into switching because door #1 DOES have the car and they are trying to get you to choose a door with the goat.  In which case you would more likely lose if switching.  <br><br>If left to pure mathematical chance, if you have 3 doors, you choose 1, and one of the other 2 is revealed (either the only one with the goat or a random one with a goat), that still leaves you with a 50/50 chance.

If this were true and it is <i>more</i> likely to get you to switch, then Monty Hall would not use this tactic.<br><br>From a purely mathematical standpoint (no psychology involved), as for the playing cards, if you started out with 2 cards, one of them being the A\u2660, would you still have a 1/52 chance of winning?  If not, then why not, since there are always 52 cards in the deck that the 2 were pulled from?  If so, then how does exposing the 50 cards after your pick change that?<br><br>Or, how about this: if someone pulls out 52 cards, exposes 50, and then asks you to pick between the 2 left, would each card then have a 1/52 chance of being the A\u2660, even though the other 50 are shown not to be the A\u2660or would one of them (a random one) be 52/ more likely to be a winner?  The answer is no, they would both have a 50/50 chance of being the right choice.<br><br>The key point of this is that you get to choose again.

Podemos denominar primeira urna e segunda urna.\r<br>Na primeira a\u00e7\u00e3o, o candidato pode retirar a bola branca ou qualquer uma das n bolas\r<br>pretas. Logo, existem n + 1 possibilidades para a primeira a\u00e7\u00e3o. Cada uma delas\r<br>determina a forma\u00e7\u00e3o da segunda urna. Vejamos: se o candidato tirar a bola branca, a\r<br>segunda urna se constituir\u00e1 de n - k bolas pretas; se o candidato tirar uma bola preta\r<br>ent\u00e3o a segunda urna se constituir\u00e1 de uma bola branca e n - k - 1 bolas pretas.\r<br>Lembramos que o apresentador tira da segunda urna k bolas pretas. Fica, portanto\r<br>determinado o espa\u00e7o amostral:\r<br>(branca; n - k bolas pretas)\r<br>(preta; branca e n - k - 1 bolas pretas)\r<br> \r<br>(preta; branca e n - k - 1 bolas pretas)\r<br>Cada possibilidade para a primeira a\u00e7\u00e3o gera n - k possibilidades para a segunda a\u00e7\u00e3o.\r<br>Temos assim uma matriz com n + 1 linhas e n - k colunas. Logo, o espa\u00e7o amostral \u00e9\r<br>formado por (n + 1)\u00b4(n - k) elementos. Nosso evento \u00e9 tirar a bola branca da segunda\r<br>urna. Assim, \u00e9 f\u00e1cil ver que o evento se constitui de n elementos.\r<br>A probabilidade de o candidato ganhar o pr\u00eamio \u00e9, portanto, P =\r<br>( 1)( )\r<br>n\r<br>n + n - k\r<br>com\r<br>1\u00a3 k &lt; n . Para n = 2 e k = 1 temos o caso tratado no in\u00edcio.\r<br>N\u00e3o necessitamos de nenhuma an\u00e1lise bayesiana (Thomas Bayes, S\u00e9culo 18). Veja que\r<br>com qualquer n\u00famero de bolas e com qualquer n\u00famero de bolas retiradas pelo\r<br>apresentador \u00e9 sempre vantagem fazer uma nova escolha depois da a\u00e7\u00e3o do\r<br>apresentador.\r<br>Vejamos o conhecido problema das tr\u00eas caixas proposto por Joseph Bertrand em 1889.\r<br>Considere tr\u00eas caixas. Uma delas cont\u00e9m duas moedas douradas, a segunda cont\u00e9m\r<br>duas moedas prateadas e a terceira uma dourada e outra prateada. Uma caixa \u00e9 escolhida\r<br>aleatoriamente e tamb\u00e9m aleatoriamente \u00e9 retirada uma moeda de dentro dessa caixa\r<br>que foi escolhida. Suponha que a moeda retirada seja dourada. A pergunta \u00e9: qual a\r<br>probabilidade da outra moeda que est\u00e1 dentro dessa caixa escolhida ser tamb\u00e9m\r<br>dourada? Algo me causa espanto quando ou\u00e7o que o senso comum tem como resposta\r<br>probabilidade igual a 1/2. Ora, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 senso comum ou mesmo bom senso em\r<br>probabilidade. A teoria \u00e9 bem estabelecida e quando se faz uma pergunta sobre\r<br>probabilidade n\u00e3o recorremos ao bom senso, recorremos \u00e0 determina\u00e7\u00e3o do espa\u00e7o\r<br>amostral e do subconjunto evento. Ali\u00e1s, o que significa bom senso ou senso comum?\r<br>Absolutamente nada, apenas del\u00edrio, um car\u00e3o oco de uma modelo ou de um efeminado.\r<br>Temos tr\u00eas caixas. Se a primeira for escolhida teremos duas possibilidades, a saber:\r<br>(D1, D2) e (D2, D1).\r<br>3\r<br>Em que D1 \u00e9 uma moeda dourada e D2 \u00e9 a outra moeda dourada.\r<br>Se a segunda caixa for escolhida teremos mais duas possibilidades:\r<br>(P1, P2) e (P2, P1).\r<br>Em que P1 \u00e9 uma moeda prateada e P2 \u00e9 a outra moeda prateada.\r<br>Se a terceira caixa for escolhida teremos ainda duas outras possibilidades:\r<br>(D, P) e (P, D).\r<br>Aqui, D \u00e9 uma moeda dourada e P \u00e9 uma moeda prateada. A primeira coordenada\r<br>significa a retirada de uma moeda e a segunda coordenada significa a moeda que ficou\r<br>na caixa.\r<br>Bem, em princ\u00edpio nosso espa\u00e7o amostral se constitui de seis elementos. Assim, temos\r<br>seis possibilidades. Por\u00e9m, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio lembrar que algumas possibilidades j\u00e1\r<br>aconteceram quando a moeda dourada foi retirada. Como n\u00e3o pode deixar de acontecer\r<br>o que j\u00e1 aconteceu, nosso espa\u00e7o amostral fica reduzido aos seguintes elementos:\r<br>{(D1, D2), (D2, D1), (D, P)}.\r<br>Qual \u00e9 ent\u00e3o a probabilidade da moeda que ficou na caixa ser dourada? Olhamos o\r<br>espa\u00e7o amostral acima e vemos que a probabilidade \u00e9 2/3. N\u00e3o vejo nenhuma \u201cintui\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d\r<br>que possa concluir ou mesmo suspeitar que a probabilidade seja 1/2!\r<br>Ant\u00f4nio Zumpano\r<br>Curso de Capacita\u00e7\u00e3o de Tutores EAD - Ver\u00e3o 2012", "comment_date": "2022-01-29T22:05:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ant\u00f4nio Zumpano", "comment_text": "There is no explanation to a probability problem.

Choose a door between 1 and 3. You chose door 1. That door IS your choice, and is now part of the IS category. The IS category has a 1 (# of chosen doors) over 3 (Total # of doors) or 1/3 chance of having your cash prize. <br><br><br>Any one of the other doors IS NOT your choice, and therefore, belongs to the IS NOT category. Now the IS NOT category has a simple calculation for probability: 2 (Total # of IS NOT doors) over 3 (Total # of doors), or 2/3. This number is important, because we will manipulate numbers within the IS NOT category, and that number (2/3) will convert probability within the category to total probability. We will call this the IS NOT Multiplier. <br><br><br>Now, since the host will never interact with the IS category, we can forget about it for a while and just look at the IS NOT category. In order to calculate the probability of any door in relation to the total, we just multiply its probability within the IS NOT category with the IS NOT Multiplier. For example, the probability of door 3 (as of right now) is 1 (# of chosen doors within IS NOT) over 2 (Total # of IS NOT doors that can have the prize) or 1/2 in the IS NOT category. Total probability is 1/2 (from before) times the IS NOT Multiplier, which crosses out &quot;Total # of IS NOT doors&quot; found in the denominator of the local probability and the numerator of the IS NOT Multiplier. So, 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3, which we recognize as the probability of the door on its own. <br><br><br>Now, when door 3 is revealed to actually be hiding a penguin, the odds change in the IS NOT category. Door 3 now has 0 chance of holding the cash, leaving door two to fill the gap in the IS NOT category. In other words, door 2&#39;s probability (within the IS NOT category) is now 1 (# of chosen doors within IS NOT) over 1 (Total # of IS NOT doors that can have the prize) or 1, since we know that door 3 cannot have that prize. <br><br><br>Finally, multiply this by the IS NOT Multiplier to get a result of 2/3 overall probability for that one door. This math can be extended to higher door problems, like if you needed to choose a door out of 5 and the host reveals 2 doors. that would be a IS of 1/5, and IS NOT of 4/5, and each remaining door (non-revealed door) in the IS NOT category 2/5 (there being two of them). 2/5 + 2/5 + 1/5 = 1, so the probabilities add up.<br><br><br>Hope that helps this problem make a little more sense.", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T04:52:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jasper Teng", "comment_text": "What if the door that open is based on a dice roll?

You draw first card out of 52 and yes, that card has a chance of 1/52 that it will be ace of spades. you will then show 50 cards with one left over, that potentialy might be the ace of spades, but that doesnt make it 51/52, it makes it 1/2. 50% Which means following the rule of this principle, the first of two cards has 1/52 chance to be the ace while the second one has 1/2 chance to be the ace, because you have only two unknown at that point. That is when two people are drawing. The first one has picked out of the whole deck and the second one is left with the second uknown card.\u00a0But should only person be drawing, these numbers will not change. <br><br>When it comes to the door, I would like you to answer this. 3 people and 3 goats. Each person will pick a goat to eat. But two of those goats will cause a persons death. Number two will eat his goat and dies. Both number 1 and number 3 will start thinking whether they want to switch their goats or not and  will follow your principle and start thinking, that while their initail chance of picking the healthy goat was 33.3%, now, number 3 has a chance of 66,6 percent of picking the healthy goat if he switches his goat with number 1 but number 1 has exactly the same chance of 66.6 percent for the goat of number 3, should he decide to change. But then number 1 realised, wait a second, If i have 66.6 chance on his goat, he must have the same chance on mine, and if mine has 66.6 chance of being healthy for number 3, shouldnt it has the same chance for me then? So sudenly both goats for both people has chance of 66.6 percent, which is imposible, but it shows that the odds are going to even and not shrink under the opposite choice in which case it must be 50/50.\u00a0<br><br>To proove it mathematically the first guys goat is X, the third guys is Y.<br>X goat has smaller chance in favour of Y ergo x&lt;Y but in the same time it works other way around for the 3rd guy X&gt;Y.<br>so if two conditions are X&gt;Y and in the same time X&lt;Y then they must be equal. <br><br>That itself prooves that the odds will never shrink simply under the 3rd doors or goat in this example. They will always even up. <br>what is misleading is the fact thatn one person is picking out of 3, but put 3 people picking out of 3 and you will get this.<br><br>To be honest I am no matematician.

They are all 2/3 chance of being a goat, because there are 2/3 goats. We don&#39;t actually know what is what. The &quot;switch&quot; is in another phase. The two phases are pick, and switch. So the switch has a different chance of being a car and a different chance of being a goat. Because if you stay, it has a 2/3 chance of being a goat.The chances change because you ARE given a new set of information, that information is that you know what&#39;s behind a door, a goat.

You know now, since we removed a goat,that the other remaining door stances has to be switched, since there is an even amount of goats, and an even amount of cars, so that the other door will be a goat, only if your door is a car,but, we know the chances of our door being a goat and a car. The two goats is what gives 2/3, so in phase II, when we know which door the goat lies in, the probabilities change and is not anymore the probability of 2/3 goat, but 1/3 goat. The reason that it is 2/3 car is because the stance of goat has to be changed. So 2/3 goat switched, is 2/3 car. And it also stances as 2/3 car because there are only two stances.

You choose door number 1, giving the probability of the prize being behind doors number 2 or 3 to be 2/3. Monty then opens one of the doors 2 or 3, which contains a goat.

The following is true:<br>There are 3 doors. 2 of the doors have goats. You pick 1 door. Since 2&gt;1, there&#39;s a 100% probability that there is a door you did not pick that contains a goat. They show you the goat you didn&#39;t pick, reducing the number of doors down to 2, and the number of goats down to 1.<br>At first, the probability that you picked a goat was 2/3, or 2 goats/3 doors, but since there is now 1 less goat and 1 less door, the probability that you picked a goat is now 1/2, or 1 goat/2 doors. There is also 1 door with a prize behind it. At first, the probability that you picked the prize was 1/3, or 1 prize/3 doors, but the fact that one of the other doors was removed CHANGES THE EQUATION! There are no longer 3 doors. There are now only 2 doors. There is still 1 prize. The odds of any one of the remaining doors having the prize is 1/2, or 1 prize/2 doors.\u00a0<br>Although your graphic at the end shows that there&#39;s a 6/9 chance you should switch, this is only true as long as all three doors are in play. One door is eliminated. Thus reducing the odds to 1/2.<br>As for the deck of cards, you have a 1/52 chance of your initial card being the Ace of Spades. Every card has a 1/52 chance. Once you remove 50 cards, there are only 2 unknown cards. This means that 1 card/2 cards is the Ace. It&#39;s not a 1/52 chance anymore because 50 of the 52 are removed from play.<br>The problem here is that you&#39;re reducing the denominator without doing the math, and you&#39;re getting a follow through error. If you want to prove that you&#39;re right, then do the experiment. 1000 times, pick a random door, and then switch once one is eliminated. 1000 times, pick a random door, and don&#39;t switch when it&#39;s eliminated.

After you&#39;ve picked a door, a bad door is removed and you&#39;re given an option to swap your pick. Let&#39;s call this game [X]<br><br>1) Since there are 2 bad doors and 1 good door, your chance of picking one of the bad doors is twice that of the good door.<br><br>2) After you&#39;ve picked a door, and one bad door has been removed, the door you&#39;ve picked are still twice as likely to be a bad door. Adding or removing doors does not change this fact since the decision was made when you had three doors to choose from.<br><br>3) Since your pick is twice as likely to be bad, swapping for the other door, as a result, is twice as likely to be good.<br><br>4) The act of swapping, IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, is a complete reversal: where good becomes bad and bad become good. It is as if there were 2 good doors and only one bad door. So which game would you play? Game [A] with 3 doors where 1 door has rewards OR game [B] with 3 doors where 2 doors has rewards (the reversed ratio of game [A])? If you do not swap, you&#39;re playing game [A]. If you swap you&#39;re playing game [B]. Think of game [A] and [B] as 2 different modes of game [X].<br><br>If you&#39;re still not convinced, keep reading.\u00a0<br><br>5) What if you&#39;re presented with only 2 doors from the get go, no door is removed and I&#39;m giving the chance to swap after I&#39;ve picked one? Well you&#39;ve guessed it, your chance is 50/50 whether you swap or not. The reversal effect of swapping discussed in #4 still takes place but a reversal of 50/50 is still 50/50. Let&#39;s call this game [C].<br><br>6) Then what the difference between game [C] and the swapping phase of game [X]? In the swapping phase of game [X], if you pick RANDOMLY (between swapping and not swapping), it&#39;s the exact same game as game [C]. However, you&#39;re NOT picking randomly, you actually know which door is twice as likely to be bad. This is what confuses people the most (myself included) as we always think of probability problems like this with 100% random picking.<br><br>7) As you may wonder how does the act of removing a bad door make the swap worth it? First of all, if no door is removed, swapping your bad door does not always result in a good door. That is, the reversal effect of swapping (point #4) wouldn&#39;t happen if a bad door isn&#39;t removed. Second of all, remember that they CANNOT remove the door you&#39;ve picked NOR the good door. If you have doors X, Y and Z; you pick door X; door Y is removed, then you&#39;re left with door X and door Z. This is where the magic happens: by deduction, you know that door X was not removed because you&#39;d picked it, whether it was good or bad did not matter. This gives you no information on which of the two doors to favor. Door Z, on the other hand, was not removed because chances are it&#39;s the good door. In other words, door Z has gone through the &quot;Test of removing&quot; which rises it chance of being the good door (more precisely double its chance of being the good door). With this information, you shouldn&#39;t play game [C] (i.e. decide whether to swap by flipping the coin). Instead, you swap for door Z.", "comment_date": "2013-12-12T20:05:57Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Lion", "comment_text": "just a thought i got:<br>Imagine two players. player A and player B.<br>player A pick a door.
