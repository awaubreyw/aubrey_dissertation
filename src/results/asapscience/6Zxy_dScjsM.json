You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don&#39;t even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends. And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that&#39;s not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don&#39;t belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears.

I don&#39;t try and upset people but my comments can sometimes be off topic. This is because since I was young my brain just doesn&#39;t stop inventing things and if I don&#39;t get a message out on the internet I feel like my head is going to explode. Once I have put my idea on some related channel I feel better. I would just email or message companies directly with my ideas but most companies aren&#39;t actually that accessable and I wouldn&#39;t care if the message went straight In the bin I just don&#39;t want to be bothered by the idea myself and sending the idea off helps me with that.<br>The other issue that makes me a troll is my scientific view of the world. Whenever I mention any of my theories I get call a troll and that&#39;s just because my view doesn&#39;t match the consensus even when I am commenting on topic it seems that scientists don&#39;t want to hear what I have to say even though some of my main theory makes predictions about reality that can and will be tested inadvertantly. I don&#39;t seek or get too many responses I just have to much to bottle that&#39;s all.<br>I have been working on the issue and have tried to target thoughts to the right parts of the internet and I have a blog to air my thoughts on although I want to eventually have my own website to blog on and show off my work.<br>Directing myself well will help with this issue but the science community can screw themselves if they think I&#39;m going to change my scientific view unless any predictions I make turn out wrong then it&#39;s only right to have to go back to the drawing board.<br>It&#39;s not like companies welcome your ideas with a set email address and it&#39;s not like scientists aren&#39;t sometimes a little arrogant calling theories facts even when they don&#39;t fit all the gathered data.

Thus, this explains a lot of their recent behavior on reddit and 4chan.

And when they take the bait (Fake Trump documents golden showers) and they always do, the trolls rejoice because they still can&#39;t believe how much power they have! When Hillary declared war on Pepe, the beloved meme it made them use it as a chance to take Pepe back from the normies.

But many of them find ways to actually end someone&#39;s life, without getting in trouble for it. I once met a sociopath, who basically bragged about having murdered(suffocated/strangled) a homeless man while working as a paramedic. He had been hit by a vehicle and was badly injured. Her &#39;excuse&#39; was that he &quot;grabbed her&quot;. When I asked what she meant by grabbing her, she was vague. She never mentioned the &quot;grabbing&quot; as being violent or sexual(and again, he was badly injured, on a stretcher). When I mentioned the possibility that he may have been in shock and wasn&#39;t fully aware of what was going on, and that his intent may not have been sexual or violent in any way, she coldly shrugged and said something like &quot;who knows&quot;, or &quot;maybe&quot;.", "comment_date": "2017-06-27T21:31:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stefan E", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zxy_dScjsM&amp;t=1m32s\">1:32</a> d.", "comment_date": "2017-06-27T19:13:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Skank Hunt", "comment_text": "Sup fuckwads", "comment_date": "2017-06-27T07:25:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mia Vocalz", "comment_text": "Waits for the trolls to go nuts on this video", "comment_date": "2017-06-23T08:26:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kneel", "comment_text": "sadism is the best smelling trash can", "comment_date": "2017-06-19T23:14:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "White Mike", "comment_text": "so why is makin valid points or asking simple questions considered by most to be trolling ..", "comment_date": "2017-06-18T05:47:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "garfled", "comment_text": "I got it, try to ignore trolls using random comments such as &#39;hello&#39; or &#39;I like pie&#39; the more random it is the more angry with you they get until they eventually give up on trying to annoy you!", "comment_date": "2017-06-17T16:19:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "abc", "comment_text": "Other YouTube channels: <b>reading mean comments</b><br>ASAP: <b>scientific evaluation of trolls</b>", "comment_date": "2017-06-17T06:17:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BonkMeabeab", "comment_text": "This video is so wrong and faaaake!", "comment_date": "2017-06-17T01:08:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JokicVision", "comment_text": "trolls dont act the same in real life \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-06-16T23:17:09Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "JokicVision", "comment_text": "what happen if all trolls could hack\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-06-16T23:15:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Myles Johnson", "comment_text": "I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Science", "comment_date": "2017-06-16T00:52:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lunchboxcravings", "comment_text": "How to start a flame war<br><br>1: post a comment", "comment_date": "2017-06-14T19:39:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Haw Yee?", "comment_text": "my favoite pokemon is Burmy", "comment_date": "2017-06-14T08:45:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarah", "comment_text": "every body trolls in they life idc idc idc", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T15:31:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nany Lover bunnys", "comment_text": "woo not true", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T03:46:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dustyboialex", "comment_text": "the comments in the beginning made me laugh so hard", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T01:54:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnny Cat", "comment_text": "how does asapscience have 6.6mil+ subs when there are only 1million people on earth?", "comment_date": "2017-06-10T19:32:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Its_MoMo_", "comment_text": "someone threw sodium chloride at me <br><br>it was a salt", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T23:31:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zipitcooldude's Channel", "comment_text": "I guess I&#39;m a sadist", "comment_date": "2017-06-07T16:33:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Goutham S", "comment_text": "NOW THE TROLLS KNOW ABOUT THEMSELVES WITHOUT THE HELP OF ANY 3rd PARTIES LIKE ASTROLOGER", "comment_date": "2017-06-07T14:42:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the anonymous nation", "comment_text": "waw you suck pls gett a life and i hate grammar", "comment_date": "2017-06-06T17:45:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LOL 879", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23blacklivesdontmatter\">#blacklivesdontmatter</a>", "comment_date": "2017-06-06T17:24:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LOL 879", "comment_text": "my pet rat was in the sewers with a bunch of baby turtles covered in radioactive ooze. should i be worried", "comment_date": "2017-06-06T17:17:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gary Chen", "comment_text": "The earth is flat", "comment_date": "2017-06-06T07:20:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary Chen", "comment_text": "I am always number one and I like to treat people cruelly", "comment_date": "2017-06-06T07:19:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate Owen", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude06!

I then eliminated option two - help an experimenter kill bugs because I thought to myself that because the job is to help an experimenter (as opposed to an exterminator) I would probably have to kill them in some grotesque way or kill a lot of them quickly or something science-y that I couldn&#39;t handle. I was left with options one and three.

Trolls&#39; pleasure comes not from inflicting pain, but by getting people to react in extreme ways (I.e.  lose their shit) over something inconsequential.  It is funny when people do that because it breaks the illusion that humans are somehow more rational than animals.  Trolls are really a symptom of a society that pretends to be &#39;civilized,&#39; which, at a closer look is merely an insane and irrational competition in a chaotic sea of conflicting self-interests.  Trolls are enlightened enough to see this while the rest of society pretends their choices are rational.  The reality is humans live like a bunch of pigs chasing their desires from moment to moment, rationalizing decisions after the fact rather than truly choosing the moral, logical or rational path.  So when someone points this fact out some people find it offensive but the display of cognitive dissonance by these people is very entertaining to watch, like a parent watching a child making cute assertions about something,, which they lack a understanding over.<br><br>TLDR:  Trolls are smarter and morally superior to you.

Surely most people feel joy when they succesfully prank someone by getting them confused or scared, this is mostly harmless play with someone. But nearly no people feel joy when they hit someone with their car who ends up in hispital. Both cases can be described as sadism though, so clearly there has to be a line somewhere.
