It was begun soon after The Hobbit was written and before its publication in 1937; but I did not go on with this sequel, for I wished first to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of the Elder Days, which had then been taking shape for some years. I desired to do this for my own satisfaction, and I had little hope that other people would be interested in this work, especially since it was primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of &#39;history&#39; for Elvish tongues.<br><br>When those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected little hope to no hope, I went back to the sequel, encouraged by requests from readers for more information concerning hobbits and their adventures. But the story was drawn irresistibly towards the older world, and became an account, as it were, of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been told. The process had begun in the writing of The Hobbit, in which there were already some references to the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the High-elves, and the orcs, as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of things higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, the Necromancer, the Ring. The discovery of the significance of these glimpses and of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the Third Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring.<br><br>Those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got it, but they had to wait a long time; for the composition of The Lord of the Rings went on at intervals during the years 1936 to 1949, a period in which I had many duties that I did not neglect, and many other interests as a learner and teacher that often absorbed me. The delay was, of course, also increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which year the tale had not yet reached the end of Book One. In spite of the darkness of the next five years I found that the story could not now be wholly abandoned, and I plodded on, mostly by night, till I stood by Balin&#39;s tomb in Moria. There I halted for a long while. It was almost a year later when I went on and so came to Lothlorien and the Great River late in 1941. In the next year I wrote the first drafts of the matter that now stands as Book Three, and the beginnings of chapters I and III of Book Five; and there as the beacons flared in Anorien and Theoden came to Harrowdale I stopped. Foresight had failed and there was no time for thought.<br><br>It was during 1944 that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a war which it was my task to conduct, or at least to report, I forced myself to tackle the journey of Frodo to Mordor. These chapters, eventually to become Book Four, were written and sent out as a serial to my son, Christopher, then in South Africa with the RAF. Nonetheless it took another five years before the tale was brought to its present end; in that time I changed my house, my chair, and my college, and the days though less dark were no less laborious. Then when the &#39;end&#39; had at last been reached the whole story had to be revised, and indeed largely re-written backwards. And it had to be typed, and re-typed: by me; the cost of professional typing by the ten-fingered was beyond my means.<br><br>The Lord of the Rings has been read by many people since it finally appeared in print; and I should like to say something here with reference to the many opinions or guesses that I have received or have read concerning the motives and meaning of the tale. The prime motive was the desire of a tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is appealing or moving, and for many the guide was inevitably often at fault. Some who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to complain, since I have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer. But even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed my story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at the same points; for I find from the letters that I have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially approved. The most critical reader of all, myself, now finds many defects, minor and major, but being fortunately under no obligation either to review the book or to write it again, he will pass over these in silence, except one that has been noted by others: the book is too short.<br><br>As for any inner meaning or &#39;message&#39;, it has in the intention of the author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. As the story grew it put down roots (into the past) and threw out unexpected branches: but its main theme was settled from the outset by the inevitable choice of the Ring as the link between it and The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, &quot;The Shadow of the Past&#39;, is one of the oldest parts of the tale. It was written long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster, and from that point the story would have developed along essentially the same lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before in mind, or in some cases already written, and little or nothing in it was modified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequels.<br><br>The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its conclusion. If it had inspired or directed the development of the legend, then certainly the Ring would have been seized and used against Sauron; he would not have been annihilated but enslaved, and Barad-dur would not have been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, would in the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would have made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge the self-styled Ruler of Middle-earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves.<br><br>Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of those who like allegory or topical reference. But I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse &#39;applicability&#39; with &#39;allegory&#39;; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.", "comment_date": "2013-11-15T13:12:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0639\u0645\u0631", "comment_text": "G+ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 G+ \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br>\u00a0\u258c\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u263b/\u2584/\u258c \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bob is held hostage \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br>/ \\ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 // \\\\ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and raped by Google+ lol", "comment_date": "2013-11-15T13:12:27Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "ThatOneGuy", "comment_text": "@Allison Higgins it&#39;s not our fault we&#39;re forced to have a google + account!", "comment_date": "2013-11-15T13:08:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Woodle Noodle", "comment_text": "\u00a0<br>\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 ]\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bob is building an army.<br>\u2582\u2584\u2585\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2585\u2584\u2583\u2582 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u263b/ \u00a0 This tank &amp; Bob are against Google+<br>Il\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588]. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/\u258c \u00a0Copy and Paste this all over YouTube<br>\u00a0 \u25e5\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25e4.. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/ \\", "comment_date": "2013-11-15T13:05:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allison Higgins", "comment_text": "All the people hating on g+ remember you are being a hypocrite after all you have to have a g+ account to comment", "comment_date": "2013-11-15T13:04:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ethan Ciarlo", "comment_text": "Why does time fly when you are having fun?", "comment_date": "2013-11-15T12:59:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik Nelson", "comment_text": "Is Brushing your teeth really that importaint?", "comment_date": "2013-11-15T12:56:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "groceries", "comment_text": "the science of time", "comment_date": "2013-11-15T12:55:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Corpor3aL", "comment_text": "silent but violent", "comment_date": "2013-11-15T12:54:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drizzy", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t read this because it actually works you will be kissed on the nearest Friday by the love of your life however if you don&#39;t post this on 5 videos you will die within 2 now you&#39;ve already started reading this don&#39;t stop this is scary put this on 5 videos in the next 143 minutes when when you are done press F6 and you lovers name will appear on the screen ", "comment_date": "2013-11-15T12:51:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Coffee Gardner", "comment_text": "\u00a0<br>\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 ]\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bob is building an army.<br>\u2582\u2584\u2585\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2585\u2584\u2583\u2582 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u263b/ \u00a0This tank &amp; Bob are against Google+<br>Il\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588]. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/\u258c \u00a0 \u00a0Copy and Paste this all over\u00a0<br>\u00a0 \u25e5\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25b2\u2299\u25e4.. \u00a0 \u00a0 / \\ \u00a0 \u00a0 Youtube if you are with us", "comment_date": "2013-11-15T12:49:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rachael C", "comment_text": "Omfg stop will all this bob shit!

Though, many objects have significant value to oneself, often having a life of its own, not necessarily anthropomorphic but rather spiritual with a story of its own significance. These objects are treated like human beings, almost seeming like they have their own personality. For example, my running shoes are like a jock that can\u2019t get enough exercise, and doesn\u2019t stop until they have DD pectorals. They have been through almost 650 miles, nearly 750,000 steps, and have that amped up adrenaline feel that I can even sense when wearing them. I also have my basketball. It has been like a teddy bear to me, I carry it everywhere, it has heard all my conversations, and knows all my secrets, and it is like my best friend. But if it could talk it would be one pissed off friend, considering I stick it in a smelly closet for half the year when it is cold and rainy. Then I have my socks. They always seem to comfort me with warmth, like a blanket for each foot, even thought that is pretty much what a sock is. These everyday objects, normal and lifeless to some, are my best friends. They hold very significant value to me, but in different ways.<br>My running shoes are the adrenaline junkies of my life. They push me to the absolute limit when I wear them, as if they are personified by Dean Karnazes. My shoes are a sweat filled pouch of mesh that looks like they have been to war and back. They have logged enough miles on them with the miracle that they are still intact, even though my sole is grinded a whole inch. The light blue color has begun to fade to a dull gray from the vast amount of wear-and-tear, although it still oozes an electric vibe. The shoes work just like any shoe would, but it\u2019s that vague sense of personality that I get that distinguishes them from all the rest. They are what pushed me to be a runner. When I got out on the course, they gave me the heart and soul, the energy, the passion, the drive to go on. They are my alter egos, practically my life. My running shoes are, in a sense, what made me who I am today.", "comment_date": "2013-11-14T19:58:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Coley", "comment_text": "For fuck sake the people moaning about the coments just shut up its just a comment system deal with it", "comment_date": "2013-11-14T19:58:30Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Kimberly Navarro", "comment_text": "Why are yawns contagious ", "comment_date": "2013-11-14T19:58:07Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Rebecca James", "comment_text": "Can you die of a broken heart? and how this happens ?", "comment_date": "2013-11-14T19:55:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Marcos Lotero", "comment_text": "why do we get brain freeze", "comment_date": "2013-11-14T19:55:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Ansermoz", "comment_text": "It&#39;s silent but violent not deadly", "comment_date": "2013-11-14T19:54:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stew Bard", "comment_text": "so this could explain creepers", "comment_date": "2013-11-14T19:54:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Parker", "comment_text": "I farted while watching this", "comment_date": "2013-11-14T19:54:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rizzy", "comment_text": "fuck bob, get a real tank", "comment_date": "2013-11-14T19:53:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ian Huang", "comment_text": "\u00a0\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550<br>\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u256d\u256c\u256e \u3000 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u00a0\u25e2<br>\u00a0\u2581\u256d\u2585\u2586\u2587\u25a1\u25a1\u2588\u2587\u2586\u2585\u2584\u2583\u2582\u2581(\u2573)\u2588\u256e \u3000Bob is building a army.<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2570\u2550\u2583__\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2220\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2594\u2594\u2594\u3000 \u3000 \u00a0 This helicopter with Bob in it is against<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u3000\u3000\u2559O \u00a0 \u2559O \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Google+ and the new comment system. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Copy and Paste this on every YouTube \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 video that you watch", "comment_date": "2013-11-14T19:51:40Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mcepicz10", "comment_text": "I Swear if this is what youtube comments is coming to its going to ruin it.
