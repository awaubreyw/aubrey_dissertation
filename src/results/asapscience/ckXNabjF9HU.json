How would that make sense. I could touch a dog excrement on the side of road with long or short nails and still have the same bacteria on my hands. Or at the least the same chance of getting E. Coli or something from it. Just annoys me that people are so germaphobic.  Even in  parts ofAfrica, they eat with their hands in the SAME bowl, and most likely NO sink or anything close to it. And are they sick? Do they spread bacteria around like crazy and infect eachother? No, they don&#39;t. If I never get proof of the bacteria that are commonly on my hands being dangerous, then I won&#39;t ever have any problem with them.

Hand Sanitizer kills the majority of germs that propagate on your hands but the tiny percentage that survives might still be able to thrive and cause problems. Besides, the germs are still on your hands even if dead until you wash them off. When done properly hand washing can force the germs off of your hands and down the drain, which eliminates the need for hand sanitizer. The reason is that soap\u2019s function is to trap the bacteria, so that when you wash the soap off you are taking the bacteria alongside it. Besides that, soap and water can remove visible dirt and grime that hand sanitizer isn\u2019t quite so effective at eliminating from your hands. As for antibacterial soaps it could be stated that using any soap that kills germs could be considered overkill mostly because by washing you are already sending the germs away, yet the main reasons to avoid any specific soap would primarily be if that soap has ingredients that harm the environment, or if you have an allergy to an ingredient in the soap type (which might be a problem in the case of some scented soaps; example: almond oil in a fragrance when you have a nut allergy).

If no one washes their hands unless there is visible dirt on them, then telling people to wash their hands for 40s doesn&#39;t solve any problem.

The reason the concentration of DNA on hands was higher in the trial you mentioned is because the Alcohol killed all the microbes, but left harmless DNA behind, while the handwashing removed some microbes and killed some, but left some able to reproduce and infect behind.
