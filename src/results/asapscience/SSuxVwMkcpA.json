And that starts with clean air, water, high sources of nutrition, organic, non-genetically modified would be best preferred opposed to just a traditional good clean high-protein diet. Even further away from fast food, soda, comfort food and drinks that have very little nutritional value if any at all. Also  if you want to take it up a notch from there you become formally educated and participate in a workout regiment that specializes in overall functionality. The steps will give one the strongest most advanced immune system their body can produce. The best way to deal with any injury, illness, disease, or sickness that may have already occurred within the body. Its with that same commitment to oneself. For part of the reason why so many American are easily infected. It is because they are soft, lazy, out of shape, over fed, undernourished, overworked, and underpaid weaklings  that have dirty low-paying jobs which come from outdated power sources, inferior materials poisonous, toxic substances, pesticides, and chemicals that never change their killing composition. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Which means whether it is a solid or liquid burnt off into our airways atmosphere as a vapor is always going to be poisonous, debilitating, and deadly to the body. At the same time polluting, corrupting, and devastating to mother earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world. I may add no pun intended that there is no cash profit to be made in the demise of the planet. Primarily due to those dirty low-paying jobs we are in the mist of environmental financial global collapse. Even worse for the last hundred and 50 years or so the mass majority of the population from coast-to-coast globally more so here in America have been living, dying off, and yielding the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested since the beginning of life only getting worse. This lack of comprehension conscious physical participation and solutions that lead to long-term permanent types of progress may be genetically inherited or a simple generic learned behavior. Quite possible for a person of today&#39;s population again more so here in America. Even more specifically Donald Trump and all the sellout suck up traitor to America trumpet blowers  to be a combination of all those worst-case scenarios combined is one.  And these facts are ignorant beyond retarded (no offense to any disabled people was intended.) Considering for the last 490 years give or take we have had the manpower woman influence to have created clean high-paying jobs from coast-to-coast globally which would constantly consistently be improving upon maintaining the quality of life to the highest degree possible.    \t\t\t\t This type of loyalty, devotion, and commitment to oneself and leadership. It would surely result in the mass majority of the population from coast-to-coast globally, naturally, gradually systematically almost effortlessly start becoming stronger, smarter,healthier, happier, better off physically mentally, and financially possibly spiritually. These points should be sincerely taken to heart considering the simple logic basic concept that if life is not free why the hell would death be any mother blanking cheaper? It&#39;s not, guaranteed. A question the common basic average man woman and child may be able to wonder is the spiritual cost to one&#39;s own soul and spirit when the freely live and die off having only used the smallest percentage of a fraction of the true potential they were first born with. Basically neglecting their own physical freedom throughout their life. Even worse than self-neglect desperate stupidity. Has been exacerbated for the last hundred and 50 years by people constantly inhaling petrified death. Drinking using contaminated water. Eating consuming things that have very little nutritional value if any at all.   Using working with manufacturer mass-producing products to the lowest standards of quality.  Versus the highest standards of quality which are organic, non-genetically modified, and earth friendly.

If so, follow the steps:<br><br>1) I invite you to get a PayPal Prepaid Mastercard\u00ae via email with my referral link provided in it. You scower the referral terms and obligations, limitations and advantages to having the prepaid paypal mastercard, and you decide you&#39;d like to try it.<br><br>2) You then order a new card using my referral information, which includes my referral link, which is <a href=\"https://www.paypal-prepaid.com/get-a-prepaid-card/?aid=PP_RTL_RAF_1&amp;site_id=RAF_MOB_URL&amp;uref=5323934216\">https://www.paypal-prepaid.com/get-a-prepaid-card/?aid=PP_RTL_RAF_1&amp;site_id=RAF_MOB_URL&amp;uref=5323934216</a> <br><br>and how you recieved my referral link, (via email); My name (Amber Hutcheson); My email address that you recieved the referral link from (amberh7875@gmail.com); And then you will need to email me with your email address and your name as well, because once you put in for the referral, or try to use my referral link, theres a chance that paypal will contact me asking if I referred you or not. They do this to ensure that you are actually my friend which is dumb. Its dumb because a new customer to them means more business, shouldnt matter if were friends or not. I think they do this to disqualify us maybe, so that they can get out of giving you and I both $20?? Anyhoe, its very crucial that you take down all of this information and provide it during sign up or the referral terms will not be fulfilled and neither of us will get our $20 referral bonus. Also, very important, make sure you dont sign up by just going to <a href=\"http://paypal.com/\">paypal.com</a>, rather you have to make sure that you actually click on my referral link and sign up there or the referral is no good.That click is tracked by them.<br><br>3) You then activate your new Paypal debit card, once you recieve it in the mail, and then verify your identity. Often they will ask for a bank statement with your name and account number displayed on it and they dont accept statements from any non-traditional banks or prepaid accounts. They will likely ask for your social security number and a copy of your drivers license. Maybe a piece of mail with your residential address and name printed on it, as well. Ensure that you are already equipped with all of this information before proceeding, due to the fact that there is a certain number of days from which you order your card that use of my referral code is good for. Also, tere are several different free scanner, fax, and email apps in the playstore that would likely get your documents to them quicker, via your cell phone.<br><br>4) You then add at least $40.00 to your PayPal Prepaid Card, within, I believe to be 14 business days? Not totally sure, so for this reason, and in an attempt to make this whole process as seamless and successful as possible, I would just call the paypal customer service card activation number that will come with your card in the mail and have them prompt you and step you through all of the steps to ensure that it gets done right and without consuming a bunch of your time. This $40 deposit can be done via mobile upload, in store cash load, or direct deposit. I would be thorough and open with them about your intended goal and any concerns or questions you may have. <br><br>5) You get a $20.00 credit and I get a $20.00 credit. That&#39;s it. May seem like a lot but its really not. Moreover, every bank has these very same and or similar guidelines and requirements for using referral codes and links. <br><br>Highlight- My referral link is also educational and informative in nature, so take some time to familiarize yourself with all of the info that it provides. Dont hesitate to email me with any questions or concerns. Please like and subscribe to my video so to help me find more lucky prospective referee&#39;s like yourself and thanks so much and God bless :)", "comment_date": "2020-09-21T05:16:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LukeLegend321", "comment_text": "I hope this virus ends\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude29", "comment_date": "2020-09-11T18:32:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackle The Mantle", "comment_text": "This comment section screams the message of what I have been saying for years to people - do not let religion overpower science/medical field.

THE BIBLE IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST! Jesus did not died to send us a &quot;book&quot;. He promised to send the gift of the Holy Spirit.

King James (2nd) beast, born 6/\u00ad1566, 6th of Scotland, authorized a bible in 1611 that now has 66 books to control people with, an image of God&#39;s word they make to speak (the bible says!). They got mark by carrying it (bible) in their hand and memorize it (verses) in their head. By having faith in this idol, they break the new covenant of having faith in the Living Christ through the Holy Spirit, who is the true word of God under this new era. A book cannot replace our King. If you esteem the bible as the word of God by putting faith on it then you have taken the mark of the beast. The bible became only history and has no authority in this generation. The bible is good for history but not for faith. Our faith must only in the spirit. Don&#39;t steal the faith of God&#39;s people from the past, it will fail you. You cannot live by someone else&#39;s faith. You need your own faith to build upon and live by it until the end. The bible cannot lead you home (heaven), the Holy Spirit can.

If so, what does this mean about its seriousness?", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T10:22:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J100", "comment_text": "Who else is sitting at home from the quarantine or self isolation", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T10:14:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "saima119", "comment_text": "I will definitely NOT be getting the vaccine \ud83d\udc89 because I don\u2019t trust the government for Shit.", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T10:13:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DF864", "comment_text": "You used to be useful", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T10:12:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wan Zongyi", "comment_text": "Me:Search up stores with hand sanitizer.<br><br>Google:No results found.", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T10:11:26Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Raphael Zhang", "comment_text": "Just FYI. Before you post any hate comment towards the Chinese communism government, it is also important to know those facts: <br>1st. Despite the US politicians lying about china hidding information about the n-cov19. The fact is that as early as January 3rd. 2020, the Chinese had already contacted WHO and CDC about the unknown novel coronarirus.(<a href=\"http://t.m.china.com.cn/convert/c_0MQY2YKI.htm)\">http://t.m.china.com.cn/convert/c_0MQY2YKI.htm)</a><br><br>2nd. China lockdown multiple cities to prevent the spreading the the epidemic and it worked, which gave the world 2 extra months reaction time for the virus.<br>However, trump said: it&#39;s just a flu.<br><br>Think about it with ur brain. Does it make the economy suffer more by not locking down the city and lie about everything, or by totally shutting down multiple cities and offer free food supply to billions of peoples.<br><br>The fact is that the us government and other Capitalism country do not want their stockmarket to suffer. &quot;As long as the upper class lives and get medical treatment ,who cares if the poor are dying or not&quot;. They love their money more than their people.<br><br>For each severe case of the n-cov, it costs the Chinese government averagely a quarter of a million dollars to treat them. But they built hundreds of new hospital within a month to make sure everyone in the country who have or not have any symptom of the new coronavirus, can get FREE TEST and FREE treatment as long as their want it.<br><br>(<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huoshenshan_Hospital\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huoshenshan_Hospital</a><br><br><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishenshan_Hospital)\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishenshan_Hospital)</a><br><br>In China, there are not such funny shit like &quot; Herd Immunity&quot;, &quot;not enough ICU bed&quot; and &quot;4.5 grand USD bill to get the n\u2013cov tested&quot;. The Chinese Government is not putting the responsibility on anyone else, instead of getting twitter addiction, they made sure everyone is tested and receiving proper treatment. The US govermment and international society already knows what happened back in January the 1st. So, stop talking <b>**</b> about china not sharing any information.<br><br>3rd. Thia virus had its first outbreak in China, does not mean it is the fking Chinese virus. It can happen anywhere at any time in any form. It is the punishment of the nature to what we have done. Same concept applies to the fact which we do not call AIDS the us sexual disease, nor do we call the Swine flu:&quot;the epedemic from us politician but we we don&#39;t give a fk flu&quot;. Despite the source of the n\u2013cov remains unknown(<a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/amp/chinese-news-51958854)\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/amp/chinese-news-51958854)</a>.<br><br>4th. Despite being treated unfairly, Chinese government had never and would never stopped exporting medical reaources to foreign countries. It has donated thousands of tons of medical resources to over 84countries already(including Italy, US, Serbia and so forth). Also, the price of the maks, sanitizer and other medical resources are traded in the market price before the pandemic(which means china did not rise the price). Another fun fact: china has already donated so much medical resources to Italy and the Itlian are taking it as granted , thinking it as the redemption of china( although china never did anything wrong) .AND THEY CAN ALWAYS BUY MASKS, RESPERATOR FROM CHINA, BUT THEY DONT WANT TO PAY ANYTHING.<br>(<a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2020-03/20/c_1125744389.ht)\">http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2020-03/20/c_1125744389.ht)</a>", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T10:01:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cezarekk", "comment_text": "Warsaw is singing.<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=kk6j3mSamB8&amp;feature=emb_logo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=kk6j3mSamB8&amp;feature=emb_logo</a>", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T09:58:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Shun \u2022 15 yr ago", "comment_text": "Karen\u2019s starting to form a new religion: TMATFVOC19 <br>The mums against the fake virus of covid 19.

I&#39;m doing my best to stop the spread of panic-inducing misinformation, and if people are thinking that the virus is really complex and the vaccine is taking ages then that makes them more anxious and more likely to do things like panic-buying.

Your whole argument falls with it. <br><br>     Also collapsing with this is your claim for this to be about &quot;believing in science&quot;, or that it proves that we should elect someone other than Trump who &quot;believes in science&quot; the way you do; science is not something to be &quot;believed in&quot; anyway,  that&#39;s an oxymoron.

It might be true if you said that it &quot;will not&quot; be done because not very good people, the kind who are filled with unsound prejudices like your own, are dominant in among journalists and bureaucracies and lawyers; but that&#39;s another matter.<br><br>      In reality, no society has ever survived without asking for existential sacrifices by citizens in emergencies. And we could easily find people to take the risk for the greater good. In the worst case we could even coerce people to do it. But in reality we would get it done without any coercion; society would simply invite volunteers to take the risk of sacrificing themselves for their country and for humanity in this way, offering some incentives such as moral reward, honors that would be bestowed on them or on their memories, and compensation for their family. We would find many who would do it, starting with old people who would soon die anyway and would care to leave a safe world for their progeny, military people and veterans for whom courageous sacrifice for their country is what they pride themselves in, lifetime prisoners who could redeem their names and get some money for their family by taking the risk, others who are simply at the end of their wits, and above all, loads of people who would do it out of sound idealistic reasons - far more sound than your own idealisms. <br><br>     Now, what ever happened to that claim of yours that it would take at least eight months, more likely a years or two, and that that&#39;s what &quot;believing in science&quot; means? And that everyone including Trump who cares about getting a vaccine soon enough to save potentially 100 million people around the world is an ignorant anti-science moron? Sure looks like the shoe is on the other foot and it&#39;s your prejudices that are anti-science, and monstrous from an ethical standpoint as well. I feel you really need to develop a sense of conscience about your apparent willingness to sacrifice millions of people to your social prejudices.", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T04:40:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amaan Akhtar", "comment_text": "The vaccine will not be infected in the body as injection instead , it will be spread near the nose of a infected one.", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T04:39:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ToOnZ PLAYZ", "comment_text": "Wasn&#39;t this guy in big brother", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T04:38:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joaquin Torres", "comment_text": "I like how people are scared of a virus that takes a week to show symptoms and only can kill old and people with weak immune systems if they don\u2019t go to a hospital", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T04:38:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "22kStyx", "comment_text": "Why is it always the bats Ebola and Corona", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T04:37:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GD3Media", "comment_text": "Dude looks like an alternate outfit Waldo.", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T04:36:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PluckySmurf", "comment_text": "Thanks boys!

The public health nurse who did her 3,6,12,18 months test said she was ahead in all her developmental stages. Using 2 word sentences at 1 year old. She is non verbal now and I fight every day just to get her to look at me or make sounds. Doctors said she regressed and have no explanation, even though it clearly happened after she was vaccinated. Her dr. Didn&#39;t want to give her the diagnosis, he gave every excuse possible as to why she was acting the way she was. I have the public health nurse come back to my home and do the same as she did just a week prior to her vaccine which she scored 98%, and after he only scored a 41%. Public health nurse is the one who put in a referral to me, to have the diagnosis. I don&#39;t know why it happened to my daughter, I believe vaccines are so important and living in a time like we are living in now it just gives you a glimpse of what living in a vaccine free world would look like.

Truth is, at that time in my life, with the stresses of work, my failing marriage and STRESS, it is no wonder my immune system was compromised.  Since then, I have improved my health greatly.  Lost weight, exercise regularly, and am really much healthier than I was.  (Still Old, but that&#39;s OK.)

Saul and Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD<br><br>(OMNS February 2, 2020) No matter which hospital a coronavirus patient may seek help from, the question is, Will they be able to leave walking out the front door, or end up being wheeled out the basement backdoor? Prompt administration of intravenous vitamin C, in high doses, can make the difference.<br><br>Abundant clinical evidence confirms vitamin C&#39;s effectiveness when used in sufficient quantity. [1]<br><br>Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. [2]<br>Specific instructions for intravenous vitamin C<br><br>The Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy (JCIT) recommends intravenous vitamin C (IVC) 12.5/25g (12,500 - 25,000 mg) for acute viral infections (influenza, herpes zoster, common cold, rubella, mumps, etc.) and virus mimetic infections (idiopathic sudden hearing loss, Bell&#39;s palsy). In adults, IVC 12.5g is given for early stage illness with mild symptoms, and IVC 25g for moderate to severe symptoms. IVC is usually administered once or twice a day for 2-5 continuous days, along with or without general treatments for viral infections.<br><br>IVC 12.5g cocktail<br>Sterile water 125 mL<br>50% Vitamin C 25 mL (12. 5g)<br>0.5M Magnesium sulfate 10 mL<br>Add Vitamin B complex <br>Drip for 30-40 min <br><br>IVC 25g cocktail<br>Sterile water 250 mL<br>50% Vitamin C 50 mL (25g)<br>0.5M Magnesium sulfate 20 mL<br>Add Vitamin B complex <br>Drip for 40-60 min <br><br>Patients with acute viral infections show a depletion of vitamin C and increasing free radicals and cellular dysfunction. Such patients should be treated with vitamin C, oral or IV, for neutralizing free radicals throughout the body and inside cells, maintaining physiological functions, and enhancing natural healing. If patients progress to sepsis, vitamin C should be added intravenously as soon as possible along with conventional therapy for sepsis.<br><br>Toronto Star, 30 May 2003: &quot;Fred Hui, MD believes that administering vitamin C intravenously is a treatment worth trying. And he&#39;d like to see people admitted to hospital for the pneumonia-like virus treated with the vitamin intravenously while also receiving the usual drugs for SARS. &#39;I appeal to hospitals to try this for people who already have SARS,&#39; says Hui. Members of the public would also do well to build up their levels of vitamin C, he says, adding that there is nothing to lose in trying it. &#39;This is one of the most harmless substances there is,&#39; Hui states. &#39;There used to be concern about kidney stones, but that was theoretical. It was never borne out in an actual case.&#39; Hui says he has found intravenous vitamin C effective in his medical practice with patients who have viral illnesses.&quot; [3]<br><br>Additional administration details are readily obtained from a free download of the complete Riordan Clinic Intravenous Vitamin C Protocol. [4] Although initially prepared for cancer patients, the protocol has found widespread application for many other diseases, particularly viral illnesses.<br><br>&quot;Research and experience has shown that a therapeutic goal of reaching a peak-plasma concentration of ~20 mM (350- 400 mg/dL) is most efficacious. (No increased toxicity for posoxidant IVC plasma vitamin C levels up to 780 mg/dL has been observed.) . . . [T]he administering physician begins with a series of three consecutive IVC infusions at the 15, 25, and 50 gram dosages followed by post IVC plasma vitamin C levels in order to determine the oxidative burden for that patient so that subsequent IVCs can be optimally dosed.&quot;<br><br>Pages 16-18 of the Riordan protocol present IVC administration instructions.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.doctoryourself.com/RiordanIVC.pdf\">http://www.doctoryourself.com/RiordanIVC.pdf</a> or <a href=\"https://riordanclinic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RiordanIVCprotocol_en.pdf\">https://riordanclinic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RiordanIVCprotocol_en.pdf</a><br><br>There are four pages of supporting references.<br><br>&quot;Given the rapid rate of success of intravenous vitamin C in viral diseases, I strongly believe it would be my first recommendation in the management of corona virus infections.&quot;<br><br>(Victor A.

It has been used for centuries to fight it and actually, Jean Lugol, the French doctor who discovered it helped stop the spread of Tuberculosis in France in 1880! So take 8 drops (for adults, 4 drops for kids 1-16 y/o, 1 drop for newborns mixed with 1 teaspoon of butter or coconut oil) daily in the mornings in a glass of water(150mL) to up your immune system and get rid of any foreign virus, bacteria, fungus your body doesn&#39;t need. Though Lugol&#39;s iodine kills most pathogens on the skin within 90 seconds, its use as an antibiotic/antiviral/antifungal has been completely ignored by modern medicine so we do not hear one word about it as the coronavirus spreads.<br>Lugol&#39;s Iodine exhibits activity against bacteria, molds, yeasts, protozoa, and many viruses; indeed, of all antiseptic preparations suitable for direct use on humans and animals and upon tissues, only Lugol&#39;s iodine is capable of killing all classes of pathogens: gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, yeasts, viruses and protozoa. Most bacteria are killed within 15 to 30 seconds of contact.<br>Dr. Derry reminds us that a long time ago students in classrooms were protected from influenza by Lugol&#39;s iodine aerosol therapy. Aerosol iodine also is effective against freshly sprayed influenza virus.<br>Dr. David Brownstein says, \u201cLugol&#39;s Iodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to Lugol&#39;s iodine.\u201d Lower your sugar intake. Virus thrives in a sugar environment so don&#39;t feed it.
