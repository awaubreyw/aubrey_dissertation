While you believe we need ostrich feet and ankles for balance and walking purposes, it would take away lots of things from those who like to climb or other actions that ostriches cannot physically perform. Besides, the only goal here is to make the human body as protective as possible (to make death less likely). Other factors such as happiness are not considered - humans have learned to work with their bodies for millions of various activities, which make them unique from other creatures. We can swim, climb trees, play a drum set, create technology, build large structures, and so much more - other animals are limited to a few actions due to their own physical and mental abilities. Lastly, our physical features balance out our mental abilities. Other animals have other cool physical features such as the ones listed in the video, but we have more elaborate mental abilities; it&#39;s definitely an advantage, considering we took over most of the world&#39;s land.<br>Another thing I would like to point out is the choice of the octopus eyes. Those animals live deep under water, and, as mentioned, they are very photosensitive. On land, they would not be optimal for sight because light travels through air better than it does through water. Not only that, but octopus eyes are constantly submerged. With nothing but air surrounding them, they could dry out quickly.

So in short, WW1 would have caused human kind&#39;s utter extinction if we had bird lungs.  Though I&#39;ll give you, our tolerance to pollution is dubious since it encourages more pollution.  <br><br>For the feet, nice, but ostrich feet are digitigrade, vs human plantigrade, meaning the bird-footed &quot;stands&quot; on their muscle power instead of their bones, meaning that human can&#39;t travel as far looking for food, and will struggle to carry it back.   In modern parlance this means they can&#39;t carry as much, can&#39;t work on their feet as hard, and will get less work done as a result in any kind of standing job.    Also consider warfare for a moment.  Plantigrade humans are able to carry more weight father than a theoretical digitgrade human.  This means military humans as we know it can march farther with heavier armor/weapons than ostrich-feet humans, meaning they will out maneuver their enemy in forced marching, and have better defense in combat thanks to that heavy armor.  Thus their armies will win the wars, and guess what, losers are wiped out of the gene pools in ancient warfare, which was typically genocidal.   Remember a KEY part of bloodlines surviving to the modern day is the ability to win wars in the ancient days.    There is a reason after all we have Italians today but no Carthaginians, Greeks but no Trojans, Norwegians but almost no Sami.  <br><br>That said, yes agree that humans COULD use a reduction of bones in the feet, but the overall design of human feet is actually very good despite the weaknesses.   <br><br>2 dimensional knees good luck remaining standing.  There isn&#39;t a walking animal alive that has multi-directional knees.  See everything I mentioned about being able to carry more weight father to win wars, this applies here too.   Also weak-kneed unbalanced people would be terrible farmers, which is all about lots and lots of hard work and heavy carrying.    And given you are far more likely to NOT suffer a catastrophic knee injury, and the advantage are so huge, we see why nature selected this design.  <br><br>Octopus eyes, you literally will not be able to focus finely enough to read.  You NEED round pupils for detailed vision.  Have fun being illiterate and unable to work on or create anything with fine details.   So how about we steal an octopus&#39;s retinas.  <br><br>No neck?  Well we wouldn&#39;t have made it then either.  Without the ability to swing our heads around &quot;on a swivel&quot; we never would have been able to both find prey and evade predators to make it to the agriculture phase.  And if somehow no-necks made it that far, they would be obliterated by the necked in warfare since they...well can&#39;t really look around without making awkward twists in a battle, thus giving up situational awareness to necked, who would defeat and kill them in combat.   <br><br>As for the ribs, while Graham might survive car-crashes, he is going to trade off the stability of his rib cage to be a &quot;core&quot; to attach his arm muscles.  Consider people can and have had 2x4&#39;s shoved though their chest and lived, the trade off for FAR more functional strength and stability is worth the risk.

Then we would build a massive network for this computer system that could be expanded infinitely through space by these robots. Meanwhile, our consciousnesses could live in the virtual world maintained by the robots. Of course we would be able to move our consciousnesses into the robots as well if need be and we would have redundancy built throughout the network to prevent us from being erased.

For instance, yes cephalopods don&#39;t have blind spots since their eyes evolved better than ours, but mantis shrimps have 16 different types of cones, allowing them to see colors we can&#39;t even imagine, so why not add that in while we&#39;re at it? Jellyfish are biologically immortal, let&#39;s add those features too. Maybe some humans want to have adaptations of certain sea animals to better swim, maybe adaptations for flying... you get the point, it starts becoming a mess, because everyone&#39;s definition of &quot;perfect&quot; is unique, and we eventually get into the conversation of talking about the perfect organism, not the perfect human.<br><br>So instead let&#39;s talk about a &quot;Flawless&quot; human instead, or at least a &quot;nearly flawless&quot; human. This means removing major flaws from our biology, but leaving alone features and parts that do their job exactly as intended with no major drawbacks. I won&#39;t look at things that might improve our current day-to-day lives, just things that we could&#39;ve started with 10,000 years ago when we were still hunter-gatherers and would still aid us today.<br><br>From the top,<br>1) Eyes - yes, we can fix our blind spot as described in the video, and have better lenses to work with much like cephalopods, good job, no need for other improvements.<br>2) Ears - To my understanding, there&#39;s no major flaws with our ears: they hear the range intended just fine, nothing more to say here.<br>3) Sinuses - This is a missed opportunity that needs fixing. The mucus in our sinuses, and in all other mammals, are designed to drain down the back of our throat into our stomach - but our lower sinuses have to drain **upwards**,  a g a i n s t  gravity. These lower sinuses either need to shrink, or the shape of our skulls need to change so that our sinuses drain properly and lower the amount of infections that happen.<br>4) Necks - Unless I&#39;m mistaken, every vertebrate has a neck, be it long or short, and the only thing we might want to consider would be to give it more reinforcement if it&#39;s something our ancestors have had problems with as well.<br>5) Respiratory System - Yep, using bird lungs are a direct upgrade that we could use, no arguments here. However, the  s e v e r e  issue of humans choking more frequently than even other mammals is something that needs to be addressed. Since we can&#39;t necessarily connect our nostrils directly to our lungs, since we still our sinuses to drain excess mucus into the stomach, we could at least do some tampering and move around the tubes to make choking much less of a hazard.<br>6) Unless there&#39;s an animal out there with ribs that improve upon some current flaw with ours that I&#39;m not aware of, we don&#39;t need Graham&#39;s ribs, ours work as intended very well.<br>7) Back - Our backs are <b>*barely*</b> designed to hold ourselves upright, and there aren&#39;t many other references in the animal kingdom we can use to fix the various back issues we have with it, so the best we could do would be to give it some additional structural integrity to better hold our weight up.<br>8) Reproductive System - No arguments with the points made in the video, pouches eliminate the period problems, birth problems, and is probably less taxing on giving nutrients to the baby while it&#39;s developing, so this works well.

I know this is a slippery-slope fallacy, I do get that, but I was born with a number of disabilities which are all pretty critical to my identity. Had I not been born with disabilities, I wouldn&#39;t have the life or friends that I do. And I like my life and friends. When it comes to tampering with genes, we are talking about the potential to decrease biodiversity. Let&#39;s say some homophobic prick, for example, gets their hands on it and decides to breed out the various genes that can be linked to homosexuality. and yes, I know it goes deeper than JUST genes, and certainly goes MUCH deeper than just one gene, duh, but...if you could choose, both of you, would you retain that identity? I imagine you both have enough integrity and good sense to tell me no, and it&#39;s the same with ANY OYHER identity...because perfection cannot be judged by an external standard.
