As for the hosts, I feel like these guys are trying too hard to make every single part a joke. Obviously there\u2019s no one type of comedy, but I think a lot of the pushback people are probably giving when they\u2019re saying that they\u2019re \u201ctoo much\u201d as I\u2019ve seen a lot of comments point out is that their attempts to joke are too frequent. They aren\u2019t really setting up any punchlines, they\u2019re just describing every single part in a goofy way, which quite frankly isn\u2019t very funny. I would highly recommend looking at youtubers like Casually Explained, who do a good job describing a topic while properly seasoning it with humor. You don\u2019t need a comedian like him, but notice how he properly balance the use of jokes and explaining his topic. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QGj15uvuPLA\">https://youtu.be/QGj15uvuPLA</a>", "comment_date": "2018-11-19T18:05:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oberfor", "comment_text": "these guys are so chill and the animations are really awesome. <br>I dont really understand the people who dislike this - they are problably just superficial jerks", "comment_date": "2018-11-19T17:50:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wolfses The Night Eye", "comment_text": "What are you doing not having Joey Diaz and Joe Rogan here!!!!!", "comment_date": "2018-11-19T17:25:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ianuky Td", "comment_text": "I like this channel but im homophobic so dislike <br><br>Who agrees", "comment_date": "2018-11-19T16:58:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Shirz", "comment_text": "Lol that guy has painted nails", "comment_date": "2018-11-19T15:04:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samzz", "comment_text": "Nose hole=nostrils.", "comment_date": "2018-11-19T14:49:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Sameowl", "comment_text": "Entertaining indeed.", "comment_date": "2018-11-19T14:01:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H Sings", "comment_text": "sad", "comment_date": "2018-11-19T13:11:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daxter T.
