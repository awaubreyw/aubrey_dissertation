Can the appearance of actors In movies change how you act about them in real life. For example: Hugh Jackman is most famous for taking the part as the wolverine.

Will this make you react to him as scared to go near him or have the slight thought of him putting his claws through your neck even though you know he is just an actor??? Or Josh hutcherson. He is most famous for peeta. Will this make you more attracted to him because of his adventurous style or his heart to save katnis in the movies while you know he is just an actor and is normal like everyone else?
