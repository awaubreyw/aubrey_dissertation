That&#39;s why is so difficult to socialize and we tend to feel lack of energy. Because we need to use our energy for paying attention to what others have to say, Specially with people with other interests in a conversation. We just can&#39;t wait to finish talking so we could go home or someplace to be alone with our thoughts or projects. extroverts are  more expressive and feel uncomfortable with there inner thoughts they like to be heard. As an introvert I love solitude because it lets me create better with no distractions but I also recognized I use it to be protected from comments that coul compromise my sense of self. Words that could sabotage my inner dialogue in a bad way. I also recognize that when I am in a setting were I am with someone who shares the same interest as me or there is a boundary of respect between each other I feel more fluent with my words and even more out of my head. So i am guessing it&#39;s more a matter of connectiveness with the inner being rather than letting external circumstances determine you. Sometimes you will find yourself alone, other times people will be a round you, but you will still be the same person.

All I did was share my husband\u2019s phone number with Cyberhackinggenius and I was able to read both his new and deleted messages from my phone without having to touch his phone. My husband was a cheating Introvert and I\u2019m glad to find out all his secrets and infidelity with the help of cyberhackinggenius. I\u2019m here in UK and able to access my husband\u2019s phone messages with a link on my phone even while he was away in Canada cheating on me. I got to discover that my husband who is legally married to me here in UK is also recently married to another woman in Canada and I\u2019m finally going through a divorce with lots of evidence against him. I read all deleted and recent chats on his Whatsapp, Twitter,Facebook,Instagram messages and Skype. You can contact this great hacker \u201cGavin\u201d via Gmail\u00a0 (cyberhackinggenius) or text and speak to him directly on his phone and WhatsApp : +19256795146 and thank me later!", "comment_date": "2020-02-05T03:51:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cameron???", "comment_text": "INTROVERT GANG- ASSEMBLE!!", "comment_date": "2020-02-05T01:50:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Astorga", "comment_text": "Well I have hardly ever felt depressed, but I&#39;m VERY anxious.", "comment_date": "2020-02-05T00:51:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Toby Edmonstone", "comment_text": "I&#39;m more introverted than any of you.

Yes, it seems quite unlikely but I&#39;d like to elaborate on the ambivert section as it is not provided in the video. I would call myself an ambivert, why? Well, first I&#39;m not someone who likes to avoid social interaction (I&#39;m not saying its bad to do so). Neither do I love to be in the spotlight 24/7, so I&#39;m selectively social. I avoid interactions when I don not feel like taking part in them, not because I&#39;m shy to be judged or so. I&#39;m not awkward, I can keep up conversations (and quite frankly I have lots of friends and acquaintances) but I only keep few (2-3) very close. I&#39;m very confident while speaking in public and expressing my opinions (those are the times where I&#39;d love to be in the spotlight) However, there are moments where I just want to shut down, hole up in my apartment to read a book. So, I&#39;m not at the either end of the scale. Somewhere in between. Also, I&#39;d like to mention, I was more extroverted than I am now (I&#39;m more on the introvert side) I think I can shift, where I am uneasy to talk to anyone or when I get social sprees where I make a target to make new friends or to improve friendships.

Introversion is when you are drained by stimulation, no matter how much you enjoy it or do it. You can be an extremely sociable person and still be introverted because you are simply drained after a long while with large amounts of people. Extraversion is when you gain more energy and thrill from being with others and function at your best in stimulation. Being alone and doing little drains you, no matter how much you enjoy it. Ambiversion is when you are able to function extremely well in lots of stimulation or very little stimulation. You dont only get drained by one or the other, either. Then again, I haven&#39;t looked into ambiversion as much, so what do I know? I&#39;m only super passionate about subjects like these.

From age 16 through 21 I was an extreme extrovert and engaged in constant socialization, wilderness adventures, wild parties and raves, and generally lived and thrived on the fringe of society. At age 21 I was struck by a car while riding my bicycle home from a friend&#39;s house. My left temporal bone in my skull was fractured severely and I suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in my left temporal lobe, which is the speech, communication, and language center of the brain as far as scientists currently know. From age 21 through today I slowly became more introverted and now I am happiest when I spend the majority of my time alone in quiet study, creating art and music as well as writing creative, analytical, and scientific essays. I still need some social time, but my need for socialization is minimal these days. I now become socially exhausted after spending more than 24 hours with friends or extended family. I need a long period of &quot;decompression&quot; or relaxation time to recover from social events. Overall, I believe my personality exists somewhere on the left side of the middle of the spectrum where far left is strong introversion, middle is ambiversion, and far right is strong extroversion. Ultimately, it is clear now that personality type shifts dramatically over the lifespan. However, it is probable that some people shift more than others. Great video by the way!

The stuff they mentioned in the video doesn&#39;t determine your type (so if you like doing both introverted and extroverted activities, it doesn&#39;t mean anything), but it&#39;s kind of like Extrovert and Introvert tendencies. I would usually just say that if you&#39;re an introvert, you like spending time by yourself (it doesn&#39;t matter how loud or gregarious you are) and draw energy from being by yourself, and if your an extrovert you prefer being around people (even if you are socially awkward or quiet).

Under some circumstances we may act or behave toward the extrovert side. Other times and circumstances we may lean more toward introvert. It is possible to be closer to the center of this scale and possibly we can exist strongly toward introvert or extrovert. Everyone is different and we may actually change our traits and move toward either end of the scale depending upon our experiences and age. There is nothing to suggest that one set of traits is better or worse than any other traits. We are what we are. I&#39;m not sure if Myers/Briggs or Jung suggests introvert/extrovert has any correlation to intelligence since intelligence may change with age, education and experiences.", "comment_date": "2016-10-22T20:18:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unboxing queen\ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udc51", "comment_text": "i dont believe that I&#39;m an introvert but my family did this to me.

As someone who knows quite a bit of intro- and extroverted people, I grow kind of tired of hearing them break each other down. Introverted friends often say how intelligent and creative they are and how dumb extroverted people are (in their opinion). Extroverted people are often pictured as loud, speak-before-you-think, blabbing arrogant people who live life without any sense of sensitivity or intellectual thoughts. I agree that society is built to appreciate extroverted people more, and this sucks. But I feel like introverted people&#39;s reaction to this is often to reduce extroverted people to &#39;idiots&#39; to try so they can make themselves feel better about being introverted. Extroverted people can be incredibly sensitive and insecure. They just get their energy from different things (like hanging out with many friends), but at the end of the day they are just as human as introverted people. The dislike works both ways by the way. Extroverted people sometimes think all introverted people hate interacting with others, when really they just don&#39;t like big crowds. Not only because it makes them feel stressed or uncomfortable, but also because it&#39;s just not interesting or fun to them and they&#39;d rather have a deeper conversation with one person they like. I think there is such a thing as intro- and extroversion, but A) I believe they are situated on two sides of a spectrum and there is such a thing as people who are neither (somewhat in between, like ambivert) and B) I don&#39;t think either one is better than the other. It&#39;s wonderful that there are so many different people out there, it&#39;s what makes this world so interesting. I consider myself an ambivert, but anyone is welcome in my club.

Well, this feeling persists for the rest of the day until I find myself back home, staring at the ceiling in contemplation about what the hell happened. Oddly enough, I feel super calm and collected whilst contemplating this. Oftentimes wishing that that moment of fleeting bliss would last the rest of my life, and dreading what emotions the next day will hold. Sometimes I find myself in tears for no apparent reason after an episode of this has gone by... Unfortunately, this is how the majority of my highschool life has been since freshman year (I&#39;m now a Senior). I haven&#39;t always been like this.
