Also read up on it before you take it. Start with half a pill if its in pill form (powder is better though) also dont continuously take more if you&#39;re new to keep the high. If someone you know starts acting too weird and is sweating more than everyone else take them outside or somewhere to cool off.

I tried it when I was just about to turn 16, and it was pretty awful. Granted, I was an idiot and took a full pill outside in February in the UK all on my own and it didn&#39;t end too well. But that&#39;s not the main problem. The main problem is the fatigue, extreme paranoia and depression that follows in the weeks after. I couldn&#39;t sleep for hours and hours every night for at least a week. At night I was extremely paranoid, not like weed paranoia, but the fear that something beyond you is lurking just outside of your vision and you are in great danger. Cigarettes and alcohol had little effect of relieving this. All my muscles were exhausted for a few days.

I didn\u2019t feel a high. I just felt weird. But I loved the sensation that we both where just talking laying down and how he opened up to me. We did have some technical problems, if you know what I mean. I wouldn\u2019t like to take it again. I\u2019d rather take a tequila shot, or have a whiskey.

I heard that it could help me in certain areas. I broke me back in 3 places in 2009. My testosterone crashed soon after and when the doctor started giving me shots of testosterone I was just starting to get back to normal, other then all of the pain that I live with in my back. My wife blames herself for my Male problem. I can promise you it is NOT my wife in anyway. We have been married for 22yrs and I find her more attractive today then when we first met. What happened was the testosterone shots were making my blood pressure go to dangerous levels and the doctor said nope, you can&#39;t take it anymore. Even with blood pressure meds it was still high, like 180&#39;s over 120&#39;s. So I listened to someone talk about the chances of it very possible giving us back something that we haven&#39;t been able to do in years. Which sucks. I think about it and her everyday and probably as much as 10 times a day. I am crushed and it kills me to hear my wife say it&#39;s her fault. So I found someone that had some of them and tried 1. It gave me a little bit of energy, but on the other. Nope not even close. All this did was make my wife cry for over an hour and me feel even worse then I did before. Bow my jaw hurts so freaking bad that even my pain meds aren&#39;t helping relieve some of the pain. I&#39;m 43yrs old and please if anyone has any suggestions that could work, please tell me. I dont think I can get anymore embarrassed than I am right now. Thank you in advance. Please dont bash me to bad. Cause if this ever happens to you, you will understand what my wife and I go through every single day. I dont wish this upon anyone, not even people that I really dont like. It sucks, it makes you feel less than a man. Plus due to my back, I&#39;m not allowed to work on any job. Which makes me feel even worse.

For this very reason (and to make sure you don&#39;t lose the magic of rolling), make sure you have significant breaks between rolls. The general consensus is that you should wait at least 3 months in between each time you take MDMA, but if you wait 5 months or more it&#39;ll always feel like it&#39;s your first time rolling when you do it.<br>With that said, whilst it&#39;s not advisable to do it more than once every 3 months, in the large majority of cases it shouldn&#39;t be a problem if you break the rule once in a while, but keep in mind that MDMA can easily damage your natural serotonin production rates if done too often, which can lead to serotonin syndrome, meaning that you are literally unable to be happy. <br>Roll safe!", "comment_date": "2019-08-12T23:03:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RedTrapDragon 187", "comment_text": "Do a video on MDA", "comment_date": "2019-08-11T13:06:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diodicide", "comment_text": "Turns you into a Zen master.", "comment_date": "2019-08-11T10:39:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Selma chrifi-alaoui", "comment_text": "kinda bad choise to watch this when my ecstasy high is starting to wear off. as this video made me sober asf. fml", "comment_date": "2019-08-11T01:59:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hasnieking", "comment_text": "Ecstasy is not mdma combined with other drugs.

Had no problems at all until we left the house to get food, I started freaking out again and I was terrified, bad thoughts rushed into my head so we drove back home. The rest of the night, we relaxed, listened to music, but I couldn&#39;t sit down. I put on my headphones and jammed out to music for a solid three hours. My friends said I was a party animal without the party.<br>Makes me a little confused as to why I freaked out at the concert but I was totally fine and having the time of my life when I was home doing nothing.

We do it about once a month, or so, no more than that though. It definitely affects me and my boyfriend differently. Not sure if it&#39;s because we&#39;re both different psychologically speaking or if it&#39;s the whole male vs female thing. Either way, the comedown is a lot harder for me if I take more of it, whilst he is fine with bigger dosages and won&#39;t have much of a comedown. I get EXTREMELY depressed for about a week after if I take more than 150mg. I&#39;m not talking about &quot;feeling kinda down today&quot; depressed, I&#39;m talking about &quot;What is the point of life?I should just go and kill myself&quot; kind of depressed. So, females beware. The high is better for us(or so I hear and have experienced), but the comedown can be very dangerous. Don&#39;t do MDMA unless you&#39;re in a safe space with people you trust. When people say &quot;Do it at a rave&quot;, that is probably the worst advice I&#39;ve ever heard. Specially for a first timer, taking it at a rave could be highly dangerous. Not only because it&#39;s full of people and loud music, but because if you get it in pill form, you&#39;re far more likely to get a shit ton of chemicals/toxins you don&#39;t want in there. Get MDMA at its pure form, which will be hard to find, but once you find it you&#39;re all set. Also keep in mind the purest you can probably find on the streets/market is 90%.<br>So yeah, make sure you&#39;re eating a healthy diet both prior and afterwards. This is VERY important. You should see MDMA as a &#39;happy points spender&#39;. If you don&#39;t have enough happy points to spend or drain all of it, then you won&#39;t enjoy the experience as much and it can even turn dangerous. Make sure you got plenty of happy points to spend, and make sure you&#39;re putting more back in with a healthy diet and exercise.

It only takes 120-150mg to have a good roll with one dose -Some people take over a GRAM in a night, and dont eat all day prior or after the roll - so no shit they will feel like shit the next day! It&#39;s a huge toll on the body to not eat, sweat and be up all night, not to mention draining the serotonin from your brain with excessive dosing. That and these people also roll far too often. If you drink 10+ drinks in a night you will feel like shit as well, it&#39;s common sense. I roll 200mg initial and 100mg booster and thats it. I&#39;ve rolled about 8 times this year alone and have not had a single hangover the day or weeks after, felt great in fact!

MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) IS the original drug referred to as &quot;Ecstasy.&quot; &quot;Molly&quot; is a slang term that has arisen in the last decade which commonly refers to a whole family of synthetic methcathinone drugs which can include any of the following and more: Methylone, Ethylone, MDPV, 4-MEC, 4-MMC, Pentedrone and MePP (also commonly sold as &quot;Bath Salts&quot; drugs). Many of these have an &quot;MDMA-like effect&quot; but none are MDMA &quot;Ecstasy.&quot; &quot;Molly&quot; is also now being used as a slang term for &quot;Ecstasy,&quot; however, over 85% of the substances being sold as &quot;Molly&quot; contain one of these synthetic methcathinones and no MDMA whatsoever. People consuming &quot;Molly&quot; can be taking ANY of these substances, ALL of which are trafficked under the name &quot;Molly.&quot; The article also states, &quot;MDMA can be mixed with caffeine to make Ecstasy.&quot; Uh, no. WTF?? Who did the research for this article? If you mix MDMA (already &quot;Ecstasy&quot;) with caffeine you will get (wait for it....), MDMA cut with caffeine.

I steer clear from cocaine and other devestating hard drugs though, because that shit will ruin your life. But I guarantee you that if you ever have the privilige of rolling, it&#39;ll change your entire outlook on life and attitude towards drugs. I know that merely sounds as biast addict talk, but it&#39;s true. I&#39;ll never be the same again like i was before i tried MDMA, and i&#39;m grateful for it. Sometimes i even pity people that are negative towards it out of some moral high ground they feel they need to stick to, because they will never know how world alteringly awesome it is. There is no way in the everyday world that you&#39;ll EVER experience that kind of feeling naturally. It&#39;s an experience quite worth it, especially since there is almost no risk attached to it.<br><br>My suggestion for everyone is: do your research. Look up the facts.

Food on its own can release high amounts of hormones in your brain, that&#39;s one of the reasons why so many are addicted to eating. Not to mention thousands of different legal drugs freely available for everyone.<br><br>The grim fact is, that whether you like it or not, you have to put stuff in your body to live, and the stuff will always have various effects on your health and psyche.<br><br>That being said, I&#39;m obviously not making an argument that everything is on the same scale in terms of potency and hazards. The differences are vast, and illegal drugs can be especially dangerous and even deadly. But as absurd it may sound, if abused, food and water can be deadly as well.<br><br>The point is, that it&#39;s just not that simple that certain substances are pure evil with no positive effects. Effects will always be various, and the properties of the resulting outcome will always be debatable.<br><br>This is how legal drugs work too. You get medicine for hair loss, but its side effects may include gynecomastia. It all boils down to which of these options you prefer: Being bald, or having luscious hair and man boobs. Both options have their perks, but in the end taking or refusing to take the medicine is always up to personal preference.<br><br>Just like drugs, computer games, movies, music and books can be very powerful forms of escapism. You have experiences that aren&#39;t &quot;real&quot;, so to speak, but enjoy them to the extent that your brain releases hormones that make you feel happy. Whether it&#39;s happening because of an external substance or a strong form of self suggestion (for example intense video game experience) is quite irrelevant.<br><br>I enjoy playing computer games, but I also enjoy getting fucked up from time to time. Hell, I even enjoy playing games when I&#39;m fucked up. I&#39;m not trying to romanticize substance abuse nor video games, but I can honestly say that altering your consciousness in a way or another can also be a blessing which makes you appreciate the &quot;unaltered reality&quot; even more than you did before.", "comment_date": "2014-10-17T02:57:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian", "comment_text": "MDMA is great but its very addictive and horrible for the brain, If you take 1 pill it would take about 2 months for your brain to get back to normal", "comment_date": "2014-10-17T02:57:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hobbes", "comment_text": "My Nepali friend said her one experience with MDMA literally changed her outlook on life and was one of the best things she&#39;s ever done.

Using the excuse &quot;I&#39;ll try it once in a while&quot; has wrecked the lives of millions of people. Now I don&#39;t know how much of this drug could actually damage you, but you should still have a level head and control over your urges before you start taking any drug for that matter.

Take cold/not hot water and make your forehead, neck and polses wet.<br>5. Use a chewing gum while on MDMA.<br>6. do not use it every week try keeping it to one time every one or two months.<br>7. Make sure you buy a safe product. (example. a red pill with a +/-) The advanced user of your group will probably now more about this.<br>8.
