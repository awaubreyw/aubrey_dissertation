It&#39;s also funny because this process also causes people not to believe in conspiracies. Well...I believe in these so called conspiracies because I read. I have almost no dopamine in my brain so I&#39;m fairly mechanical in my thinking. I take facts, make a hypothesis and see if it pans out. Then I change my view or keep it the way it is depending on outcome. I usually know about things months before they are mainstream. Here&#39;s an example of looking at the whole picture. There is no correlation between vaccines and autism. True as far as the science is concerned. Besides who would sponsor a study that proves that? However, the link between autism and heavy metals...fairly conclusive. Those metals are in a lot of vaccines. Therefore it&#39;s not conspiratorial to think that the metal contained in one of those vials couldn&#39;t lead to autism. Especially if it&#39;s used on someone who is young. Also the various inflammatory compounds won&#39;t do you any favors. Aluminum is particularly nasty. So really it&#39;s not a conspiracy. It&#39;s just a technicality the companies use to assuage fear and keep that money pump pumping.<br><br>I noticed another thing that happens. The practice of labeling without regard for outcome.

And on the subject of conspiracys, I think us humans naturaly draw lines and connect things in our mind, but we dont have the brain power to run a full simulation of reality in our thoughts to know if this is true or not, instead we are only able to break it up into pieces and discus those pieces until one by one each one of those pieces a checked. We also tend too fall for a story or lie that someone came up with too easy. I fell for one in the UFO community but the more I got into science and the Mars missions I just realized one day that aliens do not walk among us or else why would governments all around the world be spending so much money on missions to discover alien microbial life on other planets and moons if we already had one great sample setting at area 51 to study. And that&#39;s when I realized its because we don&#39;t have one. All of this is BS and misunderstandings and people keep pushing it because it makes money, basically conn men taking misunderstandings to make money. Something else that really helped pull me out is someone called me out, see i thought I was a skeptical person but you can&#39;t claim to be skeptical and only latch onto one side of a story,  a real skeptic will be critical on both sides and look at everything as a whole and point out the holes, you can&#39;t be a denier of any evidence   and claim to be skeptical at the same time.

THE REAL reason conspiracy theories work is because of the Bible.<br>If All these dark hidden things lead back to satan, then voila.<br>I know because I spent 15 years of my life thoroughly sifting, analyzing, searching and digging as well as personal experiences including supernatural demonic ones and it lead me to get saved by Jesus Christ. And I then began experiencing GOOD things that were of God.<br>I lived my whole life on hearsay and never opened the bible to read it for myself. When I finally began reading and understanding the Bible and the parables a whole new world was opened to me. <br>People having rapture dreams bu the hundreds right now. Prophecy being fulfilled and were are so close to the rapture. After that, destruction will come to those who remain on the earth. Tribulation will be horrible and was never meant for us, it was meant for the devil and the fallen angels who are the true enemy that cause fights in families, lust etc. If you don&#39;t have Jesus Christ you are not protected. <br>How can you be saved? <a href=\"http://simple.you/\">Simple.you</a> can save your soul right now.<br>1. You must first hear the Gospel of your salvation. Which is : Jesus Christ is the son of the living God who came as a man and became sin on the cross and took our punishment of Gods wrath. So that whoever might believe in him may recieve eternal salvation.<br>2. Now that you&#39;ve heard the Gospel of your salvation, of you choose to believe this is real and you confess with your mouth and heart Jesus is your Lord and saviour, you will recieve eternal salvation.<br>Ask to be baptized of the Holy Spirit. When we have the Holy Spirit we allow the presence of God to come up into the seat of our heart and work THROUGH us.<br>Many people don&#39;t understand. Jesus came for the SINNERS, not the already upright. To be born of flesh is to be born a sinner. Its the flesh that is wicked. We must crucify the flesh and accept the holy spirit of God. Jesus will accept you right now as you are completely filthy and sinful. He will make you upright and clean and work through you!<br>We all have freewill. Use it wisely!!!<br> Have you heard or seen any hell testimonies? Is it really worth chancing an eternity in torment where your soul can never die??!?<br>The truth has been hidden from us so we turn away from God.  Salvation is easy the rest comes after. So many people don&#39;t understand RELIGION tells you to &quot;DO&quot;. Jesus said on the cross &quot;IT IS FINISHED&quot; . This means Jesus works on the cross is enough we do not have to do certain things to be considered up right in God&#39;s eyes all you have to do is accept Jesus as your savior that&#39;s it.<br>This life we are told that we are walking through the valley of the shadow of death. .....&quot;THE SHADOW OF DEATH&quot; ... It&#39;s just a taste of real death for the soul.  If you don&#39;t like the evil here in this world...if you think you know depression and oppression....this is just a TASTE of what&#39;s to come should you choose not to accept a free gift of eternal salvation.<br> The punishment was never ever made for us. It was made for the devil and his angels. No human HAS to end up there.<br>I PRAY THE LORD BE WITH WHOEVER READS THIS AND THAT YOU BE SURROUND BY THE HOLY GHOST AND CHOOSE SALVATION RIGHT NOW!!<br>MY Journey With Jesus started by saying the sinner&#39;s prayer something happened that I&#39;ll never be able to explain and I wouldn&#39;t change it for anything. I&#39;m free.<br>I pray you choose freedom. This life won&#39;t last long and by the looks of things we will be out of here soon.<br>Don&#39;t get left behind. <br>Praise God! Thank you Jesus!

Should social media companies like Pinterest and YouTube be censoring information? They would stop being a platform and start becoming a news network of their own. And how should we feel about this? Is it wrong to decide what kind of information is being shared to the everyday person, or is it wrong to censor people\u2019s right to say whatever they want and have people be exposed to any and all information that\u2019s out there? Are we giving away too much freedom in exchange for security? I happen to think that it\u2019s worth censoring patently false or misleading information. Who gets to decide what information we see? People who are qualified. I\u2019m of the opinion that not all opinions are equal and that when the safety of others is put at risk and people take advantage of our psychology just to make more money, then something is wrong. It\u2019s clear we can\u2019t trust everyone to be honest or to be competent in issues they are reporting about. It\u2019s clear that not everyone is competent. That\u2019s why the school system is designed to organize people by competence and then give the people with the most competence the most opportunities. Competent people can be and are wrong sometimes, but they have a hell of a lot better chance at being right (when taken as a whole) than some random person on YouTube spreading conspiracy theories. It\u2019s important that we remember that as a society. Being incompetent isn\u2019t bad and it doesn\u2019t mean that you deserve any less than the most competent person. Everyone matters, that\u2019s a fundamental Truth. However, when incompetent people hold positions of power whether it\u2019s official positions of power or whether it\u2019s power derived from popularity, wealth, or any other source of influence, bad things happen. In order to do the right thing, we have to informed and we have to be able to interpret data correctly and use as much data as we can to inform our decisions. If we make decisions based on a reality that doesn\u2019t exist, we will be screwed in this reality regardless of good intensions. It\u2019s for these reasons that we need to listen to the consensus of competent people in the field. And perhaps most importantly, competent people have to stop preying on people for personal gain. Honestly, it\u2019s mostly competent people\u2019s fault that anti-vaxers, flat-earthers, and the overall deterioration of trust in intellectual authority exist. Just look at YouTube taking advantage of vulnerable people by programming algorithms show people what they want to see all in the name of money. Maybe it was an unintentional consequence or maybe they knew about it and just didn\u2019t care. Why should we trust anything they have to say? And why should we trust them to decide what content is best? It\u2019s this erosion of trust that is really coming back to bite all of us. I hope people of power start being more careful and I hope we can restore the trust between the intellectual elite and the layperson. But it won\u2019t be easy, especially if the powerful and the intellectual keep using their intellect and power to screw people over.", "comment_date": "2020-06-04T20:22:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mk Keshavan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://discord.gg/6tpe6N\">https://discord.gg/6tpe6N</a><br><br>Put your theories in this", "comment_date": "2020-06-04T00:20:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sofia!", "comment_text": "is no one gon talk bout how good the photoshop @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfVgHRPC7Ao&amp;t=3m08s\">3:08</a> is?", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T17:59:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roy Vivat", "comment_text": "They&#39;re literally just posting this to turn your brains into sheep, think for yourself /s", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T05:18:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harvir", "comment_text": "Really good video.

So you completely disregard the law of large numbers?...either your coin is heads on both sides, or a logical assessment would be to expect tails. You flip a coin 100 times and probability says that you&#39;ll get heads 50 times and tails 50 times. Again no disagreement that each individual flip is a 50/50 chance (technically 51/49 but we won&#39;t get that deep) on heads/tails, but 3 heads in a row absolutely increases the statistical probability of tails on the subsequent flip. Because now we aren&#39;t looking at it as ONE flip, we are looking at 4 flips and we can plug in the answers for 1, 2, and 3; we have more information with which to build a hypothesis. I&#39;ll go with the 62% chance of the 4th flip being tails, because math is on my side. Come on guys...its called science and you failed in this description. You have to be able to take things to extremes and for them to be true. Say you flip a real coin 99 times and it lands heads every time, should I expect heads again because that specific individual flip has a 50/50 chance or go with the 150,000,000,000^17 likelihood that it&#39;ll be tails because I have previous information I can build a logical conclusion from?", "comment_date": "2019-05-04T21:29:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u046e", "comment_text": "Why tf would I not constantly question my government?

That sounds really emotionally exploitative to my ears.<br>Anthropological climate change is supported by at least 11 separate studies in the past two decades, denying it is supported by strawmen and gas companies, so conspiracy dismissed. <br>America creates artificial enemies to polarize the masses to depose regimes and steal resources is supported by: the middle East and South America have oil, oil is a very sought after resource, and wars are almost always motivated by resource or monetary accrual, so conspiracy not dismissed.<br>I&#39;m not saying conspiracies shouldn&#39;t be debunked when they&#39;re held together by nothing but a few artificial strings, but there are some out there that I could very easily see being suppressed for no other reason than that it serves a multibillion dollar profit saving agenda.", "comment_date": "2019-05-04T01:09:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zechidvjchi", "comment_text": "Shane Dawson: fucks his cat<br><br><br>Us: conspiracy", "comment_date": "2019-05-04T00:57:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Addie H", "comment_text": "My conspiracy theory is that Shane Dawson is a robot", "comment_date": "2019-05-04T00:55:23Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Zealous", "comment_text": "The real title of this videos should be &quot;Why religion and other forms of non-secular worship work&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-05-04T00:19:44Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Q BALLER", "comment_text": "Who tf is Shane Dawson?", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T23:54:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BossOG", "comment_text": "I use to go down the rabbit hole from 9/11 to The Annunaki you name it but one day I started researching Quantum physics and things like string theory mainstream science is more crazy than any conspiracy theory in the world FACTS.... confirmation bias will wreak havoc on the ill informed", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T23:33:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TennPak", "comment_text": "This is why religion and god works too.

I gave the video a chance, I gave you a chance, and you blew it. <br><br><br>Naivety and idiocy abound. There are truths you don&#39;t want to accept... and no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ok that you chose to preach this message of &#39;ignorance is bliss - when it comes to important issues/ topics&#39;. <br><br><br>You do reasonable work science wise. OK. Fine. So do you want to discuss ancient history with your audience in an objective way? Do you want to discuss what evidence draws people to particular conclusions? No? Why? <br><br><br>Why do increasing numbers of people feel like we live in &#39;1984&#39; or &#39;Brave New World&#39; style of societies at this point? <br><br><br><br>If there are anomalies to a given body of evidence... like out of place physical artefacts much older than we like to say our civilisation is - what is the scientifically objective and socially conscious response to that information?  <br><br><br>(so now my text i&#39;m typing is showing as red on my screen, while the word &#39;artefacts&#39; in the above sentence is still written in white, and sentences/ paragraphs above are also written in white, still... that&#39;s pretty weird. Not happened before. Not saying it&#39;s a conspiracy - just reflecting how strange it is that this particular circumstance of me writing this, comes with a weird coincidental oddity that&#39;s new. I&#39;m sure youtube/ windows has a good reason, lol. I&#39;m sure if I looked this up, there&#39;d be an explanation...)<br><br><br>To my mind. People who are open to conspiracy theories - which &#39;anything&#39; can be a &#39;conspiracy&#39;... right? Government, is a conspiratorial construct. A good, needed and valid construct to my eyes, but nonetheless a product of conspiracy, no? <br><br><br>- Don&#39;t be idiots and advise yourselves or others, against asking questions and enquiring as to the hows and why&#39;s of things. <br><br><br>I am vaccinated, but the evidence and arguments for those who do not wish to accept all and every vaccination on faith... those seem reasonable, asking questions - and wanting information which they intentionally do not provide, is reasonable. <br><br><br>We can not, and should not, live under the expectation that a pharmaceutical company has our best interests at heart. It doesn&#39;t. Profit, is their core desire. <br><br><br>OoooooOOOOhhhh... back to white!<br><br><br>9/11.... You&#39;re a fool if you believe the face value government position on 9/11. No way around it. That day&#39;s events did absolutely not transpire in line with the stated narrative. You can call people who consider the options whatever you want... that doesn&#39;t change the reality. <br><br><br>The government has carried out &#39;false flags&#39;. Yes. 100% proven. Obviously not everything is that. But... c&#39;mon you clowns, look into the data pertaining to that day, and you will find what you would be looking for.... unless what you are looking for is a scientifically sound adherence to the given narrative, in which case you would be sorely disappointed. <br><br><br>... I don&#39;t want to overcook it. Those are fine areas to begin with. Perhaps looking into corruption and the prison system... and financial systems, banking industries etc... I think you should be able to look at the structure and literal reality of those institutions/ constructs, and understand that those industries, exist in a conspiratorial framework. They are products of conspiracy. Not subject to pure &#39;theory&#39;. But more so &#39;understanding&#39;. <br><br><br>You follow? <br><br><br>What if... everything you ever knew was a lie? <br><br><br>History? <br><br><br>Society? <br><br><br>Rule? <br><br><br>Opportunity? <br><br><br>.... As an aside. I haven&#39;t heard any arguments that climate change isn&#39;t occurring. At least not from anyone I would consider &#39;conspiratorially minded&#39; - just from your standard idiots.<br><br><br>Ok. It&#39;s done it again... seems to be related to words I mis-typed. ... anyway... The arguments I hear, coming from &#39;my people&#39; - are more along the lines of the notion of the cycle of cataclysm that our planet goes through... y&#39;know... the one that sees civilisations wiped away periodically every odd thousands of years... for me, folks that take issue with how climate change is presented, do so from the perspective that essentially... we are all doomed anyway. Humans may be having an impact, but is that impact more than the cosmos/ planet would be foisting on us without our influence? <br><br><br>- And i&#39;m not smart enough to answer that from my own mind!<br><br><br>I have to rely on other folks data, and I have to err on the side that we could be doing society in a far less destructive way. And that would likely give us an extra decade or two at least, lol.<br><br>(But that it is &#39;too late&#39; no? We&#39;re already in the &#39;6th mass extinction&#39; no? Ocean life has dropped 60% in some areas, mammal life 70-80% - since the 70&#39;s? incect life has declined as well... Nevermind sperm counts and our human... &#39;State of body&#39; - with pollutants really harming us beyond what we acknowledge. We&#39;re pretty stuffed is how it seems to many.
