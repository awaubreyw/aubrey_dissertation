I&#39;ve had a friend, who I thought was more cold blooded than me, say that I sometimes scared her.  But I tend to severely overthink things and planning a perfect murder takes too much time and effort, especially when you have a list of ideals that would contradict the ideal murder.  The most feasible way is an unfortunate accident that can&#39;t be proved otherwise, or synthesis of a complex poison, but stabbing them with a knife seems so much more intimate and terrifying.  One cut to the proper arteries and you can watch them bleed out as they die.  But that leaves so much room for error and there&#39;s so much cleanup involved afterwards.  Of course, an ideal poison would be something that kills over time, rather than instantly, is virtually untraceable, manifests few common symptoms, if any, tasteless and odourless seem to be ideal, and work in conjunction with the person&#39;s lifestyle.  Like, if you know someone likes eating potatoes and is single, you can inject varying doses of belladonna toxins into their food.  If they&#39;re an adrenaline junkie and a foodie, entice them to Japan to try Fugu and sneak a very small amount of tetrodotoxin into their fish (works better if you have no desire to try the pufferfish).  Or if they are on immunosuppressants, give them the flu.  Killing strangers is pointless, so someone you despise would be a better target (nothing for me there).  Revenge kills are the most satisfying, especially if they take some time, but the more time taken, the easier it is to trace the incident.

Especially about the ppl I knew. When I was 4 yrs old I tried to put a pillow over my brother&#39;s head. He  must&#39;ve been 4 to 5 months old at  the time. I grabbed a  pillow and started to walk slowly towards him almost like in a tip toe style. He was laying on his back in a bed with his head turned facing the other side of the room. The bed sit kinda low to the floor so I could reach him. I was a few inches from his face with the pillow and my mom appeared out of nowhere. In that moment with in a split second she punched me in my stomach. I slid across the floor in one direction and the pillow went flying the other way. She knocked the wind out of me and snatched my brother up in her arms. I laid there balled up, clutching my stomach and trying to catch my breath. She was standing on the other side of the room holding my brother. She was pacing back and forth  yelling and talking crap but after a few words into it I zoned out. At the age of 4 I knew Exactly what I was doing and Understood what the results would be from my actions. I wanted to kill him and tried to do it. I was the Only child before he came along and I wasn&#39;t excited about him coming into the picture. Well my mother met my stepdad and married him when I was 5 to 6 years old and Contuied to shit out 3 More kids like a dog that&#39;s having puppies and Robbed me out of my childhood, at a very young age. I became the second parent, maid, tutor, and live in baby sitter with adult responsibilites taking care of my 4 siblings. Keep in mind my mother and step parent (when she met him things went from bad to worse) mentally, physically, emotionally abused and neglected us through out our childhood. I was also sexual abused by family and friends of the family. It&#39;s been 23 years since I seen my mother. I cut ties with all off them except 1 and I don&#39;t ever plan on seeing them anytime soon.", "comment_date": "2019-02-07T21:28:25Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Cody W", "comment_text": "I love the background music", "comment_date": "2019-02-07T21:28:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hakkapeele", "comment_text": "Fun fact: 40% of american cops are domestic abusers, and when they kill you it&#39;s not murder, it&#39;s an unfortunate incident.<br>Statistics are fun.
