My skin felt ultra sensitive and my body itched, water tasted disgusting, I felt like I was continuously falling down, I couldn&#39;t walk, I was vomiting everywhere, breathing felt weird,  and just feeling not real.. Everyone talks about weed like its some softie begineer drug. Im sorry, its not. If weed has the possibility to have that kind of effect on anybody, its not. Especially when it so easy to green out on edibles. All for the people that wanna do it! But please omg can we talk about the adverse effects. It seems like hardcore weed fans never want to admit there is anything wrong with the drug and it is completely safe.

The first weird thing I did was laugh, this on its own isn\u2019t unusual. When I laughed I felt a lot of pressure on my upper body and slopped over the armchair of the couch. I couldn\u2019t sit up no matter how hard I tried, then I started to go into lecture that gravity was getting stronger and that I learned all about gravity in school. My friend and her parents looked at me and laughed saying I was just high. The second weird thing I did was while I was sitting on my friends bed they said we were leaving to go to the hotel. (It was my bffs b-day) I stared at my shoe because I had learned that when you\u2019re dreaming if you look at your foot it won\u2019t be on the ground completely. Because our brain can only do so much and doesn\u2019t know how to make our feet stand on the ground. But I couldn\u2019t tell if I was dreaming or not but my foot looked sus and I almost cried. I told them I was scared because I\u2019m dreaming and that when I wake up they all will have left and forgotten me. And they said we\u2019re leaving right now, you\u2019re just high it\u2019s your first time. Eventually I got my stuff and got in the car. Her parents made a stop and left us in the car, a women walked past. I convinced my friend that she would know we were high and get us sent to a mental hospital. Her parents later left us at the hotel and said they\u2019d be back tomorrow and gave us money. We were in a 3 story hotel and we were about to go on the elevator but it said it was coming from the 4th floor. So I told her that it was a serial killer coming from the highest floor which shouldn\u2019t even exist according to the information about the hotel. I stated they were at the highest coming to the lowest point in case someone from any floor would get on and thus giving them free and easy victims. I made her take the stairs because I was freaking out and I had already started running because I didn\u2019t want to be there when the door opened. We were barely on a few steps when I came to the conclusion that a killer could also be on the stairs and we were easy targets for sure. However my friend said it\u2019s too late and we\u2019re taking the stairs. So I just ran like really ran for my life of those stairs. Our room was on the third floor and there wasn\u2019t any stairs leading to a 4th floor and from outside you could see only and no way of there being another floor. Once we got inside the room I told my friend she was lucky I saved her from a killer. There was a peep hole in the door and I covered it quickly because I had heard heavy quick footsteps when we were going inside the room.

My freinds came down and realized I was not well but I guess they thought I was jokes so they were messing with me and ended up leaving for a walk. I sat there for a while then got up to try to use the bathroom I couldn\u2019t walk at all, the classic shutter effect every thing had a trail of like \u201c5 frames\u201d I stumbled/crawled to the bathroom but could not use i left and went back to my chair and sat there for 5-20 minutes I honestly don\u2019t know but I ended up going to the bathroom again but this time becaue I had the slight feeling of having to puke I laid on the floor and everything sucked every time I blinked or heard something loud or unusual or even just focused on something I would shutter and spaz out. And this will sound weird but in my head I was seeing like a wolf thing stretched out being spun around a cylinder type thing and when ever it was towards the top I would get really nauseous I felt like a unit rather then a person I had terrible cotton mouth and it sucked to swallow o could keep my thought contacting. Eventually my freinds little brother (who was about 12-13) came down and found me he called his mom down and was obviously conserned he called my freinds and got them to call my brother who had to pick me up. I remember I just wanted water and to lay down they had fro try to pick me up and figure out how to get me out but I was not having it \ud83d\ude05 they ended up getting me up and putting my arms over them I stumbled out of the house mumbling for them to go slower and I could not keep up i ended up falling and throwing up they called my dad we got in the car they brought me inside and laye some on the couch with water and trash can and stuff and we where supposed to go to a dinner for my cousin  in the morning but I woke up still high as all could be still completely greened out I tried  to get a shower but I couldn\u2019t even stand I went back to sleep did not get up until around 6pm got a shower while still pretty high I went to bed and just kinda layer there all day then I had to go to school in the morning and lucky I wasn\u2019t really high anymore but I was still \u201chigh\u201d tbh but the next day I was fine.

Since he lived with his parents, we had to also make a regular brownie batch. This left very little brownie mix for the \u201cbrownies\u201d we had set out to bake. Needless to say, we had no idea what we were doing. We put all the weed into the smaller pie tray (about 6 inch diameter) and it was about 1 inch tall. I ate a piece, and it didn\u2019t taste like a brownie at all. After about 20 mins, I ate another piece. I was very disappointed. It wasn\u2019t working, and we\u2019d seemingly come this far for nothing. I ate a third piece (more than half the pie now) and yet still- nothing. We decided we were gonna just smoke a blunt instead. I took one hit, and BAM!! I was on another planet. The cotton mouth alone was inexplicable. Three seconds after I\u2019d swallowed the water, my tongue already felt like an iguana\u2019s back. I was high as hell for about 6 or 7 hours, watched Super Troopers, went to sleep, and woke up the NEXT day higher than any weed had ever gotten me before.

My friend gave me a whole rice krispy which smelled really strongly so I had to eat it before the bus ride. The ride was about 2.5 hrs long. I wasn\u2019t feeling anything. We got to the cabins and it was freezing outside I couldn\u2019t, so I wasn\u2019t feeling anything. They asked us if we wanted to watch a movie inside with the heater since it was snowing outside and I decided to go in the gym area where the movie was playing and it was really warm. Stupidly I sat right in back of my religion teacher and bam. I will never forget remember the titans was playing. I started to see swirly lines like when in the distance it\u2019s super hot and you see waves. I saw that everywhere. Than the worst thing happened. The teacher began talking to me I just kept nodding my head and pretended to be asleep. She asks my friends that were next to me which were also baked is he ok is he ok they were like yea he is fine. I can hear them talking like if they were going further further away but they were actually right next to me. Than one of my friends kept telling let\u2019s go let\u2019s go she kept trying to move me but I couldn\u2019t move my brain was like get up get up and I couldn\u2019t. Like 20 seconds later which felt like 10 minutes I stood up and ran out of there into the cold kept telling people shit I think i got caught I think I got caught. I ran straight into my bunk bed. I somehow changed into my pjs. I needed to pee so bad so when I went to pee it felt like slow motion. Literally slow motion and my brain was like hurry up hurry up. Than when I began to pee I didn\u2019t know if my pants where fully off. But they were I just couldn\u2019t register that I was in the clear to piss.

When we got back to the car which at that point I could barely walk or move, it peaked when my vision was tunnel, grey, flickering and &quot;depressingly melting&quot; that felt quite evil.

I could barely remember where I was or what was even reality. Thought loops and voices telling me &quot;This is the end, or you will never be normal again&quot; Time was also very slow like only 15 FPS and just all impending doom.

Considering it was night time and I didn&#39;t want my cousin to smell any weed smoke on me, I just imagined eating it would be the socially-safer alternative. I was dead wrong. I had never previously tried psychedelics before this experience, but I swear it was just like one. I ate the weed edible out of the fridge really quickly as to not be seen eating it; and out of naivety, I ate the whole brownie. Empty stomach and all, I know. Afterwards, I headed back inside to watch TV with my cousin, who was probably just as bored as I was. Well, I was no longer bored anymore, as I knew I was going to be feeling something; although I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be that intense. 30 minutes pass, which is the time I read up on the internet that it was supposed to start kicking in. I didn&#39;t feel anything. Irritated, and thinking that it wasn&#39;t going to do anything to me, I almost considered going out and eating a second. Thank god I didn&#39;t do that... I would probably be unable to move. <br><br>Anyway, I sit for another 5 minutes or so, and begin zoning out far more than normal I notice. Nothing still felt wrong with me just sitting down, beside that of-course, so I began to stand up to get some water. However, as I am standing up, time all of a sudden feels like it has come to a standstill. My arms move visibly very slowly in front of me, and immediate panic sets in. I legitimately felt like I was in slow motion, and I had never experienced this ever before so I became overwhelmed with how restricted my movement felt. Trying to seem as normal as possible to my cousin, I slow-motion walk over to the sink where I get a glass of water and chug it all down. The chlorine in the water, as I remember, tasted terrible. It was as if my taste was enhanced by 100x. Afterwards, I sat back down again. Next, my worst nightmare had started whilst under the influence. My cousin was conversing with me. I couldn&#39;t understand anything he was saying, as I kept zoning out mid-speech; and the fact that he sounded like he was speaking in slow motion. I mindlessly agreed with whatever he was talking about over and over again. I could hear the slowness in my voice, and became concerned that he&#39;d know something was up; as I was not supposed to be eating edibles at that age. Time slowly passes with me in a terrifying dream-like state where I keep imagining myself floating outside of my own body, and flying away through the universe at the speed of light. I even remember feeling the acceleration of that hallucination. As a first-timer to psychedelic experiences, I was quite literally freaking out on the verge of going insane.<br><br>Eventually, I couldn&#39;t take it anymore, and I turned off the TV, stating in my slowed voice &quot;I&#39;m getting tired&quot; to my cousin. He nods and says something incomprehensible, and I grab one final glass of water before lying down in bed. Of-course, I wasn&#39;t tired. My entire body was energetic with the adrenaline pumping through my veins, after all. I just wanted to force myself to go to sleep so I could end this experience already. Big mistake. As I am lying down, I begin to REALLY zone out. I almost felt like I was in a weird lucid dream-like state, except it felt far different to a dream. I kept imagining this new dimension where everything felt unexplainably alien. The best way I can describe it to this day is it was like the fourth dimension. My vision and my entire consciousness was just one side of a square, and the other sides were stuff that, post edible, I CANNOT explain no matter how hard I try. It really messes with my brain thinking about it, and I can&#39;t even comprehend it that well anymore. As I was having these weird experiences with what I perceived to be another dimension, I was also experiencing a no-gravity state. I felt like I was just a weird consciousness floating around through the plane of the universe. I also had closed-eye visuals that I can only describe as alien, as they were coloured orange and green, all over the middle of my vision. After a while, I feel deathly ill and throw up in the sink and pace around for a while, freaking out. My cousin could obviously hear me pacing around, I thought to myself, and he must&#39;ve thought I was insane; so I got back in bed, and surprisingly, after more weird out-of-body experiences I can&#39;t really remember, I drift off and wake up the next morning feeling drained and tired. <br><br>Moral of the story? Don&#39;t just eat whole edibles when bored, especially without realising what it as in store for you, like I did. It was by far one of the most unpleasant experiences I&#39;ve had in my life.

They were called \u201cStoneo\u2019s\u201d, looked exactly like an oreo, and even tasted like oreo. <br><br>Just for context, both of us are regular THC consumers, and at the time we believed 250mg would be nothing. Very wrong is what were.<br><br>After eating the Stoneo,  the first and second hours were pretty relaxing; we were playing guitar, chatting about the day, and what we were anticipating with the come-up. Not too much happened here except for acquiring the munchies.<br><br>Hour three or so in, and things started to get funny. In my general peripheral view there was Hulu on the TV, the munchies on the coffee table, and my buddy next to me. The TV started wiggling slightly then got a little bit fuzzy, so I got up to wash my face and check if I was dreaming. The second I looked at myself in the mirror, I knew I was in trouble. My face was pale, and my cheeks were turning red. I went back to the couch, and the visuals started to fizzle out.<br><br>Hour four and five in, and it wasn\u2019t getting easier. I had music playing on subs in my room,  and I was sitting on the edge of my bed. My buddy was across the room by the door, completely submerged in the music. I was sitting there, literally just staring at my phone. I had no clue what it was or what I was doing, and I just let it slide out of my hand; I remember putting on Sober to Death by Car Seat Headrest, knowing nothing of my existence or why I was in my room. I just fell back, and stared at my ceiling. The white wall felt like an empty void, calling me like a hero called to action. This only felt like the beginning. <br><br>Hours six and seven came through, and it surprisingly turned out to be the bitter-sweet comedown. Still passed out on my bed, I was sitting upright with a pillow in my hand. I had kept fading in and out of consciousness, disconnecting and reconnecting with the world. At one point I heard one of my cats meow, and it snapped me out of the in-and-out tripping I was going through. My cat came up to me and nudged me, and it almost felt like a rekindled relationship between pet and owner. I hugged the shit out of him and continued to pet him for what felt like forever; it felt like I hadn\u2019t seen my cat in decades, and that he\u2019d been lost alone this whole time. While all of this was going on, my buddy was still passed out on the other end of the room, this time on his side. I knew he was fine so I simply left him alone. <br><br>Hour eight came, and it was definitely time for bed. I got up for what felt like the first time in forever, and poked my buddy. He flailed and his pupils were all disoriented and undilated. He panicked and couldn\u2019t sit upright for a fee minutes, but he caught track of himself. The both of us got up and checked back in with ourselves and reality, and we called it a night after storytelling for a solid half-hour.<br><br>The following day felt surreal. It was almost as if I had come back from being in a VR experience. The feelings I had and the memories I made while seeing what I saw all felt so tangible, yet at the exact same time so fake. It took me at least a few hours to re-connect with everything and everybody the following day, and it was even difficult to keep a basic focus throughout the day. <br><br>Long story short the 25g was both a living hell and a beautifully heavenly experience; if you\u2019re interested in taking a 250mg or more dose, you should definitely do your research ahead of time and mentally prepare. It\u2019s something that not everyone can mentally handle.

The only religion that says that we need a perfect, sinless sacrifice to die and rise from the dead, conquering death is Christianity.  It was only God in human form (God incarnate, named Jesus Christ) that died for our sins (crimes) on the cross and rose again and ascended into Heaven.  All we have to do is believe and have faith in Jesus saving us from Hell and letting us into Heaven.  Just pray: &quot;God, forgive me of my sins.  Jesus, come into my heart, I make you my Lord and savior.&quot;  For example, I beat up my mother when I was drunk (I don&#39;t remember doing it).

I was really convinced I would never returned to reality and cried to my boyfriend about how I was going to die and told him my goodbyes. 3 hours later I fell asleep and woke up the next day still high.

Weed also does not cause tumours either there&#39;s is very small amounts of evidence to prove this also. The most weed can do is cause temporary stain on you vocal cords and lungs. The only things that are completely proven by science is that smoking weed can help you deal with the pain of cancer treatment and multiple other slow growing diseases. There&#39;s a reason why smoking weed does not cause tumours or cancer. It&#39;s because it has nothing to attach to your lungs. It&#39;s completely different from nicotine. Nicotine attaches it&#39;s self to your lungs which aids in development and venerableness to multiple diseases. Weed does not have anything correlation with causing tumour or cancer. The most weed will do is make you cough after a hit, laugh at crappy movies that don&#39;t have jokes and give you the imagination for odd foods like a waffle ice cream penutbutter burger. Weed is safer than alcohol and tobacco and no it does not lead to worse drugs tests have proved that theory wrong. Just smoke weed if it&#39;s and only if it&#39;s legal. And don&#39;t be pressured. I mean the dare program has literally changed their mind about weed. If that doesn&#39;t prove weed is safe then have fun sending your kid to school on red ribbon weed when dare comes.

Though I recommend have a bottle of water with you during edibles as it reduces paranoia 100% of the time.

The high is just as long but with a more stretched out onset and comedown, making i appear longer to those who don&#39;t consume cannabis frequently. Ask any heavy cannabis user or anyone who works in the industry, it&#39;s no less an urban legend than saying &quot;You can take a tab of LSD and never stop tripping&quot;.<br>2) While yes, there is evidence that 11-OH-THC has been produce through metabolizing process and yes, this is technically a stronger molecule than Delta-9-THC, it is by no means some magic or incredible way to potentiate your weed like you make it sound. The high - compared to smoking - is just much more body oriented generally. To clarify some strains are proven to produce more energetic behavior and/or mood when smoked or vaporized but this is something that&#39;s not attributed to edibles very often. In short, it&#39;s just a stronger body high. That is it. I can&#39;t speak for you, but personally I&#39;ve almost always found the same people who claim edibles give you this just absolutely crazy strong high, more than not are the same type of people to hardly even smoke (or consume) that much in to begin with.<br>3) We both know there are zero cases where smoking marijuana was a definitive cause of a tumor. Stop it.<br>4) One thing I&#39;ve will note is I have consistently seen edibles <b>far</b> more unregulated along the west coast than any other product. Some people I&#39;ve done business with in the past have no problem telling you &quot;Yeah we market our cookies as 250mg but really there 450mg&quot;. That&#39;s still not an absurd amount, I know, but it&#39;s the point that it&#39;s very plausible lots of people out there are being misinformed.

The Bible-thumper: Those who have never read Genesis <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUhJnKKQDTE&amp;t=1m11s\">1:11</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUhJnKKQDTE&amp;t=1m29s\">1:29</a>,<br> 9:3, and Ecclesiasticus 38:4 or just ignore them. <br><br>2. The Authoritarian: Those that think that people have the right to <br>tell another peaceable person what they can or cannot put on or in their<br> own body under threat of physical and monetary punishment. <br><br>3. The Sheep: Those who just do as they are told without question and <br>think the government knows what&#39;s best for them. Remember, slavery was <br>legal. The Holocaust was legal. Segregation was legal. Never use the <br>state as a metric of ethics. <br><br>4. The Over Protective Parent: Those who don&#39;t want it in the hands of <br>children, yet they probably have alcohol and prescription drugs in the <br>fridge or cupboard, not realizing that those can kill their children and<br> cannabis cannot. <br><br>5. The Ignorant: Those who think that it can kill you even though it has<br> an ED50:LD50 of between <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUhJnKKQDTE&amp;t=1m20s\">1:20</a>,000-<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUhJnKKQDTE&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a>,000;<br> and those who think it has no medicinal value even though we have <br>things like Marinol and U.S. Patent #6630507. Those that think smoking <br>cannabis is the only way to ingest it and those that think it kills <br>brain cells. <a href=\"http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/does-marijuana-kill-brain-cells\">http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/does-marijuana-kill-brain-cells</a><br><br>6. The Idiot: Those who aren&#39;t intelligent enough to realize that <br>something that can&#39;t kill you (cannabis) is unequivocally less dangerous<br> than something that can kill you (alcohol, caffeine, cocaine, crack, <br>heroin, meth, nicotine, prescription drugs). It is a safer alternative <br>to lethal, recreational chemicals. <br><br>7. The A**hole: Those who don&#39;t want to admit that they have been wrong <br>all these years and/or have punished someone for it. <br><br>8. The Pig: Those who enjoy depriving humans of their life, liberty, <br>happiness, loved ones and possessions over non-violent, victim-less acts<br> such as possessing an all-natural and 100% non-lethal plant. Also, <br>anyone who benefits from asset forfeiture. Cops, judges, prosecutors. <br><br>9. The Greedy: Those who stand to lose money if it was legalized <br>nationally. Cops, judges, prosecutors, cartels, the private prison <br>system, oil companies, Big Pharma, lumber industries, alcohol companies,<br> tobacco companies, etc. <br><br>10. The Hypocrites: Those who think it makes you dumb, yet they will <br>never be as intelligent as Carl Sagan; those who think it makes you <br>lazy, yet will never be as physically adept as Micheal Phelps; and those<br> who think it makes people worthless, yet will never be as talented as <br>their favorite musician. Also, people who drink alcohol and say that <br>drugs are bad, not realizing that alcohol is a drug. <br><br>11. The Nosy: Those who want it to stay illegal because they don&#39;t like <br>the smell of it. Even though by that logic we should outlaw cooking meat<br> because vegans don&#39;t like the smell of burning flesh. They probably <br>think we should outlaw farts and water treatment plants, too. <br><br>12. The Straight edge: The arrogant people who think that because they <br>don&#39;t want or like something, no one else should be allowed. <br><br>13. The Gateway theorists: Those that think it is a gateway drug. If <br>that&#39;s true, Willie Nelson has some explaining to do. Also, curiosity is<br> the only gateway drug. <br><br>14. The &quot;it causes crime&quot; people: Cannabis doesn&#39;t cause crime, <br>prohibition does. Example: Alcohol prohibition and Al Capone.<a href=\"http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/marijuana-legalization-colorado-one-year-status-report\">http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/marijuana-legalization-colorado-one-year-status-report</a><br> <br>15. The &quot;what message does it send to the kids?&quot; people: It sends them <br>the message to not ingest lethal recreational chemicals. It sends the <br>message that intelligent people know that cannabis is far less dangerous<br> than any man-made chemical. <br>BONUS: How to talk to your kids about drugs; 1. Don&#39;t do drugs. 2. Don&#39;t<br> do drugs. 3. If you are going to use drugs, choose the only one that <br>can&#39;t kill you from overdose.<br><br>Cannabis doesn&#39;t kill people, people kill people; which, ironically, <br>makes it unequivocally less dangerous than the evil, soulless, sub-human<br> sloppy pools of maggot ridden dog excrement who enforce it&#39;s <br>prohibition and have failed miserably at their endeavor to eradicate it <br>from our country.", "comment_date": "2017-03-23T21:14:50Z", "likes_count": 319}, {"comment_by": "Dia-C 05", "comment_text": "Ummm I thought that was an m&amp;m brownie for the thumbnail.", "comment_date": "2017-03-23T21:12:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wanttofanta", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUhJnKKQDTE&amp;t=1m20s\">1:20</a> 11-OH-TH-She", "comment_date": "2017-03-23T21:10:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "No name what am I ?", "comment_text": "thanks to this video i finally figured out what wrong with the characters in mass effect:andromeda ,dem fuckers is straight tripping ballz", "comment_date": "2017-03-23T21:10:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Stepp", "comment_text": "My friend had two marijuanas and overdosed :(", "comment_date": "2017-03-23T21:10:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xlondonlove14x", "comment_text": "getting too high gave me depersonalisation lol so i wouldnt say its harmless, not mentally at least", "comment_date": "2017-03-23T21:05:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brittany Case", "comment_text": "Did he put oregano into a bowl \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-03-23T20:58:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sketch Source", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AsapSCIENCE\">#AsapSCIENCE</a> Why can&#39;t we sneeze with our eyes open?", "comment_date": "2017-03-23T20:55:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lahar Sethi", "comment_text": "11-OH-SHE A SHE", "comment_date": "2017-03-23T20:52:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amani", "comment_text": "I was eatimg one of the brownies from the thumbnail when I came across this.

So where I live in Marietta, Georgia, for example, I must abide by local law, county law, state law and federal. Usually these are overlapping. But cover different things. My city and county both have laws about traffic, because they enforce traffic laws, whereas State and Federal tend to not make laws they can&#39;t enforce. That said, the decriminalization of marijuana in certain states only removes the state law. So cities or counties in those states MAY have laws preventing usage. And this is to say nothing of the federal law. It is illegal within the united states to use Marijuana. All of it. Because of the federal law. That said, the FBI is probably unlikely to visit you to find out if you&#39;re using it.
