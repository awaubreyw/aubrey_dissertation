I can think of maybe one case. The Columbine school shooting. Although both shooters were known to play violent video games shooters, it was never proven that video games were their primary motivation. Both teens were bullied and made to be outcasts in their school and it likely took a couple of years of being bullied for them to finally snap and decide to go on a killing spree.\r<br>\r<br>By contrast, in just one year, how many men get drunk and beat up their wives or gf&#39;s? How many people get drunk at bars/clubs and end up in fights, sometimes with people getting stabbed or shot? How many women drink too much and get sexually abused? How many people drink and drive and get into accidents which sometimes cause injury or even death to innocent people? The answer to that last question is approximately ten thousand people are killed every year in the U.S. due to drunk drivers. Let me say that again, TEN THOUSAND proven deaths in one year Vs. maybe one in the past 20 years. Even if there were more &quot;proven&quot; cases of violent crimes being connected to violent video games, the number would be negligible.\r<br>\r<br>So tell me, why are psychologists, media, politicians, teachers, religious/community leaders all so against violent video games when there is something that is thousands of times more destructive to society? I don&#39;t see any one of them standing up and trying to ban alcohol.\r<br>\r<br>Do any of those people realize that video games are the most lucrative form of entertainment, and has been for many years now? The video game industry makes more money that CD&#39;s, magazines/books, DVD&#39;s and even Hollywood movies. There are hundreds of millions of people playing violent video games (Grand Theft Auto franchise: &gt;200M units sold; Call Of Duty franchise: &gt;200M; Mortal Combat &gt;50M). That is millions and millions of people, but we don&#39;t see millions and millions of crimes. Any crime that is supposedly linked to someone playing video games means that the person was already mentally unstable if they acted out something they saw in a video game. 99.999% of people can play those same games then turn off their console and have a nice dinner with their family or go to work/school the next day.

The gamers mood was usually foul, aupon knocking on the door the gamer rarely answered and when he did he yelled. His excuse was that he was busy doing something on the game. When asked to leave for a while he complained about how he needed to get more done to finish his season on division 2. When told it&#39;s just a game, he starting cussing and getting mad.<br>The non gamer, was peaceful, talkative, friendly to outgoing and always answered the door. <br><br><br>This is why videogames should be banned in N.

Violent media does not cause violent people. If it did, then the majority of consumers would go out and commit violent acts, but they don&#39;t. Only a very small minority do (less than 1%), and they can never speak for the majority.<br><br><br>Regardless of how many mental health professionals try to debate this; there is always going to be a disconnect between one&#39;s thoughts and one&#39;s actions, unless you&#39;re mentally ill in which case anything can set you off regardless of what it is.<br><br><br>Thought example: You&#39;re driving down a road, someone cuts you off, you think of driving right into them or run them off the road, but you don&#39;t act it out.<br><br><br>Action example: You&#39;re a soldier, you are trained step-by-step on the act of killing, you then go to war and you do what you&#39;re trained to do, then you come home with PTSD because your mind can&#39;t handle the thought of what your body has done.<br><br><br>The worst thing that violent media can do is give you the idea of the concept (from the thought side), but it does absolutely nothing from the action side. It doesn&#39;t force you to go out and attack people, or put a weapon in your hand and force you to commit murder. That&#39;s like saying that training in martial arts turns you into a mass murderer or serial killer. At the end of the day, the choice to act is on the individual alone, so enjoy violent content, take personal responsibility for what you do, and shut up while you&#39;re at it.", "comment_date": "2019-10-02T15:15:56Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "daBord", "comment_text": "just wanna know if anybody is also exploring the comments in 2019 and if you do, I got a serious question.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Violence memes</b>", "comment_date": "2019-10-01T21:34:12Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "demoko son of azathoth", "comment_text": "played bioshock 4 years ago am 14 now<br>guns are illegal in uk<br>have not stabbed some runt yet", "comment_date": "2019-10-01T05:23:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FireKetchup248", "comment_text": "Boomers rekt", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T01:53:57Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Lolter", "comment_text": "<b>play minecraft</b><br><br>Hmmm i felt i wanna kill the ender dragon and other stuff", "comment_date": "2019-09-18T07:39:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nichijao", "comment_text": "the dislikes are 30 year old virgins", "comment_date": "2019-09-17T23:58:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "2cool", "comment_text": "me, playing minecraft and farming peacefully without killing any animals: uh, totally?", "comment_date": "2019-09-17T09:37:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aran Erem", "comment_text": "Been playing games all my life and I am doing fine", "comment_date": "2019-09-14T10:50:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Hadron", "comment_text": "Im just building a house in minecraft", "comment_date": "2019-09-14T09:19:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gummy Bear monster commenter World smallest", "comment_text": "This theory is just made up by parents who want to spoiled kids fun and that makes them happy", "comment_date": "2019-09-14T06:42:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Miggus", "comment_text": "N O", "comment_date": "2019-09-13T02:25:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SkyLark", "comment_text": "Open your eyes.

Video game experiments often have people playing a game for as little as ten minutes, which is not representative of how games are played in real life. In many laboratory studies, especially those involving children, researchers must use artificial measures of violence and aggression that do not translate to real-world violence and aggression, such as whether someone would force another person eat hot sauce or listen to unpleasant noises. The US supreme court ruled that violent games DO NOT cause the youth to act violently. In Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association (2011) the US Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that California could not ban the sale of violent video games to minors. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in the majority opinion that studies purporting to show a connection between violent video games and harmful effects on children &quot;have been rejected by every court to consider them, and with good reason: They do not prove that violent video games cause minors to act aggressively.&quot; Of course people will be against games but they should know hat not all kids like school shooters, did what they did because of games and most of that research is flawed. Violent crimes decreased 37% and murders by juveniles acting alone fell 76% in that same period.The juvenile Violent Crime Index arrest rate in 2012 was 38% below 1980 levels and 63% below 1994, the peak year.

There\u2019s no real interpersonal communication with just a base video game. The video game has functions, not real interactions. Things that would cause violence in a person are human interactions, the way they\u2019re treated by others, how they\u2019re raised, what their personality type is, genetics, etc. One caveat to these studies done on finding a link between video games and violence is the online part (none of it was mentioned in the studies); the human interaction part of some video games that could be considered bullying and teasing, threats and whatnot.
