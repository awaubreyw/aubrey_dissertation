There are a number of problems with the sources, so I will lay them out in the order that they appear in the description (they are not in the order that they appear in the video, nor are there time stamps for correct sitation). Heads up, this is a novel of a comment, but you should give it a read through if you are curious about the sources for this video.<br><br>1-A) This is a secondary source. This is an improper sourcing technique and is thus void. This links to a magazine article talking about a study and not the study itself, and as such, is not a proper source for the claims made in the video (in reference to neuro-reactions in participants in response to images of mutilation).<br><br>2-B): This study did not actually conclude that there are any differences in cognitive styles but instead proposed the possibility of such. The brain scans did show differences that were relayed in this video (except it was the right amygdala, not the entire amygdala complex), and they made no conclusion on the effects of such differences. The scale for political belief was also conducted in a very poor manner of 1\u20135, with 1 being &quot;very liberal&quot; and 5 being &quot;very conservative&quot; without any definitions of terminology. Due to poor data methodology, this source should not be used as concrete evidence of anything, and doing the contrary is poor scientific form.<br><br>3-D): This source is a paid-only resource, meaning that it should not be used as a primary source unless you can accurately abstract the research in an easily accessable manner. Due to the manner of this research, it would also likely involve self-identification, which can cause inaccurate data collection, but this is mostly speculation as I have no access to this source at this time.<br><br>4\u2014D) Repeat of point 3. It is a poor sourcing technique to link to a pay wall unless it is absolutely necessary.<br><br>5-A) This link was an interesting read with some great insight into the historical weaponization of psychology for political reasons as done by the Nazis after their defeat in WW2. It is also a rather long article that would have benefited from a proper sourcing technique on behalf of asapscience to reference a particular section of this article or to directly link to a primary source used by this article instead of leaving this to anyone attempting to fact check their research for this video.<br><br>6.-D) Repeat of point 3. It is a poor sourcing technique to link to a pay wall unless it is absolutely necessary.<br><br>7-C): This source is using the EI (emotional intelligence) model, which has been called into question as an effective measure of emotional response in the past. Discarding that concern, this research measured the ability of a person to gauge the emotional reaction depicted in an image and choose to &quot;approach&quot; or &quot;avoid&quot;. This research would not be conclusive of emotional intelligence but would rather show a difference in threat management, which would be dependent on too many factors to be conclusive with such a small sample size (63) which were all recruited locally through word of mouth. This means that it cannot be used to extrapolate data from it or even conclude meaningful evidence without the disclaimer of possible localization of specific responses due to social factors. For an example of a social factor difference, it may be commonly accepted that people should avoid angry individuals in one area, but in a smaller community it may be accepted that you should attempt to diffuse the situation. Both responses would skew the data.<br><br>At this point, I have grown bored of disputing the sources on a point-for-point level as each source I have covered so far has all been very weak or has been taken out of their original context. Sources 8\u201312 may be great, but the sources above have either been:<br><br>A) Incorrectly sourced, either through the use of a secondary source or by failing to accurately source a specific section discussing the topic at hand.<br>B) Removed from context, as in source 2.<br>C) The studies used questionable methodologies that could skew the results and, as a result, should not be cited if you want to be accurate.<br>D) are placed behind a pay-wall, with only the abstract available to the public. An abstract of the research can be helpful but should not be the only available section of a source.<br><br><br>In conclusion, this video is highly questionable and uses very suspect sources (at points, inaccurately relaying information from linked sources). The idea of there being neurological differences between political camps is an interesting proposal, but I must urge people that watch this to take all the information contained within it with a hefty pinch of salt. This research (even if it were all accurate) would also only be the result of averages within small sample sizes, which couldn&#39;t be accurately extrapolated due to the number of potential factors that would be at play (social factors, individual identification of terms, potential regional biases, etc.) and the sample size used.", "comment_date": "2022-08-27T20:15:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brenden Brenden", "comment_text": "What low testosterone does to a mf", "comment_date": "2022-08-24T21:32:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Logan Buckley", "comment_text": "All I\u2019m really getting hear is <br><br>Virgin liberal brain vs chad conservative brain", "comment_date": "2022-08-24T12:40:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N\u00f6rdisk", "comment_text": "They are both savages and proof that democracy is a failure", "comment_date": "2022-08-22T19:18:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jade Frenzy", "comment_text": "Funnily enough, if people were to assume my political affiliation by how I tend to think, act, and perceive the world, I would be assumed to be a Liberal and Conservative 50-50.

In the scope of political opinions it&#39;s exceptionally important to recognize how the information we get shapes our worldview. It&#39;s hard to overestimate how different the pictures of the world based on different fact samples are. People with the same way of thinking and brains functioning virtually in the same manner can come to vastly different conclusions if they exist in different conditions and in different informational environment. The questions of politics ARE the questions of truth, so it&#39;s not just about \u201eneither good nor bad\u201c differences. It&#39;s also about one people being closer to truth than others.

Why calling the right wing and the left wing conservatives and liberals? There aren&#39;t only conservatives on the right: you can also find alt-right and fascists there.

Deeper look into human beings with radical political views would give a broader picture of the differences in the way of thinking, since that doesn&#39;t boil down to just preferences; these differences are crucial and serious, so the bigger differences in the way of thought are to be expected.

The very definition of sovereignty entitles states to non-intervention in their domestic affairs. The idea of Universal Human Rights and the protection of an individual within a state would appear to come into direct conflict with this very definition. As such, International Human Rights obligations are regularly seen as \u201ceroding state sovereignty\u201d (Ayoob, 2001:93).\u00a0 The coexistence of the two has not been easy; more often than not the two principles have confronted rather than partnered. By definition, Human Rights give the basic liberties and freedoms entitled to all simply because of being human. The institutionalisation of Human Rights in the international system is a relatively new concept.

You mean to tell me, the Republican Party, the party founded by Abraham Lincoln (you know, the guy who literally ended slavery in this country), are the racists? Hmm, interesting. Because according to the history books I read growing up, the KKK was founded by Democrats, the Jim Crow laws were passed by Democrats, former Democrat President LBJ used that one word frequently in private, and was also a KKK member (look it up if you think I&#39;m lying), and as for today, look at every inner city in cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, and Chicago, and what party do most of those areas vote for usually? Exactly. You can sit and tell me, oh well, the Democratic Party has changed. No, it honestly hasn&#39;t. If you want to see what modern day slavery looks like, visit any inner city that is ran by Democrats, and tell me how the conditions are. Oh let&#39;s not forget this fact, what happened to the city of Detroit  about 12-13 years ago? The city went bankrupt, right? And what party does most of Detroit vote for? Exactly. Look, you can sit and try (and fail in the process), to convince me that Republicans are responsible for all the racism in America, but history doesn&#39;t lie. And like I stated above at the beginning, there&#39;s a reason why Democrats are taking down statutes (ironically of people in the past you were Democrats), and it&#39;s because they&#39;re trying to sweep their own history under the rug and try to appeal to other people. That&#39;s why they silence or &quot;cancel&quot;, anyone who says what I&#39;m saying, because the more people who do the research and figure out the truth for themselves, the less likely they are going to gain voters. And that&#39;s why they try so desperately to get the minority vote. It&#39;s not because they care (because  the conditions of inner cities across the country proves that they don&#39;t), it&#39;s because they know they can manipulate them into thinking whatever they want to be true vs. actually doing something to make a difference. And that&#39;s exactly why they purposely killed JFK, because he actually wanted to make a difference, but that wasn&#39;t part of the plan. Democrats don&#39;t care, they will do whatever it takes to get their message across, even if they have to kill Abraham Lincoln, kill one of their own (JFK), or a Republican African American Christian by the name of Martin Luther King Jr. However, Republicans are the bad guys (according to the mainstream media). Yeah, keep telling yourself that. For those thinking, stop preaching hate speech, I&#39;m not. Here&#39;s how you can tell the difference. The truth, isn&#39;t hate speech, it&#39;s facts, logic, and common sense. Hate speech is what Democrats in the 1860s &amp; 1960s preached at Klan rallies (throughout the country). Let&#39;s also not forget how Democrats treat African Americans who become Republican. They say stuff I wouldn&#39;t dare say (because I quite frankly am better than that, and was raised right). Lastly, I&#39;ll leave y&#39;all with just a simple question, and then I&#39;ll leave. If the Democratic party is so great, then why are a lot of Democratic voters (of all different races and backgrounds), switching parties, and registering either Independent or Republican?", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T01:13:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Slaughterhouse5", "comment_text": "What a pile of horse crap!  \ud83d\udca9", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T01:02:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alan", "comment_text": "Conservatives live in a world of logic.

Democrats are on a mission to destroy this country, and many republicans pretend to be against them when they&#39;re actually working with them and helping them. America is under a hostile takeover by TREASONOUS TRAITORS! Our domestic enemies in our gov&#39;t are a far greater threat than all other enemies at this point! The 2020 election was one of this biggest frauds they&#39;ve put our country through. Yes, they STOLE the presidency &amp; vice presidency, but many other positions of power were stolen in the 2020 election as well, and it was done by democrats and republicans both, through the dominion voting machines and fraud through mass mail-in voting. Millions of votes were stolen, and the fraud happened in EVERY state. These voting machines have internet access and that&#39;s how China, Iran, and Italy were able to get in there and flip 100&#39;s of 1000&#39;s, if not millions, of votes from Trump to biden. I watched over 100,000 votes flip from Trump to biden on live tv on cnn. The exact amount of votes taken from Trump were given to biden, so there&#39;s no way that was a glitch or an accident, or anything not purposeful! And I find it funny how all of the votes from dead people were for biden! I guess those dead people wanted biden to win so bad that they clawed their way up out of their graves just to vote for him! LMAO! That&#39;s hilarious! But it&#39;s also very serious! The involvement of foreign countries(China, Italy, Iran) makes it HIGH TREASON!!! biden, kamala, and all involved in stealing this election need to be arrested and charged with HIGH TREASON immediately!

An important qualification was that the measure of verbal intelligence used was relatively crude, namely a 10-word vocabulary test. This study examines three other measures of cognitive ability from the GSS: a test of probability knowledge, a test of verbal reasoning, and an assessment by the interviewer of how well the respondent understood the survey questions. In all three cases, individuals who identify as Republican score slightly higher than those who identify as Democrat; the unadjusted differences are 1\u20133 IQ points, 2\u20134 IQ points and 2\u20133 IQ points, respectively. Path analyses indicate that the associations between cognitive ability and party identity are largely but not totally accounted for by socio-economic position: individuals with higher cognitive ability tend to have better socio-economic positions, and individuals with better socio-economic positions are more likely to identify as Republican. These results are consistent with Carl&#39;s (2014) hypothesis that higher intelligence among classically liberal Republicans compensates for lower intelligence among socially conservative Republicans.", "comment_date": "2021-03-27T13:03:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dave", "comment_text": "Republicans tend to be better at math, engineering and and dominate surgeon, dentist, veterinarian jobs.

Even at me when i admit the pros and cons of both. and they swear I side or vote with one side only. People ask or say the parties have switched and no longer the same as back then. Well for starters of course its not the same because times have changed and theres different issues to tackle so the parties adapt and fight for and against causes. But what remains the same of both parties are the fundamental values and what they stand for as far as politics and the county. All the new things they &quot;say&quot; they stand for is bullshit or new to appeal to people. Like the democrats saying they fight for tolerance and ration equality! Bullshit! They dont! They care for that vote because without they are nothing. The republicans have been the party of racial equality and freedom for all and rights for everyone. The thing is those progressives that vote democrat yelling they want racial justice is actually a republican attitude! But they have been sucked into and manipulated by the left to feel its the Democrats because of the new use of the racial equality banner! They have not done ONE THING to help different races and its communities! Prove me wrong! The welfare program? That helps them? maybe for that fast money but it keeps you under government control, dependant and seen as the bottom of the contributions to society and for yourself. The welfare program hurts you ini the long run, You will NEVER get out of it and realize your potential. It keeps you with the vicitim mentality. Look at where we are now. So upset and people who are not on the bottom and are thriving that they want to tear them down and blame them for their misfortune and poorness. The moment they accept this and say victim no more and take initiative to thrive or be amongst other like minded people then they will leave poverty behind. Sadly many wont because they are to proud to admit this, or too brainwashed by the left or dont know where to begin, or dependant on that next welfare check.  The only thing Republicans are wrong and guilty of is not fighting back and harder to gain the peoples trust and votes back.They lost those votes to the Left. They are too conservative and soft and rather not fight. They do hope people can open their eyes and do research in fact they dont even say vote for us or give you incentives or lies to do so. They want you to be free thinkers, independent thinkers and educate yourself. They fight for your freedom, and independence and freedom of speech! They will welcome all no matter what race as long as you want to be a happy and a contributor and not a menace to society. Another thing republicans look bad which is not their fault is as a collective there&#39;s many whites. This turns off blacks and minorities but the obvious answer is many blacks stand together and ignorantly choose and are persuaded to stand with the democrats. The Dems have successfully manipulated them to feel they need to and depend on them by appealing to them by using welfare and preaching racial equality. But thats a pretty slogan for we want government to control people and be more in their lives and to equally have them at their use (a precursor for socialism). Also many blacks also vote democratic because they dont want their family and race to call them a sellout. What makes the Republicans look bad is the few that are highly religious that turn off many liberals but thats not all republicans faults. And the ignorant white supremacists that are not even a significant large percentage in the nation vote red. They dont speak for the Republicans in fact the Republicans denounce them and dont stand by them. The white supremacists vote red because red is the more patriotic party, The one that stands for America and its history and values and they resonate with that. Thats not a conservatives/republicans fault! There are many white supremacists and nationalists and KKK admirers and racists in the democratic party as well. Most of these people are ignorant and live in rural areas that dont know any better. The fact people fight and argue and call people on the right racist because they vote for Trump is insane and ignorant and racist in itself. The democrats are the party that preach tolerance and denounce fascism yet have been violent, intolerable and bullying people to side with them or else and have been practicing fascist tactics! No one is the same! No one should vote for a president for single issues and the character of one does not reflect someone elses if they have some things in common. We all should agree to disagree without facing persecution  and hate. Not everyone that votes for Trump thinks the same nor has the same ideals for what policy they voted for or dislike or want for the country. Thats as ignorant as saying all democrats vote for Biden because they want communism or want the economy to fail or like touching and smelling women and children, or must admire  corruption and political fascism. Would democrats like to be labeled that for voting for Biden? Then they should not ignorantly say those who vote Trump hate blacks or hispanics. It just makes them look stupid with no good argument but more intolerance and names thrown to offend as they usually do cause all they do is act out on emotion not intelligence or something simple as facts. All people need is to do research and educate themselves before jumping on the bandwagon of a party affiliation and attacking the other!", "comment_date": "2020-11-07T02:01:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "azart61", "comment_text": "I&#39;m more in the middle.

About the weapons and police, he will ban weapons because he knows people will kill those who make them wear the microchip, So Biden is banning Guns. He is also banning police because he knows he will get arrested for doing those illegal stuff. If babies are born throughout 2020-2090 they will be put a chemical shot that will make them either autistic or make them die. Autism is a problem that makes your have behavioral problems, makes you take longer to think, you won\u2019t concentrate like other kids in school. Don\u2019t trust ANY flu shot, surgery, or any needles. And if you try to take off the microchip off your hand, the robot chip will spread a chemical that will quickly kill you.

Allow Chicago innocent residents to protect themselves from gangs.  Notice how most gun shootings come from a Democrat city/anti gun location and not from a police station, military base/post, gun range, or a heavy gun friendly zone?   If your way hasn&#39;t worked for years, change to what has worked with the far right.   <br><br>-Get rid of loopholes in welfare and social security.  Years ago, my brother and his wife at the time was filing at separate addresses, so they were able to collect double the amount of food stamps.  If they were able to do this, so is millions of other people.   Don&#39;t worry, my brother is dead now, so you democrats don&#39;t have to bother asking me if I reported him to the police.  I was too young back then to know what he did, and I learned what he did as I got older.<br><br>-Get rid of loopholes in Taxes (that the democrats actually created).  If you want to complain about President Trump paying low taxes, it was the democrats who allowed these loopholes to happen in their bill. <br><br>-Cut more ties with China and raise more taxes on them.  Trump was right on them taking advantage of us for years.  We need to be able to manufacture and create more jobs in the US.  We cannot rely on other countries.  This is what caused us to be in a huge national debt in the first place.  <br><br>-Keep government Out of medical insurance.  Everyone pays for their own insurance and plans.  There&#39;s no reason I should have to pay extra money you to get the Healthcare you need, and vice-versa.  Do you really want to pay for my $135K back surgery?<br><br>-Continue to cut taxes on everyone.  This obviously helped the economy when Trumps tax planned lowered EVERYONES tax rate.  I went down from the 25% tax bracket down to 22% (Middle class).  3% was definitely a nice difference for me. <br><br>-Retrain ALL police officers on what kind of force they can use in different situations.  Whites are the ones getting shot more than any other race everyday.  Blacks have the highest percentage of police brutality.   Police brutality is an issue among all races.  Blacks are smart enough to record the incidents, and America is finally realizing the true issues on what&#39;s going on in our homeland.<br><br>-Create laws that are the equivalent of Qatar when it comes to crime.  If you steal something, you&#39;ll get your arm chopped off.  There&#39;s a reason Qatar has the lowest crime rate in the world.  This will put many thieves and criminals in check really fast.<br><br>-Create anti-racist laws.  This means if a white person is caught saying something racist to another ethnicity, then they get life in prison.  Same with blacks against Mexicans, or Mexicans against Puerto Ricans, etc.  <br><br>-Create a law that tells all buisnesses the minimum requirements a person must meet to be hired (college degree, years of experience, strength for labor jobs, etc.).  If the first applicant meets all the listed requirements, that person MUST be hired regardless of race, gender, etc.  No chance of a company interviewing someone else and picking them due to their skin color.  <br>You want equality in America?

All this being said I have researched and I have looked at all the public information that I can and what I found is the following that is 1000% accurate. The Democrats for starters have a very long history of being racist and that goes back to the time when they formed, the Democrats were not very pleased when Lincoln freed the slaves so they had him assassinated by none other then a democrat, the vice President at that time was a democrat and once he took over he tried along with the other democrats help to go back on what Lincoln had accomplished and it failed thanks to the Republicans whom had just enough votes in chambers with some persuading. The democrats created the KKK and even today they still have members of their party that are active, Robert C Bird that was a Grand Dragon with the KKK and proud supporter spent his life and actually died while still serving in congress, he has bridges , buildings and roads named after him throughout WV yet he was a man of evil doing against the black communities. The Democrats have a lot more members with the same similarities scattered throughout America. They are supporters of planned parenthood that was created by democrats back in the day under Margaret Sanger, I suggest you take a look at her interviews and why they are in support of Abortion or shall I say why they actually started Abortions, the interviews are public information and you just have to look them up under her name. They started Abortions to try and cause the Black population to decrease by killing the black American Children so the race would eventually die off, or shall I say that was the plan and Sanger is not at all afraid to say that in her interviews of coarse they use the N word for their reference. They have fought against all civil rights movement and any legislation that went before them and still today do the same. I know you might say well they have black Americans in office and Joe Biden just picked a Black woman as his running mate yet you do not think of the fact that they are doing nothing but using the black Americans to try and gain power, look back at a year ago and see the debate that his running mate had with him before she dropped out of race for president , she exposed old Joe for what he is and how he was a racist,  the thing is everyone forgets that and they know this because people do not see to care. The real funny thing is no one wanted her as president a year ago but now a year later everyone does not think about old Joe dying in office and her taking the helm. Now we have a man that has been accused of sexually Assaulting his coworker running for President and he picks a black woman to use to try and get elected a woman that no one wanted a year ago and its okay? They shut his accuser up by one of two things they either threatened her and her family or paid very well. I do not get why someone would take money and forget something like that so I will assume she was threatened. Now on with more. The Black lives movement gets donations through their website and this is in the millions and should be going to help black lives and communities but NO it goes to all white democrats like Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren with millions received and the list goes on. This organization is ran by democrats as well as Antifa and they are paid and organized among them that are causing all these issues. Ask yourself why only certain parts of the country are having problems and not the rest? This is because they believe they can swing the blame onto Trump in these areas and swing that vote for these states because they need them to win the presidency.  They are using all the Americans period and the sad part is its going to cause a civil unrest that has not been seen since the civil war, Americans fighting Americans and they could really care less and why you might ask because they are evil and honestly they do not want Americans to be free anymore they want complete control and a lot are falling for it. The democrats sell Americans out to other countries and this is exactly what they plan. We can stop them and we will stop them. Do some research and you will see for yourself. Whom do you think dropped the ballots from the mail in a ditch in PA , all of these were for Trump. The demons aka Democrats are not going to let this be a fair election, they will continue to cheat and do what ever they can to try and take control and we the American people that believe in a fair election process and believe that we are one nation under <br>God and want to be able to keep our rights and freedoms have got to stop  them from destroying our country that men and woman have fought and died to protect throughout history, we will not let them take over , we will fight and we will win against this evil.

For example the gdp was growing at about 2.3% when Obama left after bouncing back from an inherited Great Recession that put gdp in the negatives.....trump had an increase to gdp by 1% to this number at best through trumps term (not counting 2020) but many argue much of that increase would have happened regardless of whether or not trump was in office or not as gdp was growing at steady rate when Obama left. Under Obama we also experienced a much higher moment of growth in 2014 then we ever have under trump. This is usually the largest reason I see people support trump for? So is there more to the story I don\u2019t know about? Obama added more jobs and spent less money while helping out the truly poor like me with various government programs rather then the middle class and above. This is on top of being more professional and considerate of others and not making questionable racist comments or supporting physical and verbal abuse and not \u201cbeing best\u201d (Obama was also more culturally sensitive and a supporter of the LGBTQ community unlike trump). Obama also wears a mask and maintains social distancing when possible and follows cdc guidance according to social media/images/videos of him. While trump has failed to do so only recently wearing a mask at all and even then very rarely (probably because his aides annoyed him with begging him to do it for publicity).... also holding rallies where trump supporters 80-90% of the time don\u2019t wear masks and certainly don\u2019t maintain social distancing.... the definition of involuntary manslaughter means you kill someone without intending to kill them. So when you directly or indirectly promote an environment of resistance to cdc guidelines and proper ppe this to me is no different then indirect involuntary manslaughter. just like how someone walking through a store or park with no mask who has COVID (symptoms don\u2019t always show) may get someone else with a weaker immunity sick with COVID and they may die....this too is involuntary manslaughter.... even if it is indirect... COVID has killed nearly half as many Americans as the worst war in American history the civil war. Far exceeding every single other country in the world. It is entirely possible that by the time COVID is eliminated from the USA we will have around as many deaths as World War II the second deadliest war in American history. <br><br>Sorry for the long spout there about COVID but yea...? I truly have no idea what trump did by his own actions (nobody else\u2019s influence or help) that helped so much that it forgives trump of his major flaws?? Also i paid more in taxes then trump according to his tax returns and I make about 10,000 a year as a part time care provider and full time graduate student? Unlike trump I have no failed businesses under my belt and never had tax legal issues? Unlike trump my charity I have given was actually legitimate unlike his charity organization that got taken down..... seriously what did he do? There is the 2018 first step act that he signed which I 100% supported but it\u2019s not like he came up with it? All he did was sign it and why wouldn\u2019t he? It was very popular on both sides to do anything other then that would be political suicide..... even his cherished relationship with North Korea is seen by many as a failure.... he has his own bag of scandals....he wears a bunch of orange makeup that along with him getting mad like he usually does just makes him look even more like a orange \ud83c\udf4a..... the guy is just as old as Biden just about.... he has many different sexual harassment/abuse accusers.....I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m trying hard here I can\u2019t come up with anything he did that helped so much who can help me?<br><br>\u200b@t<br><br>\u200b@t<br><br>\u200b@t<br><br>\u200b@t<br><br>\u200b@t<br><br>@t<br><br>\u200b@t<br><br>\u200b@t\u200b", "comment_date": "2020-10-05T21:05:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott Sloop", "comment_text": "If poetry doesn\u2019t rhyme, it\u2019s pointless.

A man&#39;s brain isn&#39;t built to spend too much time thinking about another persons pain and suffering cause it had to be always thinking about where is the next meal coming from - it was females that pondered what was happening in the lives of others and probably studied facial ques and verbal identifiers  and most likely where traits like sympathy and empathy sprouted up.  It was the woman of the pack, or whatever early hunter/gatherers called themselves that had more time for arts and crafts and of course they have to have an emotional attachment to their children.  Plus having so much downtime gives them more time to think which was GOOD cause women in those early human packs would contribute new ideas, whether it be for making clothes, making fires,  finding ways to catch smaller prey.  But it also leads to overthinking and overthinking is probably the source of depression. And where does depression run rampant? With Liberals and With Women.  These traits were perfect compliments to each other in pre agrarian societies but come the early 18th century and 19th century these traits were a hindrance to one another.

First off, I love my country. I favor capitalism , support the 2nd amendment, believe in hard work and personal responsibility, tend to be &quot;old fashioned&quot; in some ways, support the military and police, and want lower taxes for the average citizen. I&#39;m also Catholic and middle class from a (very moderate) democrat household....BUT<br><br>Yes, the US is not perfect, and has done and continues to do shitty things. But that doesn&#39;t change all the amazing and innovative things we&#39;ve done and still do as well. I will agree capitalism is a far from perfect system, Imho it is the best one we have. I still believe in background checks, and believe any citizen (who is responsible, ethical, and mentally healthy) should be able to own a gun. I abhor gun violence, and dangerous individuals should be kept away from them. I 100% support the legalization and decriminalization of marijuana, and possibly other drugs like shrooms. I have no problem with LGBT rights and marriage, as long as they treat me and everyone else with respect and do not &quot;force&quot; anything on anyone. I think budgets towards military and police could be cut (not exponentially but slowly over time) to go towards things like health and education to prevent poverty and police issues. I support free speech to death and don&#39;t believe in censorship unless it is violent, dangerous, or blatant propaganda/fake news. I am not a socialist but I agree that the rich should pay higher taxes, I could flirt with the idea of free healthcare (or at the very least more affordable) and definitely think college should be cheaper ( but not free.). I enjoy edgy jokes and movies but actual racism and bigotry piss me off. I hate extremists on both sides, communism and fascism are both awful ideologies.<br><br>At times, especially when online talking about politics, I can come off as a pissed off conservative with a &quot;boomer&quot; mindset or maybe even mistaken for far right. Rest assured everything I said is as truthful as I can be about my stances on pretty much everything I can think of. I will admit to having a bias towards republicans/patriotism, and over the last few months with everything going on, have made a goal to be more open minded and reasonable, and strive more towards facts and goodwill, rather than talking points and blindly siding with others who agree with me on some things but not others.<br><br>Anyway, there&#39;s my novel of a comment.

For instance my family dynamic is thus. Half of my family is far right republican and just one person shy of half my family is far left democrat, with me being the only independent swing voter out of that whole barn of disfunctionalism. First off both of my parents are as hard core conservative as you can get within a reasonable mindset. Their supporting trump for the long haul with no sign of acknowledging any criticism towards the moron, they&#39;re supportive of reasonable border security so long as the methods used are executed through logic and reason as well as extending to all people and not as an excuse to keep any one group of people out, they&#39;re pro second amendment due to their full support of the entirety of the constitution, their pro life as they have a strong distaste for wasting the potential what could have been not only a decent member of society but someone beneficial to humanity over all, and if you haven&#39;t guessed they&#39;re registered Republicans. Now growing up I was not only raised by these same parents to not only respect but show an interest towards other cultures, and to shy away from violence unless it was absolutely necessary. Both my parents preferred authentic hispanic, cultural, and oriental restaraunts to crap you would get at fast food or a steak house, and both parents taught me to broaden my perspective people and take an interest in other cultures, as well as learn more of the world over all. In fact it was the liberals in my family and those I&#39;ve met or associated with who condemned my interest in other cultures and preference for authentic foreign foods and trying new things. Calling it cultural appropriation, verbally berating me and even at times physically abusing me simply for taking an interest in something new or different. However again individuality and personal differences are a thing and I&#39;ve met quite a few people who differed away from this norm. However the reason I&#39;m an indipendence is no matter who it was no democratic or republican politician has the foresight nor are they open minded enough to view an arguement from both sides, meet somewhere in the middle, and by extension help the general public. While an indipendent isn&#39;t held down by any sense of blind loyalty to either party. Bias is still a factor as with all human beings but unlike with democrats and Republicans it isn&#39;t the defining element of of every decision that they make. This video is disgustingly biased and narrow minded and it doesn&#39;t take much intelligence or common sense to see it. Broaden your horizon and actually try to find some impartial research.

Early retirement ,power ,little to no labor and can take away anything they want from any human being! I\u2019m 54 and I woke up today realizing we have no restaurants left except chains! We have no ice cream truck? No small stores ! One tavern when we had 36!  No textiles plants few jobs! They have passed laws hindering small businesses halting them with exuberant changes licenses ,inspections , and ridiculous rules! My biggest question is why would a government want to  do this? Since the 70s I have watched us lose almost every mom and pop store in our town! Our home town bank is gone , every gas station that was privately owned.  We have nothing left but Walmart and chain stores! Most small businesses have no support from the community , usually it\u2019s the opposite  ! Small businesses are attacked and why?  Simple! The community is jealous and filled with hate that you did some with your life while they did nothing! There angry that you have more than them , that your organized hard working and there not ! They want to be you and believe they deserve what you have while they can\u2019t even manage simple tasks such as there maintaining there weight, bills or home! The politicians are furious that you have respect from the more intelligent people in your community , they hate the fact that you have garnered respect for being organized, hardworking and successful! They will break you and show you that you are not in charge , one council ordinance or law and your out of here! America sucks and is so evil ! It\u2019s path with this regime is simple! Take away your jobs your freedoms, make everyone live in poverty with crime drugs and  rundown homes. All while the regime fills you with lies of how free you are! The constitution is the biggest joke ever , almost every American would shit on it to have well paying job form the regime! They could care less what it stands for as little no as there getting ahead! Screw everyone else. With people like this being of the majority in our country we\u2019re in big trouble! We as a nation will be tax broke living in poverty with dictators running our very lives .

They treat CNN or NBC news like it&#39;s their bible, like their incapable of lying or having an agenda. People on the Right are suspicious and have a show me or prove it to me attitude. They have a distrust Republican or Democrat in politicians in general and don&#39;t believe much of anything they see or hear on tv(especially the news) because they realize that all involved have agendas. Politicians and left news media try and paint the right as racist, bigoted angry people but that&#39;s just not true. Go look up the walk away movement videos on YouTube. You will see thousands of past Liberals who when they finally opened their eyes and became truly woke they were shocked at how much flat out lying that&#39;s easily proven wrong that goes on at places like CNN and NBC and how they take little clips of things Trump says and spin it to fit their narrative and sometimes the clip they use Trump isn&#39;t even talking about the thing they spin it into. They all ask themselves how did I not see or realize this before. Almost every single one of them come away saying they had to much trust in the news and Liberal leaders when they should have known better. No one likes to admit they were easily fooled, everyone likes to think they are smart and can&#39;t be easily fooled. Just like painting Trump as a racist. They have zero evidence of him being a racist. There&#39;s actually more evidence of him not being a racist then that he is. They refuse to show you the evidence that doesn&#39;t fit their narrative and their hoping you wont investigate and find out for yourselves. They have cut so many snip its of longer conversations and twisted things so hard trying to sell a lie that he&#39;s a racist. Why....because they know that plays into peoples fears and emotions. When Trump is gone watch and see the very next Republican regardless if who he or she may be they will start trying to paint them ad a racist. Even if its Ben Carson himself they will somehow find a way to call him a racist...just watch and see. They tried to do it with George Bush and they tried to do it with Mit Romney. They try and sell this story that somehow all the racist politicians magically on the early 60 transferred to the Republican party but go look for yourself, nit one single politician switched parties during that time period.", "comment_date": "2020-06-19T01:38:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mickey Mouse", "comment_text": "This is bullshit.", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T20:38:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Fleischer", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve never understood why free-verse poetry is considered poetry, and secretly I guess I would go for meat and potato (even though I love trying out new cuisines).

The modern left wing/leftists support  social liberalism which is is a political ideology  that endorses a regulated free market economy and the expansion of civil and political rights. The modern right wing is moving away from status Quo conservatism- free trade, low taxes and judicial Precedence in court rulings  and moving towards traditional conservatism which is a philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of a transcendent moral order, which empathizes bonds of social order and the defense of ancestral institutions over hyper-individualism. The main differences I see is conservatives believe that any social unrest will lead to anarchy and thus why they support strong law enforcement to uphold social order while left leading people believe in changing the status quo by protest, boycott and even violence(Antifa)  and overall  belief in breaking the system to re-build a better system, sorta resembles the French Revolution style social change. Also in culture, right leading people believe that culture and traditions are sacred and that more immigration, illegal or not will  change the culture and thus the country as we know it and that fundamentally  culture is tied to its founders and that the less  America is    Christian or white(or both), the less likely it\u2019ll remain America as we know it . The modern left leaning people tend to appropriate aspects of other culture into their own( incorporating tea into British \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 culture for example), and tend to be rebellious of traditions(Religion and culture) and more willing to try new things to \u201cknow their true self\u201d and are more likely to try odd things to seek enlightenment. Basically conservatives want to conserve their identity and heritage(and believe they are enlightened by God or tradition or both) and that they  have the tools already to fix all  problems( Bible and constitution) while liberals tend to see the world as needing  constant improvement to new and ever changing  problems  and that the current tools are antiquated and need to be updated(Bible and constitution) and they can learn how to fix the  problems by being open to more suggestions from other countries /cultures I.e.: guns laws &amp; social safety net  in Europe, technology(High speed rail in Japan, Government Cloud(with transparency) n Estonia, etc.), Yoga In India, better  healthier food alternatives all over the world \ud83c\udf0e.", "comment_date": "2019-05-11T21:00:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "strange lil las", "comment_text": "What if you&#39;re neither?", "comment_date": "2019-05-11T19:52:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "raaston", "comment_text": "Republicans are better  and nothing and I mean nothing can disprove it", "comment_date": "2019-05-11T02:45:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Grey Walters", "comment_text": "People, people...this is all unnecessary.

Their motto might as well be &quot;if it feels good it must be good&quot;. Which just isn&#39;t true in many situations. Many left wing talking points are based in emotion rather than in the facts. Like Assimilation for example. We logically don&#39;t really have a nation or national identity. If immigrants don&#39;t Assimilate. If being Culturally foriegn is the same as being American or is being American. Than American isn&#39;t really a thing. How can we be a distinct people if all people&#39;s are American ? The left says &quot; American is whatever we want it to be&quot;. The right says &quot; if something cannot be defined. Than it has no relevant meaning&quot;. Does being an American have no relevant meaning ? To the left it doesn&#39;t. To conservatives it has a great deal of meaning. Another example of this. Is that conservatives correctly say that English is our historical, cultural and defacto official language. Which makes sense seeing as this nation was founded by Englishmen. So it logically follows that the citizens of a nation founded by Englishmen would also speak English. The left says that language should in no way be connected to someones identity. Especially not a person&#39;s National identity.

The truth is, Liberals are brainwashed from a very early age. Studies show that by a wide margin, children believe they&#39;re teachers/educators have more wisdom and knowledge than they&#39;re parents.  After being force fed large volumes of leftist propaganda throughout preschool, elementary, jr. high, high school and college, you&#39;ll have these hardcore socialist liberals primed and ready to go out into the world and fight capitalism, christianity, racism, the second amendment, pro life, global warming, homophobia, &quot;whitey&quot; and every other social-injustice in what they honestly believe to be the worst nation on the planet, The USA!  These young, left-wing zombies are the perfect vessels for absorbing lies from the &quot;elites&quot; causing such a  division from the right that they have created this extremely violent world wide left-wing mob! Unfortunately, the Liberals control nearly every facet of media and it will probably stay that way for a long time.  Whether it&#39;s the News, Hollywood, Television, Internet, Sports or Entertainment, anyone employed by these masses that strays one inch from the &quot;progressive&quot; narrative is abandoned by their peers, fired and then black-listed forever.  The good news?  Despite all of this, something magic seems to happen!  When these twisted children reach the ages of around 30-35 and move out of Mom and Dad&#39;s house and start struggling, they realize not everything is given to them for free. When they work hard and start to improve their lives they realize nothing should be free.  When they get married and start pushing out some kids, most start questioning everything they learned and believed in the past.  It&#39;s at that point that they&#39;ll see, hear or experiences something from the left that negatively impacts them strongly and then it happens...........  In a blink of an eye they are changed forever.  They are now apart of the silent majority that makes up approx. 75% of our population.  They are now, a Conservative!

Many members of the right-wing, Trump supporters especially, will condemn a specific idea as a work of the &#39;libtards&#39; but as soon as Trump adopts that stance or idea they immediately flop to support him like blind sheep. Take the bump stocks argument for example. <br><br>Many, no matter on which side of the spectrum they may stand, have completely closed themselves off to new ideas and refuse to even consider certain views of the left (for me personally, I believe the concept of universal healthcare is a good idea, but many of those on the right wing will be quick to dismiss me as a leftist and therefore close themselves off from a possible second opinion.) The fact that people on both sides of the spectrum have refused to even start a conversation with the other side, blindly conforming themselves to a single ideology as if it were a hockey team (go Canucks) with not even a second thought to understand the other side and at least consider some of their ideas.

It does tend to border on unemphatic with a pick up yourself up by your bootstraps mentality which doesn&#39;t always work perfectly. While the left sorta evens that out and smooths things over with ease of life social programs like social security and food stamps. But if that&#39;s left unchecked and becomes too ingrained in the government so their duty is to fix every little thing for people. It becomes unstable and hurts the economy and tends towards communistic ideas.  So in short you need both sides of the debate to figure out the ever moving needle of wants and needs in the country.

The field isn\u2019t understood enough to make those kind of conclusions from 1 study. The reason is that, if you have studied pain, you would know that we have very little information on how pain is actually encoded once it enters cortex. Saying that more S2 activation encodes for  \u201cmore pain\u201d is really going for a reach. Sure, that\u2019s the answer they want to see, especially if their study centers around something like politics, but often times our biases can lead us to see results that aren\u2019t actually there. S2 doesn\u2019t only process pain information, and pain information is sent to a multitude of locations, not just S2.

In our culture almost 100% of children are indoctrinated into liberalism during school years. Conservatives are those who retain their capacity for critical thinking or those who can be influenced by facts. It is fairly easy to convert a liberal if you can get them away from their constant stream of propaganda. To remain liberal one must constantly be isolated from reality. The truth is that until communism took over violently a century ago there were very few liberals on the planet. People understood the fragility of civilization and fought to protect its institutions. Christianity had a huge impact on severe conservatism and made it moderate. Liberals used to be more moderate conservatives. They fought for the things true conservatives hold dear like safety, environmental sustainability and equal access to opportunity. It is only since the 70s that liberalism took a severe turn towards communism, and fascism. Now they endanger children and the public at large. Witness the outbreaks of typhus in Los Angeles and the excrement on the streets of San Francisco. The rise of single mothers, a liberal cornerstone, has had horrific effects on our culture. Look at the statistics. Liberalism will eventually extinguish itself in an orgy of filth, sexual excess and violence. Liberalism is unsustainable because it require fantastic amounts of conservative cash to run itself. Then we will go back to a binary conservatism where moderates and traditionalists face off. The key difference is that no one will actually be fighting for the collapse of society as liberals currently do. Almost every conservative was raised as a liberal. It has less to do with biological differences than with an ability to smell a rat and to know when someone does not have your best interests at heart.", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T19:19:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "awwwkitteh", "comment_text": "Interesting video.
