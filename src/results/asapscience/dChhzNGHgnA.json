It is true anabolic steroids do make it easier to gain muscle mass. That said if you sit on you sofa and take steroids with no exercise and no increased protein intake at best you will gain about 3lbs. to 10lbs. of muscle mass. That is not that much given the dosages involved.\u00a0<br><br>What people fail to understand is that steroids work by increasing nutrient absorption from food you are eating and they speed up how quickly your body recovers from exercise. You have to be working out really hard and often and eating correctly to benefit from higher anabolic hormone levels.\u00a0<br><br>In fact to make it worth the health risks of taking steroids at higher then therapeutic levels one must workout really hard and really often!\u00a0<br><br>Growth Hormone on the other hand works no matter if you work out or not and this is even more true when talking about younger people that have not entered puberty or are currently in puberty. The freak show really starts to happen though when Growth Hormone, Anabolic Steroids and Insulin are administered combined with hard training.\u00a0<br><br>Depending on other side effects I would rather people have some sort of alternative to that combo if all they want is cosmetics and a myostatin blocking drug seems like a huge improvement over what is in use now.\u00a0<br><br>I am a young athlete with no aspirations of playing college or professional sports.
