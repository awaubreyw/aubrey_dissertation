To test this theory , (1)get on the piss (2) after a 12 pack of beers blow into a alcohol breath analyser and It is highly likely you will have an over the driving limit reading (3) immediately after this take 10 or 20 or more if you can slow deep breaths in and out.Each breath you inhale fresh oxygen and exhale your alcohol breath your alcohol analysis reading will decrease without fail. My friends and I have put this to the test many many times and it&#39;s works. I have actually blown 2 and half times the legal driving limit after numerous alcohol beverages but after approx 30 deep slow inhales and exhales and then immediately blow into the alcohol analyser I have had a reading of below the Australian driving limit of 0.05 or 250 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath. Obviously the best way to beat any test is don&#39;t drink and drive,but if you have had like 3-4 beers or wines and then go to drive home and you get pulled over by police,you along with many others will probably blow a bit over the 0.05 or 250 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath limit and you will lose your licence and get a fine. The amount of people who have lost his or her licence while being a little bit over the limit is alot of people.A half dozen or a dozen deep slow 1 litre inhales and exhales of breath before those people&#39;s tests most certainly would have had them all blow a under the limit reading.", "comment_date": "2021-01-26T02:18:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Ryan", "comment_text": "You should do this again but for cannabis.

The ADH Rc, when activated, it causes a cascade within the DCT cell, blah blah, that leads to increased genetic expression for the gene that encodes for Aquaporin II - which are the H20 Channels.... yup - now i remember - once those genes get enhanced, transcribed, translated, into actual protein molecules, manufactured in the ER - they are exported via process of exocytosis to the lumen side.. Increases water absorption so one doesn&#39;t get dehydrated.... unless if you drink alcohol and you block the V1 Rcs (V1 for Vasopressin).

What they are using in this video is called a PBT (Preliminary Breath Test) which is inadmissible in court. The PBT is used in the field to help the officer to determine if there is PROBABLE CAUSE to make an arrest for DUI (along with Standardized Field Sobriety Testing (SFST) which include the walk and turn, one leg stand and Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus).  The Intoxilyzer 5000EN series requires that the person undergo a 20 minute observation period to make sure there is no &quot;mouth alcohol&quot; present before blowing into the instrument. If mouth alcohol is present the instrument recognizes that and invalidates the sample. Also, some people think if they blow very lightly or &quot;act like they are blowing&quot; that they can beat it.  The instrument detects this and in fact will not let the sample be introduced until there is a sufficient PROLONGED force of air being blown that analyzes &quot;deep lung&quot; air.  Putting copper pennies in your mouth does nothing either ( except give you a bad taste in your mouth). Trying to circumvent the test using the above or any other methods can in fact result in a &quot;refusal to cooperate&quot; with testing which results in license revocation along with still being prosecuted. Refusing to cooperate with testing gets your license revoked EVEN if you are later acquitted of the DUI.
