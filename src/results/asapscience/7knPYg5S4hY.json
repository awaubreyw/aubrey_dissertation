Do you have a advice for me like it&#39;s pretty long story to explain my side of the story but I am going to cut it short as possible. I was originally born in Thunder Bay Ontario Canada and still living there. A lot and a lot of peoples who against me for being who i am and i am truly alienated by everyone. They&#39;re won&#39;t see me to become successful by achieving my goals such as living in America and getting my old life back and gain more happiness in my life. My father is betrayer/traitor to me after what he did to me. Many years ago before I went to Duluth, Minnesota, United States of America, I actually discovered major missing pieces of my life and I do have desire to live it in my own life. The problem is my father and peoples who do not want me to succeed and how I live in my life is actually not fair and kept fighting with them. Good news is a lot of them back down and actually do not interfered with me at all like I am dead to them. Well I&#39;ll be honest- i did shitty things to try get away from those peoples because they&#39;re associated with peoples who prevent me to succeed and most sad part of this is that i had no choices to hurt everyone and of course, especially towards my images, reputation and everything about me to just fight back. My father Jody Clifton Aiken, my aunt Charlotte Tozer, My Cousin Angelica Tozer and others from our families who don&#39;t support me to succeed, they&#39;re actually cut out of my life and i do not interfered with them at all. They&#39;re can be lucky enough to interact with me if they have a god damn chance. That&#39;s how bad it is. For father, he&#39;s only one who haven&#39;t cut out of my life yet. He&#39;s very unsporting, unsupportive, and I have nothing good to say, personally. The reason why he&#39;s ain&#39;t cut out of my life because I am living with him and he&#39;s has his ways to contact me or get a hold of me or probably tried to manipulating/brainwashing/deceiving/etc me as just like others who want me to keeps me in this place that i really don&#39;t want to live in and especially didn&#39;t asked to be focused to how I live my life without restrictions, discriminations, controlled and so on. This is exactly why i am very rebellious and really don&#39;t give a $#!T about everything and anything. It&#39;s all matters about getting my life back and be happy again without chaos and dramatic events and negativities. All i really asked for everyone who prevent me to do not succeed to reach my goals is go court with me to fight me in front of authorities who has really good opened mind and of course, has gigantic heart that&#39;s accepting everyone and everything and of course, knowing the rights and wrong in this world. I don&#39;t want cruel judge or crooked police forced or whoever are authorities because it&#39;s not fair to the innocent like me that get totally wracked by someone who corrupted. Now, That&#39;s short cut version of my story and y&#39;all has no idea of uncut version of my story. Also just let you know that I have a very small handful of peoples who want me to succeed and become my american dream. So are there&#39;s any good advices/tips for me? I actually felt like one man one army to fight my rights and my life back onto my hands also I am over 20, so I am considered myself as adult and plus I do have a touch of disability but it&#39;s doesn&#39;t means i am fully disabled or someone has disabilities also side note: I really hate everyone says that I am autistic or whatever that associated with disabilities / disabled related terms and labels. I just wish they learn some f#%king respects me when it&#39;s comes to judging and using me as weapon or whatever. You know there&#39;s a lot of stuff by reading all of this. I need your advices/tips and everyone else too because I don&#39;t know what I do now. I really hope there&#39;s a miracles for me because i definitely don&#39;t want deal with negativity anymore on serious note also it&#39;s not good for peoples like me because sometimes there&#39;s a lot of thoughts to end my life or running away but mostly ending my life because it&#39;s shows that I given up on my life and myself plus it&#39;s shows that peoples aka monsters defeated me and won over my life. Are there&#39;s any advices or tips for me anyone? I really appreciated from all of you for helping me because i definitely needed a lot of help from a lot of you guys and the ones who experienced this once before....", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T19:07:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "KILLER QUEEN", "comment_text": "Not all Americans are obese, fat, and wasteful.

There are many (not all, but quite a bit) of people bashing America and to want to show more of the positives is understandable.  With that being said though, America is by no means a &quot;perfect country.&quot;  Now, to all of those who are saying terrible stereotypes about America and how their country is so much better, you countries aren&#39;t perfect either. Once again, I can understand wanting to defend your country with what some Americans are saying, but it really does get to a point where both sides go too extreme and make everything so much worse. We all live somewhere in this world, and to try and say that one country is the best is simply a lie. Every country has done something to be considered amazing, but they have also done things that aren&#39;t something to be proud of.  We are all countries that live on the land that makes up what we know as Earth.

Now let&#39;s say that &#39;america&#39; now has 2x the population size instantly that means now that 1% of country is making breakthroughs. But a country well never blow up that instanly. So let&#39;s say america the original population before(1.3B) and overtime the population grows. It is stable naturally that 2% of really smart people would grow with that said population.  So if america grows to 1.3B people to 2.6B and a reasonable rate than naturally the smart people percentage stays the same because the smart people and the population grow at the same speed. BTW the Americans average IQ may grow but the smart people since they are above average that means their IQ is higher.

It&#39;s a shame the division isn&#39;t just what I see in the comment section pitting America against Europe or Canada, etc... <br><br>It also stems internally as well.  Let&#39;s say someone from Europe bashes America.  That would be on a larger scale.  Yet in America, we might bash each other if you live in a different state.  Ex. California for being liberal, Alabama for being conservative.  Then within those states, we bash towns or cities we deem trashier or less than us.  Then within those towns and cities we bash groups of people we don&#39;t identify with.  Then within those groups of people we might bash people in our closest of circles in our family and friends group.  It just continues with division no matter how far inwards or outwards you go.  It&#39;s the tribe mentality.  <br><br>Though, for all of you bashing each others&#39; countries in the comments section, imagine an alien race looking down on Earth bashing it saying it&#39;s a terrible planet, and now you all are part of the group as a whole.  Or yet another alien race bashing the Milky Way galaxy for being a crappy galaxy and Andromeda is the superior galaxy.  It can continue on much larger scales as well as you see.  So what should this tell us?  How about start judging people individually, or maybe don&#39;t even judge them at all and lump everyone into a category knowing nothing about them.  <br><br>I may live in America, but many of these statistics in this video do not apply to me or many people I know whatsoever.  So how about start spreading loving kindness to one another?  Stop judging people on their race or sexuality or where they were born or live.  Start spreading more positivity and helping others become their best version and encourage one another.

Australia has a smaller economy than Texas, Britain, Canada, and Germany are crumbling at the hands of Islam, and Japan, you&#39;re alright. Keep it up.

If you&#39;d like to bully somebody, I suggest getting off the Internet and taking a walk outside, as I cannot think of any distinct reason to hate some other place other than being incompetent of where you live. Also, please don&#39;t use Trump as an argument against us. &quot;Wow man said mean thing ew&quot;.

Without US presence in Europe, the USSR would have instigated communist regimes further west. I know that sounds hypocritical, but at least we don&#39;t treat countries unfairly through our military and economic power. We instigate regimes, not for our own benefit but for the freedom of man. The world hates us now, but wait until Iran and China becomes more powerful and influential because these two countries won&#39;t treat you as fairly as the US has. We have military bases in Europe not because we want to control you, but because your military is weak and you&#39;ve benefited from that. Your governments have the ability to invest in your economy instead of the military. You have free trade because the US navy protects international waters from selfish countries like China (South China Sea). Foreign companies in China have a difficult time expanding because their government restricts foreign competition, while they monopolize markets in others. Apple has to abide by government rules, Facebook is censored, Google is censored.  <br><br>History will not remember us as oppressors, but as the first empire that didn&#39;t oppress its territories or force our influence upon the world. We import more products than we export. We allow foreign companies to beat our own. We are concerned about the flourishment of globalization, free trade and liberty around the world.

The way you keep supplying guns and sending spies to manipulate the course of a third-worlds country&#39;s history for your own gain regardless of the effects and the state of the people in said countries afterwards. And before you boast about your technologies, lets not forget the people who are assembling said technologies are the people in some random country (probably unknown, geographically, for you guys) who are slaving away their life just to make a living for their family. And the clothes that you&#39;re wearing? The fancy brand-name shoes and sports gear that youre using? Check the Tag. See where it comes from. I know that most of you are not that ignorant now, but sometimes you can be so ungrateful for all the things that you have and just carelessly and thoughtlessly throw away stuff that arent even that badly damaged (like changing your phone every few months and throwing away the old 13 month old smartphone). <br><br>And as for people that keep coming and are trying to come to your country constantly? theyre the people who are trying to survive and so they&#39;ll do any desperate act in order to achieve that goal.

To the people making the argument that people are bashing Americans, but we do a lot is completely off the wall. Just because we do a lot does not mean that we are entitled to do what we want how we want. I may identify as a Republican Independent, but that type of logic is so far conservative that it is not reasonable anymore.<br>2. Yes, we do a lot. Yes, we are a larger country. Yes, we will produce more waste and things of the sort compared to certain smaller countries, so let&#39;s put some of their data (which felt very blatantly Democratic and passive aggressive) into that perspective.<br>3. We could and should change how certain things are taken care of in the country such as trash, emissions, health care, etc... but our political system controls all these issues, and it is so far polarized from the usage of social media that there is a high chance little will happen about it except arguing.<br>4. Disclaimer: This is not a point as much as a note to those reading this and looking for a reason to argue... probably quite violently. I know I talked of my political thoughts and made a remark on theirs then proceed to say that things are too politically polarized. I am saying this as separate points and ideas. So, my point is that this data is more or less organized and presented in a way that supports a more Democratic viewpoint which is okay, but we need to consider the opposite side before arguing the DATA. On the note of the political polarization, I am saying that because we have issues to address, but we have a system where if we even remotely step on another person&#39;s feet it&#39;s shut down. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s okay to freely pass bills and do things just to try it or what have you, but I do think our current ideals and system make it so passing anything or addressing any issue is a bit too open for argument when certain small things could just be tested out instead of argued over for extended periods of time before even getting to the yes/no on passing it.", "comment_date": "2017-08-25T05:41:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LCD drownd", "comment_text": "&quot;What if everyone lived like Americans&quot; The world would be awesome.", "comment_date": "2017-08-25T05:39:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LittleMissOblivious", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t hate America.
