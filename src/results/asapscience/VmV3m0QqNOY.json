And less than 5% of people could read when Jesus walked the earth. So, they compiled it into a lie to deceive and control the people with for their selfish religious reasons. They say \u201cthe dead sea scrolls,\u201d but they do not want you to think of the bible as a scroll, but rather a book that was since the beginning. THERE WERE NO BIBLES IN THE BEGINNING, IT WAS COMPILED INTO AN IDOL AROUND AD325 by Constantine the sun-god worshiper for his bishops. The RCC had it locked up for themselves until the first bible was made available to the masses in 1560 with the Geneva bible.<br>Luke 4:17<br>King James Version<br>17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,<br>GOOD THING MY FAITH IS IN WHAT JESUS TELLS ME AND NOT A BOOK.<br>The bible has the word &quot;book&quot; 188 times, there were no books as we know them today until after the invention of the printing press and the first bible made avalable to the common public was the Geneva bible in 1560.<br><br>&quot;You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&quot;\r<br>When a well packaged web of lies has been sold gradually through time to the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic. \r<br>It\u2019s easier to fool people than it is to convince them that they have been fooled. \r<br>No one is more hated than he who speaks the truth.\r<br>     This truth will free you to seek for the Living God in the Spirit and to truly KNOW GOD instead of just knowing ABOUT HIM.\r<br>     The GOSPEL is NOT written with ink, nor on tablets of stone, but on our hearts by the Spirit of the Living God. \r<br>The gentiles who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, then they are a law unto themselves. \r<br>Under the New Covenant we are to be led by the Holy Spirit, not the bible.\r<br>        I was searching for truth when Jesus told me, &quot;The bible is an idol&quot; which completely changed my direction.  After that I only sought for Him in the Spirit and He has taught me many things on life&#39;s journey.\r<br> The most important of which is that He died so we could be regenerated by the Holy Spirit into sons and daughters of God. \r<br>The gospel is simple, repent from living after the flesh, ask Jesus to fill you with the Holy Spirit and then be led and controlled by Him through the Spirit. \r<br>The bible is only history and has absolutely no authority from God to control us, the outward law was under the old covenant. Jesus died to redeem us from the curse of the written law because we were unable to keep it. \r<br>Have a great journey through life with the Living Christ guiding you.\r<br>When Jesus words are written down and Satan is using them, then the bible becomes the word of Satan.\r<br>     Constantine (1st) beast compiled 50 bibles, legalized Christianity and set up the false prophet (pope). \r<br>King James (2nd) beast, born 6/1566, 6th of Scotland, authorized a bible in 1611 that now has 66 books to control people with, an image of God&#39;s word they make to speak (the bible says). \r<br>By having faith in the bible which has been made into an idol, they break the new covenant of having faith in the Living Christ through the Holy Spirit, who is the true word of God. \r<br>THE BIBLE IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST\r<br>Ask Jesus -Yeshua for the Holy Spirit.\r<br>Link To Blog Site Book: \r<br>Book 1 THE BIBLE IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST\r<br><a href=\"http://bibleismarkofbeast.blogspot.co/\">http://bibleismarkofbeast.blogspot.co.</a>.. \r<br>BOOK 2 THE BIBLE IS AN IDOL\r<br><a href=\"http://bibleismarkofbeast.blogspot.co/\">http://bibleismarkofbeast.blogspot.co.</a>..\r<br>Youtube Channel:\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/BIBLEisMARKofBEAST/videos\">https://www.youtube.com/c/BIBLEisMARKofBEAST/videos</a><br>\u2022\u2022\u2022\ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udc96", "comment_date": "2022-04-27T04:29:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Diana Clements", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve had 3 strokes.

They just need to pair this with an AI and you can have your own Venom suit or liquid metal Terminator.<br>It can be used inside the body also to deliver drugs to a certain part of the body, Chemo directly to a tumor, or cleaning arteries of Cholesterol buildup, or a blood clot in the heart.<br>This could be redesigned to work in house plumbing systems also. If you have roots growing into your sewer lines you could have a little blob of this that wanders thru your lines and cleans them out or looks for leaks in pipes and repairs them or cleans out your air vents in your house.<br>It could even be programmed to crawl over surfaces like your floor and clean it like a Roomba while you are away and you would come home to a cleaned house. A version could me made to clean your shower, or toilets and then just go down the drain and breakdown in the septic/sewer system.<br>Put this in your yard and have it mow the lawn, kills weeds, kill the queen in an ant colony or even map out an ant colony and make some really cool 3D art.<br>The possibilities are endless.", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T15:28:00Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "bhaskarjyotipatangia", "comment_text": "Forget science...its Venom without consciousness", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T15:24:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JAE3K", "comment_text": "Imagine this is what caused the covid vaccine to become magnetized where it was injected into your skin", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T15:22:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zeus McFly604", "comment_text": "stop it", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T15:21:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Denzel Stephen", "comment_text": "Here for the terminator references", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T15:20:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "freddy fresco", "comment_text": "Wtf is this <br>Some terminator shit", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T15:20:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Chin", "comment_text": "Yeah that&#39;s definitely how we are gona die!", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T15:19:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "superitgel", "comment_text": "It&#39;s the prototype of T-1000", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T15:17:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tezorus", "comment_text": "The real question is : <br>Can it take a Robert Patrick shape ?", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T15:15:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CraWea", "comment_text": "The actual explanation starts at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmV3m0QqNOY&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a>, but does not mention that the \u201cslime\u201d is moved by magnets not shown in the videos.
