At one point in the debate I like how Dawkins said &quot;I can&#39;t explain the origin of life at the moment.&quot; But towards the end of the debate he says &quot;it cannot be God.&quot; That&#39;s a real logical fallacy. Oh and Dawkins changes his position on Jesus&#39; existence from what he said in his book about that it&#39;s under scholarly dispute Dawkins in that debate said he takes that back and says that Jesus existed. Not to mention the argument of fine tuning for evidence of a Creator.  And Just so you know the reason why people don&#39;t wanna believe the Bible is because God&#39;s word says that they love their sin and wanna suppress the truth of God, Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_UPnh9nLkg&amp;t=1m18s\">1:18</a>-22 the Bible says &quot;The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools.&quot; Verse 28 says &quot;And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind.&quot; Also Stephen Meyer author of Darwins doubt has done very well  against atheists in debate and Dr. James White has even done much better.
