Delve into equine color genetics, and you will find that zebras are EE AA DD, so dominant bay dun. The striping is caused by dun, a modifier gene that also creates a striping pattern to a less extreme extent in horses. When you crossbreed a zebra to a horse, the zorse foal looks like an extreme version of a bay dun horse. All zorses born have an E_ A_ D_ base at minimum, meaning that all of them are genetically bay dun even if there are other color genes at play that may dilute the color or cover it, such as tobiano or cream. If you compare a zorse with a normal bay dun horse, you&#39;ll notice that the striping congregates in all of the same places. Dun is a primitive modifier gene that exists in all equids and partially evolved out of horses, which is why not all of them have it.<br>With this knowledge in mind, you can definitively say that zebras are bay (or black, as most would say) with dun (white) striping.

This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I&#39;m a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18) or that if you believe in God then you&#39;re Good which isn&#39;t true. But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MIrbW4ygV8&amp;t=7m13s\">7:13</a>-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It&#39;s not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God&#39;s presence forever where you&#39;re never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can&#39;t continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn&#39;t rise from the dead.
