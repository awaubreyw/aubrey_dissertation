[{"comment_by": "Anand Acharya", "comment_text": "I think this is a case of sports adopting to humans rather than humans adapting to sports. One of the example is swimmers/sprinters and hydro/aerodymanic body types, over time more and more athletes with streamlined body adapt to take swimming as a sports option rather than bulkier athletes and the stockier people go toward sports like weight lifting.", "comment_date": "2021-07-04T12:50:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tondisx", "comment_text": "found this from <a href=\"http://archive.org/\">archive.org</a> lol", "comment_date": "2021-04-23T23:12:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Raquelle", "comment_text": "Us gymnasts heights: \ud83e\udd38\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \ud83d\udcc9", "comment_date": "2021-03-01T02:38:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "violet evergarden", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXw9P6sCcF4&amp;t=1m55s\">1:55</a>", "comment_date": "2021-02-04T14:15:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guilherme Barbosa", "comment_text": "Mairo vergara i luv you", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T03:29:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Victor Rafhael", "comment_text": "The athletes of today are not only much better than those of the past, they also look incredibly different. The weird thing is, scientists know that the human body hasn\u2019t evolved that dramatically in the past one hundred years. So why do Olympic athletes look so different now compared to the first winter Olympics in 1924?<br><br>2 \u2013 In the early 1900s, the ideal athlete was based on classical human proportions. If we imagine body types distributed as a bell curve with extreme body types being on the far ends, it was the middle of the curve that was considered the best physical build. Athletes who were not too tall but not too short, not too bulky but not too skinny and well, average, were deemed as ideal for the Olympic pursuit.<br><br>3 \u2013 But this has all changed. Now, athletes succeed based on their highly specialized body types which allow them to excel in a world of growing competitiveness. For example, athletes who are required to spin in the air such as figure skaters or gymnasts have been getting smaller. These athletes with short specialized body types have an advantage over average or tall athletes, weeding them out at the elite level.<br><br>4 \u2013 In fact, in thirty years, the average professional gymnast has shrunk from 5,3ft to 4,9ft. Computer simulations studying the physics of ski jumping have proven that jump length increases drastically with a decrease in body weight. Throughout recent years, this has caused world class ski jumpers to become extremely underweight, including many examples of anorexia.<br><br>5 \u2013 With women competing in the Olympic ski jumping event for the first time this year, their bodies are stockier and broader than their male counterparts. As female ski jumping becomes more popular and competitive in the future, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see the extremely thin ski jumping body type dominate the sport.<br><br>6 \u2013 Hockey is also an example of visible body changes. Studies looking at the past 26 years alone found a steady increase through the years of nearly all variables measured. This included height, mass, body mass index, aerobic and anaerobic fitness and even grip strength. Since the 1920s hockey players have increased nearly four inches on average from 5,9 to 6,1ft.<br><br>7 \u2013 So clearly the Average Joe Olympian is a thing of the past. But science says the games may now be a realistic goal for people of many different sizes and shapes. Don\u2019t forget we have a new video out every day during the Olympics. Can\u2019t wait? Our amazing partners at the CBC already have five of the videos up now for you to binge on.<br><br>8 \u2013 Just head to <a href=\"http://cbc.ca/Olympics/ScienceSays\">cbc.ca/Olympics/ScienceSays</a> to watch them before anyone else.

Maybe in antiquity, or just early in the 20th century, one could work hard, make the right connections and have a little luck to be selected to become an Olympic athlete, and represent their country at the Games. Fast forward to our era of forced hyper-globalization, and you&#39;ll notice that the difference between those who get gold and those who get nothing could be a matter of a fraction of a second.<br><br>Athletic competition has intensified to such an extent that genetics is now the sole deciding factor as to who wins and who is completely forgotten. A matter of a single nucleotide out of three billion could be the difference between an amateur diver and a gold medalist. There are a number of traits that are directly related to athletic performance, for example, those that involve erythropoietin signalling; this hormone pathway modulates the number of available red blood cells in the body at all times. Some athletes have genetic conditions that cause this hormonal system to be over-activated for whatever reason -- the result is equivalent to &quot;blood doping&quot;.<br><br>Imagine having trained your entire life, investing every dime and moment of free time you had in order to become good at what essentially boils down to just one single Olympic event. You got to the top of the local listings, the state/provincial listings, then the national listings, and then, finally, an entire lifetime of work pays off, and you get a spot at the next Olympic games in your event.<br><br>The truth is, it matters precisely fuck all these days. The person next to you trained just as hard as you, followed the same steps as you, and deserves it just as much as you. The only difference between you and them is... a hormonal receptor allele. They take the gold, you end up with 4th or 5th place, and are soon completely forgotten.<br><br>Now you understand why high-level athletes take &#39;extra measures&#39; to ensure &#39;top performance&#39;. It makes no sense anymore to shame or despise them; what they&#39;re doing is just emulating the accidental natural &#39;tweak&#39; that is the favorable genetic makeup of some lucky, extremely rare person, somewhere in the multitude of people in the world.<br><br>Now that&#39;s one awful state of affairs, at least in my opinion. It takes everything away from what was once a good-natured international competition that most people could relate with and cheer for. Today it&#39;s just a matter of pitting these tortured creatures against each other to see who just happens to have the right mutation in the right place. There will come a time when every genetically favorable allele for Olympians will be discovered and described -- and at that point there is just no point in having the Games at all, because the outcome is predetermined.
