And it<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=00m35s\">00:35</a><br>just so happens that between 8 and 9 AM cortisol levels peak.<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=00m39s\">00:39</a><br>This means that your body has a natural mechanism to wake you up. And while you may think that<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=00m43s\">00:43</a><br>caffeine can complement this mechanism, scientists have actually found that consuming coffee<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=00m48s\">00:48</a><br>or energy drinks during peak cortisol production greatly diminishes the caffeine&#39;s effect AND<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=00m54s\">00:54</a><br>builds up a greater tolerance to the drug in the long run. Overall, that means you get<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=00m58s\">00:58</a><br>less of a buzz, and need even more to stay awake in the future. We break down caffeine<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=01m03s\">01:03</a><br>addiction and tolerance in a previous video \u201cYour Brain on Coffee\u201d which you can check<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=01m07s\">01:07</a><br>out here!<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=01m07s\">01:07</a><br>For this reason, drinking coffee after your cortisol surge at 9AM is probably best. Scientists<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=01m13s\">01:13</a><br>have found a few other times where cortisol peaks as well: between noon and 1pm, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=5m30s\">5:30</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=01m20s\">01:20</a><br>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=6m30s\">6:30</a>pm. Which means your best drinking your coffee outside of these times.<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=01m24s\">01:24</a><br>These cortisol spikes - and your circadian rhythm in general - are most strongly regulated<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=01m28s\">01:28</a><br>by sunlight, meaning your sleep schedule doesn\u2019t come in to play as strongly.<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=01m32s\">01:32</a><br>So what if you wake up extremely early, or really late? Should you drink coffee right<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=01m37s\">01:37</a><br>away then? Well, scientists have actually found that cortisol levels do indeed increase<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=01m41s\">01:41</a><br>about 50% right after you wake up, regardless of the time. Science says, wait at least an<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=01m46s\">01:46</a><br>hour to get your cup of joe, and your body will be optimally ready to go!<br>Pr\u00f3ximo", "comment_date": "2018-03-15T22:54:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Casa & Cosmeticos", "comment_text": "Viele von uns wachen auf und haben nur eines im Sinn - KAFFEE!

Und es<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=00m35s\">00:35</a><br>ergibt sich, dass zwischen 8 und 9 Uhr morgens Cortisol seinen H\u00f6hepunkt erreicht.<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=00m39s\">00:39</a><br>Das bedeutet, dass dein K\u00f6per einen nat\u00fcrlichen Mechanismus zum Aufwachen hat.

There is a math-game or math-trick that seems to confuse almost everyone, and when a mathematician explains it, people still don&#39;t get it and say the mathematicians are wrong!...   It&#39;s called &quot;the monty hall problem&quot;. Imagine you are on a game show and the game show host shows you three doors. Behind one of them is a car and behind the other doors are goats. So you will win a car or a goat. But the rules are as follows: the game show host knows where the car is, and everytime you pick a door, before revealing what&#39;s behind it, the game show host will open one of the doors you didn&#39;t picked, with a goat behind it and say: You now have 2 doors left. Do you want to stick with your choice or would you like to switch your choice to the other unrevealed door?.. The answer is if you switch you will double your odds of winning from 33,3% to 66,6%, but there are so many people who think it&#39;s 50/50!!! Maybe you could make a video called something like &quot;explaining the monty hall problem&quot;, in a way that people understand, why its 66,6% and NOT a 50/50 chance.

This is known as the cortisol awakening response (mentioned about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgmayMSESI&amp;t=1m46s\">1:46</a> in the video). See <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167876008007940\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167876008007940</a> for more info.<br><br>Second, as someone who does research on cortisol, this is literally the first time I have ever heard of cortisol as being associated with alertness and wakefulness. I&#39;ve also been around a number of sleep researchers who study alertness/wakefulness and I&#39;ve never heard cortisol mentioned as a major mechanism or even a marker of alertness. Now, the hormone produced in the hypothalamus, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), which has multiple functions in the brain, is implicated in alertness (see: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/jc.2004-1056\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/jc.2004-1056</a>), but cortisol is not a direct read out of CRH levels. So, the video might be best served by talking about CRH levels and not cortisol.<br><br>Finally, the video implies that drinking coffee at times when cortisol is at its highest interferes with the effect of caffeine on alertness. That would seem to suggest that cortisol somehow interferes with caffeine&#39;s ability to bind to adenosine receptors. I can&#39;t find any papers that suggest this.<br><br>In sum, I don&#39;t disagree with the idea that drinking coffee at particular times of day is better than others. I just don&#39;t think cortisol plays the key mechanistic role. Better to describe neural mechanisms, since those are the ones that regulate wakefulness in the first place.", "comment_date": "2015-06-01T19:21:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lilianne Weinhandl", "comment_text": "I start drinking coffee after I arrived at work, so that&#39;s at least 90 minutes after my allarm went off :) .", "comment_date": "2015-06-01T19:10:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atomic Ace", "comment_text": "How is the planets formed wasdo", "comment_date": "2015-06-01T18:29:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "myrdraal2001", "comment_text": "I know some people that get sleepy from regular coffee.
