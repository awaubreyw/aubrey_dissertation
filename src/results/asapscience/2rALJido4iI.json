My ears feel like someone&#39;s scraping nails down a chalk board and I cringe and it makes me want to cry. This is only if their needs aren&#39;t being met. If the baby is just tired or something and every other need is met it bothers me less. I don&#39;t like hearing babies cry in stores. There are different cries. There&#39;s the no need cry and there&#39;s the help me cry. The latter pulls the strong reaction from me), I carry and hold them a LOT, they smell AMAZING to me, I get happy just looking ta them and get very attached very easily, etc. I&#39;ve been helping care for other people&#39;s kids since I was 3 and my brother was born. I started volunteering with the babies at church daycares when I was 7. I&#39;ve been working with kids since.
