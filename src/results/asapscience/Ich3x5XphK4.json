Male Circumcision is Mutilation, Evil, and Sin try being informed not just opinionated.  And I hate that this guy&#39;s is so just happy while he talks about it and how he is overall neutral about it.  God made everything very good Gen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ich3x5XphK4&amp;t=1m31s\">1:31</a> and put every member in it&#39;s place with design and purpose 1 Cor 12:18, the practice God gave to Israel was way different than the modern practice, it didn&#39;t cut off the whole prepuce organ and it went out with animal sacrifice as those things were shadows and types pointing to Jesus and were to show the wretchness of sin.  Milah Circ (just the tip of the foreskin) - it Ceased in Christ so it would be abohrant to do those in routine or at all VS Per&#39;iah Circ (modern practice, cutting the whole prepuce organ off) invented by evil Man and the Judaizer groups and influenced by the Devil. Phil 3:2.  Just because God commanded something doesn&#39;t mean he likes it for example animal sacrifice, or when he told David he couldn&#39;t build the temple after he had commanded him to kill the evil people around him because he now has too much blood on his hands.  So it goes to the spirit of the law and the law of love in the mind of Christ.<br><br>In neonates they take them and put them on a torture like table and the infant screams so much from the pain and infants feel pain more than adults and thats been proven because they have more sensitive nerve endings, that they usually falls into a sleep that scientists can&#39;t even understand.  And evil doctors then take the foreskins and they grind them up using their residual stems cells to make skin regeneration creams for evil rich people and it&#39;s Satanic what they do.  Look up South Korea does this as Oprah Winfrey sponsors it and she is going to Lake of Fire.<br><br>They remove the organ that is the equivalent to the female clitoral hood, and most don&#39;t know much about anatomy or history or philosophy, ethics or morals or even theology but this should prick your conscience but for some they are ignorant or partially ignorant or hardened in their heart.  And the humans concience isn&#39;t perfect because when we gained the knowledge of good and evil we did not gain a perfect knowledge as only God has that, but some know it better and this is something God has given me knowledge and discernment in great measure through the Holy Spirit since I was young, but I am also surprised that it takes sometimes people with a spiritual gift to see these things as most have let these things from the culture seep into church without a biblical perspective.  The male organ is made to protect and give pleasure to both sexes and was created by God on purpose for a purpose with over 15 different functions.  It is not just skin but an actual organ that is beautifully crafted by God as he knows how to make little boys.<br><br>Back to Phil 3:2 any Christian reading this should realize that doctors will sometimes just do it without asking and we must be vigilant to protect your young boys.  There is a lot of miscommunication about this practice and most don&#39;t know the science, it doesn&#39;t stop STDs, only monogamous relationships do as God intended but the real problem is most live their promiscuous lifestyles.  It doesn&#39;t stop UTIs it actually increases them especially when done in  neonates.  It actually decreases pleasure and doesn&#39;t have the lubrication that was intended again by God.  It isn&#39;t that hard to clean the foreskin and I haven&#39;t had any issues with mine as most don&#39;t.<br><br>So to do this is for conformity, pure astecics, or any non truly necessary reason is a mutilation, an evil sin, and truly abohrant and we Christian Gentiles have usually liked our foreskins unchanged as the Holy Spirit didn&#39;t want it anymore and the modern practice is the same type of practice that Paul called the Mutilation.  I have researched this to great depth and every argument for Circumcision is based off parents marking their sons with their own ignorance.  But I call out things that people blindly accept and show them for the sin that they are and am kindof a rebel that way.<br><br>So if anyone does this to another after reading what I just said without truly reasonable cause then they are committing a brazen evil sin and not just a sin in ignorance as James 4:17 says Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it for him it is sin.  And that also gets around any ignorance.

However, the penile cancer argument isn&#39;t very significant and in many cases, is stretched beyond proportion. Dr. Stephen Moreton (a chemist and part-time petrologist from England, so watch out) claims that in the developing world, the penile cancer risk decrease is &quot;only found in circumcised men.&quot; However,  in Australia, a predominantly uncircumcised country, the odds of getting penile cancer are below one in 100,000, about the same as the United States, which is predominantly circumcised. Many European countries share the same rate except England and Wales, which have a slightly elevated risk (1.3 in 100,000), but this is likely a result of social and lifestyle factors; a similar rate is found in Denmark.

However, Dowsett and Couch examined the results of the three RCTs, but found insufficient evidence to recommend circumcision to prevent HIV infection.[88] Green et al. reviewed the evidence and also found \u201cinsufficient data\u201d as well as contrary evidence.[89,90]While RCTs are often considered the gold standard of medical trials, this only applies to RCTs with study designs that minimize bias. The three African RCTs were very similar in study design and contained multiple sources of bias, outlined below[89-92]:\r<br> * Researcher expectation bias \u2212 Many of the investigators had written papers advocating for male circumcision to prevent HIV infection prior to undertaking these RCTs. Siegfried et al. note, on the topic of research on circumcision to prevent HIV, that \u201cresearchers\u2019 personal biases and the dominant circumcision practices of their respective countries may influence their interpretation of findings.\u201d[93]\r<br> * Participant expectation bias \u2212 The majority of participants were convinced that circumcision would reduce their risk of HIV infection.[94]\r<br> * Lead time bias \u2212 Men randomized to the intervention arm of the trials (the group that was circumcised) were considered to be at risk for becoming infected from the time of the surgery, even though they were told to avoid sexual activity during the period of wound healing. Men in the control arm (the ones who were not circumcised) were able to be sexually active from the beginning of the study.\r<br> * Selection bias \u2212 Only men who were interested in a free circumcision were eligible to participate, and therefore may not have been representative of the general population.\r<br> * Attrition bias \u2212 For every man who became infected with HIV during the trials, 3.5\u22127.4 men were lost to follow-up. This is a serious methodological problem that could alter the statistical significance of the findings.[95]\r<br> * Early termination bias \u2212 Studies that are terminated early are more likely to overestimate any treatment effect.[96,97]\r<br> * Duration bias \u2212 Because men who were not initially circumcised were circumcised at the end of the study, long-term comparison of the effects cannot be accurately extrapolated, as some modelers have proposed.[98]\r<br> * Source of infection unknown \u2212 If the studies were designed to determine whether circumcision reduced the risk of heterosexually-transmitted HIV, the investigators should have confirmed that the infections were indeed transmitted through heterosexual sexual contact. They did not. Using the data reported, it is estimated that about half of the infections of the men in these studies were not sexually transmitted.[92]\r<br>\r<br>The cumulative treatment effect in these trials \u2013 which claimed a 38-66% relative risk reduction[99] \u2013 was an absolute risk reduction of 1.3%.[91] This is a very small effect, which could easily have resulted from the various forms of bias, rather than being a true treatment effect. The findings are not robust, given that all of the trials had nearly identical methodologies and nearly identical <a href=\"http://results.in/\">results.In</a> any case, it appears that these trials were unnecessary in the first place. Data released before the trials began found a number of African countries where the prevalence of HIV infection was greater in circumcised men than in intact men.[100,101]Unfortunately, the results from the three RCTs provided the impetus for the WHO to bypass the usual step of performing pilot studies to determine if circumcision was effective outside of a research setting. Instead, it recommended programs to circumcise millions of men in sub-Saharan Africa as quickly as possible. (These programs measure success by the number of males circumcised rather than by their impact on HIV incidence. Since the mass circumcision campaigns began in Uganda and Kenya, the incidence of new cases of HIV in both countries has increased.[102-104]) The WHO recommendations included that circumcision programs should be voluntary, free of coercion, and targeted to areas where the HIV prevalence is high (&gt;15% of the population) and circumcision rates are low (&lt;20%).[105] None of these criteria apply to the situation of newborn babies (who cannot voluntarily consent) in the epidemiological setting of the United States (low HIV prevalence, and already high circumcision rate, as well as a much higher standard of living than Africa).As with other STIs, there is no evidence that circumcision has had any impact on lowering the incidence of HIV infection in the United States. Of the eight HIV studies in North American heterosexual men,[100,106-112] only one has found a significant association between circumcision and HIV infection risk: it actually found that circumcised men were at greater risk of HIV infection.[112] Furthermore, the HIV epidemic in the United States is concentrated among men who have sex with men (MSM) and injecting drug users. A meta-analysis of the studies published on this topic by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the risk for HIV infection in MSM is the same in intact and circumcised men.[113] A subsequent study yielded similar results.[114]While some authors have theorized that Langerhans cells present in the foreskin are a significant portal for HIV infection, and have used this as a rationale for circumcision as a preventative,[115] evidence now shows that these cells produce a protein, langerin, that is actually protective against the virus.[116] The authors of the langerin study argue that \u201cstrategies to combat [HIV] infection must enhance, preserve or, at the very least, not interfere with langerin expression and function [in the Langerhans cells of the foreskin].\u201d[116]RCTs carried out among adults in Africa are not relevant to children anywhere, since children are not sexually active and are therefore not at risk of HIV infection by sexual transmission. For adults, condoms are an effective means of preventing sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.[117] Other preventative interventions, such as \u201ctreatment as prevention\u201d and pre-exposure prophylaxis, are more effective, less expensive, and less injurious than circumcision.[118,119]Equipment most certainly is used. There are stakeholders in this whole &quot;voluntary medical male circumcision&quot; who manufacture and sell the specialized clamps and other equipment. Follow the <a href=\"http://money.it/\">money.It</a> is relative vs. absolute risk reduction. 60% is often-touted, when in reality, it was actually ~1.2%. That is hardly significant. There is simply no real-world evidence that circumcised populations are any healthier than intact (not circumcised) populations.During the &quot;voluntary medical male circumcision&quot; campaigns, men are still told to wear condoms. Condoms are a MUST, or they WILL become infected. So either chop off part of your sexual anatomy (losing numerous functions), risking infection, bleeding, and other surgical mishaps, or just wear a condom like you should in the first place.", "comment_date": "2019-10-27T02:16:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Next Level Intactivism", "comment_text": "ASAP SCIENCE - WHAT PSEUDOSCIENCE GARBAGE!!!!!<br><br>Common sense MD HIV fallacy in Africa \r<br>Dr. Dean Edell discusses the misleading and unsound arguments in the current drive to circumcise Africa.\r<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OlsUg0sdAtE\">https://youtu.be/OlsUg0sdAtE</a>", "comment_date": "2019-10-27T02:15:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jimmy Tj", "comment_text": "Im uncircumcised and proud", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T20:23:21Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "im Omid", "comment_text": "Anyone else have there &quot;heads&quot; tingle", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T07:06:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Random Person", "comment_text": "Thumbs up if you&#39;re circumcised", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T07:00:22Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "JJ JJJ", "comment_text": "Biggest regret = not being circumcised at chilhood<br><br>getting cut at 20y was painful", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T04:22:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Juker", "comment_text": "don&#39;t forget to shut your foreskin so you can activate the pee power!", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T03:50:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ava The Husky Bunny", "comment_text": "Why the F was this in my recommend", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T03:11:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Thompson", "comment_text": "I was not circumcised when I was born.........", "comment_date": "2019-10-24T23:14:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jai Monk", "comment_text": "Circumcised is better", "comment_date": "2019-10-23T19:42:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jo Collis", "comment_text": "uncircumcised and no woman should be weighing in on this subject unless you would like female genital mutilation or female circumcision to be made legal", "comment_date": "2019-10-21T06:05:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Macho Madness", "comment_text": "Uncircumcised &gt; genital mutilation", "comment_date": "2019-10-20T06:48:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "goth3d", "comment_text": "Thanks mom thanks dad.", "comment_date": "2019-10-19T16:31:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Big naga", "comment_text": "For me i&#39;m circumsice", "comment_date": "2019-10-19T08:58:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alpog 21", "comment_text": "Well... i know what is gonna happen to me now ;(", "comment_date": "2019-10-19T04:48:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray Adorno", "comment_text": "slow it down don&#39;t force it in her she need you to take care of her care a lil so wedge it in", "comment_date": "2019-10-18T19:23:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray Adorno", "comment_text": "like ahhhhhhhh!i is good ahhhhh it hurts is not so good", "comment_date": "2019-10-18T19:21:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray Adorno", "comment_text": "i have not caught any  sti im sure of myself even knowing that there are some who say things that are not truth i was told i have caught something knowing myself i havent caught anything though i did not refuse treatment just to be on the safe side", "comment_date": "2019-10-18T19:18:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carrie", "comment_text": "If I ever have a son, I\u2019m not circumcising him.

Especially since all the great western civilisations were considering these practices inferior. Apostle Paul who is also considered the Apostle of the Gentiles was a Roman citizen with a Greek and Roman education. He severely argued with Peter in the issue of circumcision because Peter demanded for new Christians to be circumcised. Well thank God Paul prevented it. Turks go even further in circumcising boys at the age of 12! (Wtf?)

Since the African study, the African Dept. of Health has reported some of the African males who were circumcised tested HIV positive because they had a false sense of security and refused to use CONDOMS! In reality there is only about a 1.5% -2% risk of transmission of HIV from female to male if intact compared to circumcision.

We&#39;ve seen foreskin taken from infant babies and used in skin <br>grafting for burn victims. Now a laboratory dubbed the &quot;Skin Factory&quot; <br>at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart, Germany is using vorhaut von <br>kindern - children&#39;s foreskin - to grow new skin samples for testing <br>cosmetics and other products.<br>Project spokesperson, Andreas Traube, says researchers hope that this <br>use of human foreskin could replace animal testing, and eventually be <br>used in developing treatments for cancer, pigmentation diseases, and <br>certain skin allergies.<br>The process itself takes six weeks to complete, and during this time 10 <br>million skin cells are grown from one single boy&#39;s foreskin - to make <br>new skin up to five millimeters thick. A machine is used to heat the <br>foreskin to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (the temperature of the human <br>body), and robotic hands extract cells from the organ. Scientists then <br>take the extracted cells, mix them with collagen and connective tissue, <br>and incubate them inside a petri dish lined tube, where they multiply <br>at the same regulated temperature. This tube, approximately 22 feet <br>long, 10 feet wide and 10 feet high, fosters the growth of the <br>foreskin&#39;s cells into an epidermis layer of skin (the outermost skin on <br>the human body). Three layers of this new skin are finally put together <br>to create the end sample. In regards to the month and a half long time <br>frame, Traube says, &quot;We can&#39;t use the machine to speed up the process; <br>biology needs time to take its course.&quot;<br>While European authorities have yet to authorize the Skin Factory for <br>official use in product testing, new skin swatches from young human <br>foreskin is begin produced at a rate of 5,000 samples per month and <br>authorities are examining the factory to determine if the skin can be <br>used commercially. &quot;It&#39;s logical that we&#39;d want to take the operation <br>to a bigger scale,&quot; said Traube. And at least one German organization <br>has already expressed interest in the machine. &quot;I think the idea is a <br>good one. I believe cells from artificially cultivated skin are indeed <br>comparable with real skin,&quot; says Rolf Homke, spokesman for the German <br>Association of Research-based Pharmaceutical Companies. &quot;I do think it <br>might take a few years to get up and running though. There are <br>complicated international safety standards -- these procedures can&#39;t <br>just be changed overnight.&quot;<br>One ethical problem in all of this? These harvested foreskins belong to <br>babies and toddlers who are not yet able to consent to the organ&#39;s <br>amputation from their own bodies. The Skin Factory uses foreskin only <br>from newborn baby boys up to four years of age, and the goal is to <br>gather as many infant foreskins as possible. &quot;The older the foreskin <br>is, the worse it performs,&quot; says Traube. And this foreskin (the prepuce <br>organ) is one that all mammals are born with, male and female alike. It <br>is on the human body for a purpose - it serves many important <br>developmental, immunological, and sexual functions. Just as the <br>foreskin is valuable to researchers when amputated from babies and <br>toddlers, it is of even more value when it remains on the body to which <br>it belongs.", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T08:17:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Carcamo", "comment_text": "circumcised niggas for the win", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T07:52:01Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "NotJayvrec", "comment_text": "Im cut!", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T05:20:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PlebObliterator", "comment_text": "I&#39;m cut", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T01:27:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "*round 5 sounds* fetch me their souls", "comment_text": "I was circumcised.", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T00:33:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "There\u2019s something wrong with me", "comment_text": "Ya know some doctors keep it and sell it to these beauty salons to make this special facial thing that rich people and celebrities get", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T00:01:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dante Franklin", "comment_text": "Pure uncut.

Benefits include: Decrease in STDs and other medical conditions, such as UTI. But that\u2019s about it.  The thing is, guess what 11 babies die every single year in the U.S. alone....<br>....in a car seat.  Do you know how many babies die every year strapped to a table as their parents pay a doctor to mutilate their son\u2019s genitalia?  117, I\u2019m not exaggerating.  UTI are actually only prevented during the first year of life. And testing for HIV in Africa is not controlled, because there can be many other circumstances other than circumcision that could boost or decrease rates.  So what it comes to is this: A parenting decision.  Now, would you rather hire someone to mutilate your son\u2019s genitals and risk him not trusting or respecting you?

There is a problem about cutting a non consenting child but at the same time there\u2019s a problem with doing anything with a non consenting child. But the government sees it as property that the parents have to deal with. In my country parents have to send their child to school or risk jail time, if a child does something the parent is usually the one that has to pay so it makes it seem like the child is more of a chore than anything in the flip side a child must get parent permission to do things and even if the child doesn\u2019t want to do the thing such as getting blood drawn or going somewhere the child literally has no say as long as the parents say it\u2019s ok. Uncut or not it doesn\u2019t make to much of a difference as long as you\u2019re clean and safe but there is a huge problem with doing things to children that can\u2019t consent. <br><br>Personally I feel as though the parents that do consent to having their boys cut are just too lazy to wash under and around the foreskin but other than that a bit of skin isn\u2019t gonna do much to a hygiene responsible person", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T05:54:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "tony rodriguez", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TurtleNeckGang\">#TurtleNeckGang</a>", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T05:36:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vivid YT", "comment_text": "1.31 Uganda kuckles", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T05:09:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "conk", "comment_text": "thats a lot of dicks", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T04:32:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Babar Tahir", "comment_text": "So basically circumcised is better than uncircumcised.", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T04:16:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Domino5747", "comment_text": "Wtf", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T02:58:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roch Cyr", "comment_text": "Mandatory!?!?", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T02:52:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "W!LL", "comment_text": "UGANDA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddec DO YO KNOW DE WAY", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T02:25:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chase Kuchar", "comment_text": "Accidentally clicked on this, but then I heard circumcision and I watched the whole video...<br><br>Twice", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T02:17:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Berd", "comment_text": "Is it bad do have circumcised", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T02:16:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "patrick Lopez", "comment_text": "Tang ina nyo mga supot", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T01:57:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H.

I think people should just leave their children as they are, but make sure they learn how to clean themselves properly while growing up. the decision to get uncircumcised or not should be left up to the individual once they become an adult", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T20:32:04Z", "likes_count": 51}, {"comment_by": "Enter Matt", "comment_text": "lots of y\u2019all are getting triggered in the comment section lmfao", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T20:23:21Z", "likes_count": 88}, {"comment_by": "zachos 2000", "comment_text": "am i the only one who is curious about if these two dudes are circumcised? how am i the first to ask this?", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T20:05:30Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Ckri5", "comment_text": "Uganda", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T19:55:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gerardo Aguirre", "comment_text": "Aye I\u2019m uncut  who else", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T19:51:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glucoza", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ich3x5XphK4&amp;t=1m18s\">1:18</a> do you da wei", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T19:48:11Z", "likes_count": 46}, {"comment_by": "I\u2019m tired", "comment_text": "Why am I here I don\u2019t have one of these", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T19:45:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tomas", "comment_text": "This videos is clearly biased to the &#39;cut&#39; side and fails to mention certain facts!", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T19:43:02Z", "likes_count": 139}, {"comment_by": "shan", "comment_text": "I didn\u2019t know this was a thing...", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T19:33:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "annihilator", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ich3x5XphK4&amp;t=1m25s\">1:25</a> you knew da wey", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T19:21:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew", "comment_text": "Condoms are 96% effective at preventing HIV transmission\u2013and they don&#39;t require genital mutilation.", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T19:21:37Z", "likes_count": 638}, {"comment_by": "Incurablederp", "comment_text": "Neither are better, you shouldn\u2019t feel any better or worse over something you have no control over.", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T19:18:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xxthehuskycaboosexx", "comment_text": "Circumcision is barbaric, no other way about it.", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T18:57:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arkafazin", "comment_text": "I thought this was supposed to be a science channel.
