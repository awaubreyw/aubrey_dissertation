Thereafter I developed DID (multiple personalties), and I thought I was a lesbian--waaaaay back in freaking 2nd grade when kids in Utah were NOT thinking that at all. A couple of years ago, after I&#39;d done a WHOLE LOT of psychotherapy and ayahuasca and everything I could to get better, I met an ex-government scientist in Salt Lake City and he scanned me with this machine and gave me these top-secret special drops designed to take everything satanic--or &quot;not you&quot;--OUT of your body. He also provided me with results of the scan and there was everything I&#39;d been &quot;programmed&quot; with--right on that stack of papers, including being a lesbian, and a whole lot of other things that hadn&#39;t registered with me yet--like porn addiction, sodomy, polygamy, wanting to be a boy--everything. Well...the next week I took the drops and I went through absolute hell. But, when I came out of that hell...there was NOTHING--no &quot;satanic&quot; desires whatsoever--inside of my thoughts or even in my subconscious. For the first time in my life, I had no desires at all to kiss another woman or do any of that stuff. And then, afterwards...well, Satan himself came and attacked me and I jumped off a cliff in order to commit suicide, I went to heaven and I met Jesus Christ. Therefore, I know, for an absolute fact...that everything associated with what the Bible and the Book of Mormon teaches is absolute truth. If you feel called to do so, please read my blog healingwithchrist.com--there are so many true stories from my life (including the one I just mentioned above--in detail) on there that are insane--I probably wouldn&#39;t believe if I hadn&#39;t been through them.", "comment_date": "2022-06-21T01:43:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Random", "comment_text": "LGBTQ is social programming", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T10:53:24Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Shark 1753", "comment_text": "Ngl does it really matter?

Gender and race are factors of predominantly expressed physicality, not spirit. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re black or white, female or male. Being attracted to the consciousness/soul of someone while not allowing their state/appearance/or being of the body to influence your wanting for them is unconditional love. Because if this current formation of your mind cares for them in that romantic, passionate, and intimate way, it really wouldn&#39;t matter what physical state of matter they occupy, you would be with them for them, not their body.  Being attracted to Black or Withe people isn&#39;t &quot;genetic&quot; and the same applies to gender. Please allow your current minds to be free of labeling yourselves so strongly because in doing so, you&#39;re restricting yourselves of additional and unique experiences in this current formation of existence. But either way, whether these forms our minds learn or not, there is something to be learned from not learning. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc97", "comment_date": "2017-08-22T18:37:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "savant", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a bisexual with a whole family tree of straight homophobes", "comment_date": "2017-08-22T13:37:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bandrukesucks", "comment_text": "What does it mean when I prefer one in the morning but another in the evening?", "comment_date": "2017-08-22T04:21:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lothric Knight Helm", "comment_text": "Mike pence has some &quot;Shocking&quot; results", "comment_date": "2017-08-22T01:53:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NerdVous", "comment_text": "Yaaass queen", "comment_date": "2017-08-22T00:41:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nicole Faye", "comment_text": "So, are people born gay?\ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2017-08-21T23:32:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "skye", "comment_text": "Soooo wat about bisexuals?", "comment_date": "2017-08-21T16:50:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "skye", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6p1nmOnILA&amp;t=0m10s\">0:10</a> Is that woman on the right a fujoshi?", "comment_date": "2017-08-21T16:44:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Corgus_theDabber68 *", "comment_text": "I love who I love.", "comment_date": "2017-08-21T15:19:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jamie Greening", "comment_text": "I hope so.", "comment_date": "2017-08-21T13:35:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jamie Greening", "comment_text": "Straight gene", "comment_date": "2017-08-21T13:31:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hyejoo", "comment_text": "This explains so much...", "comment_date": "2017-08-21T07:24:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chelsea", "comment_text": "Considering when girls see another girls and call them cute and beautiful also to the point of calling each other girlfriends (not girls that are friend but in a relationship) i think you can see where I&#39;m going from there...", "comment_date": "2017-08-21T05:40:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Rasasane", "comment_text": "So im gonna be an uncle of many children...", "comment_date": "2017-08-21T05:08:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Some Hooded Guy", "comment_text": "Simple answer<br><br>People choose to be LGTBQ+<br>and it&#39;s not in a form of genetics <br>There was a study that proved this .<br>I&#39;m not homophobic I am just pointing<br>Out facts", "comment_date": "2017-08-21T04:04:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mrbunnyban", "comment_text": "Thinking about it, whole discussion is kind of moot.

This paper is not really even a study but a accumulation of observations that has been pulled from other papers. I did not see any data that would point to statistical significance in this paper and therefore I do feel you may have misrepresented this paper.
