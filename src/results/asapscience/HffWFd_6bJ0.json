Dopamine adds transitory utility or value to moment to moment decisions and is harmful to effective decision making when it is not aligned with long term goals, as we well know by succumbing daily to social media, emails, and other distractors. The best way to eliminate distraction is to pursue meaningful activities that have more significant affective outcomes, or to induce greater positive affect by managing the unique ways incentive motivation works in the human brain. To demonstrate this latter point here is an easy procedure to increase meaningful behavior, accentuate positive affect, and eliminate distraction.<br>Simply follow a simple resting protocol (mindfulness procedure is best for this), and simultaneously pursue or anticipate pursuing meaningful behavior (e.g. cleaning house, writing poetry, exercise, etc.). Do this continuously for standard sessions of a least a half hour and chart your progress. As a result, you will be more pleasurably alert, engaged, and incented to continue being productive and resist distraction. Neurologically, this is due to \u2018opioid-dopamine\u2019 interactions, or the fact that rest is pleasurable due to the induction of opioid activity in the brain. Meaningful activity on the other hand induces dopaminergic activity, which is felt as a state of alert arousal but NOT pleasure. Opioid and dopamine neurons are located adjacently in the midbrain, and when both are simultaneously activated will also co-stimulate each other, resulting in enhanced feelings of arousal and pleasure. Indeed, when rest is accompanied by highly meaningful behaviors (creating art, athletic achievement), pleasure and alertness are highly accentuated, resulting in \u2018peak\u2019 or \u2018flow\u2019 experiences. So, there is my procedure to increase productivity and reduce distraction, and all without inspirational screeds, lectures, books, or seminars, with the added benefit that you can prove or falsify my hypothesis for yourself, give or take an hour! <br><br>This interpretation is based on the work of the distinguished neuroscientist Kent Berridge of the University of Michigan, a preeminent researcher on dopamine and motivation, who was kind to vet the work for accuracy and endorse the finished manuscript.<br>Berridge\u2019s Site<br><a href=\"https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/berridge-lab/\">https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/berridge-lab/</a><br><br>I offer a more detailed theoretical explanation in pp. 47-52, and pp 82-86 of my open source book on the neuroscience of resting states, \u2018The Book of Rest\u2019, linked below.<br><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/284056765/The-Book-of-Rest-The-Odd-Psychology-of-Doing-Nothing\">https://www.scribd.com/doc/284056765/The-Book-of-Rest-The-Odd-Psychology-of-Doing-Nothing</a>", "comment_date": "2020-05-17T15:13:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Train With Zein Fitness & Faith", "comment_text": "So true and scary.", "comment_date": "2020-05-12T15:05:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aytekin Y\u0131lmaz", "comment_text": "beautiful video is very beautiful.

I have no social media whatsoever. Texting is enough. Social media is a MASSIVE industry, so it follows that these companies are going to be using the most devious, underhanded, and brutal ways to keep you scrolling. They prey on your insecurities, tie your self-esteem to something irrelevant and useless, and incentivize obsessive, unhealthy time wasting on what ultimately becomes a parasite. Before long you feel the need to check Facebook, to post on Snapchat, to blah blah blah, because when you don&#39;t, you feel invalidated. The hollow husk of social media has become the focal point of your self-worth, the only thing keeping your frail opinion of yourself afloat, and when you stop for even a minute, you lose the ability to focus on anything else, anything that matters. All that matters now is that constant click, click, click, because when you stop clicking, you feel like people will forget you. You can no longer bear the notion of people talking without you present.
