Leave them there until their intestines are empty. This can take up to a few hours. They will not drown immediately, but they will slowly drown over time.<br>2) Once no more poop comes out, take them out of the water, put a pot with a bit of clean water on the fire and put the worms in the clean pot to boil. You don&#39;t need a lot of water, just make sure they&#39;re just completely submerged.<br>3) Once the worms are boiled, cut them up and rinse them again to get rid of the final bits of dirt and poop.<br>4) Now you can process them like most meats. Grind the pieces to make minced meat for meatballs or burgers, fry the pieces with some chopped onions and/or other herbs/spices/vegetables, etc.<br><br>Alternatively, you can slowly bake them on a tray until they&#39;re completely dry, then grind them into powder with your mortar and pestle.

Deadly nightshade (Atropa belladona)  has very pronounced sepals and rather squat fruit. Also known as belladonna.

It&#39;s a relative of tomato with a similar taste. The unripe fruit contains solanine, just like green tomatoes (which are frequently eaten) and the green parts of all solanum species, and can cause digestive issues if consumed in quantity, but when jet black and ripe, they&#39;re perfectly fine to eat. Not especially tasty, in my opinion, but fine to eat. There are cultivated forms of related species that get translated into English as &quot;wonderberry&quot; or &quot;garden huckleberry&quot; (which is a different thing than a true huckleberrie or wild blueberry) that are frequently used to makes pies in Germany and other parts of Europe. They&#39;re generally larger (and hopefully better tasting) than these wild types.\r<br>\r<br>Better that your &quot;expert&quot; errs on the side of caution, but this is exactly how misinformation gets handed down as fact.

I guess no matter what way you look at it, Your basically already dead, even if you survived the crash, unless your a regular omnivore like most of the population, and that\u2019s not even considering food allergies, Lactose intolerance or things like Celiacs \ud83e\udd2d", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T17:12:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ubc31\uc885\ubbf8", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udd0a\uadc0\uc911\ud55c \uce5c\uad6c\ub2d8\uacfc \uac00\uc871 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubd84 !! \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uce5c\uc871\ubd84\ub4e4\uacfc \ud6c4\ub300\ub4e4\uc744 \uc704\ud574,<br>\ub610 \uc5ec\uae30 \ucc38\uc11d\ud55c \uce5c\ub2d8\ub4e4 \uac00\uc815\uacfc \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uce5c\uc871\ub4e4\uacfc \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud6c4\ub300\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uae30\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4<br><br>\ud83d\udc96\ud558\ub098\ub2d8\uaed8\uc11c <br>\uc601\uc721\uac04\uc5d0 \uac15\uac74\ucf00 \ud558\uc2dc\uace0<br>\ubaa8\ub4e0 <br>\ud83c\udf81 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcf5\uc744 \uc8fc\uc2dc\uae38 \ucd95\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4<br>(\uc6943\uc11c 1:2)<br><br>\ud83c\udf43\ud83c\udf3b \uc8fc\uae30 \ub3c4\ubb38\uc740 \ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf43 <br><br>\uadf8\ub0e5 ... \uc678\uc6b0\ub294<br>\ud83d\ude13\ud615\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ub3c4\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc\ud83d\ude13<br><br>\ud83d\ude0a \ub73b\uc744 \uc74c\ubbf8\ud558\uba70 \ud83d\ude03 \uae30\ub3c4\ud558\uc600\uc744 \ub54c <br>\ud83d\udc9e\uc6d0\ub3d9\ub825\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc704\ub825\uc758 \uae30\ub3c4\ud83d\udc9e \uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4<br><br>\uc8fc \uae30 \ub3c4 \ubb38<br><br>\ud558\ub298\uc5d0 \uacc4\uc2e0 \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc544\ubc84\uc9c0\uc5ec,<br>\uc774\ub984\uc774 \uac70\ub8e9\ud788 \uc5ec\uae40\uc744 \ubc1b\uc73c\uc2dc\uc624\uba70,<br>\ub098\ub77c\uac00 \uc784\ud558\uc635\uc2dc\uba70,<br>\ub73b\uc774 \ud558\ub298\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4\uac83 \uac19\uc774 \ub545\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc774\ub2e4.<br>\uc624\ub298 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc5d0\uac8c \uc77c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc591\uc2dd\uc744 \uc8fc\uc635\uc2dc\uace0<br>\uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc5d0\uac8c \uc8c4 \uc9c0\uc740 \uc790\ub97c \uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc900\uac83 \uac19\uc774<br>\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc8c4\ub97c \uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc2dc\uc635\uc2dc\uace0<br>\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub4e4\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0 \ub9c8\uc635\uc2dc\uace0,<br>\ub2e4\ub9cc \uc545\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud558\uc635\uc18c\uc11c.<br>\ub098\ub77c\uc640 \uad8c\uc138\uc640 \uc601\uad11\uc774 <br>\uc544\ubc84\uc9c0\uaed8 \uc601\uc6d0\ud788 \uc788\uc0ac\uc635\ub098\uc774\ub2e4.<br>\uc544\uba58.

Instead of continuing to plant  millions of random trees, I think we need to research which tree or plant species absorb and retain the most amount of CO2 and create as &quot;Super Tree&quot; a hybrid of several different species of tree, and mass produce these trees, also we would need to create a variety of these &quot;Super Trees&quot; for different climates and ecosystems.  Once this &quot;Super Tree&quot; is made, we can give this to groups and organisations to plant instead of just random plant species, so we can be assured that this new tree, will acheive better results, this is also a safe and commone practice, farmers have been cross breeding, plant species for centuries.  The ideal plant would have large broad flat leaves that can absorb large quantities of CO2, and put out large quantities of O2 or oxyen, a palm tree crossed with another plant might be ideal, palm trees are friendly to most environments, have large leaves, are sturdy and strong, and require little water to survive.", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T10:02:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Science Go", "comment_text": "Raise up your hand if you like chasing chicken\ud83d\udc13\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T09:19:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Orion Smythe", "comment_text": "Cool to see youtube will  demonitise creaters for saying the f word censored then turn around and name something with the same thing i guess advertisers only care about each and every independent channel and not the company that runs it", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T06:07:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gbriank1", "comment_text": "While I appreciate the thought put in to episode, the reality is that most of these ideas just aren&#39;t possible with major metro areas.

If you want to &quot;beautify&quot; or add enrichment to the fish tank you can add hides (rocks, plastic logs, plastic or rock caves, or live plants if you add lights). The plants would be really pretty but they would take nutrients from the plants you&#39;re growing for food so probably not what you want (plus I am not sure if the Tilapia would just chew them up/pull them out, I keep very small fish mostly where hides are much more important but these are bigger so it might be less so.)
