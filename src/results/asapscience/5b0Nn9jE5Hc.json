If told &quot;the meeting has been moved back&quot; I would think 2pm.

In the spring, I &quot;spring forward&quot; by adding an hour to the clocks, and I &quot;fall back&quot; by subtracting an hour from them.

Because the question leads with &quot;the noon meeting&quot;, and because I&#39;m a visual thinker, I pictured a clock \u23f0 with the hands positioned at noon. If the clock hands move forward, it would be 2 pm. <br>However, I feel like the holidays are coming. I&#39;m not getting there, they&#39;re on their way here, but maybe that&#39;s because I&#39;m not anticipating them and working toward a goal. Because with deadlines, it&#39;s a mixture, like a runner doing hurdles on a flat escalator \ud83d\ude02 and the hurdles are &quot;coming up&quot; even though I&#39;m moving toward them at the same time.", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T07:30:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "agilemonk3y", "comment_text": "When you say moving the meeting time back a few hours you know it\u2019s gonna be later so when you say move it forward it\u2019s gonna be sooner anyone who thinks it\u2019s 2 pm is just wrong", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T07:27:22Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Tamuk Gaming", "comment_text": "I&#39;ll say 2pm cause questions itself says noon not morning", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T06:50:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bhnhbbh", "comment_text": "pls make a video about aphantasia and stuff :)", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T06:38:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aleida Forbes", "comment_text": "10am!", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T06:21:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mrhappyman", "comment_text": "2 AM", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T06:18:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aleida Forbes", "comment_text": "35 seconds in and I\u2019m already thinking too much math too much math my brain omg", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T06:13:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dibya Rana Saha Roy", "comment_text": "TAKE\ud83d\udc4f A \ud83d\udc4fTWITTER \ud83d\udc4fPOLL\ud83d\udc4f! \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T06:03:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dibya Rana Saha Roy", "comment_text": "If I was not in a position to clarify the time, I would show up at 10 am, because in case if it is at 2pm, I can again turn up 4 hours later.

I think that there&#39;s a huge difference between yanny Laurel and time moving forward to you versus time moving backward when honestly if you move an appointment back it&#39;s going to happen later and if you move it forward it&#39;s going to happen sooner but everyone knows about in daylight savings time you spring forward and you fall back. The clock moves from 5 the four when you fall back. And of course I would look forward who sings in the future. But an event being pulled forward and being pushed back is like put on the front burner or the back burner. the front burner is more accessible in the back burner is less accessible. So when it&#39;s pushed back it means it&#39;ll happen later the 2 p.m. answer. time and us moving through it and are representations of winds things are happening are reflective of how we all see events and time. But the language of those events is actually uniform or Universal. and irrelevant because it depends on where you grew up. I suppose the right answer is 10 a.m. of course to be clear you could just say it&#39;s happening later or it&#39;s happening sooner. another way to think about it is the time zone. if you know where all the time zones are then you can say that events happen later on-the-clock the further east you go unless of course you pass into another day while another person is still at 10 p.m.", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T09:20:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KenTested 2K", "comment_text": "Couldn\u2019t be 2pm.

So when someone says the meeting is moved forward from noon by 2 hours, I think of 2 pm. But I can see how others would say it&#39;s 10 am, because if time is coming towards you then the meeting just got closer to you by 2 hours so it&#39;s 10 am. So here are two analogies, 1. This is how you could describe the 10 am people. They think that they are a stick stuck in the mud while a river(time) moves around them. Think of the meeting as a boat floating down the river, so when you move the boat (meeting) forward in time the boat would be getting closer to you(the stick), you could say the boat was moved forward in time. 2. Now using a similar analogy, think of the stick as the meeting and yourself as the boat and time is still the river. You are rowing up the river(the river is flowing against you) to get to the stick (the meeting) , but now it has been moved forward by the river(time), so now it is further away from you and it will take longer for you to get to it.<br>I hope this helps someone!!<br>If you have a better way to say it, please reply to this comment", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T06:05:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Theft", "comment_text": "This would also greatly depend on the initial time of the meeting.

But my first reaction was 2 pm because if you look forward on a time scale (into the future) it is now two hours more forward than it already was. But I totally understand people who say 10 am, because the German \u201evor\u201c like in \u201evorverlegt\u201c is related to \u201evorne\u201c wich is a direction and \u201enach vorne\u201c can also mean forwards (sounds almost like \u201evorw\u00e4rts\u201c and has also the same meaning). So from the meetings point of view, wich is heading in my direction, \u201eforwards\u201c is towards my position, so that can result in 10 am.

We can&#39;t &#39;move&#39; through time in the same way but we use a one-dimensional representation (for the most part) to try and make sense of time.

We can make time appear to be moving faster, but can never actually travel through time. We can&#39;t control time because time isn&#39;t something we can interact with.

Another thing is, we can control things within time, but we cannot control time itself. <br><br>The problem is, this doesn&#39;t quite explain why time is moving forward through us. We are moving in time, but time mus be moving through us because we aren&#39;t moving through time. Another way to look at it is with a rock, to the rock things are just happening, has no goals or hobbies or anything really other than it exists. Yet it&#39;s travelling through time. We are the same way. We do stuff and think stuff, but other than that the only difference between us and the rock is that we are conscious living things. For this reason, time comes to us, not the other way around. Thus, time moves through us. <br><br>Since time moves through us, time must also be moving forward through us because otherwise that would imply we are about to experience is the future, which is impossible to be the case, by definition.

However when considering time from a point in time that has not happen, such as the appointed time for a meeting, one should talk about &quot;sooner in time&quot; or &quot;later in time&quot; to avoid ambiguity. So when resetting the time for a meeting that has not happen, to avoid any ambiguity, one should state either the meeting will happen X hours &quot;sooner&quot; or X hours &quot;later&quot; than the appointed time.

Noon. Moved forward by two hours.

Had it been me, I would just ask why not be more direct and totally forgot the sentence is being used as an illustrative example for time perspectives. I speak Filipino and I wonder if we have this conundrum because we are more direct ( at least in this scenario) even when we use english phrases in Filipino sentences (Taglish). &#39;Na-move ng 2 oras ang 12noon meeting.&#39; (as per translating the example) is vague is not usually used. So a Filipino would typically say &#39;Na-delay ng 2 oras ang dapat sana&#39;y meeting sa alas dose&#39; or &#39;Na advance ng 2 oras ang meeting&#39;(we dont have a literal direct translation for the &#39;moved forward to&#39; phrase that we always/ we avoid using it since instead of getting the acknowledgment, the response we&#39;ll get is &#39;ano?!&#39; meaning &#39;what?!&#39; which makes it appear we&#39;re speaking non sense. in our example there&#39;s already a visual representation in the sentence structure that the one being spoken to needs to add  in advance or wait 2 more hours. Might add a P.S. later because I&#39;ll be rewatching the explanation in the first 2 minutes. I really cant grapple the idea of time perspectives when the statement could have been resolved by using a more direct sentence.This post made me want to check more about time perspectives if it is always correlated to linguistics or is there any other way to discuss it.

If you and the event are approaching each other and the event moves forward, it moves closer towards to you. 10AM is a time I am closer to, therefore it&#39;s the time that the event has moved forward to.<br>In my mind, my perspective of forward doesn&#39;t match the event&#39;s perspective of forward. From the events perspective, it is moving to meet me as opposed to moving to escape me - therefore when it moves forward, it approaches me and meets me sooner in my timeline.<br><br>Which makes me wonder... Does that mean I break the rule of there only being 2 ways of perceiving time? Or am I just using the only two ways available simultaneously?", "comment_date": "2020-06-26T01:46:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DinosourousRexx", "comment_text": "This is definitely a semantic issue.

Some people seem to be assuming that it has something to do with the semantics of the word forward, but we all understand what forward in time means. It means away from the past and toward the future. I think it has something to do with how we perceive the phrase \u201enoon meeting.\u201d If u thought the noon meeting is a reference to a meeting that currently exists at noon then u would think 10 am. If u just thought noon meeting was a reference to a meeting scheduled at noon that is later modified by the phrase moved forward 2 hours then u would think 2 pm. I understand how people would think the former and maybe that points to a shift in language that is occurring as opposed to a dichotomy in our perceptions of time which just seems attention grabbing and completely unfounded by any other evidence. On top of that how can someone just change their entire perception of time just because of a plane ride. I hypothesize that the truth is u don\u2019t really think about time in either one of these ways because in effect  they are exactly the same. For example I don\u2019t usually say we are getting close to the holidays. I would say something like the holidays are coming up even though I think the meeting is at 2 pm which are supposedly according to them contradictory perceptions of time. And for fucksake u can replace noon meeting with any noun and time with any adjective and u would get a similar amount of ambiguity eg: \u201cthe red ball has been painted blue.\u201d  which could mean the ball is now red but had a blue phase or it could mean the ball was red and is now blue.

When I first heard this question posed, I was leaning a bit more toward 2pm than I was toward 10am, but when I asked myself, &quot;What would I pick if the question were &#39;moved back&#39; instead of &#39;moved forward&#39;?&quot; the answers was obviously 2pm, which meant that 10am had to be the answer for &quot;moved forward.&quot; I solved the problem linguistically, not using any perception of time. I asked my parents, and my mom did the same thing, whereas my dad answered 2pm unequivocally. This isn&#39;t to say that the ego-moving and time-moving perspectives aren&#39;t real, just that, to me, they&#39;re not relevant to this particular question.", "comment_date": "2020-06-26T00:27:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "neo jericho", "comment_text": "10am, Laurel, Black And Blue.", "comment_date": "2020-06-26T00:27:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ZahraTamar", "comment_text": "what if i thought 2pm but 10am makes more sense to me?", "comment_date": "2020-06-26T00:27:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MEDINJECT", "comment_text": "I only wake up at 3pm anyway, would have missed both", "comment_date": "2020-06-26T00:27:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Duke Frywokker", "comment_text": "Time is like a rope.
