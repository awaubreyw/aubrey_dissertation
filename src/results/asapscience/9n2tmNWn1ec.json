Both are a set way to see life. Both are like a pair of shades with different color. Instead of picking up either of the shades and putting them over your eyes. I recommend that one should opt to increase the clarity of your vision. Pessimists have an ideal of the world which has not been met and cannot accept that reality does not match their ideals. They feel a deep sense of dread about life due to their own choice of not letting go of their ideal to understand life. Until they let go of their presumptions/ideals due to conditioning of the mind/psychological process and lack of deeper understanding and awareness of themselves, they will suffer. The reason one has ideals is because they want the world to suit their personality/psychological process/conditioned mind. Your thoughts are not yours and you have no power of choice until you realize that. Every idea and thought that you have is picked up from the limited experience of your life. That\u2019s why people turn out so different from each other, because we all have different experiences. Once you are aware that what you think is you(personality) is not actually you, you have the power of choice. Once this happens you can start to find out that you really don\u2019t know anything about life and need to re-evaluate everything. More proof that your personality is not you is that you think about/create what you think is your future only from past experiences. Your mind cannot make anything new up from scratch. It needs material/experience/exposure to a situation or stimulus. Most get this \u201cmaterial\u201d unconsciously which is why they are identified with their ideals when in fact it is not their choice to pick their personality, thoughts, ideals up. Once you are aware of this in the present moment you can then get \u201cmaterials\u201d consciously by allowing yourself to accept/seek new experiences. Suffering mentally is actually a sign that you are not in line or harmony with truth/reality. Only those who seek truth consciously can experience it. As for optimistic people it is the same story flipped. They have great experiences which lead them to have a different mentality/personality/psychological process. Both are untrustworthy and will lead to misunderstanding. People think they have it all figured out and come to conclusions about life based on their limited experiences. I know I don\u2019t know anything about life but am happy to learn and seek as that is the only way. If you do the right thing the right thing will happen. If you do the wrong thing, the right thing can never happen. By right I mean successful/sufficient action. By wrong I mean unsuccessful/insufficient action. No matter your intention or emotion, If the rule to winning a million dollars is that you have to score a goal in soccer with you left foot and you will win, but you score with the right, you won\u2019t win. Only what works will work and what doesn\u2019t work will not. Please seek. Do not believe and come to any conclusion by thought. When you know you know, when you don\u2019t know you don\u2019t know. Honesty with yourself is key. Right and wrong in a moral context is just another boundary you put because you are afraid of the truth. Instead of using morality as a substitute for clarity please seek truth.

I always thought that having a more positive outlook on things was better than being so negative, but after watching this video I\u2019m not really sure.  At one point they made it seem like being pessimistic was good in the end and the people with a pessimistic view end up being more successful. I see where they are coming from when they talking about people with a pessimistic view being more worried about the future and take finances more seriously because they are more cautious about everything, but people with an optimistic view can still know right from wrong and when things have been taken to far. Being negative and worried all the time can make you live longer? How? Everything I get told in life is not to stress because everything will work out, and that I will live a happier life not taking everything so seriously and if I stop worrying so much. Isn\u2019t if you are not all tense and worried you will live a happier life, which means a longer life? In my opinion people can have an optimistic point of view and not make dumb decision. I feel that looking at things in a positive way would leave you to enjoying life more and I rather live a happy, positive shorter life than a long life filled with worry and negative outlooks.", "comment_date": "2015-12-09T08:27:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmed Nawab", "comment_text": "I hate this question because:<br>1.

It&#39;s something that&#39;s been researched in the field of neuroscience in recent years, and they&#39;re pumping out books left and right on the subject. I think this whole fixed mindset of the Asap guys saying that you don&#39;t have any control over your pessimistic or optimistic life approach is an outdated way of thinking. Btw, when I say optimistic, I don&#39;t mean delusional optimism.

(I am not saying that vaccinations are bad I&#39;m just saying that in this particular case  the outbreak could not have come only from a lack of vaccination but must have been first brought into the country by and outside force). What this outside force was is up for debate, many people (including myself) believe that it a result of the many illegal immigrants coming from countries where the disease is prevalent, however this is only a educated guess.

It&#39;s, also, a perfect demonstration of man kinds current, and eternally defunct mental state, whereby, even in the 21st century, we still persist in entertaining, and amusing ourselves with such redundant, and wasteful queries. We, literally, find a demented glee in establishing a position, whereupon, we can find endless delight in pointing out how ignorant others are, rather than share, out of love, our discovery, and, potentially, new understanding. Also, sadly, such is the nature of man that upon being asked such a question, he will immediately choose a side, and most often argumentatively, and in a typical hostile manner will defend that side till his untimely, and idiotic death. Enter the realm of ignorance and folly. Whereby, man creates struggle for himself where in reality, none exists. Ultimately fascinating is this fact. The answer is simple, but the questions mere structure leads the ignorant to choose sides. Most people never even consider there is a valid third option. It never, ever occurs to them, because so blind are they by the choice to take sides, and in, animalistic, animosity guard their decision they do not, will not, and outright refuse to see another way. Beyond whatever other real insights anyone else has ever had, I came to the conclusion, myself, having never been told by another, that this third option is that the glass exists, being, simultaneously, both half full, and half empty. When this conclusion hit me, I was immediately, astounded by my sheer, and pathetic lack of observation, especially, in the light of having come across this query probably more than a decade ago. There is something to be said for discovering something for oneself. Choosing sides seems, almost always destructive, because , the people involved, usually end up on opposite sides of the solution, and therefor, cut themselves off from it. This in all cases can be remedied by wisdom. There is a new question, now, I think some people will know, while most will never know, and, certainly, most just do not care. And so, we will, endlessly, repeat ourselves until such a time as we all choose to do otherwise. An end to war, poverty, and even death itself can be found in this new question.
