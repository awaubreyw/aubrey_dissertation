In Australia, not only do most men not wash their hands after urinating, a surprising number do not wash their hands after pooing. We can smell that this happens and hear that these men walk straight out of the public toilet. [Few may have thought of looking into this.] <br><br>Sooner or later, now that we have covid in the equation, we look at all the surfaces that people touch including door handles, banking, petrol browsers, and money. I&#39;ve told a young person on the street that the five-dollar note in their mouth may have been anywhere. [People just don&#39;t think]<br><br>Some of us bring our own toilet paper with us or use our facial tissues. We use it to open doors, get petrol. My care has been wiping down shopping trolleys for decades. I complain to management that children stick their fingers in the blanch mange at the food self-serving places. [They have been discontinued.]<br><br>However, we are more likely to get autoimmune diseases when we are not getting any pathogens. Our normal immune systems require certain pathogens at a regular frequency to stay healthy. But we should choose who or where we get them from - if possible.<br><br>The very overcrowded slums of India and other places not only have given resistance to diseases that would make &#39;westerners&#39; ill, but it has also given them good protection against covid-19.<br><br>Still, I will wash the toilet seat if possible, as I do have skin problems. I don&#39;t use the first piece[s] of toilet paper either. I prefer to do up my pants and belt after washing my hands too.<br><br>I don&#39;t like drying dishes with a tea towel. I prefer to chop meat on a separate chopping board. I wash my vegetable that others have handled.<br><br>With covid, I have become ever more vigilant and hold my breath if a place has people about or appears to have had some there in recent hours.<br><br>It&#39;s not right to call covid-19 a one-in-a-hundred-year pandemic, as some do. We must expect that even more serious pathogens are going to be the norm. We have automatic doors now to our GP practices. We must stop recycling air in public buildings and transport vehicles.<br><br>Australian politics places making profits via large corporations before the welfare, health, and well-being of the general community and those who are vulnerable.", "comment_date": "2021-06-10T10:45:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "skip ads \ud83d\ude10", "comment_text": "????", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T14:02:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Yates", "comment_text": "I can always. remember this. as told to me by someone who was in the army in the fifties.. <br><br>The new recruits were.

Remember the Maple Leaf incident? If no, here&#39;s a quick recap: because of many employees of the Maple Leaf meet factories not washing their hands after going to the bathroom, many people got ill and even. one died after consuming Maple Leaf products. Now, let&#39;s pretend those factories had these wrongly placed doors I mentioned earlier. Of course, for the employees who didn&#39;t wash their hands in the first place, it&#39;s doesn&#39;t change anything. But for the people that do, they would contaminate their freshly washed hands and probably spread to illnesses in the meet even more. Luckily now, Maple Leaf is forced to make sure sure their employees wash their hands and that the bathrooms are correctly cleaned so this event won&#39;t occur again, but what about the other public bathrooms... of course, they could just make ads about the topic to encourage us to wash our hands, but better safe than sorry.

Wet one. Go into the stall and use wet paper towel to lower seat if up and wipe the seat down. It won&#39;t get rid of microbes, but it will remove visible urine and fecal matter, which is what most people are grossed out by. Use dry towel to wipe seat off. Throw towels away in trash outside stall.<br><br>Next, go back into the stall and get piece of toilet paper and use as barrier to latch door. Toss paper in toilet. Use restroom. Once finished get another piece of toilet paper and unlock stall door using tp as a barrier. If not an automatic toilet, depress lever with your foot. If button higher up, still use foot. If you aren&#39;t that flexible, mutter under your breath about the lack of foresight owned by the contractor who installed bathroom fixtures, ponder writing letter to management. Use piece of toilet paper as barrier and flush toilet. Drop paper in toilet. Use top of foot under door to open stall.<br><br>Finally, washing your hands. Extend a length of paper towel from the dispenser, but DO NOT rip it off. Turn on faucets, wet one hand, acquire soap in other. Scrub hands together vigorously, up to the forearms, top and bottoms, under fingernails and the at the base between your fingers. Do this for a minimum of twenty seconds, are about as long as it take you to sing the ABCs. With the water still running, flick water off hands, rip the previous towel off the dispenser and dry hands. If you need another, use that towel as barrier to depress button/lever to get another. Curse the contractor at this point quietly to yourself if it&#39;s not a touchless motion dispenser. Seriously consider writing an stern letter to the management of the company who&#39;s bathroom your in. Once your hands are dry, use the paper towel you dried you hands with to turn off the faucets. If you care about your water use, you can use your elbows to shut the water off 99% of the time prior to drying hands. DO NOT THROW THE TOWEL AWAY. Walk to the exit and grab the handle with the damp paper towel being used as a protective barrier from all those people who don&#39;t wash their hands after using the restroom. Next to the door, 99.9999% of the time, there will be a trashcan. Using your foot to prop the door open, hold the door open and deposit the towel into the trash. If no trash, curse management/contractor out loud and throw on floor in protest, begin forming the basic outline of the angry letter to the management scolding them for forcing you to litter.<br><br>Slip through the door being held open by your foot and listen to it shut behind you, confident in your overwhelming victory against the germs in that restroom.<br><br>I&#39;d say give yourself a pat on the back, but who knows where your shirt has been...", "comment_date": "2014-07-19T14:19:56Z", "likes_count": 61}, {"comment_by": "Skooma inna cup rn", "comment_text": "The most interesting thing in the video is the way the dude says audible ", "comment_date": "2014-07-19T14:12:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gasai Yuno", "comment_text": "I usually put paper on after wiping to check if someone left the seat wet which commonly is- do not want.", "comment_date": "2014-07-19T03:00:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Solid Structure", "comment_text": "Solution?
