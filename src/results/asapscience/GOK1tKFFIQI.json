i honestly have no clue. my sister and i started seeing our mom on the weekends. we thought she was great. at first it was strange cause to me she was just a stranger. my dad had always talked bad about her, but i never knew what to think cause i had never seen her do anything bad. my dad has drinking problems so he seemed like the bad guy. he always yelled at me and hit me (sometimes). one time we were in an argument and i went to my room and locked the door. he broke my door and i immediately started crying. i was like 11. my dad had always said my mom had problems when they were together. one day my mom took me and my sister to stay at a hotel where she lived, just for fun and cause they have a pool. i woke up in the middle of the night, 2-3am. i didn\u2019t see my mom anywhere so i tried facetiming her on an ipad. no response. she picked up an audio call tho. i asked where she was at. she said she was downstairs \u201cgetting breakfast\u201d. i was like it\u2019s 2am, why are you getting breakfast? she said there\u2019s a really long line for food. i believed her. that happened when i was 7 but, as i grew up i realized i was stupid. during that call you could hear it in the background. the machines. the jackpots. my mom has a gambling problem. when i moved with my mom to california i would constantly find her gone or late and when i\u2019d track her phone she\u2019d be at some casino. when i lived in alabama i was constantly depressed because i was the only asian besides my family and i was just more prone to depression since i have epilepsy. my epilepsy wasn\u2019t so horrible until i moved. i hadn\u2019t had a seizure for like 2 years in alabama. now i have them 2-3 times a month. i\u2019m on 7+ pills. i\u2019m not allowed to swim, cook, go on stairs, be alone, etc. i love cooking and it hurts me that i\u2019m just\u2026 not allowed. i\u2019m not allowed to do anything. my mom has a camera in my room that it watching me 24/7. i\u2019m not allowed to exercise. i\u2019m not allowed to go to school. i\u2019m not allowed to go outside alone. i just stay inside\u2026 on my bed\u2026 laying down. i get to depressed to even move. i don\u2019t even get up to eat. the most screen time i\u2019ve spent on my phone in a day was 23h and 57m :D. when i moved to california i met this guy while playing xbox. he was a friend of a friend. he lived over an hour away so we thought we\u2019d never meet irl. we became best friends. he was funny, kind, and the same age as me lmao. i didn\u2019t know what he looked like. he kept his face a secret. but i started liking him. even tho i had no clue what he looked like. we met in person. i was too nervous to even look at him. i ended up telling him i like him and a week later he said he felt the same. he\u2019s still my best friend, plus some. he\u2019s the reason i\u2019m alive. i\u2019m only alive for other people. i don\u2019t want to make other people sad. but what\u2019s the point if i\u2019m just laying here all day. i don\u2019t do anything useful. my bf said if i kms then he\u2019s gone too. i take some antidepressants and they help but not enough. i have no friends since i don\u2019t go to school or ever go outside. i just have my bf. i\u2019m always just in my bed watching youtube or sleeping. only time i ever do something is if i\u2019m with my bf. but his dad doesn\u2019t want us to see each other anymore because he just\u2026 doesn\u2019t like me. and i\u2019m always alone. i\u2019m scared of being alone. i\u2019m sort of an ambivert. even tho i have epilepsy and i\u2019m not supposed to be alone, my mom has to work. my dad and other siblings are in alabama (except my older sister, university). i\u2019m just here\u2026 even tho i could be in a better place. it feels like i\u2019m getting slashed or stabbed every minute, even tho nothing is happening. i\u2019m not doing anything even tho i want to do/be something. i can\u2019t. how could i be something if i\u2019m not allowed to do anything?

I was abused as a kid, broken, depressed, anorexic, bulimic, suicidal. I went in &amp; out of psych units like it was a game of tic-tac-toe. Suicide watch. I was on enough Antidepressants to kill a horse. I hated myself. I wanted out. I wanted the pain to stop. The gaslighting* to end. *(when a psycho makes a sane person question their own sanity, and thus think they themselves are the insane one).<br>I wanted power. I got into witchcraft. I thought it would give me the identity i wanted, to be set apart from people who hurt me. It only made me sicker. Sicker. Thats what it did to me. <br>The doctor said id never get well. That i would suffer severe Chronic Manic depression, and never be well, that id be stuck on antidepressants all of my life. <br>I would plot suicide on a daily basis, binging and purging my food as often as opening and closing a door. The pain was too real. People choked me. Assaulted me. Told me i was ugly, i felt worthless. Nothing ever got better. Then my mother died. The (1) &amp; only soul who ever loved /emotionally supported me was removed from the earth. I was stuck living with people who broke me, ruined my identity, thus causing me to hate God. I thought God hated me, that he was just  like the ones who tortured me, a family of abusers, who cover up all their actions with the mask of religion. I didnt know that God is on my side. I didnt know that Jesus would Love and Defend me, and fight for me and that He later would heal me, rescue me from Family. The ones who caused me pain. The ones who choked me for wearing a necklace. <br><br>I moved out after family threatened to throw all my belongings on the front yard, and have me permanently institutionalized in an insane asylum, when they were the ones who caused my mental illness via abuse. <br><br>They blamed me for the abuse they did to me. <br>To take my life in an insane asylum when they were the ones who made me suicidal. <br><br>Next morning i spoke with my dead moms parents who let me live with them. <br><br>I stayed on the antidepressants, prescribed. But they only made me sicker. I got deeper and deeper into witchcraft, thinking it was a solution. But it made me even more suicidal. Self hatred was inescapable. <br><br>I decided i was going to kill myself. I was going to take all my pills. <br><br>But then Jesus stepped in. I didnt die. I surrendered my life to Jesus to make me well and heal me. <br><br>The deity i blamed for me being abused wanted to heal me. He Was fighting for me and Loved me all along.  <br><br>He wanted to love me. He wanted to give me His Heart. <br><br><br><br> HE LOVES ME. JESUS. LOVES. ME .<br><br>Jesus miraculously healed me \u2014 i am off all drugs and dont need them and i dont have any mental illnesses.

It just drains out all positive thoughts and replace them with dark clouds of negativity. It can get very overwhelming. Once it starts, it will go on for months but last year it lasted pretty long.

Lost my appetite, stopped talking to my friends, fought with everyone I encountered, unable to think straight, stayed in bed staring at the ceiling the whole day, neglected my studies for months, unable to concertrate, suffered short termed memory lost, unable to differentiate reality and non-reality, a wrecked sleep schedule, fast weight lost or gain. Those were some of the symptoms I suffered. <br><br> It felt as if there was no other way out of it other than ******. It eats up your brain and can physically hurt your health at the same time.

It\u2019s very common. And if you suffer from depression, you don\u2019t have a mental disease. You are sane and you\u2019re normal, because life is depressing. It\u2019s filled with pain and suffering. As you go through life, your beloved dog dies. So does your sweet grandma. Then you realize that no one survives. We are all going to die and it seems that there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. That\u2019s very depressing. <br><br>TWO QUESTIONS<br>What is the world\u2019s best-selling book of all time? It\u2019s the Bible. Are you familiar with its story of the rich young ruler who ran to Jesus, knelt down and asked, \u201cGood Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d How would you answer that question? Before you answer, let me give you a quick scenario: Imagine you feel a painful lump under your arm. So you go to the doctor. He examines it, looks concerned, does some tests, and comes back with a grim expression and says, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to tell you this, but you have lymph node cancer. It has metastasized. You have about two weeks to live. I will give you some medication to help ease the pain. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d <br><br>You go home and lie on your bed. You\u2019re too sick to see anyone or go anywhere. All you can think about is that one question: \u201cWhat should I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d This isn\u2019t a far-fetched scenario. More than 600,000 Americans will die of cancer in the next twelve months, and over 8.2 million will die of the disease worldwide. Put yourself into that frightening scenario and ask yourself, \u201cWhat should I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d Do you know the answer? <br><br>THE CAUSE OF DEPRESSION<br>According to the world\u2019s best-selling Book, every human being is held in bondage to a haunting fear of death. The Bible says that what Jesus accomplished on the cross was so that . . . [He] might free all those who through [the haunting] fear of death were held in slavery throughout their lives. (Hebrews 2:15, Amplified Bible)<br><br>FEAR\u2019S ANTIDOTE<br>If you were standing on the edge of a plane 10,000 feet up, thinking about how you are going to jump and hit the ground face-first at 120 mph, you would understandably be terrified. But if I gave you a parachute, the minute you put it on, you will be able to control your fears. If you completely trust that parachute, you will now know that you will land gently at 8 mph, on your feet. Your fear will be in direct proportion to your faith. If you have total faith in the parachute, you will have no fear. Your faith will rid you of fear. <br><br>Let\u2019s now apply that analogy to faith in Jesus. When He was asked, \u201cGood Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d He replied: \u201cWhy do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. You know the commandments: \u2018Do not commit adultery,\u2019 \u2018Do not murder,\u2019 \u2018Do not steal,\u2019 \u2018Do not bear false witness,\u2019 \u2018Do not defraud,\u2019 \u2018Honor your father and your mother.\u2019 \u201d (Mark 10:18,19) <br><br>Jesus told him that only God is good; only He is morally perfect. Then He gave the man five of the Ten Commandments. This is because we may think that we are good, but the Ten Commandments show us that we\u2019re not. For example, how many lies have you told in your life? Have you ever stolen something (irrespective of its value)? Have you taken God\u2019s name in vain (including \u201cOMG\u201d)? Jesus said that if we look with lust, we commit adultery in the heart (see Matthew 5:27,28). Have you ever looked with lust? <br><br>If you answered \u201cYes\u201d to these questions, you\u2019ve admitted that you are a lying, thieving, blasphemous adulterer at heart. So if God judged you by the Ten Commandments on Judgment Day (we\u2019ve looked at four of them), would you be innocent or guilty? No doubt you (like the rest of us) will be guilty. If you\u2019re guilty on Judgment Day, will you go to Heaven or Hell? If any of us were judged by the Ten Commandments, we would justly end up in Hell. What then should you do to be saved from death and Hell? <br><br>Fortunately, there is an answer to the question, \u201cWhat shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d Just over 2,000 years ago, God became a perfect, sinless human being in Jesus of Nazareth. The Bible says: And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh . . . (1 Timothy 3:16) And the reason He became a human being was to suffer and die on the cross. When Jesus was on the cross He took the punishment for the sin of the world. We broke God\u2019s Law (the Ten Commandments are called \u201cthe moral Law\u201d) and Jesus paid the fine. That\u2019s what happened on the cross. That\u2019s why He cried out, \u201cIt is finished!\u201d just before He died. In other words, the debt has been paid. <br><br>If you\u2019re in court and someone pays your fine, the judge can legally let you go even though you\u2019re guilty. God can dismiss our case, and legally let us live forever, because Jesus paid our fine on the cross: \u201cFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life\u201d (John 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead, defeating death. Today, if you repent and trust in Jesus, God promises to give you eternal life as a free gift. <br><br>DEATH IS EVIDENCE<br>Do you know what \u201cdeath\u201d is? It\u2019s our wages. The Bible says, \u201cThe wages of sin is death\u201d (Romans 6:23). We earn the sentence of death by our sin. It\u2019s like a judge saying to a mass murderer, \u201cYou have earned the death penalty.\u201d Death is evidence that God is serious about sin. In His morally perfect eyes, our sin is deadly serious. Today, right now, please confess and forsake your sins and put your trust in Jesus Christ (like you\u2019d trust a parachute). Do that, and God will not only save you from death, but He will save you from the fear of death. Remember the analogy of how fearful it would be to jump 10,000 feet without a parachute? And how, if you were given a parachute, you could control your fears? Put on the Lord Jesus Christ and trust in Him with all of your heart, and you will rid yourself of that haunting fear that causes depression. <br><br>Millions of human beings suffer from depression because they live without faith in Jesus. They have no hope in their death. But in Christ, you now have a living hope, both in this life and in your death. You need never fear as long as you trust in Jesus. Look at the promises of Scripture: What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who shall bring a charge against God\u2019s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written: \u201cFor Your sake we are killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.\u201d Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.

First of all keep in mind whatever your problem is, it&#39;s never larger than your life whether you believe it or not. So now relax and only look in the direction of solution. The first thing I can always suggest is &#39;meditate&#39;. Remember you don&#39;t do meditation you just meditate. There is a difference as you can only experience it and not imagine about it. This will solve the maximum part as it will let you know that you are not under the control of your brain which you otherwise believed. If I may suggest try out &#39;isha kriya&#39; video available on YouTube.<br>For the remaining part hold on to youtube channel &#39;Therapy in a nutshell&#39; which will answer almost all your questions you&#39;ve ever had.<br>Finally, don&#39;t surf the internet for solutions because it will only make you believe that you have a larger problem than it actually is. These marketing people want you to pay for their plans and that&#39;s why all the drama. Internet is not yet a friendly place for genuine solutions to mental health issues.<br>Trust me I did the above things and my life got back on track and in the end I realised that I never had a problem because the problems outside are still same but me inside is not the same and that&#39;s what everyone wants. Me obsessing and analysing about it was the reason it turned worse. <br>These should solve the problems for maximum of people who are confused about the problem more than the problem itself. Just give it 1 week and see how you feel. If you still think there is no change then now it&#39;s your birthright to walk into the office of that therapist because now it&#39;s no longer your headache it&#39;s their headache \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude02.

Why I despise myself, why I feel ashamed of who I am. I always pretend to be the happy one, joke around, friendly, sarcastic, dark humour... but it&#39;s always there, the physical pain in my chest and my brain, and no one knows it. It&#39;s not something that I did, but more like what I didn&#39;t do.\r<br>\r<br>In front of people, I smile a lot, I laugh, I joke, people think I&#39;m a happy person... and I have a happy side, people just don&#39;t know the heavy stone inside of me, weighing on my brain, my chest, I can physically feel it in every moment of my life. Even when I&#39;m happy, it&#39;s there.\r<br>\r<br>I&#39;ve never received treatment, I&#39;ve made a point for myself to not get diagnosed, and I don&#39;t want to flush money on a &quot;professional&quot; who doesn&#39;t really have a personal bond with me and just gets paid to listen to me. No, I think I&#39;m too cynical for it.\r<br>\r<br>The reason I&#39;ve decided to post here is because... I&#39;ve had it weighing me down, being on my soul, my mind, not letting me sleep, bringing dark thoughts into me, since the age of 14-15... I wanted to die then, but I was like, &quot;Better things will come... keep waiting.&quot; Better things did come, I have a wife I love, a child I adore, and I know for a fact I would never harm myself, if only not to upset or traumatise them. Like, self-harm is out of the question. However, the heavy loads is still in me. I feel that I need to post here because... why not? I&#39;ve never tried it, so why not?\r<br>\r<br>Does it make me weak for opening up? I don&#39;t think so. The fact I was passive and did nothing about the entrapment and emasculation I&#39;ve experienced growing up with a possessive mum who thinks a bear hug of preventing you from living is love and &quot;protection.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>I&#39;ve had a few heavy lows in my life, one at 16-17, one at about 24-25, and one now. Stuff bother me - I can&#39;t sleep, I always feel low about myself, I simply hate who I am, that is the truth.\r<br>\r<br>I just really hate myself - like, I look in the mirror, I just feel disgusted. I just don&#39;t like who I am), my life in the sense of what I&#39;ve done with it.\r<br>\r<br>Like, I feel old, finished, like there&#39;s nothing left in me - I&#39;m 30. When I go home, if I see high school students going home, or when I run into people in their early 20s... I just feel so old. They&#39;re young, enjoying life, have their whole lives ahead of them, have hope... I never experienced being young, that was deprived for me and I was too passive to do something, but now it&#39;s too late.\r<br>\r<br>My mum had paranoia and other issues, never got diagnosed... but just figure this out. Until the age of 16, I was forced to call her every time I arrived at school - my school was 10 min from my home. I felt so humiliated doing it! I literally wasn&#39;t allowed to meet friends in the evening like any other normal teenager could until the age of 17-18, because in her mind I could be killed, get into drugs, or whatever... basically, I had to lie in my bed, and choke on my own envy of those who do live and sense of worthlessness while I hear laughter and people making memories, being young from outside my window.\r<br>\r<br>In her sick, selfish mind that was love. I did nothing.\r<br>\r<br>I finally started going out with friends at the age of 17... not that my mum liked it, every time I went out she had a panic attack, pretended to faint on the floor, called me a million times... I didn&#39;t answer, but you can imagine that whenever I came home she was there in the flat, with a slapped-arse face acting like I actually did something bad to her.\r<br>\r<br>In her mind, I was being selfish - not her after trapping me and preventing me from leaving, she claimed I was being selfish for daring to go out with friends and &quot;not thinking about her.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>It affected my personality. Even though I met friends and they all thought I was friendly and fun, I could never form meaningful relationships, I was very introverted, I still kept a distance a lot. I was there for others, but never let anyone get inside my head, inside what I felt.\r<br>\r<br>I was also passive, in a way. I never initiated friendships, it was people doing it to me - this passiveness, both in resisting my mum before the age of 17, and this, are a big part of why I feel ashamed of who I am.\r<br>\r<br>I remember when I was younger, in my early 20s... I still had things to feel good about. Like, when I was 22, people found it impressive I had an MA... people found my knowledge of music and history impressive, the fact I played guitar... thing is, most of those things were a result of me just being stuck at home and not being able to do anything else. I love music, it&#39;s my life and I&#39;d never give it up for anything, but nothing else developed within me.\r<br>\r<br>But now... there&#39;s nothing. If you&#39;re 22 with an MA and knowledge in history it&#39;s WOW, if you&#39;re 30... like, so?\r<br>\r<br>I never got to experience being young and free, young and happy... and now I&#39;m just fat, 30, ugly... complete nobody.\r<br>\r<br>Thing is, I&#39;d be OK with who I am if I had experienced being young, the joys and disappointments of that time, the life, but I didn&#39;t. It&#39;s like I&#39;ve been born old, with no memories of youth to give me something to think about.\r<br>\r<br>Imagine being born old and not having any joyous memories of the past, never being young... that&#39;s how I feel.\r<br>\r<br>I&#39;m stuck in this skin, I&#39;m stuck in who I am... and I really hate the person I am. I&#39;m ashamed I was so passive when my mum locked me in the flat, I&#39;m ashamed I remained there until the age of 22 and didn&#39;t run away from home, I&#39;m ashamed I always went with the flow and didn&#39;t work to approach people, to be the one to initiate friendships, that I was telling myself, &quot;Good things will come&quot;... without realising that you must go towards those things, you must work for them, you can&#39;t just expect them to come.\r<br>\r<br>Literally the only thing that I have is to make sure my daughter has a full, fun, and free life. To have the happy upbringing I didn&#39;t have, to be outgoing and happy. Thing is, you still want to have something in you, going for you, and I don&#39;t.\r<br>\r<br>Ironically, my mum is actually a good grandmother - thing is, she knows she couldn&#39;t get away with the sh** she did now.\r<br>\r<br>But when she dies, I know for a fact I&#39;ll be zero upset. I&#39;ll be upset for my daughter being upset, but I have zero sympathy of love for my mum.\r<br>\r<br>At one point, I wrote to her and tried explaining what she did... she thinks I&#39;m being childish and selfish. According to her, I was spoilt with &quot;too much love&quot; - that abuse is love in her mind.\r<br>\r<br>It&#39;s funny, but she thinks I was a spoilt child... my parents never took me to a restaurant (except McDonald&#39;s a few times), maybe took me on one holiday, and always made it clear we were too poor for the most basic things that other kids in my school who were much worst off still did, but apparently that&#39;s being &quot;spoilt.&quot; Thing is, that never bothered me - it was mostly a result of my dad being bitter in general and imposing his &quot;sour grapes&quot; mentality on the whole family.\r<br>\r<br>I&#39;m not asking for a virtual hug or support... it is what it is, nothing can be done, but I felt like I needed to let it out somewhere.", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T15:38:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "monoranjan hai yaha", "comment_text": "2 year ago i try to suicide but i failed in that \u2639\ufe0f\u2639\ufe0f why i don&#39;t know why my father don&#39;t understand me he love my brothers but not me..

Those suffering from depression can experience intense feelings of sadness, anger, hopelessness, fatigue, and a variety of other symptoms. They may begin to feel useless and even suicidal, losing interest in things and people that they once enjoyed. Depression is often triggered by life circumstances, such as a loss of job, death of a loved one, divorce, or psychological problems such as abuse or low self-esteem.<br><br>The Bible tells us to be filled with joy and praise (Philippians 4:4; Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOK1tKFFIQI&amp;t=15m11s\">15:11</a>), so God apparently intends for us all to live joyful lives. This is not easy for someone suffering from situational depression, but it can be remedied through God\u2019s gifts of prayer, Bible study and application, support groups, fellowship among believers, confession, forgiveness, and counseling. We must make the conscious effort to not be absorbed in ourselves, but to turn our efforts outward. Feelings of depression can often be solved when those suffering with depression move the focus from themselves to Christ and others.<br><br>Clinical depression is a physical condition that must be diagnosed by a physician. It may not be caused by unfortunate life circumstances, nor can the symptoms be alleviated by one\u2019s own will. Contrary to what some in the Christian community believe, clinical depression is not always caused by sin. Depression can sometimes be caused by a physical disorder that needs to be treated with medication and/or counseling. Of course, God is able to cure any disease or disorder. However, in some cases, seeing a doctor for depression is no different than seeing a doctor for an injury.<br><br>There are some things that those who suffer from depression can do to alleviate their anxiety. They should make sure that they are staying in the Word, even when they do not feel like it. Emotions can lead us astray, but God\u2019s Word stands firm and unchanging. We must maintain strong faith in God and hold even more tightly to Him when we undergo trials and temptations. The Bible tells us that God will never allow temptations into our lives that are too much for us to handle (1 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOK1tKFFIQI&amp;t=10m13s\">10:13</a>). Although being depressed is not a sin, one is still accountable for the response to the affliction, including getting the professional help that is needed. \u201cThrough Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise\u2014the fruit of lips that confess his name\u201d (Hebrews <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOK1tKFFIQI&amp;t=13m15s\">13:15</a>).<br><br>Gian Giorgio Trissino<br>Both I and J were used interchangeably by scribes to express the sound of both the vowel and the consonant.

I received word of his loss very shortly after and what particularly hurts about this is that when I was a kid, me favorite uncle once bought me a black puppy and I called him Sparky, but he was found dead in his bed after 2 weeks, I named my Umbreon Sparky... My other friend... Let&#39;s just say the the world was far too cruel to him. between Christmas 2018 and the new year, our town lost a public figure who had given us so much for many years. One night after returning from my Pokemon Go rounds, our resident mad hatter met with a freak accident. Earlier I caught my first Ho Oh, I named it Hohatter in his honor. Recently, as of last week, we lost a shop owner. I would usually purchase art supplies from his store in the last week before the new year, to prepare an end of year special drawing but since 2017, I always had to say goodbye to someone. And with everything I love: Videogames, Anime, etc, and the fact that I&#39;m not much for going out as the norm and that the outside world doesn&#39;t have much for me... I think I&#39;m becoming depressed. I couldn&#39;t really partake of what I do on a regular basis this past week. Sure I watch a couple of movies, watched the new Joker film but I couldn&#39;t do much of the other things. As I&#39;m typing this, I have a pain in my center and I feel like I care less. I wanna do Pokemon Go this evening but I don&#39;t care for it right now. I additionally DO NOT want to use a short term solution to a long term problem but sometimes, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing... Well, tbh I&#39;m just feeling THAT PART now.

A lot of personal problems happened and I started getting bullied a lot by my own \u201cfriends\u201d. I don\u2019t feel happy anymore and I I\u2019m shutting people off for no reason. There was this girl that I really liked, and I\u2019m pretty sure she liked me too, but every time she would come over and try to talk to me I would just try to distance myself from her for some reason. I have a single mom, and I haven\u2019t seen my dad in a few years. I can have a lot of acquaintances in school, but after that I just spend all my time at home, in my bed by myself. So I really don\u2019t have any friends. And the people that I very rarely do see are mean and usually encourage me to kill myself when I tell them I\u2019m sad, I still only talk to them because I don\u2019t want to be all alone. But now, I find it hard to even feel sad. I just don\u2019t have the energy for anything, and everything feels wrong. I really don\u2019t want to do much, I\u2019ve started eating less and I feel nothing. In school I can put a facade and try to show like nothing is wrong while everyone just harasses and bullies me.

I don&#39;t want to hurt my family that is what stopped me and I do believe in hell...Life is hard I am not going to lie to you. When I look in the mirror I feel ugly I have no friends I don\u2019t feel smart no guy everything in my life is no no no no no. I&#39;m like why am I here...but even if I am poor no job and feel like why am I here I have tried to help people who were really grateful for my help. Living to help is a reason. There are people in this world who appreciate our help. Sometimes I look at people who are worse then me and I think what makes them want to live? why are they so happy? I read this article a girl with no legs and no arms loves life wow!! What&#39;s my excuse...<br>My only best friend in this whole world is my mom and I tell people my mom is your mom if you need one she saved me. There must be something worth living for are you creative? Artistic? What are your gifts? I will admit I called the suicide hotline many times...my problem was a broken heart and broken will and wanted to die because I felt like I didn&#39;t fit anywhere and my only guy of 7 years used me and left me...before that it was more hell poverty sickness dysfunctional family childhood trauma and the list goes on....I look at it this way I died a long time ago but something inside tells me keep going so I do and I am here why??? I just am and I lived and got to this very moment in time to where I am writing you. That means something?? <br>I know it&#39;s hard to reach out I am a soul on this earth who cares and understands you are special remember no thumb print is alike you are you and I know you will find a reason to live. We only have this one life lets try to love ourselves forgive ourselves and try to do the best we can because we are different and that is okay believe me being a teenager is so hard I am 40 years old now and as I am maturing I realize that you look at life in a different way things change over time but when you are young it feels like it&#39;s going to last forever but it won&#39;t the torment and dark thoughts will go away I found out at the doctor my thyroid was low get your thyroid checked and I am on a low dose of a mood stabilizer I toughed it out without meds for years because I was against them but it has helped no more crazy angry violent mood swings I even hit my mom and she forgave me but I admitted myself into the mental hospital because I was getting out of control and it really helped 20 years without meds only to find out I needed them. You need reality...that is a big part of getting well counseling would help too. It took getting real for me I had to come out of some delusion I was in, you are not alone...Everyone that jumped from the Golden gate bridge what would they say if they could come back and talk to us? Hell is repetition. I did something positive today, I picked up all this trash in a parking lot and the manager appreciated it. That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying random acts of kindness make all the difference. If we all live to do this then it takes our thoughts off of ourselves and you start seeing how much of a need there is all around us,I don&#39;t have to feel useless or hopeless because someone somewhere needs my help:) <br>Call the suicide hotline, it really helped me to talk, if you are really bad admit yourself into the nearest hospital i did and I don&#39;t regret it, the people are really nice to you and they will help you. Find a true friend someone you can be at your absolute worst with and accepts you for who you are...Sooner or later there are wake up calls in life and that is our chance to change. <br>remember you are special and we all came from different families and some of us suffered more painful experiences then others don&#39;t beat your self up over the past it is going to all work it&#39;s self out in the end the hardest thing is to forgive yourself for bad things you have done or said...<br>Religion can twist and make people feel threatened. Nobody should feel condemned or damned everyone should feel loved and accepted, because we are all on individual journeys.<br>Nobody has walked in our shoes. We all know right from wrong and we can choose to be positive or negative help or hurt give or take. there is more positive energy then negative energy.Or the world would have ended by now.. If you hate everybody find out why...We can&#39;t stay mad forever sooner or later you need answers to find out why you are angry, maybe someone betrayed you, let you down, abused you, threatened you, sexually abused you, Go to a doctor and find out if it&#39;s a genetic chemical imbalance and don&#39;t feel bad if you find out you have a chemical imbalance because you are not alone. Get your thyroid checked! The thyroid can affect your brain.The answer WHY is so important once you find out then you can start to get answers..and then you are on the path to recovery, life is not fair but all we can do is try to meet the right people who are there for us along the way...There is a lot of help out there and people who really care, school counselors too.

Friends ask me to go out, but then all i think is how they are calling me because they don&#39;t have anyone else, like I&#39;m just there when they are alone. And I think about all the people who are going out, looking at me, talking about me and I just can&#39;t do it.

The only thing that helps me coping are my animals. But of course, i got very sick and my therapy dog died. It has been very hard since. So hard that i even turned to self harm. The emotional pain was just too hard to go through. I just feel like it was all my fault, that everybody hates me, that i am a terrible person. It has been a few months, but my psycheatrist still says &#39;&#39;get over it&#39;&#39;. It is not something i can throw away. I have had it for years now and it has ruined my life. I try to be as happy as possible, but with the stress, grief and all that it is very hard. I also keep overthinking things.

When I first saw her it felt like everything around her exploded, she was just too fine. I approached her and we took off from there. Texting and chatting all that cute shit. After a good 2 weeks she told me she had bipolar depression. I really had no clue on what the depression part was. I had always heard people say &quot;oh this person is bipolar&quot; or when someone would suddenly act up and change emotion people would be like &quot;chill out you bipolar&quot;. So when she told me that I asked her what it was. Once she gave me a little piece of information on it I knew not to ask too much questions about it. At that point I had already started caring about her. She&#39;s a real beautiful person and I am really grateful she&#39;s entered my life. I&#39;ve researched so much about bipolar depression so I could understand her. Fast forward to now, we&#39;re a loving couple but god damn is it a rollercoaster of emotions. I&#39;ve learned not to take things personal when she gets low. She kinda pushes me away, and at the beginning I thought it was because she didn&#39;t care about me. I love her to death and would endure anything for her. She sometimes thinks I&#39;m too good for her and that she doesn&#39;t deserve me when she&#39;s feeling low. Or she gets tired of life and does a lot of crying. I swear she deserves everything good in this world, like I&#39;m the one that feels like I don&#39;t deserve her. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever stop loving her. I know she loves me a lot also. So I feel like it&#39;s my mission to love her when others won&#39;t. Even if we do fall apart. Idk that&#39;s just a piece of my love story that I thought I&#39;d share. I&#39;m currently high af atm so I&#39;m just kinda reminiscing. I feel for those of you that are suffering from depression especially those with bipolar. You people are real talented. Surround yourselves with good people. Never give up hope and never believe that you&#39;re alone.

First of all, I&#39;ve had depression and suicidal thoughts before, where it got so bad that I did physical harm to myself more than once, and I know what it feels like to feel that worthless and pitiful and meaningless. <br>One thing that always really helped me was to find things that made me laugh. I mean really laugh. Crying-weak-at-the-knees, doubled over and gasping for air laughing. Comedians usually did the trick, and always made me feel so much better. Another was finding other things to focus on, like stories and books and shows. I&#39;m not saying you should constantly be hiding from reality, but you should definitely have a place to escape to and forget about your worries when you need to. Also, getting up and forcing yourself to do little things like fold laundry or do dishes while listening to music, and not having to think and get the satisfsction or getting something done is really great- and if you don&#39;t have the energy for that, just close your eyes and listen to some rain or just sleep. Eventually you&#39;ll have the energy to hoist yourself up and do something, and all you need is one first step. Another thing, and this is much more based on your beliefs on God and whether or not there&#39;s a purpose to everything, is something I&#39;ve heard been called optimistic nihilism, but it&#39;s so much more. The idea is that you&#39;re going to die. Yes, you, reading this. You are going to die. Maybe not right now, maybe not in a fes days, maybe not for a couple of decades, but you ARE going to die, and sooner than you think. So will your loved ones, your idols, your ideas, your dreams, your creations, all humans, the solar system and the universe will eventually end. <br> Okay, but how is that inspirational? Short answer- it&#39;s not. But the thing is, all of that is going to happen REGARDLESS, so tell yourself, &quot;what the hell? None of it matters anyway,&quot; and go try to find something new to do. Even if it&#39;s just go for a walk or go out to meet someone new, you are going to die anyway, so you might as well enjoy your life while it&#39;s here.

It involves a combo of environmental and genetic factors that can cause genes to be turned on and off! If you are suffering from anxiety or depression please read..... :)))<br>I love the book Nutrient Power by Dr William Walsh. Life changing!!!! This man has dedicated his life to study patterns of people with mental illness and has the worlds largest database that he uses for his own scientific research. He will tell you what mainstream medicine will not. He believes that depression falls into 5 phenotypes. <br>We all need to read it and get our blood and urine tested for our own biochemical needs to see if we fit into a particular phenotype. Maybe you&#39;ve wondered why a particular medicine that worked so well for someone else, doesn&#39;t work for you? <br>Even simple Nutrients can make conditions better or worse. For instance a person who is under methylated will exhibit depression and anxiety and is intolerant to folic acid and thus supplementing will make that person worse.  Unfortunately a lot of our food is fortified with this supplement. At the same time another phenotype of depression is folic acid deficiency! This explains why one man&#39;s medicine can be another man&#39;s poison. <br>Folic acid deficiency depression types are very intolerant to SSRI&#39;s and these patients have been linked to suicide and homicide after taking them. I think it&#39;s criminal not to test people for this deficiency before prescribing them anti depressants!<br>Then there are copper overload patients, over methylated patients and patients suffering from toxic metals or pyrole disorder as their chief problem.  These can all cause depression, anxiety, irritability, panic, confusion, delusions even schizophrenia! If you want to get better, they key is to figure out your own biochemical individuality. Find a Dr under The Walsh Institute to help you. They can check your methylation status and check for deficiencies, overloads and disorders. I&#39;ve decided to spend the extra $ and try for myself. Naturally your health insurance won&#39;t cover a lot of it, so be prepared to spend a little bit. <br>I know there are also tests like 23 and me (the genetic part) which might let you know your methylation status. Whether or not you decide to take medication, I believe it&#39;s important to first check your biochemistry. <br>You can check Dr William Walsh out on YouTube if you&#39;re into the science aspect.", "comment_date": "2018-02-12T10:09:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cleofus Brown", "comment_text": "Thanks for posting this, I really enjoyed this video.

The dominant female make sure to be the only fertile with her urine which interfere with the reproductive cycle of every other female.<br><br>If the dominant male or female dies, there will be a power struggle until a new one emerge and forcefully bring back peace in the group.

It is a way to make us give up any hope to progress in life, convinced that trying to fight will fail miserably.

And why? Because God Gave you this life because you are strong. You might grow being all tough and all that. But someone at least has a weakness. I suffer from a lot. You always might say &quot; I&#39;m going to kill my self&quot; and &quot;I hate my life&quot; and all that but then prove it.

You have a strong spot and a weak spot. Show the strong spot and get rid of the bad spot. You at least accomplish something somewhere often. It takes pacience. You have to wait. Give all the time you have. You never know when something ends. When you finish this the world might stop. You you have to work on it to accomplish. Everyone believes in you.

That&#39;s why I decided to change one of my senior courses at the last minute and take AP psychology instead because you need to understand how the mind works in order to understand yourself and others. This all stemmed from a painful but awakening experience I had this summer.<br><br>I used to be one of the smartest kids in all my classes and would often complete tasks with little effort compared to my peers. This lead me to believe that I was &quot;better&quot; than others and this mentality was only reinforced when I started to get a bit popular in my school. I would constantly look down on other people but only in my mind. However, I started smoking weed heavily in high school (at first it was due to curiosity but then I became addicted).  By the end of junior year, I had decimated my GPA by smoking everyday and not prioritizing my grades. I started taking harder drugs (in retrospect I realized that I only did it to please other people). During one night in the summer leading into senior year, my friends and I decided to trip acid. A couple hours in, I lost all sense of ego and began thinking about all the bad decisions I made in high school and how it affected my life, my friends and my family. I began having a psychotic meltdown (I didn&#39;t know that this is what was happening to me at the time); I lost all sense of self-awareness and I couldn&#39;t control what I said or did. My mind was moving at 1000 mph but I had no control over my thoughts whatsoever. I began acting very strangely in front of all my friends- I began making loud noises and weird gestures. The fact that I couldn&#39;t comprehend what was happening to me or the fact that all my friends were watching (some of them I knew from childhood) only made it worse. To top it all off, some of my friends began taking videos of me while this was happening and I didn&#39;t know until the event was infamous all over social media days later. When I got home, I was in a state of constant paranoia and  I couldn&#39;t trust anyone, not even my own brother. I began to realize I was depressed (I never thought I&#39;d ever say that since I was ignorant towards the subject my whole life until now) and I developed crippling anxiety that caused me to shut out all my friends for the whole month of August. I didn&#39;t respond to anyone who tried to reach out to me and debated deleting all of my social media. I ended up wasting most of my summer even though all of my friends were only trying to help me.<br><br>The day after this incident, I threw away all of my paraphernalia. I haven&#39;t smoked since that day. I watched self-help videos during the entirety of August. I vowed to do whatever it took to reach my full potential as a student. I&#39;ve begun practicing meditation and working out 5 days a week. I stopped reinforcing my victim mentality with negative thoughts. I remind myself everyday to keep everything in perspective (so many others have it worse off than you do). I learned true compassion and stopped looking down at people for things they can&#39;t control. I sometimes still have negative thoughts (I&#39;m only a week into my senior year and this whole experience is still fresh in my memory), but I&#39;m slowly learning to transform my mind and ultimately my life . My mission is to live a fulfilling life so I can spread happiness and joy to those around me and be a role model for my siblings so that they can be the best version of themselves.<br><br>If you&#39;re struggling with depression, just remember that it gets better. We are all born with the same mind. Negative emotions stem from negative thoughts. Don&#39;t turn to drugs in order to evade the stressful problems in your life as it only makes those problems worse. I recommend reading books to improve your mentality and develop new habits. I realize that my experience may not be as bad as yours, but that shouldn&#39;t deter you from living a happy life.

I&#39;m a 15 year old boy, and I&#39;ve always been a happy positive person. My dad and sister had bipolar depression and my mom never understood. And neither did I frankly. I was always patient with people, but I never really understood, how can somebody be depressed? I&#39;ve been sad, but I never understood it. Eventually my dad got sick of my mom, a combination of Zoloft and the way she didn&#39;t understand his depression. He left both me and her and i didn&#39;t even know where he went. I was pissed, and sad at the same time. I started to have hallucinations. I started to wonder what my life was even worth. Not to mention I had but 3 friends at school, and since I always took their jokes, they continued to always pester me, but I wasn&#39;t allowed to say anything back. I&#39;m 6&#39;2, 190 pounds, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m a small guy, I&#39;m physically strong but emotionally weak. Eventually I heard where my dad was living. I was right on the brink of dying, and I knew nobody would ever love me. And then I met a girl. She was beautiful, smart funny. Not the kind of girl who would want to hang out with me. She said she needed someone to talk to, and she told me she had bipolar depression. At the time I was having suicidal thoughts, so of course I knew she needed help. She was always talking about how she wanted to kill herself. I never told her about my suicidal thoughts because I was afraid to tell anyone. I told her how my sister has bipolar, and how she tried to kill herself at work, and is in a mental institution now. The girl told me she would be there for me if I felt this way, but then was like I know you don&#39;t have suicidal thoughts. I wanted to tell her so bad. So months passed and I was about done with my life. I knew that hardly anyone cared about me, so I took a dozen sleeping pills, to kill my self. I threw them up, because I was scared, I was too scared to die. I told my one close friend, I&#39;ll call him Greg for the comments. Greg laughed when I told him that, and I felt betrayed. And that&#39;s when I truly knew nobody loved me. I decided to tell the girl that I was going to kill myself. I texted her and she seemed  shocked! Me the happy kid, with such a positive outlook on life was going to kill myself. I don&#39;t exactly fit the emo stereotype of a depressed person. She begged me not to do anything, so I didn&#39;t. I missed my dad a lot, he seemed like he loved me, but then he left. But then she thanked me for telling her this, and that she never thought I felt this way, and she was glad I told her. Well eventually I asked her out. A guy like me never deserved a girl like her. And then I met another friend. He was a nice, nerdy boy. We became new best friends, and I was in a great relationship with my gf too. Well he told me that he had depression. So I let him meet my girlfriend so they could be friends. Well they sure became friends. And apparently they were hanging out behind my back. Like, excuse me you wouldn&#39;t even know each other without me. Well one day my girlfriend told me that she was in love with my friend. And then she left me for him, and they are living a happy life. In a way I should feel glad, I made them happy. This made me very suicidal again, so I texted a suicide hotline. The person on their didn&#39;t seem to care at all what I was saying, and they terminated the text before I was even done. So here I am, listening to this song, just trying to keep myself alive. Anyone else got a story?

Stop being so hard on yourself, do not ever feel ashamed to seek for help from an individual, whether it be friend, parent, counselor, pastor, teacher, or whoever. The truth is, alot of people feel exactly the same way you do, but are living with it all hidden trying to pretend it is not there. Do not fall for negative thoughts, this is part of the lack of serotonin in the brain, it is not real. For instance, if you have doubts that someone may not love you, remind yourself that the reason your mind is thinking this way is probably due to a chemical inbalance, and don&#39;t take it at face value. No matter what, where, or who you are, it is never too late to live a happy life, and things WILL get better, even if it seems bleak at the moment. You may not see the hope right now, but that is again a negative thought due to a chemical inbalance, and most likely, if you talked to someone about what you are going through, they might even open up a dialogue themself so that maybe you can help them, and in turn, help each other. Every life matters, and you are special and loved by your Creator, and He will guide you if you put your faith in Him!

Now I am sick (cold) and stop the treatment.<br><br>My wife much more serious than me, she cant recognise it, and alot of things in her mind not true. Last year end of march was such as the evil came to my home, she lost control, her face and hairs as the gost in the movie, she yelling, crying, hate our friends and my family, wanted to killed our friends, and asked me to suicide with her, That was the seriouslly time I and her had passed through. Ofcourse I had took her to the doctor and also chinese herb doctor too, everythings were useless and later she refused to see them and stop to see them. I had no choice so I had to solved the problems by myself, she only believed in me, everything in me. In june last year I gave her try over 20 different herbs, compare to before I can say  better, but still very bad bad bad!!!!! In summer I stop all the treatment and summarize the herbs I used and before chinese doctor gave. In this year also end of march I gave Ginseng, donkey-hide gelatin, turmeric, Zhigancao (\u4eba\u53c3\uff0c\u963f\u80f6\uff0c\u8591\u9ec3\uff0c\u7099\u7518\u8349) for two weeks and stop, and few times in june, and twice in July, Now she much much better, she strong, last week she passed the citizenship test in around ten minute times.

She still refused she heve depression, and in her mind still have some things not true but not that series, still refuse the friend (still hate), accept my family now but still have thing in her mind, the most important are she can control herself, she enjoy music, enjoy funny videos and big laugh.

I&#39;ve had good days, I&#39;ve had bad days, and I&#39;ve defiantly had much worse days.\u00a0I have been suicidal before, twice actually. But even though I&#39;m not suicidal anymore, I still have really bad days where I just don&#39;t want to get up I the morning, where I don&#39;t want to eat, where I don&#39;t want to talk to anyone. <br><br><br>I lost a lot of my innocence at a very young age which is how I developed depression at only 12 years old. I&#39;m only 14. And there&#39;s a guy who I had dated (I know it&#39;s really young to date but I was young and stupid, it&#39;s part of the story just go with it) and he manipulated me, made me feel safe then would do a 180 and just make me feel like shit. But because I was so young, I kept falling for his &quot;safe act&quot; over and over again because I didn&#39;t know what to do and after a while I felt trapped because I eventually figured out that he was playing with me and I just didn&#39;t know what to do anymore. When this guy found out I was depressed and cutting (this was 7th grade, when it started and we weren&#39;t dating at the time) he gave me advise on how to cut,\u00a0 how to hide it. I thought that was it. Nope. He found out\u00a0 was suicidal and gave me advise on how to kill myself. From his advise, I&#39;ve attempted suicide 8 times. <br><br>As I said before, I&#39;m not suicidal anymore, I&#39;ve over come that part of my life nd I can control it a bit more, if that makes any sense??? Not gonna lie, there were a few times where certain situations pushed me over the edge, I wasn&#39;t suicidal but I sure did end up cutting a lot and I don&#39;t know if anyone else out there with depression has ever felt like this\u00a0 but I was legitimately alone because I knew I needed help, I knew I needed to stop cutting but I felt like I would just end up back at\u00a0another therapist and\u00a0 my experience\u00a0with\u00a0therapists aren&#39;t the greatest so I forced myself to get through it myself. I had cut so much that my body like lived for that adrenaline of being cut, kinda like your body craves nicotine when you smoke? I guess I was, or at least my body was, addicted to cutting in a sense? So when I forced myself to stop cutting I started having a lot of panic attacks to the point where I could barely breathe because I wanted to cut so bad. And what made it worse is that I told my boyfriend (at the time) everything about my cutting issue and that my body was kinda craving it again and he ended up breaking up with me while I was having one of those kinda panic attacks where I was coughing and barely breathing (my parents weren&#39;t home at the time or they were sleeping, I can&#39;t remember) and when he broke up with me, I was at such a venerable point and I was so fragile, I guess, that I completely los tit and stopped fighting and (I was in the kitchen) I just stood up form my seat and just pulled out one of our sharpest knives and cut. Not a whole bunch but only a couple times. I of course cleaned the knife and my arm and bandaged my arm and I just went to my room and cried.<br><br>But, even though there&#39;s a LOT more I didn&#39;t share with all of you, you know I haven&#39;t had the best time the past few years and it sucks that I&#39;m only 14. Y&#39;know, I&#39;m suppose to be this kid in high school having fun with my friends, playing soccer, going\u00a0 plays, cheering on my friends at their games and such. I mean, I&#39;m going into 10th grade in the fall! But even though I&#39;m not that child that loves the world and is happy 24/7, my depression doesn&#39;t hold me back, not anymore. That&#39;s why this year is going to be different. Yes I will still have those bad days and maybe a few of those worse days but they won&#39;t last forever. And now that I&#39;ve over come that &quot;cutting addiction&quot; Twice actually, and the fact I did it by my self? I feel that&#39;s amazing and that even though I have 42 (maybe 43 idk) scars from cutting, and even though I can remember every moment that caused those scars, it just gives me a reason to keep fighting and I want to be a therapist when I grow up so I can help others get through what I&#39;ve been though, or possibly even worse than what I&#39;ve been though. <br><br>Pleas, if you&#39;ve read this far, first thank you for reading I know this was long, and secondly, if you&#39;re dealing with depression, anxiety, anything, really. Know that things get better. That may not mean shit to you or it&#39;ll mean the world to you, I don&#39;t know. I know I didn&#39;t believe it wen people said It&#39;ll get better so I don&#39;t blame you. But I&#39;m 14 and obviously you&#39;ve read through a few of the worst things that have happened since I became depressed. But just look at me! I&#39;m okay. I&#39;m not great, I&#39;m not fantastic, but I&#39;m okay and I can say I&#39;m okay and mean it for once. So please, if you&#39;re still reading, I hope you realize that even though I have no idea what your situation is or what you&#39;re going through, if you just keep fighting and hold on even when things look or seem horrible, you can get through them. You can do this. Just because I don&#39;t know you, doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t believe in you. I believe in you. You can do this. You can fight this. You can be okay. Just hold on. I promise. It will be better.

It&#39;s like every thing keeps getting worst for me, around here, I also think about my Sexuality a lot I don&#39;t know what I want, in life, &quot;where do you see yourself in 5 years&quot;...here? But he (my doctor) did mention something about Sexuality using codes like &quot;it doesn&#39;t have to be that way&quot; I don&#39;t know Tf You know even at my new school people call me by my last name instead of my first :/ I really love listening to music, He asked what makes me happy I told him listening to music, food (I don&#39;t eat enough tho), sleeping... That&#39;s all I ever do, I&#39;m 18, female, 134lbs and 5&quot;8. Anyways, What makes you happy? You know music and sleep helps me to kinda ion&#39; know....escape reality I sometimes imagine that I&#39;m not me, Instead I&#39;m someone who has it all figured out. Someone that&#39;s happy, someone that loves, someone that&#39;s loved. I want a kitten. I enjoy texting my past high school friend lol my only friend she lives so far away and is often so busy but she&#39;ll text me when she can, it&#39;s good to know I have at least one person out there to talk to every once in a while. I love hearing my grandmother&#39;s voice as well so sweet, reminds me of when things were easier. She&#39;s coming along good btw (she did a major surgery) She&#39;s in a wheelchair tho They don&#39;t want her walking too much, she too lives so far away I haven&#39;t seen her in a couple years she raised me when I was I was little then she left just like everything else that I loved left me. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m in everyone&#39;s way, like things would be better without me because of that I think about suicide a lot, like I only cause pain, stress and disappointment into this family, I tried once but I&#39;m here so....I really don&#39;t have a purpose and I&#39;m not good at anything, there&#39;s nothing special about me at all, nope :/ Why am I here? I contribute nothing to this world. So what&#39;s the point. I  love reading stories as well, that helps me to escape reality too, Just get lost in it and imagine myself being in that story, as one of the main characters, It&#39;s funny because I&#39;m never a &quot;main&quot; in anything. I don&#39;t care about anything at all, I don&#39;t have anything to fight for to carry on for, anything to push forward for so what&#39;s the point, of life, of my life. I used to believe in Jesus. I went to church for many years with my grandmother when I was younger, after I realized it was nonsense, please its a spirit that no one has ever encountered before that&#39;s supposedly going to burn his kids alive for breaking his rules, a holy book that has been rewritten so many times in history and was once filled with rules for black slaves....I&#39;ll pass plus Christians are supposed to be \u201cgood&quot; people but they&#39;re really not, they&#39;re so hateful, well some of them (most that I have encountered) are racist, homophobic, hypocritical and sexist like Wtf if that&#39;s what your God stands for I&#39;ll definitely pass. Jesus is a fairytale but I understand why people like believing in him and continue to hold on and have \u201cfaith&quot;. He gives people something to look forward to, hope. No one really 100% knows where we came from or where we&#39;re going believing in an after life in heaven gives people something more to look forward to than simply knowing everyone they&#39;ve ever known and loved is just going to die, get covered in a lot dirt, forever. So that&#39;s good for people to keep them...I guess happy and hopeful. I used to call myself atheist but I now tell people that I&#39;m agnostic. Agnostic - a person who claims neither faith nor disbelief in a God. That makes people less \u201ctriggered&quot;. I was diagnosed with bipolar depression in the 9th grade, it&#39;s not something that will pass, it won&#39;t get &quot;better&quot; stop telling me that, nothing helping, there&#39;s nothing.

The mind is described to work normally only when coinciding with a person\u2019s divine given conscience. The conscience is described  by the Holy Fathers of the Greek Orthodox Church to be Christ centered and to also  be ~the mind of our minds~. In [Romans <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOK1tKFFIQI&amp;t=2m14s\">2:14</a>]  we are informed that the conscience will be the law by which each and every person is going to be judged at His Second Coming who never in their lives got to know the commandments and WILL of God as to the Salvation of man!  [Romans <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOK1tKFFIQI&amp;t=2m14s\">2:14</a>] \u201cFor when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves\u201d.<br>Violating the conscience on a frequent basis knowingly or unknowingly will eventually cause a chemical reaction to the brain (because of un natural conditions present) known to psychiatry as depression that is usually balanced out with psychiatric medicine. The conditions however that bring on the illness of the brain (unbalance) do not spring from the mind they are given birth to by the heart. [Matthew 15-19] \u201cFOR OUT OF THE HEART PROCEED EVIL THOUGHTS MURDERS ADULTERIES FORNICATIONS THEFTS FALSE WITNESS BLASPHEMIES\u201d Furthermore vainglory, ego, envy, hatred, lustiness stinginess and greed are equally strong passions that siege the heart (self-will) and force the mind (body) in the un natural act of sin. The illnesses of the heart (as described in Mathew <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOK1tKFFIQI&amp;t=15m19s\">15:19</a>) are known as passions.  Passions not only hamper the normal functioning of the mind by captivating it they also deny it to work naturally and they can eventually cause a chemical un balance.   A <del>Passion</del> according to Saint John of the Ladder (the book the ladder of Virtues 6th century), is a <del>mischievous thought</del> that becomes nested in the soul (heart) that becomes a routine (habit) over a period of time, making the soul to be attracted to it, in a manner where the soul runs to it willingly (on her own accord) and not by enforcement. The ill begotten soul/mind willingly down falls to the somatic act of sin. According to Saint Nicodimos, mischievous thought are the \u201cwords of demons (remember it was only but words spoken in Paradise) and the forerunners of passions\u201d. Allow me Marie to point out with brotherly love and respect that in the absence of the therapy of the heart/soul as prescribed by the Apostles 2000 years ago psychiatric illness is just waiting to re appear when conditions are right. It is like extinguishing the fire and leaving the coals to be burning!

I&#39;m constantly tired and I&#39;m never motivated. Most of my days are spent in school, but when I get home, I lay in my bed and think about my shitty life. About a year before, my family and friends meant everything to me. Now I can&#39;t care about anything. All of my grades are in the 40&#39;s, yet I can&#39;t bring myself to care or try. People say I&#39;m smart, but I feel extremely stupid. Sometimes, I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. I have begun to get very distant from my family and friends and I don&#39;t know why. I don&#39;t cut or harm myself in anyway. Sure, I have my days where I&#39;m productive and my days actually go good, but that usually means that the day after is gonna be 10 times worse. Sometimes, I wonder if I should just disappear for a while and learn more about the importance of life, because I can&#39;t see the importance in mine. I have made so many mistakes that I wouldn&#39;t tell god if he already didn&#39;t know. I feel like I can&#39;t trust myself anymore. I can never think of a future for me, whether it be YouTube, McDonald&#39;s, or working at a professional business. Everyday, I wonder if my family and friends would care if I commuted suicide. I have become a dull and nonchalant person and I barely eat. The only thing I use to cope with is my phone and my PS4. I know this is a really selfish reason, but the only reason I haven&#39;t killed myself is because I&#39;m afraid of going to hell. Although I used to be a energetic, active, kind boy, I&#39;ve turned into a lazy, selfish person and I hate myself for it. I always feel like no one really likes me and just have me around so they won&#39;t hurt my feelings.

Heck let\u2019s just say it has been a very stressful, emotional and difficult life thus far.. <br>I suffer from many things like depression, anxiety, ocd, insecurities and a desperate need to find a purpose in life that will consume me and revive me and bring back all the positive emotions I have not truly felt since I was 12 years old. <br>It has gotten so bad that this past week I almost quit my job; packed up all my things, and was was about to head out and leave everything I know behind.  <br>This may come as a shock to a lot of people.  Is this the same cheerful mailman we see walking around town never without smile on his face? The same guy that is friendly and outgoing to every person he has the pleasure of bumping into? The same kid the posts goofy FB statuses about cookies and Netflix and nothing ever all that deep or meaningful?<br>You have seen what I have chosen to show you.  <br>I chose to never show any of my weaknesses publicly and privately because of my ego.  <br>I wanted people to believe that I am a successful, happy go lucky 21 year old mailman living the American Dream. The majority of this has been a lie.<br>We live in an age fueled by deceit.  My generation (including myself)  post pictures on social media of happy selfies, group photos living it up at college, and cool events we are attending. But what you don\u2019t see is a broke college student crying on the phone to their mom 5 times a day. You don\u2019t see the hours and hours of hard work put in and the stress of which can really take a toll on a person&#39;s physical and emotional well being. This is just one example of many people who are muddling through their lives but you would never know it. Nobody likes to show weakness. It\u2019s awkward and it\u2019s ugly and easier to hide and ignore than to share.<br>But judging by all the self-deprecating memes and dark humor posts that are shared around social media so many people feel this way.<br>And with tools like social media that could be used to reach out, connect, relate, help, heal, and understand people across the word (which was not available but 20 years ago) instead we choose to use it for vanity and ego and hide important parts of ourselves.<br>With all that being said, I have decided to do something kind of scary.<br>I have changed my instagram account to @RealMaxMartin.<br>Starting today the lies end.<br>I will be using this account to share my personal feelings, struggles, battles, and anything else I feel could be beneficial if someone like minded could see and walk away even the tiniest bit comforted and understood. <br>I will start slow with small issues and gradually delve deeper into who I am -as to not overwhelm anybody or myself, but the goal will be to post at least once a day.<br>Not all of it will be pretty. It will be awkward and ugly and uncomfortable and you may think \u201cwhy would he share this for everyone to see?\u201d<br>At this point I do not care.<br>So many people including myself are struggling. <br>And we only sink deeper when seeing other people succeeding thinking \u201cwhy is it so hard for me?\u201d \u201cwhy can\u2019t I be like that\u201d \u201cwhat am I doing wrong\u201d \u201cis no one else feeling this way?\u201d \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d \u201cwill i ever be okay?\u201d<br>Little do we realize so much of what we \u201csee\u201d is so far from the whole truth. <br>So if you would like to embark on this adventure with me please go follow @RealMaxMartin on instagram.

Say there is an exam that you have to study for and you are becoming increasingly stressed about it, based on what this video stated, stress can cause the Hippocampus to reduce, thus reducing memory recall efficency. The inability to recall information correctly could then further increase stress and so the spiral continues and before long the effect of what has happened could potentially reduce you into a state of depression. So my question is this: If you were to use a safe amount of these serotonin increasers, on both healthy and depressed individuals, would it allow your hippocampus to maintain/improve its state and thus allow more efficient recall of information. I&#39;m very intrigued to know if somebody can help answer my question. <br><br>p.s.

However, I remember being able to recall and feel past bad memories with extreme clarity and detail. I&#39;m still pretty good with that, but not as much now that I&#39;ve somewhat recovered.So, it seems to me that during the &quot;depression&quot;, the hippocampus grew, which makes no sense and completely contradicts this video. So, it makes me wonder what I actually had? Obviously self diagnosis isn&#39;t very accurate, so any ideas on what I was really suffering? Was it actually depression? Why did I seem to have more accurate abilities that are associated with the hippocampus?", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T05:45:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kai", "comment_text": "I&#39;m happy a girl I like hugged me and said she liked me today and even better I had almost given up on trying to get her", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T04:35:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Montreal Plane Spotter", "comment_text": "In school no one want to be my friend everyone call me small nerd i think i want to kill me \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude2d", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T00:29:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Centrist Philosopher", "comment_text": "I am taking Sirtraline which is supposed to increase Siratonin levels.", "comment_date": "2016-09-09T17:56:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LearnEnglishESL", "comment_text": "Clinical depression is beyond sadness or feeling down.

My parents will do nothing about it because they only see the good side of my brother, and say that it was my fault, not my brothers. And then for the past year my whole life turned upside down. I started school and all my friends were not in my class so I was left alone. And it seems when you&#39;re sad, that&#39;s when all the kids start teasing you. The only good side to the past year was my elderly cat. She was sweet and stayed by my side when I came home, all my best memories with her was at the end of each day, when everyone in my family was asleep, me and my cat would sit beside each other, in my room, while I read. This is where I got my love for books. As I suffered through the year, summer was finally 3 days away. I was really happy and excited to be able to finally get away from the kids at school, and when I came home My elderly cat greeted me. I was cheerful that day and I put my necklace I was wearing around my cats neck, It was a stream of fabric that held a star charm that changed colors as it was moved around. I left my cat with the necklace once I was done petting her and went into my room not realizing that would be the last time I would ever see her again. I was on my bed, with my laptop, when my dad came in my room, and gave me the worst news of my life. Someone ran over, and killed my cat. At first I thought it was a joke, I mean who would kill my Sushka? But I soon found out that it was not a joke, my beloved cat was with the stars. I stood there, watering the ground with my tears as my family digged a hole in the forest next to the lake, and put the box that held my Sushka (Sushka was my cat&#39;s name) into the ground. When I came back home from Sushkas funeral, I never knew such grief. The last few days of school were absolute torture. I lost the will to stand up to my teasing classmates and I was pushed around, insults being thrown at me left and right as my classmates took advantage of my grief. My mother then realized that the necklace Sushka was wearing was mine and gave it back to me. That necklace is very dear to me. I wanted to wear it all the time but as I learned through my life, I can&#39;t be trusted with jewelry or i&#39;ll somehow break it. So I have kept it in a small box next to my bed. Now I am in 6th grade, my summer is over and I have already experienced the first day of school. It was terrible and I don&#39;t want to experience another day, so I skipped school on the second day, which is today. My brother found out I missed school and contacted both my parents ignoring my pleading to stop and not tell them. Now I am counting down the seconds until my wicked mother thinks of a punishment for me. I haven&#39;t shared my depression story with anyone and it feels good to get it of my chest before my mother takes away my electronics for who knows how long. <b>Sigh</b>", "comment_date": "2016-09-09T00:01:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jay bee", "comment_text": "a terrible illness ):", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T19:22:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sour Pickle", "comment_text": "Can men be depressed?", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T17:59:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "asem al balawe", "comment_text": "i don&#39;t wanna kill my self or anything like that ... i just feel like shit most of the time can&#39;t sleep right ,i eat a lot more than usually  , i pretend im interested in front of ppl all the time and I&#39;m not ... but usually it&#39;s not that bad during summer cuz no college \ud83d\udc4d but still .. i don&#39;t know if its depression or not", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T04:41:17Z", "likes_count": 25}, {"comment_by": "Kamil", "comment_text": "Neurons do not grow my friend.", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T01:51:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nada Mehelba18", "comment_text": "depression is when your family tells you that they are not proud of you and they donot need u anymore\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22", "comment_date": "2016-09-07T22:59:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "massie x", "comment_text": "My dad has depression.....", "comment_date": "2016-09-07T07:51:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hack this account if you can ;-D", "comment_text": "hey, my boy depression how you&#39;doin", "comment_date": "2016-09-06T23:07:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Edson Iseme", "comment_text": "I&#39;m very depressed to the point that i just want to take my life &amp; be done with it", "comment_date": "2016-09-05T00:16:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shaun Weston", "comment_text": "You can download it free, not for free.", "comment_date": "2016-09-04T17:36:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexa Swass", "comment_text": "Lol now everyone is depressed..Yo just because you&#39;re depressed doesn&#39;t make you special. nor intelligent. real depressed people don&#39;t talk about their depression.

But I believe this video takes away that depression and other mood disorders are all about how people react and deal with things - if bad things happen you will probably feel bad about it - the proper term is resilience, meaning how well you deal with things and a range of things can improve or remove this ability. It is worth noting that the use of chemicals (drugs/medications) can be a double edged sword when dealing with depression and anxiety, and should only be used as a last resort and with other therapies under regular monitoring from a professional to prevent dependence.<br><br>Another interesting point is that serotonin is not the only neurotransmitter involved; I myself was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety nearly 10 years ago and doctors keep trying to prescribe me SSRIs and tricyclics (types of medications for depression), however I have found that when I am at my worst (uncontrollable crying, palpitations, muscle tension, ect.) very dark chocolate eases my symptoms massively and doesn&#39;t come with the scary insert of prescribed depression medications - if anyone else wants to try it out, speak to your doctor before stopping any medications as they can have some nasty withdrawal effects, also I use chocolate that is at least 75% cocoa, anything less doesn&#39;t have the same effect and higher fat and sugar content can cause other health issues.

We know that this is a very complex condition that can vary greatly in every affected person, but it\u00b4s still very hard to believe that there aren\u00b4t better options out there. There ARE many options, but most of them turn out to be useless in many cases, the severe cases. <br>In my case, 7 years ago everything went out of control, and since then, nothing was even remotely like it was before the outbreak of this horrible disease. An eating disorder, anxiety and perceptual problems evolved over time, everything I see is blurred, instead of a tree, for example, I see a tree and its shifted contours, so it seems like there\u00b4s the same tree again in another one. <br>Got put on antidepressants, antipsychotics, was in a mental hospital, went to several doctors, nothing helped. Might sound familiar to quite a few people out there. After many years you start to realize that the world with its treatment options cannot (or doesn\u00b4t want to) help you, so you\u00b4re left with two options: keep on living a life in agony while over the years the symptoms become worse and still doing the best you can, trying to look after yourself (healthy eating, exercise, positive thinking, expressing yourself through art etc., all the stuff they tell you might be helpful), but all those things can be, once a certain severe stage is reached, only a little bit helpful, if anything. <br>Suffer long enough and you\u00b4ll start to think that this is never going to change, at the same time you feel: something that feels SO MUCH abnormal must have a specific cause. Still alive after 7 years (although it doesn\u00b4t feel anywhere near like being alive), you\u00b4re left with guesswork, reading about biochemistry and brain chemistry. You order supplements, in search of THE REAL CAUSE. Is this merely unrealistic wishful thinking? Maybe, but what can you do if no one but yourself does anything to improve your miserable existence. People say it so often that it sounds like a clich\u00e9: The only one who can help yourself is you. Many of us would be dead already if we\u00b4d have solely relied on doctors, and when it comes down to it, you\u00b4re left alone with something no one should be ever left alone with, helplessly left to your cruel fate. <br>Still, we are unbelievably strong and suffer, despite everyone around us being able to really live instead of JUST SURVIVING. <br>Respect to all of you who hang in there, I know what it\u00b4s like, every day we stay on this earth is a huge personal accomplishment, an accomplishment that only you and fellow sufferers can see, whereas the vast majority of people will never know what it\u00b4s like and how hard it can get.

I gave up all the drugs I was taking in February, but became an alcoholic again in March, and I&#39;ve been drinking heavily ever since, but I&#39;m about to drink my last beer, because I need to quit for my health and because I hate the embarrassment caused by going into a shop on a Monday morning to buy beer and also because on the medication box it says not to drink alcohol when taking the pills.. I hope the pills/therapy help me and I&#39;m going to start exercising every day and eating a lot of fruit and watching motivational videos in the hope that it helps me get better, I&#39;m also starting to socialise a bit now, and hopefully I can get some new friends.. The last 8 years have been really terrible for me, I&#39;ve just been trying to cope as opposed to enjoying my life....

I sincerely hope that I&#39;m able to get better and start enjoying life and doing cool things like perhaps trying to become a successful artist soon, even though my chances of success are very small, but yeah, I have nothing to lose, and potentially everything to gain.. so starting today I&#39;m going to make every effort possible to improve the quality of my life, and if I fail and nothing improves, and I just continue to suffer for every second of every minute of every hour of every day of every week of every month of every year, then I guess its time to give up....

This leads to emotional disharmony and bodily imprisonment. If you find yourself in a state of depression, embrace it. Avoid retreating to all forms of pacification. Release your pain in the form of tears and writhing expression. After anguish has been exhausted, the best form of attack for the soul is to be aware of darkness, stillness and silence in order to detach from all forms of identity and perception. Something that is made of nothing cannot be assailed. You have now obtained the true art of peace. This technique allows you to see your true Self within the womb of universal consciousness. When your true origin and reflection are revealed to you, forge the solar gem with the wheels of law that are driven by the sword of desire, to give birth to liberation. The God of Veils generates worldly perceptions for your observation to diminish the will power that flows from the seed of awareness. You must disregard all observations to access your core consciousness and awareness. Once your core is accessed, reassert the will power into the creator of veils true form to give birth to the primal seed. This is your true Reflection and Purpose for being, like the Apple Tree that rises from the earth seed of the root chakra to produce the evolutionary seed with out-stretched arms under the guidance of a nurturing Sun within the mind&#39;s eye.

I believe that aside from getting professional help and possibly medication, there are  two main things you need to focus on to feel fulfilled and to help you rise out of depression or overcome anxiety.  It may not be the same for everyone, but focusing on the following two things has really helped me:<br><br>You have to know, not think, but know; that you are able to have a positive impact on the world.  You need to create or work on something that could either help or inspire other people.  Never underestimate the influence that a kind or productive action can have as any inspiration or help you can provide has a ripple effect.  This ripple effect is that anyone who knows about the work you are doing will feel encouraged to help a cause that they feel passionately about.  Some examples could range from simply helping fix a fence in someone&#39;s garden, or volunteering at a homeless shelter, creating inspirational music or videos, or going  on a volunteer trip abroad to do some relief work.   <br><br>The second thing is to venture into new places that provide new experiences.  The world is vast and is filled with staggeringly beautiful landscapes and cities, and I believe a natural high is experienced  when exploring them.  I believe that another main cause of <br>depression is when life becomes too familiar, and the same routine is experienced for too long.  Venturing into the unknown and unfamiliar enables you to have more vibrant experiences and makes it easier to enjoy the present moment, as you are appreciating and absorbing what you see around you.  It will also give you greater confidence in your <br>ability to organize and take care of yourself.  You can start off by simply getting the bus or the train to somewhere near your local town that you&#39;ve never been to before, exploring the area, perhaps taking a few photos, and then travelling back home again.  If you do want to travel abroad, the best way to start is to gather as much information as you can about different and affordable ways to travel, make a plan, and then go for it.<br><br>In my view depression is caused by your genetics, your past experiences, accepting thoughts as fact when they may not be true and acting on these negative assumptions.  I believe that getting an expensive car, or house or having a high paying job will only make you happy temporarily, as these are material things that although provide you with security, will not provide you with long lasting fulfillment.  <br><br>On a side note, there is a user called Vagabondsteve who has uploaded lots of videos where he gives advice, and while I don&#39;t agree with everything he says, most of the videos have been an extraordinary help to me, so I would strongly recommend trying out his channel.<br><br>Making the purpose of your life to help or inspire people in need in anyway you can, whilst exploring all the beauty the world has to offer, is in my view a very fulfilling way to live.", "comment_date": "2016-01-17T22:11:27Z", "likes_count": 56}, {"comment_by": "Iitathebomber", "comment_text": "sigh", "comment_date": "2016-01-17T20:20:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Good old days", "comment_text": "I&#39;m depressed and I&#39;m wondering does anyone know how to deal with depression", "comment_date": "2016-01-17T19:29:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nikhil Jagga", "comment_text": "Can you add to this video with a cognitive behavioral therapy view?", "comment_date": "2016-01-17T07:13:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "abc", "comment_text": "Please please make one on anxiety, OCD or PTSD. \ud83d\ude0d love it.

It all stemmed from elementary school. I always used to get good grades and would ace my tests. Later on in the year, I was classified as a gifted student which is similar to AP courses in high school. But because of this, i had a lot more pressure to be perfect. Teachers often expect even more of me, almost always perfect. I never thought that the gifted program was for me. I just felt that i wasn&#39;t as smart as they thought I was. All this pressure made a giant impact on my life. Because I was young, I just thought that this was normal, even though it caused a lot of stress. I started to be very harsh with myself. In everything. Grades, looks, personality; I didn&#39;t have to be better than everyone, just up to my own standards. I was always a little shy, but this made it ten times worse. Just getting a question wrong in class would stick with me for the entire month. Sometimes even the entire school year. I could never stop thinking about it. I didn&#39;t like presentations, answering the door/phone, or even asking an employee for help at the supermarket. When ever i saw in myself in the mirror, I hated it. Not just the appearance, but my personality. I was afraid of failure. In my head I knew that at the end of the day, other&#39;s people&#39;s opinions didn&#39;t matter, but I couldn&#39;t stop caring about it. So one day, I decided to tell my mom. she was supportive, but she didn&#39;t quite understand. She said &quot;maybe it&#39;s just a phase&quot; and to be honest I really wanted to believe it too. So I did. I ignored it for a while, and thought that everything was okay. But one day in class, they were taking a class photo. The teacher asked me to come over but I said no. I really hated pictures of myself because I hated myself. The teacher then said, &quot;C&#39;mon, don&#39;t be &#39;that person&#39;&#39;. I don&#39;t know what it was, but all my thoughts came rushing to my head. &#39;That person&#39;? I&#39;m SORRY that i hate myself and that I am afraid of failure, and that I don&#39;t know what to do about it. While I was thinking this, I suddenly burst out crying. The fact that I started crying made it even worse. I was so embarrassed. My friend who I talked to about my situation, took me outside to calm down. when I came back inside, the teacher asked me if there was anything that he needed to know. I simply said &quot;No&quot; and out my head down on the desk. I wanted to go home home and forget bout everything. I did forgive him because he didn&#39;t mean it like that and he didn&#39;t know about my anxiety. That comment still stayed with me for the rest of the year though. The only thing i found peace in was video games and anime. They made me feel like I could do anything. They were my escape from reality. The only thing I was missing was a friend. Someone I could tell everything to. I&#39;m kind of a loner and because i was afraid, I convinced myself that I was better alone. But now I realize that \u00a0need someone. That was this year, in grade 7 and next year I will be in Grade 8 and moving to a new school.

I was never really happy growing up because I was bullied at home and turned to food as comfort. At the age of 11 I started gaining weight and then started getting bullied at school too. At 12 I changed schools and no longer was with my best friend.. Basically my only real friend. In that school I was bullied even more. Excluded out of the nearby park. Called a lesbian. Pushed out of swings. People threw big mistake erasers at me. Never had partners for projects. There was a rumor I talked to dead people. During the 8th grade field trip everyone had a group to sleep with and for 8 hours my teacher asked each group if I could room with them and I got placed in a group of mean girls that pranked me and tourmented me the entire trip.

I hate myself and I just feel like there is this constant war inside my head but then I feel like nothing is happening at the same exact time.

No matter how hard you yell, cry or stomp around, he/she is just going to keep bothering you. He&#39;ll bother you when you do your homework, when you are trying to relax, when you&#39;re trying to have fun, whatever. The only way for this kid to stop pestering you is to stop letting him/her pester you. Because all and all, he or she is still your little brother/sister, and you love him/her (deep down).<br>You have depression. This is a part of your life that you must accept, like the annoying little brother/sister, instead of fight. The more you learn to be patient with yourself and your emotions, the easier it will be to cope. The fact of the matter is that depression is something that happens to you- and it probably will for a long time! Depression, no matter how fucking terrible it is, makes you, you. And you&#39;re pretty cool, so that&#39;s important.<br>So don&#39;t fight it. Don&#39;t shove it away. Don&#39;t hide it. The more the stuff it down, the harder it will fight to come back up. Accept it, feel your feelings, and (as goofy as this is going to sound, this is the most important part of what I&#39;m going to say) love yourself for doing so. Because you&#39;re you, and you&#39;re never going to be anyone else but you, so you may as well learn to love even the bad parts of yourself. Embrace your sadness like a child who is scared, not like a evil monster who you&#39;re trying to kill.<br>This all takes practice. DEFINITELY. But it helped me a lot.

Anyway, enjoy lads and ladies!<br><br>You know what I hate about depression? People never understand. Depression can be a completely subjective matter because of how creative and thoughtful we can be. For me, I started feeling depressed for no reason. I&#39;m not talking about &quot;having a bad day&quot;, I mean grieving like someone just died (I have no experience of someone dying and I wish I never do, with exceptions of Jimmy Saville, Josef Fritzl and people like them). I used to have mental breakdowns at night (for me, they were just thinking about what made me depressed to the point it overwhelmed me and I cried), but then I started doing it for the buzz (yes, believe it or not but mentally breaking down at night makes you feel better the day after, at least it did for me, it&#39;s a good way to vent your feelings but don&#39;t do it for too long otherwise the elation the next day will start to gradually shorten until it&#39;s ineffective, in fact: <b>Don&#39;t try it at all, it may be healthier than cutting but it&#39;s a bad addiction</b>). But at the time I really didn&#39;t have a reason, just grieving on a daily basis for no reason. So, what did I do? One of the worst things ever (not cutting, I may be depressed but I have never deliberately cut myself unless there is a good enough reason like extortion). I remembered this conversation that my <b>severely</b> (he really fucking was!) friend had with another friend. He said &quot;None of this might not even be real, it could all be a dream.&quot; Now you&#39;re probably thinking, &quot;How does that make someone depressed?&quot;. Well, my mind basically needed something to blame, and here it was. It instantly latched onto the memory, expanding it out, all the sadistic and immoral possibilities filling my head. It was horrible. I set myself up with the worst possible reason to be depressed. I was against morality. I thought it was the religion that nobody thought about. The fact that it isn&#39;t real, look around you, what do you see? Walls, radiators, sofas, tables, warmth, love. It all implies meaning, but we have none. I couldn&#39;t help but think that genesis was an accident, the big bang was probably a mistake. Everything is so meaningless, it doesn&#39;t matter anymore. People keep saying how religion and science were complete opposites, but morality was the real deal. How do we live meaningful lives whist we have science screaming in our faces how much of a mistake we are and how we&#39;ll be lost and forgotten when dead? Why do we live knowing this, this futile journey that might now even be real, everything you&#39;re experiencing could be a dream or just plain non-existence? But this wasn&#39;t the only thing, life and death scared my too. Death. A process where everything gets erased and you become non-existent, once again meaningless. How does it feel to not be able to feel? No touch. No smell. No sight. No sound. No taste. To think that without these senses, we wouldn&#39;t actually be what we defined as &quot;being alive&quot;. But don&#39;t get me wrong, I have completely moral problems too, I have no self confidence, I know I&#39;m unattractive bla bla bla. I don&#39;t care about this, it&#39;s a bee sting compared to my lack of morality. However, I thankfully have a bunch of proper lads at physics, I practically said the same thing as I&#39;ve just noted here to them and they listen, and they offer solutions that I can relate to, but most likely won&#39;t work. However, my parents instantly told me to <b>&quot;Stop thinking about it&quot;</b>. The worst possible thing they could say to me, it shows that they didn&#39;t understand. I never felt more alone in my life since the start of Year 10. Anyway, this was after my friend convinced me to tell my parents and see a <b>counselor/psychotherapist</b> (<b>PLEASE DO IF YOU THINK YOU SUFFER FROM A MENTAL ILLNESS LIKE DEPRESSION, BIPOLAR &amp; ESPECIALLY SCHIZOPHRENIA</b>).\u00a0<br><br>Take care lads and ladies, if you have any questions please ask. I hope my story vindicates how subjectivity increases the difficulty of solving depression.<br><br>EDIT: One session my counselor asked a <b>VERY</b> important question. Did I want to actually <del>stop</del> my depression? I still said yes, because I wanted to feel happy whilst being able to think about the same stuff for days (may be weeks, months, years and more) on end. Another important thing about depression: It&#39;s not whether you feel happy or not, it&#39;s your <b>ability</b> to feel happy. I can&#39;t, I just grieve during my downs periods, and if I&#39;m not grieving then I&#39;m empty or annoyed or embarrassed or guilty or anything but happiness.", "comment_date": "2015-01-29T21:57:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cheatmuh", "comment_text": "Very helpfull lol...<br><br>&quot;It feels like I&#39;m trapped inside my head banging against its walls.&quot;<br><br>I think its real.There is a difference between<br>a) I&#39;m not cleaning my teeth today, cause I&#39;m lazy and my gf&#39;s not here<br>b) I&#39;m not cleaning my teeth today, cause its senselless.

I would say the main source of depression obviously is being unhappy with your life, not being where you want to be. Bad relationships, bad job, overweight etc are all causes. And the great thing is people can change those things so they can become happier, but the problem is the vast majority of people give themselves permission to do nothing to improve their life, and make up a bullshit sob story they tell themselves to justify their inaction. They settle for less and don&#39;t chase their dreams and goals. They think it&#39;s too hard and just quit. That&#39;s the problem today, people just quit. An overweight depressed person tells themselves &quot;I was born this way&quot; and this is their story to justify them not exercising at all and not eating properly. We do enable a lot of &quot;depressed&quot; people to bullshit themselves into accepting their sadness. Stand up like a man and fix your life, I think you&#39;ll find your sadness will fade as you take action. You have to participate in your own rescue.

Two abstract concepts such as the natures of disease and misery could never exist together as &quot;depression&quot; in perfect harmony with the reality of the transient world. Yet fools who hold themselves to be gods, misguided in their dogmatic persistence of a perfect scientific truth, believe they hold the authority to lay such a tyrannical judgment on such a wide variety of idiosyncratic miseries through the utilization of a facile explanation.\u00a0\u00a0In reality, all individuals with a diagnosis of depression hold fundamentally different transient mindsets of themselves, their respective spiritualities, and the surrounding world. Since the common belief is that this &quot;disease&quot; supposedly bears a location within the mind, my logical conclusion must be that &quot;depression&quot; is only a subjective concept and not an external truth, as such a vague phenomenon could not be expletive for such variety, just as a higher discrete being is not responsible for all floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes.<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Superficial objective fact gods such as AsapSCIENCE are in part held with such credence due to a misinformed and isolated American public that runs away from the world into the internet-verse of instant gratification.

The agenda should be obvious as the video-producers never acknowledge the existence of contradictory studies to these many theories of &quot;depression.&quot; Additionally, although the opinion presented in this video is that &quot;depression&quot; is treatable with &quot;antidepressants,&quot; several meta-analytic studies produced by Irving Kirsch demonstrate that all psychiatric drugs, including &quot;antidepressants,&quot; used in treating &quot;depression&quot; perform little better than placebo in reducing subjective aspects of &quot;depression,&quot; and furthermore demonstrate the slim disparity between active drugs and placebo is due to an enhanced placebo effect.<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The congregation of masses into cult followings has been ubiquitous throughout the ages. However, with only the recent establishment of the technological Western Sphere, no such cult phenomenon compares in scope to the psychiatric industry&#39;s enslavement of so many innocent minds.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-08-28T05:36:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jada.Mariee", "comment_text": "Do one about anxiety, I have it, I just want to scream cause it&#39;s like a never ending roller coaster...", "comment_date": "2014-08-28T05:34:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bobisaball", "comment_text": "science of gambling or Texas hold em \u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-08-28T04:11:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mikeyr3x !", "comment_text": "Is it just me or did I think they were gonna put rip robin williams at the very end<br>", "comment_date": "2014-08-28T03:21:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "APdaDoN B.F.M.

Plants also breath out water, why cant they just save the water for later to use in photosythesis? And why do animals need to drink water?

The information in you video is clearly biased toward a north American view on psychiatry. In the old world, scientists have a bigger focus on psychological en societal causes for depression and more so for a holistic view that takes in to account biology, social en psychological aspects of the problem. Anyway there are already some problems with calling depression a disease, since there is no clear view on what depression actually is, what it looks like, what the onset is, what the cause is, how it develops and how it is cured. We pretty much have non whatsoever rational motive to call it a disease. Enough emotional and economic reasons though. It being a billion dollar industry and there are real people suffering from this problem.\u00a0And calling it a disease with a focus on\u00a0biological causes is\u00a0definitely not without consequences... It is way better viewed as a broad syndrome\u00a0where different people have different symptoms in a different way, but al clustering in the same broader syndrome. Depression is not a single disease entity, there will never be found a single cause and the will never be a single &#39;one size fits all&#39; cure. This is because depression\u00a0is tied\u00a0to experience and is ultimately always a personal story. And so it is obvious what happens to these people and there story&#39;s\u00a0when we start calling it a disease with a biological cause.<br><br>And then one more thing on the brain study&#39;s...

So he states that it&#39;s real, then asks if it is. The question is whether it&#39;s a literal disease, and whether that 350 million means anything.<br><br>He carries this weird circular reasoning throughout. &quot;When we look at the brain of a depressed person...&quot; He should say when we look at the brain of a person &#39;diagnosed&#39; with depression. The whole point of the video is to see if it is something that can be diagnosed. i.e. a disease. He continues: &quot;The longer a person has been depressed...&quot; again.. aren&#39;t we determining what depression is?? He does same thing when he mentions the study about twins and bipolar &#39;disorder.&#39;<br><br>His conclusion is that depression is a disease with a biological basis. Yeah, it&#39;s biological in that you cannot have a mind without a brain. That&#39;s his retarded reasoning. To the same extent, me being happy, confused, angry, etc. has a biological basis, as does playing an instrument or washing the dishes. What he means to conclude is simply that sadness requires having a brain. He never even defines what a disease is......<br><br>A disease is a physical disorder of the body. It is also &quot;a particular quality, habit, or disposition regarded as adversely affecting a person or group of people.&quot; Under the second definition, the first is taken metaphorically. e.g. &quot;The article cites intolerance as one of the most dangerous of society&#39;s diseases&quot; &quot;He sees crime as a disease that too often plagues the poor and disadvantaged.&quot;<br><br>Depression is not a &#39;real&#39; (literal) disease. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a MENTAL illness, and not a brain disease. A sick mind is like a sick economy. It&#39;s a metaphor.

With that being said, Robin had a lot of demons he battled. That&#39;s not about science that&#39;s more related to the spirit of a man. <br><br>Confessing your sin before a God that forgives and repenting does a lot of GOOD for the soul. The Bible says that the penalty of sin is DEATH. We have seen that manifest in the actions of Robin Williams when he committed suicide. Suicide is an admittance of no hope, a compliment of sins not forgiven, and a guilty conscience. In the Bible, all people who committed suicide harbored great sin in their lives. When Judas committed suicide in the Bible, was that scientific? <br><br>When man is disconnected from God death is the result (suicide,  murder, spiritual death, &amp; ultimate death in hell separated from God).<br><br>Science is at an all time high with an intent of wiping away the concept of guilt. No one can do wrong! It&#39;s not your fault! It&#39;s chemical imbalances. It&#39;s a gene inside of you. Ultimately we end up blameless then turn our fists to God heaping all blame on Him.<br><br>", "comment_date": "2014-08-21T18:39:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lolly Inman", "comment_text": "RIP Robin", "comment_date": "2014-08-21T18:31:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soenderfi", "comment_text": "All the hate om him being gay, what the fuck is wrong with you guys?

It is well documented that exercise stimulates an increased production of various endorphins in the body, which are themselves often related to improved mood. What remains to be seen is whether or not the act of exercise itself (not the effects) plays a major role in effective treatment. The &quot;average man&quot; is a rare thing indeed, in fact it is more common for us to be different from one another in most ways than it is for random members of the population to share many similar characteristics. So the act of exercise itself may affect different people in different ways. Some will respond positively to exercise (many feel as though it helps occupy their mind elsewhere, it gives many a sense of reborn purpose, some enjoy the social and interactive aspects) while others may not feel benefits in the same way (while it may make one &quot;fitter&quot; the increased stress on the body can increase any anxiety already felt, or perhaps an individual ends up putting too much pressure on themselves to &quot;achieve&quot; which only serves to worsen their mood if they fail to meet expectations). <br>As for meditation, once again, we will all respond in varying ways. Often meditation is included in activities such as yoga and other eastern sports/activities. Much of the purpose of these activities is to &quot;be kind to yourself.&quot; The thoughts associated with depression vary from person to person, but many people may feel as though they aren&#39;t good enough or they feel as though they shouldn&#39;t be what they are (this is by no means an exhaustive list of the thoughts of the depressed, please don&#39;t bite my head off!). These activities, focussed mindfulness and respectfullness, often have the idea of self appreciation and inner harmony as one of their core mantras. Not to mention thr promotion of healthy relaxation and reflection, which reduce the stress on an individual among other benefits. <br>Just remember you intrepid YouTube commentors, be kind. The idea of the average man is just that, an idea. The norm is uniqueness. Just remember that one person&#39;s treatment should not be taken as a &quot;one size fits all cure&quot; and also that what many consider to be pseudoscience is effective for another. Depression is a serious illness just like cancer. It dominates the sufferer&#39;s life and, in some sad cases, destroys it. Just as with cancer treatment there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; treatment. Depression affects the sufferers, those that care for them and that they care for and can destroy lives. While there may be no known cure, we can all help in it&#39;s prevention. Living with acceptance could be the start. Just remember, you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on behind a facade.

A. Greene", "comment_text": "I do believe the biological and psychological go hand in hand. For instance, if I want to feel happy, I try to find something that makes me happy, like sports. However, let&#39;s say I play in a game, and I have a bad game. Playing a bad game I may not control, because it&#39;s just simply my body&#39;s inability to perform at a level I want it to perform at. I might have a bad game because I didn&#39;t sleep well the night before, I didn&#39;t eat enough before the game, I went through a breakup, etc. However, I can still either allow that bad game to dictate my mood, such as feeling sad or angry because of my performance, or I can shrug it off my bad game and appreciate the camaraderie and fellowship that I had with the people that I played with. However, if I invested so much emotion into sports, or into a relationship, and it doesn&#39;t turn out well, it would be extremely hard to not become depressed. Just like if a loved one dies, my emotion takes control, and I allow it to take control, because my body wants me to take control.<br><br>I think the issue we have here in our modern society is that we put so much emotional emphasis on too many things. In point: we invest too much emotion on things that we cannot control. We worry so much about winning or losing the game, when we really don&#39;t have that much control over winning. Sure, the better our performance, the more likely we&#39;re going to win, but there&#39;s no simple guarantee of that, and just because I want a relationship to work out so badly, the other person may not want to, or, quite simply, may not have the ability to.<br><br>I think it&#39;s a matter of perspective. There&#39;s always too perspectives, but because of our &quot;flight or fight&quot; reaction to things, if we sense great emotional turmoil by a certain event to happen, we will do our best to prevent it from happening. However, this &quot;fight or flight&quot; was only suppose to be used in emergency situations, but now we have this response almost every day of our lives. In many ways, it&#39;s drawing our emotion thin, therefore, making it harder to &quot;find joy&quot; in everyday things, or, it might do the opposite, where we&#39;re so focused on &quot;finding joy&quot; that once we receive it, we love it, but then have an emotional crash once that joy leaves.<br><br>In a straight up comparison: I believe we get emotional highs or emotional rushes like a sugar rush or a drug high. When we make ourselves emotionally high too much, our biology adapts to this rush, or this high, and begins to get use to it, thus, making it &quot;normal&quot;. However, because now that the &quot;high&quot; is normal, the normal feels &quot;depressed&quot;. It&#39;s the same for someone who is so high all the time, that feeling sober feels weird to them, and for someone who is so &quot;high on life&quot; all the time, feeling normal feels weird to them. And just like someone who&#39;s going through withdraw from a drug, many people who have gone a long time without this &quot;high&quot; might become depressed for weeks, or even months, without end, because their biology is craving that high that it adapted to.<br><br>I feel like we, as a society, allow ourselves to get &quot;too high&quot; off of emotion. We can have 100 things go well for us, but as soon as one wrong thing goes against us, we flip out. We cry for weeks over a relationship that we might forget about in 10 years. We cheer about our team winning the championship that 99% of the will forget in 10 years (or simply might not care in the first place). If you don&#39;t believe me (without researching), name the NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL champions from 10 years ago (2003-2004 seasons). Few may be able to do it, some will get at least one or two right... others will just simply guess, because they simply can&#39;t remember.<br><br>We either live in the past, or live in the future. Most of us don&#39;t live in the now. We don&#39;t think about the now. We think about how the now will affect our future. We even think how the past will affect our future (fate). We just simply don&#39;t live in the now, and explore the now, and relish in the now. I think by doing that, we are able to get a little bit better handle of our emotions and our mood swings. We may not be able to control what emotion we have, but we can decide whether or not it&#39;s an appropriate time for that emotion to control us. It&#39;s just simply asking the question of &quot;should I be feeling this way, or not?&quot; and / or &quot;where is this feeling coming from?&quot;.I believe we should understand the psychological part of ourselves, almost even more so than the biological, because if we know our biology is going to react a certain way when we put ourselves in a certain situation that will be negative, then it would be best for us, and for the people around us, to try and not put ourselves in that situation, much like how an alcoholic might not want to live alone next to a liquor store or a bar.<br><br>We&#39;ve got to understand ourselves in just the biological way. There are many other psychological and metaphysical factors that play a part in depression, and in order to do the subject justice, we&#39;ve got to explore all elements (although I understand that this is a &quot;science&quot; channel and talking about the science of depression, but I&#39;m tired of people saying &quot;it&#39;s just chemical imbalances that people can&#39;t help&quot;. I beg to differ, because there have been many cases of people overcoming depression, just like how people overcome cancer. Yes, medical help may be needed, but the psychological, and the metaphysical, also needs to be addressed and corrected if there is any hope of them to be &quot;in remission&quot; from depression. It doesn&#39;t mean it goes away permanently if all of a sudden they no longer feel &quot;depressed&quot;, but they&#39;re no longer feeling the effects of depression anymore, and their biology has adapted to &quot;normalcy&quot;. That&#39;s what I think we need to try and do.
