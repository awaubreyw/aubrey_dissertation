Juices and salts are added to canned vegetables to make them taste better and to last longer, but that isn&#39;t what is best for your body.

This has nothing to do with the video. I just want these pricks to fix the fucking comments. Cool video though. Here&#39;s the first two chapters of Alice in Wonderland.<br>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, &quot;and what is the use of a book,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;without pictures or conversations?&quot;\u00a0<br>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy\u2013chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!&quot; But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat\u2013pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat\u2013pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit\u2013hole, under the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!\u00a0<br>The rabbit\u2013hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.\u00a0<br>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book\u2013shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled &quot;ORANGE MARMALADE,&quot; but, to her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\u00a0<br>Down, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself. &quot;Dinah&#39;ll miss me very much to\u2013night, I should think!&quot; (Dinah was the cat.) &quot;I hope they&#39;ll remember her saucer of milk at tea\u2013time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!&quot; Alice felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\u00a0<br>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, &quot;Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it&#39;s getting!&quot; She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.\u00a0<br>She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all &#39;round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\u00a0<br>Image i003.jpg (No Description)\u00a0<br>Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice&#39;s first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, it would not open any of them. However, on the second time &#39;round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!\u00a0<br>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat\u2013hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway. &quot;Oh,&quot; said Alice, &quot;how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.&quot;\u00a0<br>Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it (&quot;which certainly was not here before,&quot; said Alice), and tied &#39;round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words &quot;DRINK ME&quot; beautifully printed on it in large letters.\u00a0<br>&quot;No, I&#39;ll look first,&quot; she said, &quot;and see whether it&#39;s marked &#39;poison&#39; or not,&quot; for she had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked &quot;poison,&quot; it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle was not marked &quot;poison,&quot; so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry\u2013tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.\u00a0<br>* * * * *\u00a0<br>&quot;What a curious feeling!&quot; said Alice. &quot;I must be shutting up like a telescope!&quot;\u00a0<br>And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.\u00a0<br>After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\u00a0<br>&quot;Come, there&#39;s no use in crying like that!&quot; said Alice to herself rather sharply. &quot;I advise you to leave off this minute!&quot; She generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes.\u00a0<br>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake, on which the words &quot;EAT ME&quot; were beautifully marked in currants. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll eat it,&quot; said Alice, &quot;and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I&#39;ll get into the garden, and I don&#39;t care which happens!&quot;\u00a0<br>She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, &quot;Which way? Which way?&quot; holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake.\u00a0<br>II\u2014THE POOL OF TEARS\u00a0<br><br>&quot;Curiouser and curiouser!&quot; cried Alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English). &quot;Now I&#39;m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good\u2013by, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.&quot;\u00a0<br>Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\u00a0<br>Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again.\u00a0<br>She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all &#39;round her and reaching half down the hall.\u00a0<br>After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid\u2013gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, &quot;Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won&#39;t she be savage if I&#39;ve kept her waiting!&quot; When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, &quot;If you please, sir\u2014&quot; The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid\u2013gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\u00a0<br>Alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking. &quot;Dear, dear! How queer everything is to\u2013day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. Was I the same when I got up this morning? But if I&#39;m not the same, the next question is, &quot;Who in the world am I?&quot; Ah, that&#39;s the great puzzle!&quot;\u00a0<br>As she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit&#39;s little white kid\u2013gloves while she was talking. &quot;How can I have done that?&quot; she thought. &quot;I must be growing small again.&quot; She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether.\u00a0<br>&quot;That was a narrow escape!&quot; said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence. &quot;And now for the garden!&quot; And she ran with all speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. &quot;Things are worse than ever,&quot; thought the poor child, &quot;for I never was so small as this before, never!&quot;\u00a0<br>As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt\u2013water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. Also BTW I have never read this book. Not yet anyway. Lemme continue...\u00a0<br>Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\u00a0<br>&quot;Would it be of any use, now,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out\u2013of\u2013the\u2013way down here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there&#39;s no harm in trying.&quot; So she began, &quot;O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!&quot; The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\u00a0<br>&quot;Perhaps it doesn&#39;t understand English,&quot; thought Alice. &quot;I dare say it&#39;s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.&quot; So she began again: &quot;O\u00f9 est ma chatte?&quot; which was the first sentence in her French lesson\u2013book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. &quot;Oh, I beg your pardon!&quot; cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal&#39;s feelings. &quot;I quite forgot you didn&#39;t like cats.&quot;\u00a0<br>&quot;Not like cats!&quot; cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. &quot;Would you like cats, if you were me?&quot; Well, perhaps not,&quot; said Alice in a soothing tone; &quot;don&#39;t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you&#39;d take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a dear, quiet thing.&quot; The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended. &quot;We won&#39;t talk about her any more, if you&#39;d rather not.&quot;\u00a0<br>&quot;We, indeed!&quot; cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its tail. &quot;As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats\u2014nasty, low, vulgar things! Don&#39;t let me hear the name again!&quot;\u00a0<br>&quot;I won&#39;t indeed!&quot; said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. &quot;Are you\u2014are you fond\u2014of\u2014of dogs? There is such a nice little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats and\u2014oh, dear!&quot; cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve offended it again!&quot; For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\u00a0<br>So she called softly after it, &quot;Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won&#39;t talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don&#39;t like them!&quot; When the Mouse heard this, it turned &#39;round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, &quot;Let us get to the shore and then I&#39;ll tell you my history and you&#39;ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.&quot;\u00a0<br>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore..", "comment_date": "2013-11-09T06:11:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "taylor hazzers", "comment_text": "that is really amazing \u00a0:3", "comment_date": "2013-11-09T06:08:51Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "The Plague Doctor", "comment_text": "yeh", "comment_date": "2013-11-09T05:43:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Belinda Phan", "comment_text": "Is there away to distribute fat where you want by what you eat or any other way?", "comment_date": "2013-11-09T05:41:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Teresa Muthoni", "comment_text": "That&#39;s awesome.", "comment_date": "2013-11-09T05:38:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rain Man", "comment_text": "This is wrong, first of all frozen vegetables are cooked before being frozen, which results in lower nutrients.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2013-11-09T05:36:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "freetv77", "comment_text": "Did you know that Sheriff Arpaio of AZ held a press conference over a year ago that concluded that the &quot;birth certificate&quot; posted by Mr. Obama is a forgery?

Ah! how hard a thing it is to tell what this wild and rough and dense wood was, which in thought renews the fear! So bitter is it that death is little more. But in order to treat of the good that there I found, I will tell of the other things that I have seen there. I cannot well recount how I entered it, so full was I of slumber at that point where I abandoned the true way. But after I had arrived at the foot of a hill, where that valley ended which had pierced my heart with fear, I looked on high, and saw its shoulders clothed already with the rays of the planet[1] that leadeth men aright along every path. Then was the fear a little quieted which in the lake of my heart had lasted through the night that I passed so piteously. And even as one who with spent breath, issued out of the sea upon the shore, turns to the perilous water and gazes, so did my soul, which still was flying, turn back to look again upon the pass which never had a living person left.<br>[1] The sun, a planet according to the Ptolemaic system.<br>After I had rested a little my weary body I took my way again along the desert slope, so that the firm foot was always the lower. And ho! almost at the beginning of the steep a she-leopard, light and very nimble, which was covered with a spotted coat. And she did not move from before my face, nay, rather hindered so my road that to return I oftentimes had turned.<br>The time was at the beginning of the morning, and the Sun was mounting upward with those stars that were with him when Love Divine first set in motion those beautiful things;[1] so that the hour of the time and the sweet season were occasion of good hope to me concerning that wild beast with the dappled skin. But not so that the sight which appeared to me of a lion did not give me fear. He seemed to be coming against me, with head high and with ravening hunger, so that it seemed that the air was affrighted at him. And a she-wolf,[2] who with all cravings seemed laden in her meagreness, and already had made many folk to live forlorn,\u2014she caused me so much heaviness, with the fear that came from sight of her, that I lost hope of the height And such as he is who gaineth willingly, and the time arrives that makes him lose, who in all his thoughts weeps and is sad,\u2014such made me the beast without repose that, coming on against me, little by little was pushing me back thither where the Sun is silent.<br>[1] According to old tradition the spring was the season of the creation.<br>[2] These three beasts correspond to the triple division of sins into those of incontinence, of violence, and of fraud. See Canto XI.<br>While I was falling back to the low place, before mine eyes appeared one who through long silence seemed hoarse. When I saw him in the great desert, &quot;Have pity on me!&quot; I cried to him, &quot;whatso thou art, or shade or real man.&quot; He answered me: &quot;Not man; man once I was, and my parents were Lombards, and Mantuans by country both. I was born sub Julio, though late, and I lived at Rome under the good Augustus, in the time of the false and lying gods. Poet was I, and sang of that just son of Anchises who came from Troy after proud Ilion had been burned. But thou, why returnest thou to so great annoy? Why dost thou not ascend the delectable mountain which is the source and cause of every joy?&quot;<br>&quot;Art thou then that Virgil and that fount which poureth forth so large a stream of speech?&quot; replied I to him with bashful front: &quot;O honor and light of the other poem I may the long seal avail me, and the great love, which have made me search thy volume! Thou art my master and my author; thou alone art he from whom I took the fair style that hath done me honor. Behold the beast because of which I turned; help me against her, famous sage, for she makes any veins and pulses tremble.&quot; &quot;Thee it behoves to hold another course,&quot; he replied, when he saw me weeping, &quot;if thou wishest to escape from this savage place; for this beast, because of which thou criest out, lets not any one pass along her way, but so hinders him that she kills him! and she has a nature so malign and evil that she never sates her greedy will, and after food is hungrier than before. Many are the animals with which she wives, and there shall be more yet, till the hound [1] shall come that will make her die of grief. He shall not feed on land or goods, but wisdom and love and valor, and his birthplace shall be between Feltro and Feltro. Of that humble<br>[2] Italy shall he be the salvation, for which the virgin Camilla died, and Euryalus, Turnus and Nisus of their wounds. He shall hunt her through every town till he shall have set her back in hell, there whence envy first sent her forth. Wherefore I think and deem it for thy best that thou follow me, and I will be thy guide, and will lead thee hence through the eternal place whew thou shalt hear the despairing shrieks, shalt see the ancient spirits woeful who each proclaim the second death. And then thou shalt see those who are contented in the fire, because they hope to come, whenever it may be, to the blessed folk; to whom if thou wilt thereafter ascend, them shall be a soul more worthy than I for that. With her I will leave thee at my departure; for that Emperor who reigneth them above, because I was rebellious to His law, wills not that into His city any one should come through me. In all parts He governs and them He reigns: there in His city and His lofty seat. O happy he whom thereto He elects!&quot; And I to him, &quot;Poet, I beseech thee by that God whom thou didst not know, in order that I may escape this ill and worse, that thou lead me thither whom thou now hest said, so that I may see the gate of St. Peter, and those whom thou makest so afflicted.&quot;<br>[1] Of whom the hound is the symbol, and to whom Dante looked for the deliverance of Italy from the discorda and misrule that made her wretched, is still matter of doubt, after centuries of controversy.<br>[2] Fallen, humiliated.<br>Then he moved on, and I behind him kept.", "comment_date": "2013-11-08T03:30:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rositas52", "comment_text": "Long comment bro.(comment under mine)", "comment_date": "2013-11-08T03:30:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GUMBY", "comment_text": "alright i see a problem with the comment section now hahah", "comment_date": "2013-11-08T03:28:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OoberMcAwesome", "comment_text": "Why do we sing in the shower???", "comment_date": "2013-11-08T03:25:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sntsbc", "comment_text": "let&#39;s STOP this video from trending PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2013-11-08T03:25:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WWW.JUMP85.COM", "comment_text": "We are still investigating that.

The king of Scotland had died without a son, \u00a0<br>and the King of England, a cruel pagan known as Edward the Longshanks, \u00a0<br>claimed the thrown of Scotland for himself. Scotland&#39;s nobles fought him, \u00a0<br>and fought each other over the crown. So Longshanks invited them to talks \u00a0<br>of truce, no weapons, one page only. Among the farmers of that shire was \u00a0<br>Malcolm Wallace, a commoner with his own lands. He had two sons: John and \u00a0<br>William. \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: I told you to stay. \u00a0<br><br>William: Well, I finished my work. Where are we going? \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: MacAndrews. He was supposed to fess up when the gathering was \u00a0<br>over. \u00a0<br><br>William: Can I come? \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: No. Go home, boy. \u00a0<br><br>William: But I want to go. \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: Go home William or you&#39;ll the back of my hand. \u00a0<br><br>John: Follow him, William. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: MacAndrews; MacAndrews. Great Jesus! \u00a0<br><br>William: Ah! (screams) \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: It&#39;s all right! William! \u00a0<br><br>John: William! \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: It&#39;s all right. Easy lad. \u00a0<br><br>Dead Page Boy: William! \u00a0<br><br>(in Wallace&#39;s house) \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: We fight them! \u00a0<br><br>MacClannough: Every nobleman who had the will to fight was at that meeting. \u00a0<br>We can not beat an army. \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: We do not have to defeat them. Just fight them. Now who&#39;s with me. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell (among others): I am, Wallace. \u00a0<br><br>MacClannough: Alright, alright. \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: Where do you think you&#39;re going? \u00a0<br><br>William: I&#39;m going with you. \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: Oh, you&#39;re going with, hey? And what are you going to do? \u00a0<br><br>William: I&#39;m gonna help. \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: Hey, and a good help you&#39;d be, too. But I need you to stay here \u00a0<br>and look after the place for me while I&#39;m away. \u00a0<br><br>William: I can fight! \u00a0<br><br>Malcolm: I know. I know you can fight. But it&#39;s out wits that make us men. \u00a0<br>See you tomorrow. \u00a0<br><br>John: Ha! \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: English! \u00a0<br><br>William: Get down! \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: With your father and brother gone, they&#39;ll kill us and burn the \u00a0<br>farm. \u00a0<br><br>William: It&#39;s up to us, Hamish. \u00a0<br><br>Both boys: Ahhhh!

You have the look of your mother. \u00a0<br><br>Argyle: We&#39;ll stay here tonight. Tomorrow you&#39;ll come home with me. \u00a0<br><br>William: I don&#39;t want to leave. \u00a0<br><br>Argyle: You didn&#39;t want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened. \u00a0<br>Did the priest give a poetic benediction? &quot;The Lord bless thee and keep \u00a0<br>thee&quot;? \u00a0<br><br>William: It was in Latin. \u00a0<br><br>Argyle: You don&#39;t speak Latin? Well that&#39;s something we shall have to \u00a0<br>remedy, isn&#39;t it. \u00a0<br><br>Argyle: The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord cause his light to \u00a0<br>shine on thee. The Lord lift up his continence upon thee. And give thee \u00a0<br>peace. Amen. \u00a0<br><br>Dead Malcolm: Your heart is free. Have the courage to follow her. \u00a0<br><br>(Campbell plays bagpipes) \u00a0<br><br>William: What are they doing? \u00a0<br><br>Argyle: Saying goodbye in their own way. Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed \u00a0<br>pipes. It was the same for me and your daddy, when our father was killed. \u00a0<br><br>(William looks at sword) \u00a0<br><br>Argyle: First, learn to use this (mind), then I&#39;ll teach you to use this \u00a0<br>(sword). \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Robert the Bruce (narrator): Many years later, Edward the Longshanks, King \u00a0<br>of England, supervised the wedding of his eldest son, who would succeed him \u00a0<br>to the thrown. As bride for his son, Longshanks had chosen the daughter of \u00a0<br>his rival, the King of France. It was widely whispered that for the \u00a0<br>princess to conceive, Longshanks would have to do the honors himself. That \u00a0<br>may have been what he had in mind all along. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Scotland, my land. The French will grovel to anyone with \u00a0<br>strength, but how will they believe our strength when we can not rule the \u00a0<br>whole of our own island? \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Where is my son? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Your pardon, my Lord. He asked me to come in his stead. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: I sent for him and he sends you? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Shall I leave, my Lord? \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: If he wants his Queen to rule when I am gone, then by all means \u00a0<br>stay, and learn how. Please. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Nobles. Nobles are the key to the door of Scotland. Grant our \u00a0<br>nobles lands in the north. Give their nobles estates here in England, and \u00a0<br>make them too greedy to oppose us. \u00a0<br><br>Advisor: But sire, our nobles will be reluctant to uproot. New lands mean \u00a0<br>new taxes, and they are already taxed for the war in France. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Are they? Are they? The trouble with Scotland is that it&#39;s full \u00a0<br>of Scots. Perhaps the time has come to reinstitute an old custom. Grant \u00a0<br>them prima noctes. First night, when any common girl inhabiting their lands \u00a0<br>is married, our nobles shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her \u00a0<br>wedding. If we can&#39;t get them out, we breed them out. That should fetch \u00a0<br>just the kind of lords we want to Scotland, taxes or no taxes. \u00a0<br><br>Advisor: A most excellent idea, sire. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Is it? \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Robert the Bruce (narrator): Now in Edinburgh, gathered the council of \u00a0<br>Scottish nobles. Among these was Robert, the 17th Earl of Bruce, the \u00a0<br>leading contender for the crown of Scotland. \u00a0<br><br>Robert the Bruce: I hear that Longshanks has granted prima noctes. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here. \u00a0<br><br>Robert the Bruce: My father believes that we must lull Longshanks into \u00a0<br>confidence by neither supporting his decree nor opposing it. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: A wise plan. And how is your father? We missed him at the council. \u00a0<br><br>Robert the Bruce: Ah. His affairs in France keep him long overdue, but he \u00a0<br>sends his greetings. And he says that I speak for all the Bruces, and for \u00a0<br>Scotland. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>William: (rides home and smells air) \u00a0<br><br>(wedding celebration; music playing) \u00a0<br><br>William: You dropped your rock. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Test of manhood. \u00a0<br><br>William: You win. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won&#39;t let us train \u00a0<br>with weapons, so we train with stones. \u00a0<br><br>William: Well, a test of a soldier is not in his arm, it&#39;s here (mind). \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: No, it&#39;s here (arm) \u00a0<br><br>(Hamish hits William) \u00a0<br><br>William: Hamish? \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Uh huh. \u00a0<br><br>(drumming, rock throwing contest) \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: Here you go, son. Show him how. Come on! Haha, my boy! \u00a0<br><br>William: That&#39;s a good throw. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Ay. Ay, it was. \u00a0<br><br>William: I was wondering if you could do that when it matters. As it, as is \u00a0<br>matters in battle. Can you crush a man with that throw? \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: I could crush you, like a worm. \u00a0<br><br>William: You could? \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>William: Well then do it. Would you like to see him crush me like a worm? \u00a0<br><br>Crowd: Ay! \u00a0<br><br>William: Then do it. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: You&#39;ll move. \u00a0<br><br>William: I will not. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: He&#39;ll move. \u00a0<br><br>(Hamish misses, William hits Hamish) \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: Fine display, young Wallace. \u00a0<br><br>William: You alright? You look a widdy bit shaky. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: I should have remembered the rocks. \u00a0<br><br>William: Ay, you should have. Get up you big heap. It&#39;s good to see you \u00a0<br>again. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Ay, welcome home. \u00a0<br><br>Girl: William, will you dance with me? \u00a0<br><br>William: Of coarse I will. \u00a0<br><br>(Horses ride in) \u00a0<br><br>English lord: I have come to claim the right of prima noctes. As lord of \u00a0<br>these lands, I will bless this marriage by taking the bride into my bed on \u00a0<br>the first night of her union. \u00a0<br><br>Scottish man: By God, you will not! \u00a0<br><br>Lord: It is my noble right. \u00a0<br><br>(They ride off with bride). \u00a0<br><br>Smythe: Ha ha. Ha ha. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>(raining, outside of Murron&#39;s house) \u00a0<br><br>William: Good evening, sir. \u00a0<br><br>MacClannough: Ah, young Wallace. Grand soft evening, huh? \u00a0<br><br>William: Ay, is that. I was wondering if I might have a word with your \u00a0<br>daughter. \u00a0<br><br>MacClannough: What do you want to have a word with her about? \u00a0<br><br>William: Well, ah, Murron, would you like to come and ride with me on this \u00a0<br>fine evening? \u00a0<br><br>Mrs. MacClannough: In this? You&#39;re out of your mind. \u00a0<br><br>William: Oh, it&#39;s good Scottish weather, madam.

We&#39;ll see you later. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: &#39;O the weather&#39;s just fine. It&#39;s hardly raining. \u00a0<br><br>Mrs. MacClannough: Did you no hear what I said? Now get--Murron. It&#39;s you \u00a0<br>she takes after. \u00a0<br><br>William: How did you know me after so long? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Why, I didn&#39;t. \u00a0<br><br>William: No? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: It&#39;s just that I saw you staring at me and I didn&#39;t know who you \u00a0<br>were. \u00a0<br><br>William: &#39;O sorry, I suppose I was. Are you in the habit of riding off in \u00a0<br>the rain with strangers? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: It was the best way to make you leave. \u00a0<br><br>William: Well, if I can ever work up the courage to ask you again, I&#39;ll \u00a0<br>send you a written warning first. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: &#39;O it wouldn&#39;t do you much good. I can&#39;t read. \u00a0<br><br>William: Can you not? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: no. \u00a0<br><br>William: Well that&#39;s something we shall have to remedy, isn&#39;t it. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: You&#39;re going to teach me to read, then? \u00a0<br><br>William: Ah, if you like. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>William: In what language? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Are you showing off now? \u00a0<br><br>William: That&#39;s right. Are you impressed yet? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: No. Why should I be? \u00a0<br><br>William: (in French) Yes. Because every single day I thought about you. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Do that standing on your head and I&#39;ll be impressed. \u00a0<br><br>William: My kilt may fly up but I&#39;ll try. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: You certainly didn&#39;t learn any manners on your travels. \u00a0<br><br>William: I&#39;m afraid the Romans have far worse manners than I. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: You&#39;ve been to Rome? \u00a0<br><br>William: Ay, my uncle took me on a pilgrimage. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: What was it like? \u00a0<br><br>William: (in French) Not nearly as beautiful as you. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: What does that mean? \u00a0<br><br>William: Beautiful. But I belong here. \u00a0<br><br>Mrs. MacClannough: Murron, come in now. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>William: Sir, I know it was strange of me to invite Murron to ride last \u00a0<br>night, but I assure you I-- \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: MacClannough&#39;s daughter is another matter. I&#39;ve come to fetch you \u00a0<br>to a meeting. \u00a0<br><br>William: What kind of meeting? \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: The secret kind. \u00a0<br><br>MacClannough: Your meetings are a waste of time, Campbell. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: Your father was a fighter, and a patriot. \u00a0<br><br>William: I know who my father was. I came back home to raise crops, and God \u00a0<br>willing a family. If I can live in peace, I will. \u00a0<br><br>MacClannough: You say you want to stay out of the troubles? \u00a0<br><br>William: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>MacClannough: If you can prove it, you may court my daughter. Until you \u00a0<br>prove it, my answer is no. \u00a0<br><br>William: No? \u00a0<br><br>MacClannough: No Wallace, no. \u00a0<br><br>William: Didn&#39;t I just prove it? \u00a0<br><br>MacClannough: No. \u00a0<br><br>William: No? \u00a0<br><br>MacClannough: No. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>William: Of coarse, running a farm is a lot of work, but that will all \u00a0<br>change when my sons arrive. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: So, you&#39;ve got children? \u00a0<br><br>William: Well not yet, but I was hoping that you could help me with that. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: So you want me to marry you, then? \u00a0<br><br>William: Well, that&#39;s a bit sudden but alright. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Is that what you call a proposal? \u00a0<br><br>William: I love you. Always have. I want to marry you. Is that a yes? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Ay, that&#39;s a yes. \u00a0<br><br>William: We best hurry. He&#39;ll be waiting. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Wait. \u00a0<br><br>William: Where are you going? \u00a0<br><br>William: What&#39;s that? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: You&#39;ll see. \u00a0<br><br>William: Father. \u00a0<br><br>William: I will love you my whole life; you and no other. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: And I you; you and no other forever. \u00a0<br><br>Priest: (speaks Latin) \u00a0<br><br>William: When am I gonna see you again? Tonight? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: I can&#39;t. \u00a0<br><br>William: Why not? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: My dad&#39;s gotten suspicious. \u00a0<br><br>William: Not as suspicious as you (?). When? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Tonight. \u00a0<br><br>William: Tonight? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Smythe: Look lively, sergeant. \u00a0<br><br>Smythe: Where are you going lassie? Oo, that looks heavy. Let me help you. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: That&#39;s fine. \u00a0<br><br>Smythe: &#39;O, you remind me of my daughter back home. \u00a0<br><br>Smythe: Hello lassie. \u00a0<br><br>Soldier: Keep going, Smythe. \u00a0<br><br>(lots of screaming) \u00a0<br><br>Smythe: Ah, you bitch. \u00a0<br><br>William: Are you alright? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>William: Can you ride? \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>Smythe: Come back here, you bastard. \u00a0<br><br>William: Meet me at the grove. Ride. \u00a0<br><br>Smythe: They&#39;re getting away. \u00a0<br><br>William: Murron? Murron? \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Magistrate: All of you know full well the great pains I&#39;ve always taken \u00a0<br>never to be to strict, to rigid, with the application of our laws. And as a \u00a0<br>consequence, have we not learned to live together in relative peace and \u00a0<br>harmony? Ha? And this day&#39;s lawlessness is how you repay my leniency. Well \u00a0<br>you leave me with little choice. An assault on the king&#39;s soldiers is the \u00a0<br>same as an assault on the king himself. \u00a0<br><br>(He kills Murron) \u00a0<br><br>Magistrate: Now, let this scrapper come to me. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Soldier: There. (points at William) \u00a0<br><br>(fighting starts) \u00a0<br><br>Magistrate: Corporal, summon archers on the tower, now. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Hold still, father. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: Ahh, boy! \u00a0<br><br>(William kills Magistrate) \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: MacClannough, MacClannough! \u00a0<br><br>Crowd of Scotsmen: MacClannough, MacClannough, WALLACE, WALLACE! \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>(Murron&#39;s Funeral) \u00a0<br><br>Priest: (speaks Latin) \u00a0<br><br>Mrs. MacClannough: (crying) \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Campbell: What cha waiting for, boy? \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Here. You can do it. I&#39;ll hold him down. \u00a0<br><br>Morrison: Here. You can do it. I&#39;ll hold him down. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: Ay, straight in, boy. I know it seems like a waste of good \u00a0<br>whiskey, but indulge me. AHHH. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Hold him! Hold him! \u00a0<br><br>Scottish man: Let him go. Sorry. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: That will wake you up in the morning, boy. \u00a0<br><br>Watch guard: There&#39;s somebody coming. Arm yourselves. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: There&#39;s somebody coming. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: MacGregors, from the next clan. \u00a0<br><br>MacGregor: We heard about what was happening, and we don&#39;t want you \u00a0<br>armidants thinking you can have your fun without us. \u00a0<br><br>William: Go home. Some of us are in this. We can&#39;t help that now. But you \u00a0<br>can help yourselves. Go home. \u00a0<br><br>MacGregor: We&#39;ll have no homes left when the English garrison from the \u00a0<br>castle comes through and burns us out. And they will. \u00a0<br><br>William and Campbell: Welcome! \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>(William&#39;s army enters, dressed as English patrol) \u00a0<br><br>English soldier: Patrol returning, my Lord. \u00a0<br><br>English Lord: So, what news? \u00a0<br><br>(William hits Lord) \u00a0<br><br>English Lord: I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark. They will be \u00a0<br>returning now. \u00a0<br><br>William: Were they dressed like this? Actually, it was more like 50. Make \u00a0<br>it quick. \u00a0<br><br>Morrison: Do you remember me? \u00a0<br><br>Lord: I never did her any harm. It was my right. \u00a0<br><br>Morrison: Your right? Well I&#39;m here to claim the right as a husband. \u00a0<br><br>William: I am William Wallace, and the rest of you will be spared. Go back \u00a0<br>to England, and tell them there that Scotland&#39;s daughters and her sons are \u00a0<br>yours no more. Tell them Scotland is free. Burn it. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>(in English castle) \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Scottish rebels have routed one of my garrisons and murdered \u00a0<br>the noble lord. \u00a0<br><br>Prince: I heard. This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: And how would you deal with this brigand? \u00a0<br><br>Prince: Like any common thief. Have the local magistrate arrest him and \u00a0<br>punish him accordingly. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Leave us. Wallace has already killed the magistrate and taken \u00a0<br>control of the town. Stand up. Stand up. In the morning, I depart for \u00a0<br>France to press our rights there, and I leave you here to quell this little \u00a0<br>rebellion, understood? Is it? One day you will be a king. At least try to \u00a0<br>act like one. \u00a0<br><br>Prince: Get away from me. I will need my military council. \u00a0<br><br>Nicolette: (in French) I hope your husband goes to Scotland and meets \u00a0<br>Wallace and then you&#39;ll be a widow. \u00a0<br><br>English soldier: After them. \u00a0<br><br>English leader: No point resisting. You&#39;re outnumbered and trapped. Now \u00a0<br>where are the rest of you? Where&#39;s Wallace? \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Robert: Father? \u00a0<br><br>Leper: Ah, come in, come in. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: A rebellion has begun. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: Under whom? \u00a0<br><br>Robert: A commoner named William Wallace. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: We will embrace this rebellion. Support it from our lands in the \u00a0<br>north. I will gain English favor by condemning it, and ordering it opposed \u00a0<br>from our lands in the south. Sit down. Stay a while. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: This Wallace, he doesn&#39;t even have a knighthood, but he fights with \u00a0<br>passion and he inspires. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: And you wish to charge off and fight as he did. So would I. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Well, maybe it&#39;s time. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: It is time to survive. You&#39;re the 17th Robert Bruce. The 16 before \u00a0<br>you passed you land and title because they didn&#39;t charge in. Call a meeting \u00a0<br>of the nobles. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: But they do nothing but talk. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: Rightly so. They&#39;re as rich in English titles and lands as they are \u00a0<br>in Scottish, just as we are. Admire this man, this William Wallace. \u00a0<br>Uncompromising men are easy to admire. He has courage, so does a dog. But \u00a0<br>it is exactly the ability to compromise that makes a man noble. And \u00a0<br>understand this: Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king ever to sit in \u00a0<br>the thrown of England. And none of us, and nothing of Scotland will remain, \u00a0<br>unless we are as ruthless. Give in to our nobles. Knowing their minds is \u00a0<br>the key to the thrown. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Prince: Wait. Wait. Look. This is right and this is left. Carry on. Carry \u00a0<br>on. \u00a0<br><br>Nicolette: (in French) When the king returns, he will bury them in those \u00a0<br>new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army \u00a0<br>north. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: (in French) How do you know this? \u00a0<br><br>Nicolette: (in French) Last night I slept with a member of the War Council. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: (in French) He shouldn&#39;t be telling secrets in bed. \u00a0<br><br>Nicolette: (in French) Englishmen don&#39;t know what a tongue is for. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: (in French) Ah. This Scottish rebel, Wallace. He fights to avenge \u00a0<br>a woman? \u00a0<br><br>Nicolette: (in French) I nearly forgot. A magistrate wished to capture him, \u00a0<br>and found he had a secret lover. So he cut the girl&#39;s throat to tempt \u00a0<br>Wallace to fight, and fight he did. Knowing his passion for his lost love, \u00a0<br>they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and \u00a0<br>brother, and setting an ambush at the grave of his love. He fought his way \u00a0<br>through the trap and carried her body to a secret place. Now that&#39;s love, \u00a0<br>no? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Love? I wouldn&#39;t know. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>William: You know, eventually Longshanks will send his whole Northern Army \u00a0<br>against us. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: Heavy cavalry, armored horse; shake the very ground. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: They&#39;ll ride right over us. \u00a0<br><br>William: Uncle Argyle used to talk about it; how no army had ever stood up \u00a0<br>to a charge of heavy horse. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: So what&#39;ll we do? \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: Run, hide, the highland way. \u00a0<br><br>William: We&#39;ll make spears. Hundreds of them. Long spears, twice as long as \u00a0<br>a man. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: That long? \u00a0<br><br>William: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Some men are longer than others. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: Your mother&#39;s been telling stories about me again, ah? \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Guard: Volunteers coming in. \u00a0<br><br>Faudron: William Wallace, we&#39;ve come to fight and to die for ya. \u00a0<br><br>William: Stand up, man. I&#39;m not the pope. \u00a0<br><br>Faudron: My name is Faudron, and my sword is yours. I brought you this. \u00a0<br><br>Guard: We checked them for arms. \u00a0<br><br>Faudron: I brought you this. My wife made it for ya. \u00a0<br><br>William: Thank you. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: (laughs) Him? That can&#39;t be William Wallace. I&#39;m prettier than \u00a0<br>this man. Alright Father, I&#39;ll ask him. If I risk my neck for you, will I \u00a0<br>get a chance to kill Englishmen? \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Is your father a ghost or do you converse with the Almighty? \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: In order to find his equal, an Irishman is forced to talk to God. \u00a0<br>Yes, Father. The Almighty says don&#39;t change the subject; just answer the \u00a0<br>fooking question. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Mind your tongue. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: Insane Irish. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: (pulls dagger on Campbell) Smart enough to get a dagger past your \u00a0<br>guards, old man. \u00a0<br><br>William: That&#39;s my friend, Irishman. And the answer to your question is \u00a0<br>yes; if you fight for me you get to kill the English. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: Excellent. Stephen is my name. I&#39;m the most wanted man on my \u00a0<br>island, except I&#39;m not on my island, of coarse. Mores the pity. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Your island? You mean Ireland. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: Yeah. It&#39;s mine. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: You&#39;re a madman. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: I&#39;ve come to the right place, then. \u00a0<br><br>(everyone laughs) \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>(Faurdon trys to kill Wallace, but Stephen saves him) \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: Sure didn&#39;t the Almighty send me to watch your back? I didn&#39;t like \u00a0<br>him anyway. He wasn&#39;t right in the head. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Hamish: William, it&#39;s our runners. \u00a0<br><br>Morrison: The English are devising an army towards Scotland. \u00a0<br><br>William: Will the nobles rally? \u00a0<br><br>Runner: Robert the Bruce and most of the others will not commit to battle. \u00a0<br>But word is spread, and highlanders are coming down on their own. \u00a0<br><br>Morrison: Ay, in flocks of hundreds and thousands. \u00a0<br><br>William: Are you ready for a war? \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: Well, what news? \u00a0<br><br>Horseman: We&#39;re outnumbered, at least 3 to 1. \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: How many horse, then? \u00a0<br><br>Horseman: 300, maybe more. \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: 300 heavy horse? \u00a0<br><br>Lochlan: We must try to negotiate. \u00a0<br><br>Short soldier: What are they talking about? \u00a0<br><br>Tall soldier: I can&#39;t hear, but it doesn&#39;t look good. The nobles will \u00a0<br>negotiate. If they do a deal, then we go home. And if not, we charge. \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: 300 heavy horse; we have no chance. \u00a0<br><br>Short soldier: I didn&#39;t come here to fight so they can own more lands; then \u00a0<br>I have to work for them. \u00a0<br><br>Tall soldier: Nor me. Alright lads. I have no time for these bastards; lets \u00a0<br>go home. \u00a0<br><br>Lochlan: Stop men. Do not leave. Wait until we&#39;ve negotiated. \u00a0<br><br>Short soldier: William Wallace? \u00a0<br><br>Tall soldier: Can&#39;t be. Not tall enough. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: The Almighty says this must be a fashionable fight. It&#39;s drawn the \u00a0<br>finest people. \u00a0<br><br>Lochlan: Where is thy salute? \u00a0<br><br>William: For presenting yourselves on this battlefield, I give you thanks. \u00a0<br><br>Lochlan: This is our army. To join it you give homage. \u00a0<br><br>William: I give homage to Scotland. And if this is your army, why does it \u00a0<br>go? \u00a0<br><br>Tall soldier: We didn&#39;t come here to fight for them. \u00a0<br><br>Short soldier: Home. The English are too many. \u00a0<br><br>William: Sons of Scotland, I am William Wallace. \u00a0<br><br>Short soldier: William Wallace is 7 feet tall. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>William: Yes, I&#39;ve heard. Kills men by the hundreds, and if he were here \u00a0<br>he&#39;d consume the English with fireballs from his eyes and bolts of \u00a0<br>lightning from his ass. I am William Wallace, and I see before me an army \u00a0<br>of my countrymen here in defiance of tyranny. You have come to fight as \u00a0<br>free men, and free men you are. What would you do without freedom? Will you \u00a0<br>fight? \u00a0<br><br>Tall soldier: Fight against that? No, we will run, and we will live. \u00a0<br><br>William: Ay, fight and you may die, run and you&#39;ll live. At least a while. \u00a0<br>And dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade \u00a0<br>all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come \u00a0<br>back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they&#39;ll \u00a0<br>never take our freedom. \u00a0<br><br>(cheering) \u00a0<br><br>English lord: They seem quite optimistic to me. Maybe they do want to \u00a0<br>fight. \u00a0<br><br>Cheltham: Confrontation might be a foregone conclusion, my lord. But none \u00a0<br>the less, I think we should deliver the king&#39;s terms. \u00a0<br><br>Lord: The king&#39;s terms will never live up to them. \u00a0<br><br>Cheltham: My lord, I think--. \u00a0<br><br>Lord: Alright, offer them the terms. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: They&#39;re coming out. Shall we go and meet them? \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: Fine speech. Now what do we do? \u00a0<br><br>William: Just be yourselves. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Where are you going? \u00a0<br><br>William: I&#39;m going to pick a fight. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Well, we didn&#39;t get dressed up for nothing. \u00a0<br><br>Cheltham: Mornay, Lochlan, Craig. Here are the king&#39;s terms. Lead this army \u00a0<br>off field and he will give you each estates in Yorkshire, including \u00a0<br>hereditary title, from which you will pay--, from which you will pay him an \u00a0<br>annual duty--. \u00a0<br><br>William: I have an offer for you. \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: Cheltham, this is William Wallace. \u00a0<br><br>Cheltham: From which you will pay the king an annual duty--. \u00a0<br><br>William: I said I have an offer for you. \u00a0<br><br>Lochlan: You disrespect a banner of truce? \u00a0<br><br>William: From his king? Absolutely. Here are Scotland&#39;s terms. Lower your \u00a0<br>flags, and march straight back to England, stopping at every home to beg \u00a0<br>forgiveness for 100 years of theft, rape, and murder. Do that and your men \u00a0<br>shall live. Do it not, and every one of you will die today. \u00a0<br><br>Cheltham: You are outmatched. You have no heavy cavalry. In two centuries \u00a0<br>no army has won without--. \u00a0<br><br>William: I&#39;m not finished. Before we let you leave, your commander must \u00a0<br>cross that field, present himself before this army, put his head between \u00a0<br>his legs, and kiss his own ass. \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: I&#39;d say that was rather less cordial that he was used to. \u00a0<br><br>William: You be ready and do exactly as I say. On my signal, ride round \u00a0<br>behind our position and flank them. \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: We must not divide our forces. \u00a0<br><br>William: Do it, and let the English see you do it. \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: They&#39;ll think we&#39;ve run away. \u00a0<br><br>William: Take out their archers, and I&#39;ll meet you in the middle. \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: Alright. \u00a0<br><br>Priest: (speaks Latin) \u00a0<br><br>English Lord: Insolent bastard. I want this Wallace&#39;s head on a plate. \u00a0<br>Archers. \u00a0<br><br>(Scots scream) \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: The Lord says He can get me out of this mess, but He&#39;s pretty sure \u00a0<br>you&#39;re fooked. Ah! \u00a0<br><br>(Scots scream) \u00a0<br><br>William: Ride! \u00a0<br><br>Lord: See, every Scot with a horse is fleeing. Our cavalry will ride them \u00a0<br>down like grass. Send the horse; full attack. \u00a0<br><br>William: Hold! Hold! Hold! Now! \u00a0<br><br>(lots of screaming) \u00a0<br><br>Lord: Send the infantry. \u00a0<br><br>Cheltham: My Lord? \u00a0<br><br>Lord: You lead them. \u00a0<br><br>(lots of fighting) \u00a0<br><br>Lord: Retreat! \u00a0<br><br>William: Alright. \u00a0<br><br>William: (screaming) \u00a0<br><br>Scottish army: (screaming) WALLACE! \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Craig: I knight thee Sir William Wallace. Sir William, in the name of God \u00a0<br>we declare and appoint thee guardian and high protector of Scotland and thy \u00a0<br>Captains as aides-de-camp. Stand and be recognized. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Does anyone know his politics? \u00a0<br><br>Craig: No, but his weight with the commoners can unbalance everything. The \u00a0<br>Balliols will kiss his ass so we must. \u00a0<br><br>Balliol supporter: Sir William, Sir William. Inasmuch as you and your \u00a0<br>captains hail from a region long known to support the Balliol clan, may we \u00a0<br>invite you to continue your support and uphold our rightful claim. \u00a0<br><br>(screaming) \u00a0<br><br>William: Gentlemen!, Gentlemen! \u00a0<br><br>Balliol supporter: Now is the time to declare a king. \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: Wait! Then you are prepared to recognize our legitimate succession. \u00a0<br><br>Balliol supporter: You&#39;re the ones who won&#39;t support the rightful claim. \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: Those were lies when you first wrote them. \u00a0<br><br>Balliol supporter: I demand recognition of these documents. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: Gentlemen! Please, Gentlemen! Wait! Sir William, where are you \u00a0<br>going? \u00a0<br><br>William: We have beaten the English, but they&#39;ll come back because you \u00a0<br>won&#39;t stand together. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: Well what will you do? \u00a0<br><br>William: I will invade England and defeat the English on their own ground. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: Invade? That&#39;s impossible. \u00a0<br><br>William: Why? Why is that impossible? You&#39;re so concerned with squabbling \u00a0<br>for the scraps from Longshank&#39;s table that you&#39;ve missed your God given \u00a0<br>right to something better. There is a difference between us. You think the \u00a0<br>people of this country exist to provide you with possession. I think your \u00a0<br>possession exists to provide those people with freedom. And I go to make \u00a0<br>sure that they have it. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Robert: Wait! I respect what you said, but remember that these men have \u00a0<br>lands and castles. It&#39;s much to risk. \u00a0<br><br>William: And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk \u00a0<br>less? \u00a0<br><br>Robert: No, but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its \u00a0<br>nobles share allegiance with England. Its clans war with each other. If you \u00a0<br>make enemies on both sides of the border, you&#39;ll end up dead. \u00a0<br><br>William: We all end up dead; it&#39;s just a question of how and why. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: I&#39;m not a coward. I want what you want, but we need the nobles. \u00a0<br><br>William: We need them? \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>William: Now tell me, what does that mean to be noble? Your title gives you \u00a0<br>claim to the thrown of our country, but men don&#39;t follow titles, they \u00a0<br>follow courage. Now our people know you. Noble, and common, they respect \u00a0<br>you. And if you would just lead them to freedom, they&#39;d follow you. And so \u00a0<br>would I. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Royal Governor of York: Damn it! The sodomite my cousin the prince tells me \u00a0<br>he has no troops to lend and every town in Northern England is begging for \u00a0<br>help. \u00a0<br><br>Soldier: Wallace rides! Governor: To which town? \u00a0<br><br>Soldier: To here my Lord. \u00a0<br><br>Governor: Bring the food and provisions inside, double the wall guards, \u00a0<br>seal the gate, now! \u00a0<br><br>Soldier: Quickly, bring in the provisions, seal off the gate, NOW! \u00a0<br><br>Soldier: Sir, we can get you out if you leave now. \u00a0<br><br>Governor: I am not about to tell my Uncle I&#39;ve lost him the greatest city \u00a0<br>in Northern England. \u00a0<br><br>William: Come on! \u00a0<br><br>Scottish soldiers: AAAHHH! \u00a0<br><br>(lots of cheering, gate on fire) \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>(back in London) \u00a0<br><br>Soldier: Make way for the King. \u00a0<br><br>Philip: It&#39;s not your fault. Stand up to him. \u00a0<br><br>Prince: I will stand up to him and more. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: What news of the North? \u00a0<br><br>Prince: Nothing new, Your Majesty. We&#39;ve sent riders to speed any word. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: I heard the word in France, where I was fighting to expand your \u00a0<br>future kingdom. The word, my son, is that our entire Northern Army has been \u00a0<br>annihilated. And you have done nothing. \u00a0<br><br>Prince: I have ordered conscriptions. They are assembled and ready to \u00a0<br>depart. \u00a0<br><br>Soldier: Excuse me, sire, but there is a very urgent message from York. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Come. Leave us. \u00a0<br><br>Soldier: Yes, sire. \u00a0<br><br>Prince: Wallace has sacked York. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: What? \u00a0<br><br>Prince: Wallace has sacked York. Ah! \u00a0<br><br>Philip: Sire, thy own nephew. What beast could do such a thing? \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: If he can sack York, he can invade lower England. \u00a0<br><br>Philip: We would stop him! \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Who is this person who speaks to me as though I needed his \u00a0<br>advise? \u00a0<br><br>Prince: I have declared Philip my High Counselor. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Is he qualified? \u00a0<br><br>Philip: I am skilled in the arts of war and military tactics, sire. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Are you? Then tell me, what advice would you offer on the \u00a0<br>present situation? \u00a0<br><br>(Longshanks kick&#39;s Philip out the window) \u00a0<br><br>Philip: AAAHHH! \u00a0<br><br>(Longshanks kicks Prince) \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: I shall offer a truce and pie him off. But who will go to him? \u00a0<br>Not I, huh, if I fell under the sword of that murderer that might be my \u00a0<br>head in a basket. And not my gentle son. The mere sight of him would only \u00a0<br>encourage the enemy to take over the whole country. So who do I send? Whom \u00a0<br>do I send? \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>William: I&#39;m dreaming. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: Yes you are, and you must wake. \u00a0<br><br>William: I don&#39;t want to wake. I want to stay here with you. \u00a0<br><br>Murron: And I with you. But you must wake now. Wake up, William. Wake up. \u00a0<br>William, wake up. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: William, a royal entourage comes, flying banners of truce, with \u00a0<br>the standard of Longshanks himself. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: I am the Princess of Wales. I come as the king&#39;s servant and with \u00a0<br>his authority. \u00a0<br><br>William: To do what? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: To discuss the king&#39;s proposals. Will you speak with a woman? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: I understand you have recently been given the rank of knight. \u00a0<br><br>William: I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities, the executioner \u00a0<br>of the king&#39;s nephew, my husband&#39;s own cousin? \u00a0<br><br>William: York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And \u00a0<br>that royal cousin hanged innocent Scots, even women and children, from the \u00a0<br>city walls. Oh, Longshanks did far worse the last time he took a Scottish \u00a0<br>city. \u00a0<br><br>Hamilton: (in Latin) He is a bloody murdering savage. And he&#39;s telling \u00a0<br>lies. \u00a0<br><br>William: (in Latin) I never lie. But I am a savage. (in French) Or in \u00a0<br>French if you prefer. (in English) You ask your king to his face, ask him, \u00a0<br>and see if his eyes can convince you of the truth. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Hamilton, leave us. \u00a0<br><br>Hamilton: My lady? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Leave us. Now. Let us talk plainly. You invade England, but you \u00a0<br>can not complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply. The king \u00a0<br>desires peace. \u00a0<br><br>William: Longshanks desires peace? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: He declares it to me, I swear it. He proposes that you withdraw \u00a0<br>your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest of gold \u00a0<br>which I am to pay to you personally. \u00a0<br><br>William: A lordship and titles. Gold. That I should become Judas? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Peace is made in such ways. \u00a0<br><br>William: Slaves are made in such ways. The last time Longshanks spoke of \u00a0<br>peace I was a boy. And many Scottish nobles, who would not be slaves, were \u00a0<br>lured by him under a flag of truce to a barn where he had them hanged. I \u00a0<br>was very young, but I remember Longshank&#39;s notion of peace. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: I understand you have suffered. I know about your woman. \u00a0<br><br>William: She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share \u00a0<br>her with an English Lord. They killed her to get to me. I have never spoken \u00a0<br>of it. I don&#39;t know why I tell you now except I see her strength in you. \u00a0<br>One day you&#39;ll be a queen, and you must open your eyes. You tell your king \u00a0<br>that William Wallace will not be ruled, and nor will any Scot while I live. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Ah, my son&#39;s loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen. So he \u00a0<br>accepted our bribe? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: No, he did not. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Then why does he stay? My scouts tell me that he has not \u00a0<br>advanced. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: He waits for you at York. He says he will attack no more towns or \u00a0<br>cities, if you are man enough to come and face him. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Did he? The Welsh bowmen will not be detected arriving so far \u00a0<br>around his flank. The main force of our armies from France will land here \u00a0<br>to the north of Edinburgh. Conscripts from Ireland will approach from the \u00a0<br>southwest to here. \u00a0<br><br>Prince: Welsh bowmen, troops from France, Irish conscripts. Even if you \u00a0<br>dispatch them today they will take weeks to assemble. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: I dispatched them before I sent your wife. So our little ruse \u00a0<br>succeeded. Thank you. And while this upstart awaits my arrival in York, my \u00a0<br>forces will have arrived in Edinburgh behind him. You spoke with this \u00a0<br>Wallace in private? Tell me, what kind of man is he? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: A mindless barbarian, not a king like you, my lord. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: You may return to your embroidery. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Humbly, my lord. \u00a0<br><br>Prince: You brought back the money, of coarse. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: No, I gave it to ease the suffering of the children of this war. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: haha! That&#39;s what happens when you send a woman. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Forgive me, sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate \u00a0<br>your greatness to those you mean to rule. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: My greatness will be better demonstrated when Wallace returns \u00a0<br>to Scotland and finds his country in ashes. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Hamish: William, there&#39;s riders approaching. Personal escort of the \u00a0<br>princess. You must have made an impression. \u00a0<br><br>William: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: I didn&#39;t think you were in the tent that long. \u00a0<br><br>William: (in French) Miss. \u00a0<br><br>Nicolette: (in French) A message from my mistress. \u00a0<br><br>William: (in French) Thank you. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Stephen: It&#39;s true. The English ships are moving up from the south. I don&#39;t \u00a0<br>know about the Welsh yet, but the Irish have landed. I had to see it with \u00a0<br>me own eyes before I could believe it. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: What the hell are the Irish doing fighting with the English? \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: I wouldn&#39;t worry about them. Didn&#39;t I tell you before, it&#39;s my \u00a0<br>island. \u00a0<br><br>William: Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh and assemble the council. Order \u00a0<br>it. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>William: Your island? \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: My island! \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Mornay: This time our only option is to negotiate. \u00a0<br><br>William: My army has marched for more days than I can remember, and we \u00a0<br>still have preparations to make. So I&#39;ll make this plain. We require every \u00a0<br>soldier you can summon. Your personal escorts, even yourselves. And we need \u00a0<br>them now. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: With such a force of raid against us, it is time to discuss other \u00a0<br>options. \u00a0<br><br>William: Other options? Don&#39;t you wish at least to lead your men onto the \u00a0<br>field and barter a better deal with Longshanks before you tuck tail and \u00a0<br>run? \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Sir William. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: We can not defeat this army. \u00a0<br><br>William: We can. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Sir William. \u00a0<br><br>William: And we will. We won at Stirling, and still you quibble. We won at \u00a0<br>York and you would not support us. If you will not stand up with us now \u00a0<br>then I say you&#39;re a coward. \u00a0<br><br>(Hamish swings axe) \u00a0<br><br>William: And if you are Scotsmen, I am ashamed to call myself one. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Please, Sir William. Speak with me alone. I beg you. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Now you&#39;ve achieved more than anyone ever dreamed, but fighting \u00a0<br>these odds it looks like rage, not courage. \u00a0<br><br>William: It&#39;s well beyond rage. Help me. In the name of Christ help \u00a0<br>yourselves. Now is our chance, now. If we join, we can win. If we win, well \u00a0<br>then we&#39;ll have what none of us have ever had before: a country of our own. \u00a0<br>You are the rightful leader, and there is strength in you. I see it. Unite \u00a0<br>us. Unite us. Unite the clans. Alright. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Robert: This can not be the way. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: You said yourself, the nobles will not support Wallace. So how does \u00a0<br>it help us to join the side that is slaughtered? \u00a0<br><br>Robert: I gave him my word. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: I know it is hard. Being a leader is. Now son, son, look at me. I \u00a0<br>can not be king. You, and you alone can rule Scotland. What I tell you, you \u00a0<br>must do. Not for me, not for yourself, but for your country. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Soldier: Make way. Coming through. Make way lads. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: The Bruce is not coming, William. \u00a0<br><br>William: He&#39;ll come. Mornay and Lochlan have come. So will the Bruce. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Quite a lovely gathering. Wouldn&#39;t you agree? \u00a0<br><br>General: The archers are ready, sire. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Not the archers. My scouts tell me their archers are miles away \u00a0<br>and no threat to us. Arrows cost money. Use up the Irish. Their dead cost \u00a0<br>nothing. And send in the infantry and cavalry. \u00a0<br><br>General: Infantry, cavalry, advance. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>(Irish advance and shake hands with the Scottish Army) \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Irish! \u00a0<br><br>William: Glad to have you with us. Watch this. \u00a0<br><br>General: Mornay, Lochlan? \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: I gave Mornay double his lands in Scotland and matching estates \u00a0<br>in England. Lochlan turned for much less. Archers. \u00a0<br><br>General: I beg your pardon, sire. Won&#39;t we hit our own troops? \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Yes, but we&#39;ll hit theirs as well. We have reserves. Attack. \u00a0<br><br>General: Archers. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Send in our reinforcements. \u00a0<br><br>General: Send in the rest. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: Bring me Wallace. Alive if possible. Dead, just as good. Send \u00a0<br>news of our victory. Shall we retire. \u00a0<br><br>(William hit by arrow) \u00a0<br><br>General: Protect the king. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! \u00a0<br><br>(William sees that Robert has duble crossed him. He is shocked) \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Get up! Get up! Get him out of here. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: Jesus! \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Go! \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: Ah! \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Campbell: I&#39;m dying. Let me be. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: No, your going to live. \u00a0<br><br>Campbell: I&#39;ve lived long enough to live free; proud to see you become the \u00a0<br>man you are. I&#39;m a happy man. \u00a0<br><br>(Hamish cries) \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Leper: I&#39;m the one who&#39;s rotting but I think your face looks graver than \u00a0<br>mine. Son, we must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved \u00a0<br>that. You saved your family, increased your land. In time, you will have \u00a0<br>all the power in Scotland. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Lands, titles, men, power, nothing. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: Nothing? \u00a0<br><br>Robert: I have nothing. Men fight for me, because if they do not, I throw \u00a0<br>them off my land and I starve their wives and their children. Those men who \u00a0<br>bled the ground red at Falkirk, they fought for William Wallace, and he \u00a0<br>fights for something that I&#39;ve never had. And I took it from him when I \u00a0<br>betrayed him and I saw it in his face on the battlefield, and it&#39;s tearing \u00a0<br>me apart. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: Well, all men betray. All lose heart. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: I don&#39;t want to lose heart. I want to believe as he does. I will \u00a0<br>never be on the wrong side again. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>(Mornay&#39;s dreaming) \u00a0<br><br>Mornay: (crying) Ah! \u00a0<br><br>(Wallace kills him and jumps out window) \u00a0<br><br>Scottish noble: Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay? \u00a0<br><br>Craig: Ay, Wallace rode into his bead chamber and killed him. More a \u00a0<br>liability now then ever he was. And there&#39;s no telling who&#39;ll be next. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Maybe you, maybe me. It doesn&#39;t matter. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: I&#39;m serious, Robert. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: So am I. Haha! \u00a0<br><br>(Lochlan drops on table) \u00a0<br><br>Craig: Search the place. \u00a0<br><br>Noble: Lochlan. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>(Common towns people talking) \u00a0<br><br>Common Scot: William Wallace killed 50 men. 50 in one. \u00a0<br><br>Commoner #2: 100 men, with his own sword. \u00a0<br><br>Commoner #3: Cut through them like Moses through the Red Sea. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: His legend grows. It will be worse than before. \u00a0<br><br>Hamilton: He rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town. And when he \u00a0<br>replenishes his numbers, -- \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: They&#39;re sheep, mere sheep. Easily dispersed if we strike the \u00a0<br>shepherd. Very well. Take a flock of your finest assassins and set a \u00a0<br>meeting. \u00a0<br><br>Hamilton: My lord, Wallace is renowned for his ability to smell an ambush. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct, he warmed to our \u00a0<br>future queen and would trust her. So we&#39;ll dispatch her with the notion \u00a0<br>that she comes in peace. \u00a0<br><br>Hamilton: My Lord, the princess might be taken hostage, or her life be put \u00a0<br>in jeopardy. \u00a0<br><br>Longshanks: My son would be most distressed by that. But if she were to be \u00a0<br>killed, we would soon find the King of France a useful ally against the \u00a0<br>Scots. You see, as king, you must find the good in any situation. \u00a0<br><br>Assassin: It&#39;s William Wallace sure. And he&#39;s given up his sword. Be ready. \u00a0<br>(lots of screaming, hut is burned) \u00a0<br><br>William: My lady. I received your message. This is the second time you&#39;ve \u00a0<br>warned me of danger. Why? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: There will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month. \u00a0<br>Food and weapons, they will-- \u00a0<br><br>William: Why do you help me? Why do you help me? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Because of the way you are looking at me now. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Stephen: Just when we thought all hope was lost, our noble saviors have \u00a0<br>arrived. Off with hoods. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: Sir William, we&#39;ve come to seek a meeting. \u00a0<br><br>William: Well, what&#39;s the point? You&#39;ve all sworn loyalty to Longshanks. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: An oath to a liar is no oath at all. Every man of us is ready to \u00a0<br>swear loyalty to you. \u00a0<br><br>William: So let the council swear it publicly. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: We can not. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Others think you \u00a0<br>pay the Mornay&#39;s wages. So we (?) to Edinburgh. Meet us two days from now. \u00a0<br>Give us your pardon and we&#39;ll unite behind you. Scotland will be one. \u00a0<br><br>William: One? You mean us and you. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: No, I mean this. It&#39;s the pledge of Robert the Bruce. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: You do know it&#39;s a trap. Tell him. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: I think if the Bruce wanted to kill you he&#39;d have done it already \u00a0<br>at Falkirk. \u00a0<br><br>William: Ay. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: I know, I saw. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: I ain&#39;t leaving him aside. What about the others? The scheming \u00a0<br>bastards couldn&#39;t agree on the color of shit. It&#39;s a trap, are you blind? \u00a0<br><br>William: We&#39;ve got to try. We can&#39;t do this alone. Joining the nobles is \u00a0<br>the only hope for our people. You know what happens if we don&#39;t take that \u00a0<br>chance? \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: What? \u00a0<br><br>William: Nothing. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: I don&#39;t want to be a martyr. \u00a0<br><br>William: Nor I. I want to live. I want a home, and children, and peace. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Do ya? \u00a0<br><br>William: Ay, I do. I&#39;ve asked God for these things. It&#39;s all for nothing if \u00a0<br>you don&#39;t have freedom. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: That&#39;s all a dream, William. \u00a0<br><br>William: A dream? Just a dream? What we&#39;ve been doing all this time; we&#39;ve \u00a0<br>lived that dream. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: You dream isn&#39;t about freedom. It&#39;s about Murron. You&#39;re doing this \u00a0<br>to be a hero because you think she sees you. \u00a0<br><br>William: I don&#39;t think she sees me. I know she does. And your father sees \u00a0<br>you, too. \u00a0<br><br>(Hamish hits William) \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: Jesus?! Shall I come with you. \u00a0<br><br>William: No, I&#39;ll go alone. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: I&#39;ll see you after. \u00a0<br><br>William: Right. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: Sooner rather than later, I hope. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Craig: He won&#39;t come. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: He will. I know he will. \u00a0<br><br>Guard: My Lord, he approaches. \u00a0<br><br>(Robert sees trap) \u00a0<br><br>Robert: NO! \u00a0<br><br>Craig: Stay out of it, Robert. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Get Away! Get Away! \u00a0<br><br>Craig: The Bruce is not to be harmed. That was the arrangement. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Robert: Father! You fooking bastard. Why? Why? \u00a0<br><br>Leper: Longshanks required Wallace. So did our nobles. That was the prize \u00a0<br>of your crown. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Die! I want you to die. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: Soon enough I&#39;ll be dead. And you&#39;ll be king. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: I don&#39;t want anything from you. You&#39;re not a man, and you&#39;re not my \u00a0<br>father. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: You are my son, and you have always known my mind. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: You deceived me. \u00a0<br><br>Leper: You let yourself be deceived. In your heart, you always knew what \u00a0<br>had to happen here. At last, you know what it means to hate. Now you&#39;re \u00a0<br>ready to be king. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: My hate will die with you. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Executioner: William Wallace, you stand intained of High Treason. \u00a0<br><br>William: Against whom? \u00a0<br><br>Executioner: Against your king. Have you anything to say? \u00a0<br><br>William: Never in my whole life did I swear allegiance to him. \u00a0<br><br>Executioner: It matters not. He is your king. Confess, and you may receive \u00a0<br>a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? Do \u00a0<br>you confess? Then on the morrow you shall receive your purification. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Guard: Your Highness. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: I will see the prisoner. \u00a0<br><br>Guard: We&#39;ve got orders from the king that no one-- \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: The king will be dead in a month and his son is a weakling. Who \u00a0<br>do you think will rule this kingdom? Now open this door. \u00a0<br><br>Guard: Majesty: Come on, back on your feet. \u00a0<br><br>(Guard kicks William) \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Stop it. Leave me. I said leave me. \u00a0<br><br>William: My lady. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Sir, I&#39;ve come to beg you to confess all and swear allegiance to \u00a0<br>the king, that he might show you mercy. \u00a0<br><br>William: Will he show mercy to my country? \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Mercy is to die quickly, perhaps even live in a tower. In time, \u00a0<br>who knows what could happen. \u00a0<br><br>William: If I swear to him, then all that I am is dead already. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: You will die. It will be awful. \u00a0<br><br>William: Every man dies, not every man really lives. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: Drink this. It will dull your pain. \u00a0<br><br>William: No. It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. For if I&#39;m \u00a0<br>senseless or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: I can&#39;t bear the thought of your torture. Take it. \u00a0<br><br>William: Alright. \u00a0<br><br>(They kiss, and William spits it out) \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace. \u00a0<br><br>Prince: You&#39;re quite taken with him, aren&#39;t you. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy, O \u00a0<br>great king, and win the respect of your own people. Even now you are \u00a0<br>incapable of mercy. And you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love. \u00a0<br><br>Prince: Before he lost his powers of speech he told me his one comfort was \u00a0<br>he would live to know Wallace was dead. \u00a0<br><br>Isabella: You see, death comes to us all. But before it comes to you, know \u00a0<br>this. Your plot dies with you. A child who is not of your line grows in my \u00a0<br>belly. Your son will not sit long on the thrown, I swear it. \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>(crowd cheers) \u00a0<br><br>William: I am so afraid. Give me the strength to die well. \u00a0<br><br>Common man: Here he comes! \u00a0<br><br>(crowd throws food at him) \u00a0<br><br>Executioner: Now behold the awful prize of treason. You will fall to your \u00a0<br>knees now. Declare yourself the king&#39;s loyal subject, and beg his mercy, \u00a0<br>and you shall have it. \u00a0<br><br>(no response) \u00a0<br><br>Executioner: Rope. Stretch him. That&#39;s it, stretch him. Pleasant, yes? Rise \u00a0<br>to your knees, kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, and you will feel no \u00a0<br>more. \u00a0<br><br>(no response) \u00a0<br><br>Executioner: Rack him. Enough? \u00a0<br><br>(they put William on the cross, and begin disembowelment) (William in \u00a0<br>serious pain) \u00a0<br><br>Executioner: It can all end, right now. Peace. Bliss. Just say it. Cry out \u00a0<br>mercy. \u00a0<br><br>(crowd repeats &quot;mercy&quot;) \u00a0<br><br>Executioner: Cry out. Just say it. Mercy. \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Mercy lad, mercy. \u00a0<br><br>Stephen: Jesus, mercy. \u00a0<br><br>Executioner: The prisoner wishes to say a word. \u00a0<br><br>William: FREEEEE-DOMMMMMM! \u00a0<br><br>(William is beheaded) \u00a0<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Robert (narrator): After the beheading, William Wallace&#39;s body was torn to \u00a0<br>pieces. His head was placed on top on London Bridge, his arms and legs sent \u00a0<br>to the four corners of Britain as a warning. It did not have the effect \u00a0<br>that Longshanks planned. And I, Robert the Bruce, rode out to pay homage to \u00a0<br>the armies of the English king and accept his endorsement of my crown. \u00a0<br><br>English noble: I hope you&#39;ve washed your ass this morning. It&#39;s about to be \u00a0<br>kissed by a king. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: Come. Lets get it over with. \u00a0<br><br>Robert: Stop. You have bled with Wallace, now bleed with me. \u00a0<br><br>Craig: Ah! \u00a0<br><br>Hamish: Yea! \u00a0<br><br>(Throws sword; sword lands) \u00a0<br><br>Crowd: WALLACE, WALLACE, WALLACE, WALLACE. AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH! \u00a0<br><br>(Scots charge) \u00a0<br>William (narrating): In the year of our Lord 1314, patriots of Scotland, \u00a0<br>starving and outnumbered, charged the fields at Bannockburn.
