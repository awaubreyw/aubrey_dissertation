Until one day I was just surfing through YouTube  when I came across a great post from Anita, who said that she was diagnosed with HIV and was healed through the help of this great herbal supplements of Dr Harvey, Sometimes I really wonder why people call him the  great Dr.Harvey, I never knew it was all because of the great and perfect work that he has been doing. So I quickly contacted him and told him everything happening to me, and he asked me a few questions and he said something I will never forget, that anyone who contacts him is always getting his/her cure within a few weeks after doing all he asks them to do. So I was amazed all the time I heard that from him, so I did everything he said only to see that at the very day which he said I will be cured and should go for a test to confirm my status, I went to hospital for the final test and the doctor after running the test said I&#39;m HIV negative wow.

I want to share the good news of how I was cured of non-small cell lung cancer. I was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer in April. I did surgery and later went for many rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Even though I always come out weak after chemotherapy, I had no choice than to continue with the treatments for months because that was my only chance of staying alive and beating the cancer with time. After 3 months of treatments, I realized that I became very weak and could not continue with the chemotherapy and that was when my doctor gave up on my case and told me that I have a period of 2-6 months left to live. I became so down and just wished death would come that day because I had suffered a lot only for my doctor to still give up on me. After a week that the doctor had told me about the bad news, my sister suggested that I don&#39;t give up and try some other remedies. So I started eating bitter apricot seed kernels along with Bromelain, and vitamins. So I continued to search for other home remedies on the internet when I came across a post on a health blog where a lady shared her experience and how she had to try some natural herbal medicines from a doctor and after 2 months of using the herbal medicines she got healed. So I decided to also give this medicine a try. I contacted Dr. Sani told him about my conditions and the treatments I have been using. He assured me that he can cure me with some herbal medicines. He prepared the herbal medicines and shipped them to me through courier, after some weeks of using the herbal medicines. I got cured and went to see my doctor for a check up where he confirmed that I am completely free from all the cancer disease and traces. My happiness now is without limit.
