Then He breathed gently into the shape.  The man&#39;s eye&#39;s opened and he began to live.  God called him Adam.<br><br>The Lord made a beautiful garden for him to live in.  The garden, called Eden, was full of many wonderful things.  Beautiful flowers grew everywhere.  Birds sang in the trees, streams flowed through the valley and animals roamed across the fields.<br><br>God had made the man in His image to keep Him company and look after the world.<br><br>God brought all the animals to Adam one at a time to be given their names.  &quot;Elephant&quot;, he would say, or &quot;Tiger&quot;, or &quot;Porcupine&quot;.<br><br>But God felt sorry for Adam.  &quot;None of these animals is really like him,&quot; thought God, &quot;he needs someone to share his life.  Someone who cares for him and who he can care for.&quot;<br><br>That night, God took a rib from Adam&#39;s side and made a woman.  When Adam awoke the following morning, he found a wife, Eve, lying asleep beside him.  Adam was so happy.  He took her hand and she woke up.  She looked up at him and smiled.<br><br>God told the man and woman that it was their job to take care of their new home.  God blessed them, saying, &quot;All this is for you.  Help yourself to anything you like.  But never touch the tree in the middle of the Garden.  That tree gives knowledge of good and evil.  The day you eat its fruit, you will die.&quot;<br><br>God did not mean that Adam and Eve would drop down dead the moment they ate the fruit from the tree.  He meant that in time they would die with out His Spirit dwelling in them.<br><br>One day, Adam and Eve were gathering berries for dinner when she heard a silky voice behind her.<br><br>&quot;Has God told you that you can eat the fruit from all the trees?&quot; the voice asked softly.  Eve turned around to see a snake talking to her.<br><br>&quot;God has told us we can eat all the fruit except for what grows on The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,&quot; Eve told the serpent.<br><br>&quot;Oh come now, that&#39;s silly!  I hardly think such a lovely fruit would do you any harm,&quot; the serpent lied. &quot;God knows that if you eat from The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil you&#39;ll become just like God, and will be able to decide for yourself what is right and what is wrong.&quot;<br><br>The woman looked at the fruit and thought how tasty it looked. She thought how wonderful it would be to be as wise and powerful as God.  She believed the serpent&#39;s lie and ate the fruit and also gave some to Adam, who was with her, and he took a bite as well.<br><br>She felt a strange feeling in the pit of her stomach.  She fidgeted and wondered what was wrong with her.  Suddenly she realized that she was feeling guilty -- she had disobeyed God and knew she&#39;d done something wrong.<br><br>As soon as they ate the fruit a change came over Adam and Eve.  They became unhappy and fearful of God.<br><br>Adam and Eve heard God calling them.  Without thinking, they dived into the bushes, but God knew where they were.  When God asked them if they had eaten from The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil that He had told them not to touch, they blamed each other for their sins.<br><br>God was sad that Adam and Eve had disobeyed them.  He told them that they had to leave the Garden of Eden, &quot;From now on you&#39;ll have to scratch a living from the soil.  You&#39;ll need to make clothes and grow food.

First off ill ask you a few questions<br><br>1) if you stretch a spring(adding only work to the spring) is it the same mass after?\u00a0<br><br>2) If i point a laser pointer into space is the light in straight line into the cosmos? if not would knowing the speed of light in various materials give you the proper curve ? more so what dimension is the slope of the tangent vector to 4D space?\u00a0<br><br>3) Did we evolve from monkeys?<br><br>4) Mass cannot be created or destroyed by Antoine Lavoisier is it law?<br><br>5) Sir Isaac Newton said that god was necessary to validate his calculations, is this still a valid way to explain why planets stay in orbit even though, by newton&#39;s calculations the orbits are unstable?\u00a0<br><br>6) Science claims to have an answer for everything<br><br>7) Radioactive dating is inaccurate<br><br><br>Alright Ill give you the correct answers. If you get any false you have no justification to bitch and whine that evolution is incorrect.\u00a0<br><br>1) No its not. Its mass increases by exactly (Fxd)/c^2. (E=mc^2)<br><br>2) Its not a straight line because the earth is rotating and knowing speed of light in various materials well give a curve thats slightly inaccurate. The speed of light is slower near a excessive body of mass and faster in space. GPS systems due in fact take off a second or two when pinging for your position which ends up being within 10m. the tangent is 3D space.<br>3) NO! that would be like saying you came from your cousin. We came from a common ancestor think greatx~10000 grandparents.\u00a0<br><br>4) False its not law. If i were to try to split an proton, the energy added to split the proton well create a new quark and in turn a new proton thus resulting in 2. Matter is converted into energy via nuclear processes like the atom bomb. We take heavy atoms like uranium, they split. Mass is lost and E=mc^2.\u00a0<br><br>5) Nope. Newton didn&#39;t have the math and didn&#39;t want to admit there was something he didn&#39;t know.\u00a0perturbation theory and KAM theorem was invented and it turned out the universe was not unstable.\u00a0<br><br>6)\u00a0Mercury has slower time than the rest of the planets thus making its orbit slower to us. People thought our calculations were &quot;good enough&quot; and didn&#39;t think of relativity until einstein came about. After many cases like this, many scientists agree that there could be another &quot;E=mc^2&quot; equation we have not developed yet.\u00a0<br><br>7) Its accurate and i personally done it and it agreed with the theoretical mathematics. Its based off half lives. carbon 14 decays away to stable carbon 12 at a measurable rate when not exposed to sunlight/elements/etc. We then look at atmospheres inside rocks where carbon 14 was left to decay without interference so we measure what&#39;s left and what should be there, and find the difference then compare it to the half life equations. We also do several other tests with other radioactive materials, and they all point to the same age of the atmosphere inside the material", "comment_date": "2015-04-22T20:17:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mois\u00e9s Nieto", "comment_text": "Nice video, very well narrated! c:<br>At <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wissIOikrqc&amp;t=3m58s\">3:58</a>, is the arrow going from the insect to the plannts right? o: That way it looks like plants are directly eating insects (which would be true for the carnivorous plants :P)", "comment_date": "2015-04-22T20:16:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Who is John Galt?", "comment_text": "dat mass", "comment_date": "2015-04-22T20:11:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmed Sanai", "comment_text": "And where is the proof for this", "comment_date": "2015-04-22T20:08:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jackthaone", "comment_text": "Did it again awesome video guys and like the saying goes &quot;we humans are so smart but so stupid&quot;.", "comment_date": "2015-04-22T20:07:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johann Abarca", "comment_text": "Is it possible we can break the laws of physics<br>", "comment_date": "2015-04-22T20:06:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miguel Sardinha", "comment_text": "there was another mass extinction, when started to appear life forms that did photosynthesis, oxygen is an oxidant, and most of the life form died because of the oxygen, surviving the photosynthetic creatures", "comment_date": "2015-04-22T20:03:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Marvin", "comment_text": "I like fairy tales like these", "comment_date": "2015-04-22T20:01:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "master97061", "comment_text": "Faith in humanity lost once more due to people we chose to be fucking leaders <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ThanksObama\">#ThanksObama</a>", "comment_date": "2015-04-22T20:01:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ouroboros", "comment_text": "Jesus did it?", "comment_date": "2015-04-22T20:00:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason", "comment_text": "Power is always changing and shifting.

Just because you cannot see something does not automatically mean that it does not exist. I mean look around you right now, can you see the very air around you? No you cannot, but you know it\u2019s there because if not you would be not. Can you see gravity? No you cannot, but you know it is there because you can feel its weight upon you. What I am saying is, just because you cannot see something it does not mean that it does not exist. You might say there is proof of these things, wind and gravity, and there is no proof of God. Well you are wrong again as there is proof in everything that is and will ever be. There are thousands of things that point towards and tell of the existence of God. The bible told of the big bang far before science even had the slightest of clues about it. All science did was remove God from the equation and boom they made millions of people into atheists by just removing God from the theory, that\u2019s all they needed to do. All science have ever done is discover and learn from the things around them, the things that were always there, the things that God created. All they are doing in sense is reverse engineering Gods work, and then claiming it as their own. I could write hundreds of pages on why God is real but you atheists would rather believe that everything came from nothing and therefore is and means nothing. Satan wants you to believe in anything but God, and in doing so you are openly denying God making you not welcome in his kingdom of heaven rendering you hell bound upon your death, in doing this Satan wins. What better way to disprove God than with evolution, aliens and so on\u2026 its perfect, and you fools believe it. I mean if you were an super advanced alien race why would you fly around making random Irrelevant appearances that are slightly but not completely disguised, just enough so, that you cannot make out who or what it is, but you can see that it is not human? \u00a0To claim such things as not being an attempt at a mass deceit of the population is irrational, because what better way to disprove the bible than with aliens? Why haven\u2019t the aliens come down yet and said hello? Because there are no aliens to say hello, they&#39;re fallen angels and demons. Evolution is also false, as many people have pointed out its countless undeniable flaws. There is little and next to no proof of its truth, but there is allot next to infinite proof of its falsities. Yet it is enforced into the minds of the public through many sources of media and entertainment as truth when it is nothing more than a \u2018theory\u2019. Lucifer wants you to go to hell, and he is already in control of the world\u2019s most powerful people just like in the days of Noah, Egypt and Babylon. He will and has deceived you and will continue to do so until Jesus returns. \u201cAnd no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.\u201d Believe in Christ and you will be saved John <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wissIOikrqc&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a>.
