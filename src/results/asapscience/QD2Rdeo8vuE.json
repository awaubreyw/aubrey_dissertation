Yes very cool, will it change the world No. Why? Money... yes you can print super drugs, but those able to do it will make it soo expensive that only 1% of the people will be able to afford it. I know i sound depressing but that the way the world work.. Just think back 20 years (if you&#39;re old enough) and think of all technology promissed you will realise that many promisses were made, few were ralised. Take the DVD for example it was sold as awesome interactive movies and all.. how many interactive movies have you seen? They were saying you will have a lot of language... I rarely find a DVD with more than 2... All in all... the money side always win. So expect the technology to be limited to those with the money.", "comment_date": "2014-06-11T18:47:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Defined Edits", "comment_text": "Can you 3d print a 3d printer??", "comment_date": "2014-06-10T19:42:39Z", "likes_count": 134}, {"comment_by": "seatbelttruck", "comment_text": "I&#39;m EXTREMELY looking forward to 3D printing organs being perfected.

Wether its, hate, poor, stress, fear. We need to help each other out of it and have peace of mind. Not only us but the animal kingdom as well. Using psychedelics and meditation we can speak to the animal species with our spiritual voice. then they can speak to the animals below them, then them to them then them. etc. Then we will all work together to have food. and face each others differences. no matter how different. We can perfect the system and rebuild the base if needed. Then once when every one becomes self concious, using psychedelics we can surpass every bad feeling, and transform, together, into something unique. And help each other have fun with it. So we no longer have worries.<br><br>Post repost fuckin like!!! We need to make a plan, and forgive each other. Need to face each others demons together. and see the shadow that is ourselfs, and learn from it!!!!! We can save us!! Thank you everyone, you all mean a lot to me. we all influence each other, and we are all one anothers parents. We all need to talk. (ALL) Like responsible beings, to bring about this plan. AS I take my mind to new heights I&#39;m mesmerized by the lights . The Reds Greens and Whites. The blues are too bright, Ive had to use all the might to understand the fight. But i held on tight and now I&#39;m wise in my sight. Now the Christmas spirit I can hear it, I cant fear it anymore. It told me to toss all the anger to the floor cuz with hatred in your heart you won&#39;t see it anymore. If you look closely you will finally see. see it fight for the rights of all humanity while it tries to save it from the grave and calamity. Like yosammidy Sam totin his gun when he can. We have all got a place here and were just standing hand in hand but our hands are unclean and although it may seem that were we are living green our minds are in place stuck somewhere in between misery and money.

Once you can <b>print</b> entire chips using additive manufacturing, however, this all changes. Your phone can be 1/4 the size it is now, as almost the entire phone would be one big single component with no PCB required to glue it all together. Want to add more RAM? Add new wireless capability? More flash or less flash?
