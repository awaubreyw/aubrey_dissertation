In the West, it was first isolated by Vannoccio Biringuccio and described in 1540.<br><br>For some time, China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the Xikuangshan Mine in Hunan. The industrial methods for refining antimony are roasting and reduction with carbon or direct reduction of stibnite with iron.<br><br>The largest applications for metallic antimony is an alloy with lead and tin and the lead antimony plates in lead\u2013acid batteries.

I love your channel and being a child that hopes one day to grow up to be a scientist, I love when something creative can help me with something logical ( I don&#39;t have a logical mindset). Since I love science so much, I&#39;ve been looking into recent discoveries such as the verification of the 4 &quot;placeholder&quot; elements. Is there any way that you could upload a new video that includes the 4 newly discovered elements? That would make me so happy, especially since my friends think it&#39;s crazy that I&#39;ve memorized the periodic table. I want it to be as accurate as possible! Thank you so much, and have fun making new videos on your channel.
