When people say &#39;&#39;money doesn&#39;t buy&#39;you happiness&#39;&#39; they usually say that for people who marry for money or want money to get everything they want.<br>But the truth is that money is simply a tool that helps you do and get what will really makes you happy easier. And that is being around what you love most.<br>This can include family, friends or a specific location. I had a teacher once who got rid of a lot of wealth because he didn&#39;t need it. He only needed a little money to get and be what made him truly happy.<br><br>So please don&#39;t think that more money=more happiness. Because it doesn&#39;t. Not only will you get used to having a lot of money, which will result in you not being as happy as you were when you got the money, but when you have a lot of money then more money doesn&#39;t make a difference.<br>For example: getting a car is amazing. So it 2 or 3 cars. But when you have 50 cars then another 3 wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference in your happiness. In fact, you will get so used to having a lot that you don&#39;t have much else to gain. This will result in a DECREASE in happiness because you gained so much in your life that reaching a point where that gain keeps slowing down will frustrate you.<br><br>A limo and the most expensive clothes don&#39;t make you happy. What makes you happy is being around what you love most. Money is tool that will make achieving that easier. It gets you through life. But money=/=being happy. That happiness depends on what you do with it and knowing how much you need to be happy.

This allows happiness to flow freely and easily. Forgiveness is powerful, acceptance is also strong, and love is the healing force. Love dissolves the negative thought patterns, more love means more respect, appreciation, approval, support, friendship. It means a smile, a hug, a compliment, a helping hand, heartfelt thanks, praise, a gift, encouragement. It is that easy. I wish for you peace, love and harmony.
