But the comment section does. There are thousands of people with death anxiety. Starting from like 10 maybe to even 70-80 I guess. The thing that makes us feel better is the fact that ALL OF US fear death, but not all of us are READY to speak up about it. It is a tough, scary, anxious, unknown, mysterious and terrifying topic to discuss, but still, some of us share their experiences of death here. Knowing that I am not alone makes me feel better. It sounds awful, but it\u2019s true. This is what makes life pretty and precious.<br>We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a God or Goddess or many Gods that created universe, us etc. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some Higher Powers. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s energy. We don\u2019t know anything. And if there\u2019s nothing at the end and we\u2019re just gonna sleep forever\u2026.maybe\u2026.that\u2019s for better? Maybe we\u2019re created like that for the better? The best theory is reincarnation. It would be amazing, cause it\u2019s not boring. I guess if there\u2019s heaven and hell we\u2019ll just get bored if we\u2019ll forever spend our time there. So maybe \u201cnothing\u201d is not that bad. <br>Ofc, I\u2019m just trying to convince myself, but maybe\u2026it\u2019s really not that bad\ud83e\udd14<br>The one thing I really understand after reading mangas about vampires is that losing the ones you love constantly is as painful as death. You live forever. You see everyone around you dying. Life becomes meaningless. You\u2019ve tried everything. You\u2019ve learned every possible language, you\u2019ve studied every possible science, but it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re alone. You\u2019re just on your own. No one is around you because you\u2019ll stay and they\u2019ll go. At that point living forever becomes your curse. <br>You may say \u201cnah, at least I\u2019m alive\u201d. Dude, when you will experience someone you know dying you will understand what I mean. And you will be able to imagine other ppl dying. It would be great if all of us could live forever, but now in 2022 it is not possible, fortunately or unfortunately. <br>All of those who watch this is 2022 will be most likely dead by 2100-2150. Congrats if you read it and you made it to 2200, I\u2019m proud of you. But I guess I\u2019m already dead by that time. It\u2019s strange to say so, but it is most like will be so. I\u2019ll die. And you\u2019ll die. I\u2019m gonna cry because it\u2019s scary. The only key is to save money if you don\u2019t have them, then find a therapist and attend him or her to clear up your mind. This is the best decision I\u2019ve found so far. I hope I\u2019ll get to talk about it with the therapist in the next 2 years, because I\u2019m getting more and more anxious about it each year. <br>My old friend ones answered me after I\u2019d asked him about his attitude towards death: \u201cI don\u2019t think about it and I don\u2019t see a point of thinking about it and fearing it, because I can\u2019t change it and I will die. I have to think about my LIFE instead of thinking about my DEATH. So, i just don\u2019t think about it. That\u2019s it\u201d. And he is damn right. It (most likely) won\u2019t matter after we die. So not to waste the life we have, it is our duty and responsibility to live lives we want to live. <br>You want to be a doctor? Be a doctor. You want to quit your university? Quit it. You want to travel around the world. Then hecking book tickets and go. <br>You\u2019ll say \u201cwell, easy to say\u201d. Yes. It\u2019s easier to say. But if you won\u2019t do what you want \u2014 when time comes to leave the world of those who are alive \u2014 you\u2019ll regret and try to breath as hard as you\u2019ll only be able to and do at least anything to change it. But it\u2019s too late. Time\u2019s up. <br>This is where we come to the point that we have to do everything to end each and everyday with a thought \u201cI\u2019m good, I\u2019m great, I\u2019m thankful and I\u2019m happy, I won\u2019t regret even if I die right now at the moment of thinking about it\u201d. That\u2019s the key to not regret when it comes to an end. <br>Thanks for reading this. I had to get into the dialogue with the comment section and the keyboard to calm myself down. I hope you all will live a healthy, happy, long, interesting and unpredictable lives. Rip to all ppl who are not with us and joy to all of those who read this comment. Have a great day and a great life. We\u2019ll all meet alive or dead, but we will definitely meet and this thought comforts me a lot. Thank you\u2665\ufe0f<br><br>And yes. The main thing. I\u2019ve decided that if there\u2019s no reincarnation, no souls, no precious lives and stuff them I choose to be born and experience life and then die rather than not being born at all. I\u2019m thankful to my parents and especially to my mother. I\u2019m blessed with being born. And it\u2019s beautiful. I choose to be born, live and die. It\u2019s better than not being born at all.

Human beings at the end of the day are energy themselves. And when we die, that energy does not, it just changes form. It evolves. It moves on. And where it leaves us with the concept of the afterlife is in my opinion two scenarios.<br>1) Is how other people have theorised the afterlife is, that it\u2019s basically like a place of your creation.Your best memories are all there, your loved ones are there to meet you, you can basically do anything that you can do in the real world in this world,only you can do it with a thought.If you want to play video games again, you can do that, if you want to watch old war films all day long(if you want the day night cycle in your own heaven, you can, it\u2019s a world where your imagination doesn\u2019t die).<br><br>2)And here it\u2019s the most likely scenario <br>We are born, then we die, then our energy based life forms just move on to the next cycle(When I mean the next cycle, I mean I\u2019m going with the theory that time is a circle, when the end of time happens, the birth of another one begins, time can be different there, or act the same, we go back to the beginning of our own life again, we bring our own previous experiences from the previous life, not the memories but the lessons, we make different choices, our grandparents could make different choices which results in a different outcome. We might end up being born with a different parent which results in us having different personalities as a result or we might end up being stillborn which you will have to go the next cycle. The cycle keeps going over and over and it doesn\u2019t end, it doesn\u2019t stop. <br><br>And here\u2019s the thing, this isn\u2019t the first cycle, you probably had some dreams, or nightmares of previous cycles: a cycle where we end in a nuclear war, or a virus has destroyed us all. The concept of a multiverse could be vastly different here, as instead of them existing in different dimensions, they are merely the next or previous cycle of our lives. <br><br>Or it could be a combination of both, we don\u2019t know how this works, people have seen only darkness and other people have seen things and I say, that\u2019s because when we become energy, we can\u2019t see, we can\u2019t hear, but we can think, we can feel, we are one with the universe after all.

However, you are experiencing it to a level that it is having such a huge impact on your daily life and psychological well being, so it is certainly something that needs addressing. <br><br>I would advise that in a case like your own you do get some additional ongoing support to deal with this phobia as it has apparently reached a level that needs some form of clinical intervention. There are some types of therapy available that deal with phobia very specifically that would be useful for you. I would advise that you go to your doctor to get advice on this and referral to the appropriate service.<br><br><br>In the context of this type of counseling I can\u2019t provide ongoing support; but I can give you some tips that I hope will help in the meantime until you are able to get this additional support. <br><br><br><b>I\ua78cm Scared of Death, Please Help! - About Islam</b><br><br><br><b>Should Muslim Feel Anxious about Death?</b><br><br><br>Alhamdulilah as a Muslim, you have lots of solutions at your fingertips that should help at least take the edge off these difficulties.<br><br><b>Increase Your Good Deeds</b><br><br><br>As I said, fear of death is something we probably all experience to some extent. It\u2019s not a pleasant feeling to be so anxious, however, there are ways that we can use it to our benefit, particularly as Muslims. We know that death is surely coming to us, and we know that when that time comes, we must face our deeds. This can be very scary for everyone as we have all committed some level of sin in our life.<br><br><br>However, with this knowledge, we can use this to push to do good to ensure that our scale of good deeds is heavy on the day that it really matters. Use this as an opportunity to increase your good deeds. This may in the form of increasing your acts of ibadah, doing more voluntary prayer and reading more Quran for example.<br><br><br><b>Al Hadi - The Source of All Guidance</b><br><br><br><b>Al Hadi - The Source of All Guidance</b><br><br><br>Additionally, use this as a motivation to restrain from sin. However, at the same time, do not lose hope in Allah\u2019s Mercy, in the knowledge that He loves to forgive and He will forgive you as long as you continue to turn to Him for guidance and in repentance. Find comfort in this and this will help to reduce the anxiety pscyhologically, but also the physiological effects of feeling anxious too.<br><br><br><b>Remember Allah</b><br><br>Sometimes, the feeling that you\u2019re having possibly can be attributed to the whispers of Shaytan, especially if they are distracting you from Allah and turning to Him. Whether it is or not, there is no harm in making sure to tackle this also by keeping Allah in mind all the time and repelling Shaytan. <br><br><br>Make sure not to neglect your morning and evening adhkar to protect you from this, as well as doing all the necessary duas as you do different acts during the day right down to those you say before you enter the bathroom and so on. This ensures Allah is always close and Shaytan is not given the space to enter your mind with intrusive thoughts.<br><br><br>May Allah guide you out of this distressing situation that you are in and may you find great comfort in His remembrance.<br><br><br><a href=\"https://islammessage.org/en/article/16856/I%EA%9E%8Cm-Scared-of-Death,-Please-Help\">https://islammessage.org/en/article/16856/I%EA%9E%8Cm-Scared-of-Death,-Please-Help</a>", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T04:15:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dumbel bells", "comment_text": "I&#39;m scared from afterlife<br>Because I don&#39;t follow religions that much<br><br>Probably I&#39;ll land directly in hell if there&#39;s afterlife", "comment_date": "2022-04-17T11:14:09Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "3rd Ay", "comment_text": "U", "comment_date": "2022-04-17T03:50:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "99 problems but a fish ain't one", "comment_text": "My biggest worry when I die is my wife selling my hunting and fishing stuff for what I said I paid.", "comment_date": "2022-04-16T15:38:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jim Birch", "comment_text": "And hear I thought I was alone with this....Kidding....Be happy", "comment_date": "2022-04-15T22:51:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tom Skinner", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not afraid of death, I just don&#39;t want to be there when it happens -  W.

He went out with his friends on a normal night to get some fast food and smoke some weed. No different than any other day. And he ended up dead at 19.<br><br>At the time, my friends asked me if I was ok. I said I was. I hadn&#39;t been close w him since we were kids, and I&#39;m now 22, why wouldn&#39;t I be ok? I went to his service. It lasted the whole weekend and I got to really process and feel the grief of my family. The regrets they held about how they treated him. I got drunk and asked my friends to sit on call w me.<br><br>I cried and I screamed and I ranted and I told them I loved them and I poured my heart out about all the times I felt like I&#39;d hurt them or been cruel, of all the things I regretted. Not once, in my drunken state (which all my friends will tell you is when I&#39;m most honest) did I care about myself. I was trying to make amends with them.

Death is the meaning of life.&quot;\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvZdXRP6Tig&amp;t=5m36s\">5:36</a> &quot;We should work to allow people to lead happier &amp; longer lives.&quot; <br><br>\r<br>\r<br>I think this is a philosophical contradiction. If death is what makes life meaningful, then the best way to bring meaning to people&#39;s lives is to help them die, which is an absurd statement. If a longer life makes life more meaningful, then to bring meaning to people&#39;s lives is to care for their wellbeing and make them live forever. Therefore, living things that live forever have infinite meaning, and finite things that live have either no meaning or finite meaning, and dead things are infinitely meaningless. Death is what makes life meaningless. If we have the power to create everlasting meaning in life, we must also have the power to abolish death.  \r<br><br>This refutes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvZdXRP6Tig&amp;t=7m16s\">7:16</a> &quot;we can choose to have a meaningful life,&quot; but only if we have immortality. However, one can interpret that the fear of death makes life meaningful, but why fear what is impending, like fearing puberty? If it is because of survival instinct, why can&#39;t we evolve to have longer life spans if death is the ultimate predator? Therefore, the fear of death is not only meaningless, but it is a perfectly rational feeling to have. I find it strange how we govern our possessions against covetous thieves who only take what they ought, yet we freely give our souls away to the thief of death that destroys everything you know and love. <br>Why live life to the fullest and not the emptiest? The happy and the sad, rich and poor, the successful and failures, are but forgotten vapors anyway. And as long as there is no life after death, the world should have every reason to commit suicide. Surely death is life&#39;s greatest quandary; the enemy of existence. Correct me if this logic is not bulletproof. <br><br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvZdXRP6Tig&amp;t=8m12s\">8:12</a> &quot;I&#39;m constantly on a quest to deal with my own fear of death...&quot; @AsapSCIENCE you will never break free from the lifelong fear of death if you do not believe there is life after death. Seekers of life are commended, yet founders of it are despised imposters. So I, like most christians, found life, and broke free from that fear after hearing what Jesus Christ offers to those who call upon him in John 5:24. He said what no king, prophet, or rabbonic teacher has ever said, <br>\u201cI am the light of the world! I am the bread of life! I am the resurrection and the life! I am the way, the truth, and the life! I am living water! I have the keys of hell and of death! I am he that lives, and was dead, and, behold, I am alive forevermore!\u201d \r<br><br>To overcome the fear of death and your sins, examine yourself on the ten commandments, fall on the mercy of God by repenting of your sins, turning away from your iniquity, putting your faith in Jesus, and be born again, and God will grant you the free gift of everlasting life and will make you a new person with a clean heart that desires righteousness and holiness. Why? Because your fear of death is evidence you need life and righteousness.

Alot of years pass and ur alive again. Why am i saying that we are gonna live again? Short answer, Multiverse. The multiverse is something that is full of universes, those universes are like copies of ours but different, So yes. You will <b>100%</b> Live again once you die. But also, you wouldnt even know your dead, u could not see darkness, we will return to the phase we were once. Again, we were like that for 13 billion years! THERES no reason to fear death, we all were dead for 13 billion years and We will go through it again in our life time. We will wake up in a universe with different stuff, NOT humans.

It&#39;s a way to rationalize one&#39;s own suffering in the presence of others, but it is also unnatural for us to deal with such suffering. Before the advent of agriculture we lived very low stress lives for if life had been so harsh stress wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal-but it is. We are a highly social species and we did not evolve to see others in pain without the ability to end their suffering or comfort them. Studies like that prove only that we did not evolve for it.

I wasted time not starting the things I wanted to start and now that I did, my demon, health anxiety, is telling me that after all the tests I have gotten, this new thing will be the thing that they have missed all along (and when it turns out to be nothing, I wonder what the next thing to panic over will be). So I&#39;m trying to see past just the health aspect of my anxiety and am trying to get to the source. Is it death? Because I do fear it. I used to not, back when I was more spiritual. Now I&#39;m more practical and I fear death and there not being anything after it. I used to believe in multiple lives. But then I got into science and real world problems have held me very close to earth. Now I feel like I&#39;ve lost my faith in there being a plan. I fear wasting time in this life because I love this life, I want to experience so much still, I&#39;m not asking for a lot. But also I want there to be more to this. I want to see my family members again, see my past pets and friends. I want to be reborn, even if I don&#39;t remember this life. I used to think my soul is eternal and has learned from all of these lives and I in some way still believe that with my heart and soul, but my brain is making me doubt that. I would rather live in ignorant bliss believing what some might consider hokus pokus talk, rather than be ultra realistic and think we&#39;re all just nothing, come from nothing and will become nothing. If there&#39;s an end to us and the Universe, what&#39;s the point at all? And what&#39;s worse, feeling everything all at once or feeling nothing at all? I can&#39;t decide if I&#39;d rather have my overly active anxious brain that finds meaning in everything or a dull depressive brain that doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s any meaning at all. Idk what to do with my thoughts. Anyway, thanks for reading my diary entry for today. And I had such a good day before I googled some symptoms. Maybe that&#39;s the point? Just have a good day. And then another. And then another. Until there are no more days. I still refuse to believe there is no afterlife but, maybe I should focus on being alive right now rather than thinking of being dead one day. &lt;3", "comment_date": "2021-09-17T00:21:18Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "DarkGames", "comment_text": "Well, I do not really fear death, I fear what happens to me after I die", "comment_date": "2021-09-16T20:57:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "No Worries", "comment_text": "We are , You are Consciousness taking form temporarily as this form.

I\u2019m actually a catholic so I should believe in an afterlife but I still fear death because I also think about the possibility of it not being true, because there\u2019s some things in my religion that been proven wrong... I want to believe there\u2019s an afterlife but believing there\u2019s enteral punishment in the afterlife is terrifying and just seems so unfair to deserve enteral torment for a life you\u2019ve only lived for temporary. Plus I do things that are against my religion like being a LGBTQ member. There\u2019s technically nothing morally wrong with being a LGBTQ member. How you\u2019re supposed to hurt anyone as one? You can\u2019t unless people make you a problem. <br>But I\u2019m actually here to give some advice for anyone whose suffering like me. And No i\u2019ll not be religious. I\u2019m gonna give some advice that goes for everyone. We can dream. When we sleep we can dream. That\u2019s probably where the concept of an afterlife comes from. If you don\u2019t wanna believe in nothiness after death. Maybe try practicing lucid dreaming so you can control your dreams and have a image of what life after death is like.. Maybe life after death is like dreaming because dreaming is where our conscious goes when we sleep and dying is like sleeping forever. So you can practice lucid dreaming to clam you down about it. I can kinda lucid dream, I can remember my dreams (I mostly get dreams that piss me off or scare me). But if you learn to control them then maybe you can learn to control life after death. <br>Another form of advice. I took on a new hobby to coop with the fact that death is inventible. I tried sculpting dead people to help me forget about death while also accepting it. Sounds weird but it actually helps.

I am getting paranoid to be honest an cry nights about it a lots!!! I am worried about what will happen after. And here is thing i think this thoughts dont come from just regular day or some you know what i mean? It all has reason why we think this and how we worried. So heres my reason. <br><br>1.i wanted somenthing interesting to happen in life. Dude i was scareddd like when i mean scared i mean SCARED. I thought my life was boring and full of nothing. Besides if you see this now the time i wrote it we are in quarantine!!! In home 24/7 (every time) and i got all weird and scared and lost hope of everything. Unmotivated and stuff.i thought dude this is end of world. Covid will get us all and thats it 0-0<br><br>2.i was in love dude xddd yeah weirddd but i was in love with one boy and i liek him a lot. After i lsot feelings i just wanted someone to hug me at nights and tell me if i die they die too.<br><br>3.i daydreamed a lot and realised everything good is in dreams and now these things wont happen and i wont be living happy interesting life.<br><br>4.i didnot have favourite hobby or anything not even color.<br><br>NOW THAT YOU RED THESE YOU REALISE SUCH DUMB REASONS. But i needed all of these attention and love!! But now...nothing changed and i am healing. Time to time :))) i realised. This is just age i have teen age. If you ARE NOT A TEENAGER READING THIS! Its normal to think about this. People must be crazy not worrying about this. I even started being paranoid about what if other humans not real. Or maybe i am in dream YEAH. This PHOBIA got me scared of other things too!!!<br><br>Right now how do i make myself calm? Well how i did AND IF YOU CANT DO THOSE TIPS I WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER ONES I LOVE YOU ALL EVEN IF I DONT KNOW YOU!!!<br><br>1. I belive in god. Here if you dont its okay to be honest!!! But i used to think what if doesnot exist and that all was because of DEATHHH. I wanted to know what happens after so i forgot heaven and stuff. I was so scared and wanted answer!!!so i forgot about god... but now if he really doesnot exist i belive in him and i think its no bad. I think thats better than beliving in nothing. He is in my heart tells me everything will be okay. I dont know if heaven exists or hell but everyone makes mistakes so its alright we all have this moment okay?  So i tell myself if i will die i will see god. I will be with my loved ones.<br><br>2. Sometimes when my phobi of death triggers me a lot, heaven doesnot calm me down ( i still belive in god) but what does is music. I listen to music i love and sleep with it. Mostly OK heres weird thing but listening to ABBA and watching f.r.i.e.d.s all that things make me calm and fun. I AINT FROM MEXICO BUT WHEN I THINK OF MEXICO I GET ALL HYPED AND HAPPY AND LIKE YAAAS MUSICC!!!! Haha i know this is dumb but it helps meee!!!!<br><br>3. Ok if neither works and i have serious breakdown, hugging helps. If you dont have anyone to hug :C imagine people who have died already. What do you think you are alive now!. People 10-15 or more years older. They are gonna probably die first right? But why are not they worried? Why is it that they happy. Some people want to die and are not scared of death. ( please dont die, i love you and be with me ... &lt;3 ) amazing people who have done lot in life. People who are about to die laugh and smile because THEY ARE HAPPY THAT THEY LIVED LIFE and happy that made their life better!!! (Thank you Kate Diamondlake for calming me down your message was really helpfull &lt;3 @Kate Diamondlake ) <br><br>4. If even that doesnot help i belive our body parts will switch to robotic parts. In 2050 or sum. Tbh i dont belive in it that much but yeah i like it. I mean human dies from cancer or heart attack right? People live mor ethan 100 !!! Some of them even 117!!! So you will live too!!! You are amazing. <br><br>5. EVEN IF THAT DIDNOT HELP because you suffer from disease or cancer hear me out. You are in battle and you will win this!!! Strong beautiful human you are girl boy or royal (i love you every single way! &lt;3 ) trust me i will be there for you just imagine me being next to you or read this message. I love watching videos that say like \u201c hey you worried? Lets have tea\u201d LIKE ANIMATED ONES!!!!.  So many cool videos. Imagine someone singing for u on ukulele cute song. AGHHH or imagine funny moments. <br><br>6. What makes me sad is past. How much fun i had and how i was free :C no virus nothing...good summers....less people being angry and those  you know what i mean? If not than its okay neither do i XDD<br><br>7. Last thing is find somenthing you love and will do a lot. Summer nights are really cool. Forget about sad moments  at moment when you get that breakdown. Please understand i love you and no. Need to worry. You will grow up laughing about those!!! Well i need to go now. But i wrote these because i am worried about people who suffer with me/like me. Please i lvoe you and know you are not alone &lt;3 AND BESIDES IF I WILL DIE AND I WILL GET TO GO TO HEAVEN I WILL GO AND SE MY BESTFRIEND KICK HER ASS AND MAKE SURE I TELL HER HOW EVIL SHE WAS CLEARING MY NICKNAME IN MESSAGES. OK PAIN I HATE IT WHEN SEH DOESN THAT!!! ( i said this in other vid but im saying thi shere too so dont worry ok? You might be reborned, mot feel anything, go toheaven or be ghost mystery is mystery dont solve it it will make u feel worse. But if u rlly interested in it just think that before you were bron what did u see? Remember? No then thats whats after death.

You are conscious, however what you are as a person, whoever you are, is a configuration. In fact, a human is a form of life. A form of being. When you die, the configuration breaks down. Consciousness however is different. First of all, we need to quit separating ourselves from the rest of the universe. A human being is as much a part of the physical world as a parking lot is. In other words, there is no &#39;out there.&#39; You are a part of the earth and its total mass. You arent separate of the physical world, but rather another part of it, like anything be it a tree, or a rock. Or a car. Additionally, while you are cojsidered living, everything that makes up you is non living. The iron in your blood is the same iron that steel is refined from. The water in your body which constitutes 70 percent of your mass is the same water you would find on a comet floating about in space. Are either of those alive? No. Neither one of them or anything in you. You are an animated object made of inanimate material. <br><br>Consciousness arises from matter. But how? How can a state of inate awareness arise from physical matter? There has to be some property within matter that gives rise to consciousness. In this case, consciousness is like matter and energy. It is fundamental. If so, then like matter and energy, it cannot be created or destroyed. It can be converted. In this case the awareness isn&#39;t lost at death, however the person, the memories, all of that are lost as those are a configuration. Without any memories existence is a novelty.

We are never whole with drugs or alcohol, thats fake love. It doesn\u2019t feel the void. But the love that is patient, that is kind, nor does it envy nor boastful, nor dishonour others and it is not self seeking.

Not only is death, the time when you are completely gone, a scary thing to think about, but there is also the process of decay that you go through in the best case.<br><br>When I was in middleschool I became nearsighted, it did not dawn on me that I would never see clearly through my natural eyes until I die.  If I get surgery, that may only speed up the decay in other ways (becoming farsighted, etc.)  A couple of days ago I realized I couldn&#39;t see in the dark as well as I could.<br><br>Thinking about my hands is horrifying.  They are my connection to everything, to create and do everything I love, to cook and clean, to pet my cats, to hold my family, to play games, to write.  But one day they will be gone, they will either be completely worn out or I will lose them to some injury.  The best case scenario is they are replaced by something that replicates them.<br><br>In western thought we try to come to terms with death itself by attaching it, as older cultures did, to a higher purpose.  There is comparatively little to allow us to accept our inevitable decay.<br><br>In any case, if we&#39;re all being honest, death and dying does not really feel like something mundane and natural, it feels overwhelming, it&#39;s very sad to think that one day you won&#39;t get to wake up and do all your favorite things one day.

No way in hell would I want to experience life on this earth over and over, even though I wouldn&#39;t remember any of my past lives. When it comes down to it, I&#39;m actually very lucky to have the life I do, and if reincarnation were real, I&#39;d fear getting stuck with a real shitty next life. I was into the new-agey spiritual stuff for a while and looked up a lot of stuff about souls and reincarnation. Real interesting, but kind of a bummer in a way...because according to that, our souls <i>have</i> to go through challenges here on earth in order to evolve, whereas right now at this point in time, I&#39;m kind of hoping we just have this one life and that&#39;s it. After that, it&#39;s just blank. Emptiness. It&#39;s not like we&#39;ll feel it or sense it in any way if that really is the end of our consciousness, if our consciousness just flips off like a light switch and then it&#39;s just nothing.<br><br>But at the same time, I definitely believe there&#39;s more to us than just our physical bodies. We still don&#39;t even fully understand what consciousness is and how it works. I believe in science and am super into astronomy and astrophysics, but at the same time, I&#39;m also kind of spiritual and believe there&#39;s so much to the universe &amp; to existence in general that we don&#39;t know about/will likely never know about that can&#39;t be explained by science as we currently understand it. It&#39;s funny. Sometimes I vacillate between strictly adhering to science and believing all of our lives and the emergence of the human species in general were just by pure chance and we&#39;re nothing in the grand scheme of the universe, and that one day even the universe itself will go dark and eventually die...but who knows, there are scientific theories out there about a multiverse, or maybe the universe will eventually be reborn. Then other times, I lean on the more spiritual side and think &quot;but there HAS to be more to this existence than just life, death, then nothingness.&quot; But maybe that&#39;s just my human egocentrism speaking? If our consciousness is energy and energy can neither be created nor destroyed, where does that energy go when we die? Since we&#39;re all made of star stuff, I guess we started out as just elements of the universe before we were born, and after we die, our energy just merges back into the universe at large? Or maybe that energy is what some of us call a soul and that soul goes somewhere we find out about only when we die. Who knows. Anyway, I have to stop &#39;cause clearly I&#39;ve written more than enough and this stuff can get me going for hours.<br><br>Forgot to add: I talked about getting &quot;stuck&quot; with a shitty next life if reincarnation were real, but according to the new age theories, our souls specifically choose what our lives will be like before we begin a new cycle aka life. Meaning we apparently choose our parents, general events/challenges in our life, etc, all in the quest to evolve our souls. Basically, according to this belief, we&#39;ve agreed to our lives in advance; it&#39;s just that we can&#39;t remember doing any of that when we&#39;re in our mortal bodies.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T04:09:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colin Kamoda", "comment_text": "We also have pooping in common, don&#39;t ever forget that.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T04:05:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "lurategh", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t fear death itself per se, as in the state of being dead, but I fear the pain that will come with the actual act of dying.

However, there has only ever been one person in history who emphatically spoke on this subject - Jesus of Nazareth, commonly known as Jesus Christ. Many have heard of the name Jesus but not many have seriously considered the astonishing claims he made. Fewer still are people who tried to examine if there are evidence to support these radical claims. Jesus said: &quot;I AM the resurrection and the life. Anyone who believes in me will live, even after dying. Everyone who lives in me and believes in me will never ever die&quot; (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvZdXRP6Tig&amp;t=11m25s\">11:25</a>,26). Again Jesus said: &quot;I AM the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me&quot; (John 14:6). So Jesus claimed that he alone has the power to grant immortality to every person who believes in him. \r<br>\r<br>Jesus Christ rose from the dead - this is the foundation of Christianity (1 Corinthian 15: 12-17). There is historical evidence to support this claim. \r<br>\r<br><br>If you are searching for answers to the four big questions of human existence - origin, meaning, morality, and destiny, you owe it to yourself to find out who Jesus is.

If the spirit exist and our consciousness continue after death suffering and pain would teach and mature our spirits. If a person had a perfect life we learn nothing thus we never improve. Having a Stagnant soul/consciousness is pointless. souls need to be challenged to adapt and grow just like evolution where organisms face obstacles then evolve to become better and overcome those obstacles. I imagine our spirits live out many lifetimes in order to adapt and become better. Every living being learns at least one valuable lesson in their lifetime then dies and gets reborn then rinse and repeat. Perhaps even complete monsters are that way because they&#39;re learning something important perhaps they&#39;re young souls who&#39;ve only recently stepped up from living as animals. Perhaps people who have tragic lives are learning something. Life is organisms evolving and becoming better and then death and suffering is spiritual evolving to become something better. What will our consciousness eventually evolve into who knows. Why does evil exists well because evil and negativity is a great teacher I suppose.

Is there really a place where people go and are aware of themselves and go to this wonderful afterlife people are talking about or (this is where I just started to bawl my eyes out just because I&#39;m  typing this) or is there nothing. Like the person said below me, just darkness. Or nothingness after I die and I wont have any awareness because I&#39;m gone.  I can&#39;t even fathom even to think about me no longer being... I hear that if given the option to take a pill to live for eternity most people said no.  Ohh no not me I would take it. I may not have a perfect life, I&#39;m not rich in any way and even my marriage is ehh 50%50 right now but that doesn&#39;t mean things won&#39;t get better or heck I&#39;m happy to be alive right now regardless.  I love being me and I love helping others. I genuinely care about all living things human and animal. I&#39;m 48 almost 49 and some may say that&#39;s not old but I beg to differ. I&#39;m not going to live to 100. Typically it&#39;s around 80 to 93 in my family. So I don&#39;t have a lot of time and this kills me inside and I gotta stop before I go into a panic attack.  Literally does anyone know what people like myself can do to get over this because I&#39;m the type of person I have to see it to believe it, yes I have faith, but with the amount of fear I carry within me every day unless Im shown a glimpse of what it&#39;s like I&#39;m going to continue to be a walking basket case anytime someone mentions death  And I pray to God quite a bit asking or sometimes begging God to show me somehow someway just a tiny glimpse of the afterlife.

Is it the same thing before we were born when you just could not feel even light and my head hurts at 3 AM thinking about what life was like before our birth.  Is it a place like heaven or hell where people live eternally being immortal.    The scarier and most depressive part is thinking about your teenage years, your years as a child, the years you spent making your dreams come true and all those people you had for friends and those you had a crush on. Your parents, your relationships. Everyone aging slowly and finally fading away. You don&#39;t know if you going to meet them again in an afterlife. I feel very depressed when thinking about my parents and the girl that I like just kicking the bucket at some point. All those moments with each person just ending. All that fear motivates me so bad to become a researcher and attempt prolong lives. You may feel sad and scared with these thoughts. I do. But we should believe in God and that he takes care of us. Think about that. We are the only intellectual species on this planet  and haven&#39;t found any other species similar to our capabilities. We evolved and survived our predators and harsh environments. We cured all the diseases that striked us and move on curing more. We survived wars that could end our existence. We have discovered planets that are similar to ours but only our own planet  hosts the most wonderful thing in the entire universe that is called LIFE.  Our will to survive and keep moving through the years is limitless. When we see a danger our survival instinct kicks in and we try to save our lives at all costs. We have to believe that nothing is just random. That there is something supreme that guides us and  protects us but doesn&#39;t show it directly. We have to believe that we don&#39;t come in life randomly. That we have a task to accomplish and a life to live at its best.

God is holy and has no sin nor can he be around sin. Man lives on this Earth and must find forgiveness for all of his sins, believe in God, and accept his Son, Jesus Christ, as his Savior.

The Holy Spirit comes to live within a person who has been born again. It&#39;s quite an amazing experience and for us who have been filled with God&#39;s spirit, it is hard to explain to others what this is all about.

They will be as if they never existed. Those who believe in Jesus will awaken from their sleep of death, when Jesus returns to earth in the future, and be given an immortal body.

I think God wants the best for all of us, but hes fighting the devil for our souls. I just keep trying to be a good person, helping people in need, doing something worthwhile in my life, but I still fear hell and the thought of being tortured with no one to save me.<br><br>The issue I have is I have an extremely over active brain. I think about everything, existence, life, death, I honestly sometimes wish I had a lowish IQ. The innocent are usually happy, I have some friends with special needs and they seem pretty blissfull, it&#39;s quite beautiful in a way.<br><br>Not only do I fear hell though, I also fear non existence, maybe even more so. I need to understand everything, it&#39;s a drive I have and because I just cant fathom non existence, it gets me very anxious. <br><br>The irony is, I actually tried to kill myself before.

Sure memories of us of our cells will live on, but why would we care if we are DEAD. Under the assumption seemingly made in this video that death is the end of our existence anywhere of both our body and our conscious, we would not be conscious to care if memories of us or our cells or whatever live on. The only time that answer would comfort anyone is while they are still alive, and they may see that it  is totally not an answer to the question. Choosing to not dread on death and focusing on making a meaningful life is just avoiding the problem. Why would a feeling of significance about the quantity of our neurons be a reason to not fear death in any way? The two things are unrelated and we&#39;re all going to die anyway. Death will always be looming until we die, whether we accept it or not. What I think is this: before this world or life or anything existed, if somehow someone was to tell you that life was going to exist and we were going to have a world perfectly designed for us, you would think they are crazy. There is nothing. How could something exist. (I know this is impossible to happen, because we would not have existed, but you get the point). But we do exist. Life exists. That seems like a crazy statement. Anything exists, but how? Even more, how is it that what does exist is perfectly designed for us? The sun&#39;s photosphere is over 10,000 degrees f and we are far enough away with an atmosphere that protects against just the right amount of rays for the light to ripen our tomatoes. Going back to the point about the absurdity that life exists, if someone were to tell you that life exists after this world, why would you think it is absurd? We live in a perfect world (were not nothing anymore), so how could an afterlife not exist? You are probably in a building right now, so how do you know there was a builder? If you see a painting, how do you know there was a painter? Obviously the existence of the building or painting points to a builder or painter. It couldn&#39;t have come out of nothing and just existed, that would be scientifically impossible. In my understanding, creation, better yet perfect creation, is absolute evidence for a creator. Do you believe nothing created everything? That is scientifically impossible. In my opinion, the only way that makes sense is that there is something bigger than this world and this world&#39;s laws of physics. God is the creator, who is who He is. This is why anything exists, because of Him. This is why this world is perfectly designed, because of Him. Another piece of evidence that points to Him is that He prophesied through prophets about what would happen in the future of this creation He made. Those prophecies are recorded in the Bible, and there are about 2,500 of them. 2,000 of the 2,500 prophecies have been fulfilled perfectly to the letter. They have been fulfilled as perfect as this world was for us, until sin entered the world. The remaining 500 are about the future and will tell us what will occur in the future of this wonderful creation. The point is that God also gave us a set of laws that point to His perfect character, but going against the laws is ruining this wonderful world He created for us. We have all went against these laws and due to this, the Bible says we all deserve death. We don&#39;t deserve life, because we have ruined this world and gone against God&#39;s only commands for us. God is a righteous judge and has to judge according to the violations of the law we committed. However, God also loves us so much that He came to the world Himself to live a perfect life and die as a sacrifice for anyone who accept the sacrifice. If we repent (turn away) and trust in God with our life, He can lead us to everlasting life due to Jesus&#39; perfect sacrifice. One of the points of this video is that death makes life great. The only reason we wouldn&#39;t want to live here forever is that this world is no longer perfect. It has been corrupted by sin and we are cut off from God. I don&#39;t know exactly what heaven will be like, but I know it will be better than anything this world can offer and an eternity with God. God bless you all and please think about repenting and turning to God before it is too late. It has saved me from the fear of death and changed my life for the absolute better, so I encourage you to read the Gospels, pray, and seek God&#39;s character so we can all understand this world and God better.", "comment_date": "2020-07-25T17:16:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "kanava", "comment_text": "Our existence, our consiousness , our memories, our loved ones, all of that is connected to very weak, &#39;&#39;glass&#39;&#39; like human body, that can so easily be harmed, or even destroyed.

Most of us get knocked down, bullied, ridiculed, emotionally or physically abused; by people around us, and sometimes even by our own family. We are told to work hard, even though most of us would rather do other things but are told that if we don\u2019t work hard we will not make it in life (what the hell). Then, after having busted our asses off, we have to get a job \u2013 or be a slave \u2013 save money and die. Most of us won\u2019t have time to travel or do the things that we really want.

I&#39;m not afraid of what happens afterwards, I&#39;m not afraid of death itself. Through spiritual AND quantum study, I have learned that the spirit lives on. We leave our physical bodies but our conciousness absolutely continues. Believing fully in that keeps me grounded. I know death is not the end. But even if it is not, life itself, feels fleeting. When I was 20ish I had an experience with my heart that felt as if it could have killed me. Ever since then I have had heart related issues that I know are partly anxiety, and also partly from what happened that day. Point in case, heart palpitations. I feel them all the time. I never felt them before that day. I&#39;m still in my 20&#39;s and every year I have an experience that puts me in the hospital. Most of those times,  it is chest pain, half my body going numb, pain that radiates to my shoulder, heat in my head, sharp pains in my body, even blood pressure spikes and signs of clotting (according to the doctors). All types of things and it just feels like my body is ill equipped for life. I know these things are WHY I have anxiety about death. I know these things could kill me. I hear these things could be all be in my head. (Doubt its ALL in my head though. My EKG&#39;s are sketchy.) But knowing that my heart could &quot;attack me&quot; or I could have a blood clot travel to my heart or brain or lungs and just kill me, are why I fear death. Those things scare the shit out of me because they are so far out of my control. Because of that, I eat healthy and live an active lifestyle. Yet I continue to experince these episodes in which it feels as if I am having a medical emergency. I JUST found a good person who wants to love me and possibly marry me. And I keep thinking how bad I feel for them. Knowing that if we were to get married and have kids, I would die first for sure, and leave them all behind. OR I could die sooner than later, and die before I&#39;ve experienced a life of loving someone and someone loving me! These are things that keep me from living my life to it&#39;s full potential. Why I dropped out of college. Why I settled in a low wage job, why I have few attachments. Why I have roommates and refuse to live alone even though I want to. This crippling fear has altered the course of my life and that in itself, frustrates the hell out of me. Why cant I just NOT have the things happen. Then at least I could try to ignore my thoughts. But everytime I feel that numbness in half my body or those heart palpitations that take the wind out of me, I go back to that thinking everytime. I&#39;ve taken it as my cost of living. Maybe it is a karmic pay off. If that&#39;s the case, fine.

While it does bother me as an individual, I will ignore these feelings in my little paragraphs.<br><br>There is no scientific evidence for anything. This whole preconception that nothingness in death is the &quot;smart&quot; option doesn&#39;t make sense. You don&#39;t have any evidence for such claims. So that means if you believe you become a unicorn after death or something, that&#39;s just as valid as believing that there is nothing after death.<br><br>Another thought I have is that an afterlife wouldn&#39;t be so strange to me. I mean think about it. The universe is so wacky. Particles that exist in two places at once, how the big bang was triggered, the different dimensions (2D, 3D, 4D) etc. To me, afterlife doesn&#39;t even sound weird at all in comparison to much weirder and wackier stuff in the universe. Reality is much more magical than any human could make up <br><br>Another thing is that what makes a living thing living? You and your chair share the same atoms. You could make the argument that life comes from all the biological stuff and stuff like that, but if you inject genetic material into a chair, it doesn&#39;t just spring up and start dancing.

While the big bang is almost a certainty, it&#39;s still technically a theory.<br><br>Nothingness after death seems to human, if that makes sense. (Following statements is all my opinion!) Just like how heaven and hell seems too human and orderly to me, I feel like that with nothingness as well. Everything in the universe is endlessly complicated, no way death can be so simple.<br><br>In conclusion, I feel like nothingness after death is often seen as the &quot;intelligent&quot; option even though we have 0 evidence. It&#39;s best not to think about death, as we will never ever truly know.<br><br>(OPINION)<br>and death just can&#39;t be that simple.

This is a clear example of the naturalistic fallacy. Essentially, all of this interest in the science of how death works doesn\u2019t give any influence on the positivity or negativity of death, it\u2019s just explaining why it\u2019s there.<br><br>Many people want to die, but I don\u2019t, and let me explain why.<br><br>Death doesn\u2019t give life meaning. Misery isn\u2019t required for happiness to have meaning, happiness is meaning itself. If people didn\u2019t die and I started a murderous rampage to \u2018give life meaning,\u2019 and once everyone was dead I killed myself to give my own life meaning, I\u2019d be an outright monster.<br><br>If death were gone, we wouldn\u2019t reconstruct a reaper to give life meaning. <br><br>And yes, death IS a part of life, but so was cholera before we developed proper ways of preventing the mix between water and disease.<br><br>If death were a person, he\u2019d kill millions daily, which is an irredeemable act in and of itself, but if death is ay okay and is a good thing, this embodiment of death is a good person. Do you see how insane that is? Even if death isn\u2019t a person, simply entertaining the idea that it is would mean that the slaughter of what will eventually be every person is a <b>good thing.</b><br><br>If you had the ability to cure cancer, would you?<br><br>You\u2019ll say yes if you have any sense of morals.<br><br>If you had the ability to stop murder and manslaughter, would you?<br><br>Again, you\u2019ll say yes if you have any sense of morality.<br><br>I could keep going, but just about everything that causes death is bad. If you give an example of something that was good and causes death I could simply say it can be improved. <br><br>For example, people who do dangerous things that could kill them, but those things are necessary for society.<br><br>If you had the power to improve the work done in those fields so that it doesn\u2019t kill anyone, would you?<br><br>You\u2019ll say yes if you have basic morals.<br><br>So, if every cause of death is drastically immoral, not to solve, then I ask you a new question.<br><br>If you could cure death, would you?<br><br>You might say old age, but people don\u2019t die of old age. People die due to the effects of aging.<br><br>If you believe death is a good thing, you\u2019ll say yes to this question, but then you\u2019re leaving some cause of death open, DELIBERATELY. In other words, you\u2019re allowing suicide, or cancer, or murder ect. To exist.<br><br>If you had the choice to cure death and didn\u2019t, you\u2019re a monster of the likes the world has never seen... You had the ability to prevent millennium of years and suffering and you didn\u2019t.<br><br>So, you\u2019re reasons are wrong because;<br><br>1. Humans are meaning making machines, but portraying death is developing upon that idea. I never said meaning doesn\u2019t exist with death in the picture, but it also exists with death out of the picture.<br><br>In other words, yes, live a meaningful life, but don\u2019t delude yourself into believing in horrible things being good in the process. Live a meaningful life while looking at its imperfections, one being death.<br><br>2. We are insignificant in the long run. Just because I have more of a cell that I couldn\u2019t see if it were put in front of me doesn\u2019t than burning balls of plasma that can make planets, which can make life, that doesn\u2019t make me feel significant. You can list off numbers and intelligence as much as you want, but I can still say, without a doubt, that even if I made more of a difference than any other person in the world, my name will still be forgotten.<br><br>3. This doesn\u2019t make life great. Life is inherently great, death or no death. CGP grey made an amazing video on this a while back, I highly recommend it.<br><br>4. This argument is a non-sequitur even when we consider the full argument, but I think your conclusion is correct. This is still true without death, though. An infinite life is still one with infinite fun to be had. It\u2019s still one which can be lived to the fullest.<br><br>5.

Your brain and your consciousness are two different things. Yes while we know what happens to our body and our organs (like the brain) after we die, we don&#39;t know what happens to our consciousness after we die. We don&#39;t even know how to explain what consciousness is. All we know is that consciousness is how we are aware of our selves and that it&#39;s pretty much who we are because through consciousness we get all our thoughts and feelings, not the brain. Our brain is the organ that tells the rest of our body what to do, intelligence is another part of who we are, and if consciousness is who we are then our brain has nothing to do with our intelligence. There is no way of knowing what consciousness is, so we can&#39;t explain what happens to it after we die because it&#39;s not something physical that we can hold and look at. Me personally, I&#39;m religious and believe that there is a god and that heaven is real, but just like consciousness we can&#39;t currently hold these beliefs physicality. Consciousness is something that we can&#39;t hold yet we know it exists, so god and heaven could be the same. I don&#39;t know if it does, but that&#39;s why it&#39;s called Faith.

It the fact that leaving behind everything that you are, your body, mind, and soul and no longer experiencing life as that. And it\u2019s for a eternity. But this is probably because of human ego and selfishness, we must realize that we are part of nature. If nature were to be a human we would be a body part of that human. We are organic and biological matter, just like the ocean. And the ocean has waves.

Here\u2019s my take fwiw: we\u2019re all energy at the end of the day, and by extension so is our consciousness. When we\u2019re gone, our energy is released back into the universe, since energy can\u2019t be created or destroyed, just converted. All the atoms and subatomic particles that made us us goes back to the universe too. Whether you\u2019re buried in the ground or cremated, it all goes back. While statistically the chances of it are dang near zero, it\u2019s not completely zero, so whose to say that whatever energy and combination of subatomic particles that helped make us exist in the first place, all actions that are basically one giant butterfly effect that is the coming together of us before we were born can\u2019t come back together as a sentient being again, and we come back as, well, ourself? Maybe not 100% ourself, but at the very least the thing that made our consciousness, the thing that gave us our personalities, our memories, etc. While I take many stories of alleged reincarnation with a grain of salt, I also don\u2019t completely 100% discredit them. It could be the same reason why we experience deja vu: somewhere in our consciousness, some subatomic particles may vibrate in such a way that gives us the tiniest glimpse into a previous life, that we\u2019ve done something like this before, but you just can\u2019t put your finger on it. Who knows, maybe some people get lucky and can actually remember their past life, same reason why some organ donor recipients take on the personalities of whoever\u2019s organ they got, since to some extent you\u2019re absorbing some of their being. It could be the day after you die, it could be in a billion years, it could take several big bangs for it to happen, who knows. Either way, to quote a Kurzgesagt video: just blink or snap your fingers. That\u2019s how longer forever was for you before you were born.

Imagine if time was a pinpoint- everything that is, has been, or ever will be is all occurring in a single moment- and you can experience all of this at a glance. You have no frame of reference to process this, as you live in a 4 dimensional world where space time is linear. Viewed from more complex dimensions, all of time would be simply a point. You could watch eternity and be omniscient to humans if you could return to this dimension. Would that make you a God? If our spirits move as pure energy to these higher dimensions, each of us is then a God. Or we are all part of one God who created this dimension from the stuff of its own substance, and that stuff will be reused, perhaps in a sentient being, perhaps not. But maybe, just maybe- we are all Gods in training. When our spirits are freed to become omniscient, we each create our own universe, in whichever dimension we prefer.

Hebrews  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvZdXRP6Tig&amp;t=9m27s\">9:27</a>. God so loved the world [you] that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son to condemn the world but that through Him the world might be saved. He who believes in Him shall not  be condemned but he who does not believe is condemned already because He has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvZdXRP6Tig&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a>-18. And this is eternal life, that they may KNOW You the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. John 7:3. For there is no other name under heaven [than Jesus] by which a man must be saved. (Acts 4:?) There are many good husbands that purchase life insurance in case they should die and leave a wife and children behind but have neglected to receive eternal life assurance. Do not be one of them. We are only a heartbeat away from eternity. That is the reason it is also written &quot;Now is the day of salvation [?]. And If you hear His voice today, do not harden your heart. Hebrews (?) God said to Israel when they were in the wilderness, &quot;Today I place before you both life and death, blessing and cursing. Therefore choose life.  Deuteronomy. Once you make peace with God, you need not fear death. But outside of God, you will be punished for your sins in a place called hell that is described as a lake of fire and also outer darkness. It is forever. You should fear that, however Paul also wrote, &quot;Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Romans 5:1. You can make peace with Him through prayer in faith in what Jesus did on the cross where He bore all our sins nailing them to the cross. Then He rose from the dead, thus proving that He has life and will share that life with anyone who comes to Him by faith.

Eso tambi\u00e9n puede ser comprobado con experiencias de enfermeras, personas que trabajan en la morgue o los que realizan autopsias, los gestos de las personas y como se relajan cuando se les habla, o los que sienten &quot;otras presencias&quot;. Seg\u00fan mi modo de ver, el cuerpo f\u00edsico muere pero la energ\u00eda que le di\u00f3 &quot;vida&quot; a ese cuerpo no se pierde s\u00f3lo se transforma, esa informaci\u00f3n se &quot;codifica&quot; se &quot;encripta&quot; y en la realidad que deja esa &quot;energ\u00eda-alma&quot; no tenemos el &quot;hardware&quot; para decodificarla de nuevo.

It is quite the conundrum, if you ask me. I think people who fear death the most are those who are living life the least, it is relative to how much you embrace that which is your current existence. The more you overthink and overprocess, the more you welcome the catastrophizing delusions concerning what it&#39;ll be like. I think people rather fear the process that is dying, and not so much death itself.

I first conceptualized death however at a much younger age, maybe eight or nine years old. My love for science came consuming my mind in constant process &amp; methodological thought. Learning to distract my thoughts from the anxiety inducing thought of death came soon after. Seeing this video in my suggestions made me very excited to grasp a hint of your stunning thought process yet again &amp; perhaps finally put my mind at ease. I actually thought it would put my mind at ease because you are so based in scientific method followed closely with care and emotion that I didn\u2019t doubt your knowledge pair elegantly with your vast knowledge and comfortable voice  would sooth me into a state of relaxation. I am very upset that it did not. In almost a way similar to how any politician would answer how they were going to solve poverty or unemployment, you beat around the bush so well. The answer to why not to fear death you did provide &amp; I lie distressed that even your thoughts can sooth your mind yet have not taken as such to mine. I know and understand all you have said within this video, I\u2019ve known it for some time. Yet humans thrive off of hurting one an other, more &amp; more people fall into this and cause destruction to the earth, each other and themselves. Working to live longer &amp; keeping everyone happy is almost impossible. Greed is a learned quality &amp; as far from a virtue that you can possibly go, yet it is infecting the minds of most of the public due to our society &amp; political systems. If I don\u2019t see an end to the human race (excluding the very wealthy) in my life time, i believe it will soon follow after. My consciousness that is held within this vessel I use as a tool called my human body still fears where it can collect &amp; remain in the motion of thought after its vessel begins to rot &amp; fade through as all biological things do. The idea of not doing anything is unproductive &amp; not being able to contemplate how to improve the lives of alll &amp; myself kills me &amp; still is restlessly uneasy about the thought of death. Ironically speaking of course. Distraction will remain the answer.", "comment_date": "2019-08-22T04:01:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ahmed gdg", "comment_text": "it&#39;s not scary if you want make it funny", "comment_date": "2019-08-21T22:22:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ember", "comment_text": "tbh it&#39;s the after death that terrifies me cuz we basically have no proof of what will happen and that&#39;s haunting", "comment_date": "2019-08-21T18:55:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheViccerBoy", "comment_text": "Now Im prepared for science <br><br>BTW i Only go in 3rd grade", "comment_date": "2019-08-21T18:24:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OmiMaHomie", "comment_text": "Me after the video: THE MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL.

But really, I&#39;m not too scared about that either, because as long as I&#39;m alive, I can choose to do things that can make a positive impact on the world. I&#39;m religious, too, so I believe in the afterlife. But before anyone criticizes that, think about this: there are plenty of things that people believe and hope will happen, whether pertaining to this life or what happens after. It&#39;s human nature to have things that they hope for. This allows humans to develop trust. We trust that something good will happen. We trust that our relationships will last a lifetime or longer. We trust others to keep their promises. And sometimes that trust is broken. Sometimes things don&#39;t go as you originally planned or hoped. But that doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t trust in anything good. We humans are social creatures. We can&#39;t function properly without being able to rely on others for support when we need it. We can&#39;t do everything alone. So if it turns out that there is no afterlife, that there is no higher power, and that there is nothing after death, why should it matter what I believe?

To explain this I need to start with the bad news...<br><br><br>The bad news is that all mankind has fallen from what we were created to be. When Adam sinned, he represented all of us and we fell with him. This is why we all sin. We don\u2019t honour God as we should, and we sin against our fellow man as well. We do this right from our childhood because the corruption affects every part of us. No one is exempt. We all know our own sin, at least enough of it to know we\u2019re guilty. Our consciences tell us that things are not okay. Death is part of the curse. We were never meant to die. <br><br>There was one exception to the cursed line of Adam. Jesus is very special in a bio of ways. He was born of the Holy Spirit, not an earthly father. So he\u2019s God. He existed before creation. The Bible actually calls him the creator. But he\u2019s also a man like any other. Not 50/50 God and man, but completely God and also completely man. He had to be a man so he could be a suitable substitute for sinful man, and he had to be God so he could bear the awful weight of judgment that sin deserves. <br><br>So Jesus was tempted by Satan in the wilderness by many temptations. He was hungry because he was fasting. He was in danger from wild animals. He was tired, lacking sleep. Compare Adam, who was tempted while in paradise and still failed. The Bible calls Jesus the second Adam. Where Adam failed, Jesus succeeded. God said he was pleased with his son Jesus. What Adam could have earned if he remained faithful until eating from the tree of life, Jesus actually earned instead. He earned perfect righteousness for his people. That\u2019s why God promises an amazing inheritance to his people. Not because they earned it, but because Jesus earned it for them. Eternal life, endless joy, living in God\u2019s presence, enjoying God\u2019s riches for eternity. <br><br>After his righteous life, Jesus gave himself up to be crucified. A horrible way to die, reserved for the worst offenders. Even God said in the OT that someone hanged on a tree was cursed. God poured out his wrath against the sin of his people on Jesus. <br><br>2 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvZdXRP6Tig&amp;t=5m21s\">5:21</a> He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. <br><br>The great exchange. When we cease trying to bribe God with our own efforts and simply trust what Jesus did for us, he legally declares us righteous as though we lived his life. He also legally charges our sin to his account. All we do is believe him. Trust that he will do what he said. So even though I\u2019m a sinner, I\u2019m loved by God like his own Son. The law in the Bible tells me how to live and what God wants, but I can never live it out. I try, to honour him out of thankfulness, but he doesn\u2019t judge me by his law anymore. <br><br>Continued...<br>Unless...<br><br>God shows us his wrath against sin by those he doesn\u2019t save. Those who resist his command to trust Jesus and rather bribe God with their own efforts will never be good enough to please a holy God. He\u2019s a perfect judge and requires absolute perfection. If we\u2019re not perfect on our own, and we don\u2019t have a perfect substitute, he will send us to hell until we can pay off the debt. Which will never happen. Sinners in hell go on hating God and increasing their debt. So the punishment is eternal. <br><br>Or some simply don\u2019t even try to bribe him with their efforts. They openly hate God and will suffer the same fate. But Jesus says that anyone who comes to him he will never cast out. But we must come on his terms. He is God, after all. Many have deceived themselves thinking they are his, but he says he will say to them \u201cI never knew you\u201d. <br>That\u2019s the gospel, in a nutshell. <br>Forgot something. Jesus was raised from the dead because God was showing that Jesus had accomplished his mission. His sacrifice was acceptable to God and needs nothing added. We too will be resurrected in real physical bodies, to live on a re-created earth. God will live with us here on planet earth, but a totally renewed earth without the curse and all that came with it. Unbelievers will have resurrected bodies to experience the wrath of God without being able to escape by death. So when we die, we either go to a place of comfort or torment until the resurrection. Then in our new bodies, we live in an earthly/heavenly paradise or the lake of fire. <br><br>God bless everyone who reads this. My prayer is that you open your minds and hearts to this message and receive Jesus as your Saviour and substitute. Praise God for such an incredible gift! \u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2019-07-03T01:55:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wybie 02", "comment_text": "\u201cDeath gives life meaning\u201d to know that your days are number.", "comment_date": "2019-07-03T01:39:51Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "IG @OMEAKATL", "comment_text": "Did nothing for me....", "comment_date": "2019-07-03T01:30:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "It's just kayla!", "comment_text": "<b>I&#39;m not scared!...I just don&#39;t wanna get hurt!</b>", "comment_date": "2019-07-03T00:53:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anu", "comment_text": "So it&#39;s okay if I commit suicide then?", "comment_date": "2019-07-03T00:23:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Closet Demon", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not really scared of death, i just hope I&#39;m not the cause of my own.", "comment_date": "2019-07-02T23:46:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gonzalo ruiz Juarez", "comment_text": "\u201cDoesn\u2019t make any sense \u201c", "comment_date": "2019-07-02T23:41:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emily Horsfall", "comment_text": "I need you to be my science teacherrr", "comment_date": "2019-07-02T22:23:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aurora Byrd", "comment_text": "Y&#39;know, evolution really baffles me sometimes. At the very beginning, we know  that it started from groups of molecules that happened to be able to replicate themselves, whether it was on Earth or another planet.

I know it wasn&#39;t evolved on its own, but over time, but how did organisms spontaneously evolve light sensing organs? And really the same for anything else. On top of that, there are some really strange,but very successful stories in evolution. Consider the sawfish,a shark that literally uses a sword to kill/stun its prey! How did that evolved, and what really prompted it? the fish not only had to evolve a long snout, but also had to evolve separate teeth on the snout! Some other really good examples of this would include parrotfish, which blow themselves mucus bubbles to sleep in at night, the goblin shark, which has a big extrusion on its forehead, myriapods, which I wonder what exactly favored that many legs, and so many others.

It&#39;s hard for me to grasp that not only did she die... but she died in one of the worst ways imaginable. The person who killed her (not really a person, more like walking garbage) hasn&#39;t been caught and brought to justice. She hit by a moron who ran a red light and fled the scene. She lost 80% of her blood and was pretty much comatose for 4 months before they had to pull the plug on her.

Most deaths in my family have been from old age/stroke/heart attacks and have been sad but peaceful and relatively quick. This one... however... is like something out of a movie and that&#39;s the kind of death that terrifies me. And the worst part is... aside from the cunt who fled the scene and is still out there with blood on his hands... is the fact that this is someone I knew as a LIVING person. Someone with smiles and laughters, with two children and a stepdaughter. Someone who wasnt related by blood but family nonetheless. Someone who I spent vacations with a lot because her birthday is 2 days after my mom&#39;s. Her 25 or 26 year old daughter is getting married soon and she sadly wont be there in person. It&#39;s just so sad. And how horrible she went. And the death of those I love is harder to swallow than my own. At least I wont be there to mourn my own death. I hope I go as an old man peacefully.

Even if you become immortal, you&#39;d still want to eat your favorite food, do your favorite stuff, love your favorite person and enjoy your life.

I think the actually good reason to no fear death is to recognize that you won&#39;t be aware of it. Like, you can be aware of dying and that sucks for most people, but after that there&#39;s just nothing. I have a suspicion most people who don&#39;t believe in afterlife imagine there being blackness or nothingness after death but that&#39;s not the case. At the moment of death, you cease to exist. There won&#39;t be awareness, and there won&#39;t be a you to be scared of it. Imagine it like this: are you afraid of 1761? You probably aren&#39;t, but you didn&#39;t exist back then. When you think back to not existing, is it scary? It isn&#39;t to me. And that&#39;s what death is like - not existing.<br><br><br>So really fear of death is either FOMO (which can be a pain, but you can get over it) or the fear of the process of dying. And if it is the latter, well... at least it won&#39;t last forever. Also, remember - you lose awareness every time you fall asleep, and that&#39;s not scary (at least I hope it&#39;s not for you). And death is pretty much like that, except without waking up... so go ahead, use your time wisely while you&#39;re still alive, and stop reading ridiculously long YouTube comments.", "comment_date": "2019-06-27T17:35:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SiroBenju", "comment_text": "Dying is actually super easy, sometimes barely noticeable.

The reality is, true science has  never disproved anything in the bible, but has only confirmed what was is said.

Its as if this truth is met with personal grievance against nonbelievers.
