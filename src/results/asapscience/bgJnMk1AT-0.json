No. But because children don&#39;t understand medicine or biology and usually just trust what their parents tell them at that age, they believe the kiss takes away the pain and helps their injury heal faster, and they do show signs of pain relief.<br><br>There&#39;s no way parents would have been doing this for so long if it didn&#39;t do anything to even calm down their children. All it takes is trying it once and the child continuing to cry and scream in pain, likely feeling more severe than it is, for the parent to stop and find something else to help better.<br><br>Also, we can sort of see this in reverse with things like Munchausen syndrome.
