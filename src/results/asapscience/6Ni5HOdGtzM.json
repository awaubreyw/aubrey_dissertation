I love watching this with my nephews and nieces, it helps us answer all our crazy questions? Recently something came up in my applied physics class that has me stumped. \u00a0One day at lunch our professor told us he does not hold his handset to his head when talking on his smartphone. \u00a0Professor Howard our Radiation Science teacher told everyone in his class to use ear phone headsets, not Bluetooth headsets as they act like mini-microwaves inside your ear heating the water in your brain. \u00a0 Professor Howard went on to say that using your phone hours a day, year after year is like microwaving your brain. After class we all talked and wondered what we could be doing to our bodies?? \u00a0Now that my little nephew has a smartphone and is using it all the time I wonder if the cell phone radiation is harmful given his thinner less developed skull. Amazing Science can you please help those who were wondering? What could 2 hours of cell phone use a day to a individual... \u00a0Its scary to think that most of us use our smartphones several hours a day. \u00a0When Professor Howard said this I stopped and looked at my phone as something I need to be more educated on. \u00a0When I looked into it my smartphones manual it informed me of something known as S.A.R. or Specific Absorption Ratio, which apparently is a baseline the government decided is a safe level of radiation for humans to survive. \u00a0Is Professor Howard correct? \u00a0Are these devices something we should be mindful of our use with? \u00a0It would seem that continuos exposure over a life is bad news. \u00a0The WHO, otherwise known as the World Health Organization is saying that cell phone radiation could cause cancerous gliomas.

There are no neurons added to your cerebral cortex after birth. Any cerebral cortex neurons that die are not replaced.<br>- Fat cells are replaced at the rate of about 10% per year in adults. So you could say that on average, human beings replace all their fat cells about every ten years.<br>- Cardiomyocyte heart cells are replaced at a reducing rate as we age. At age 25, about 1% of cells are replaced every year. Replacement slows gradually to about 0.5% at age 70. Even in people who have lived a very long life, less than half of the cardiomyocyte cells have been replaced.
