I then went to the Branch Manager, Dan George and told him he needed to put a stop to this as John was creating a hostile work environment.  And it had taken a mental toll on me over the 5 years.  One day I went in to work and Dan asked me to meet him in the Board Room.  I was fine with that until he told me that John Wilson would be sitting in.  I told him that was unacceptable and that he was part of the problem.  At this point I felt completely under attack and just could not deal with the stress.  I ended up going to the Psych Ward and got on medication.  When Head Office found out about this, they immediately told me no to communicate with anyone at the Branch.

Of course, that is literally news to not a single person who is watching this. <br><br>Does circumstance matter? Of course, again, that is not news to a single person watching this. <br><br>Also, neither of those questions even remotely answer the question posed.  It is total obfuscation and answers to a completely separate question, I.e. \u201cwhat are the components of success?\u201d.   There is not a human being on the planet that thinks the only variable is hard work.  There a very few people who even think hard work is the main component.   Easiest way to illustrate this to anyone is just pointing out, no matter how hard you work, if you\u2019re 5\u20193\u201d, you\u2019re not going to be a NFL defensive end.  Just not going to happen.  <br><br>If you were interested in answering your own question you would look at a study that samples similar populations that are targeting the same goal and see how their level of work effects the ultimate outcome.  Then you would have an answer to \u201cdoes hard work matter?\u201d. <br><br>Your genetics you\u2019re born with, nothing you can do.  Your circumstances (especially at birth) are not anything you can exert any control over either, there\u2019s nothing you can do.  Your work ethic and effort is the biggest component under your control that you can alter.  I was interested clicking on this video to see what effect that could have. <br><br>If you have any desire to help people at all I\u2019d suggest you make that video. Because right now your video is unnecessarily the most depressing, demoralizing video I have ever seen. While also not even answering the question posed, so it seems almost intentional. To be \u201caccepting\u201d and to not \u201coffend\u201d you\u2019re basically just telling people who are unhappy with their situation, \u201coh the people doing better, don\u2019t worry, they didn\u2019t earn it, stop trying, you were not born to do the thing you enjoy\u201d.   What sort of message is that?! <br><br>If my sport was basketball (it\u2019s not), and I was not good but really enjoyed it.

Then hear the message, \u201cSomeone of Lebron\u2019s natural talent only has to put in 50% effort to Division 1 athlete and if you try the hardest possible you\u2019ll never make it anyways, so don\u2019t put in the work\u201d. <br><br>I know it\u2019s not intended. But this video strikes me as one of the most soulless, immoral, malicious videos I have seen.  I literally cannot think of a better video to make children, or really anyone in a bad situation, give up and not try to put in the effort to improve themselves.

If you look at sports, genetic advantages make some people better at one sport and worse at another for example swimmers tend to have longer torsos and shorter legs than the average person. While runners tend to have shorter torsos and longer legs.

Sure, if a person works hard in a field that they have no ability/knack for then that hardwork is potentially wasted and could be used for something they have a knack for. But In fields with people with a pre-disposed advantage and normal people with no such advantage, the normal people could outdo if the &#39;talent didnt work hard enough&#39;. If you have a house full of money but you don&#39;t know what to do with it, even a beggar could get richer than you in a few years.  <br>There are also people working hard for something they may not have a knack/ability for but they love it and want to do their best for it. Then is their genuine passion and hardwork all for naught? It might seem romantic but that feeling of giving your all for something they truly care about, will give them the satisfaction and self confidence. Maybe they will never be the best of it and fall short even of non hardworking geniuses. Maybe no one will look beyond the room of talented people to spare a glance at the non talented hardworking ones. But self satisfaction, imo, matters way more than mere appreciation. It&#39;s sad that our society takes hard work for granted and it isn&#39;t generally appreciated. Talent and Genetic Pre-disposition isn&#39;t something in our hands. But hard work and sacrifices are. So if we truly did so much work for something we care about regardless of being recognised for it or not, we should be unabashedly   proud of it.
