She had four children of her own. Anyway the abuse started off almost immediately making me stand in the corner of the room facing the wall for absolutely no reason that a five year old child would understand anyway.  The days went on with low level mental abuse, well to a five year old boy it was devastating. My father was a long distant driver so all this abuse took place when he was out, but he could see that I was unhappy there. So her four children started to bully me and attacked me in the house. They had a dog that use to nip me, and they would all just laugh. I started to hear her mother say to her, &quot;Why don&#39;t you just dump him somewhere.&quot;  So after a year of mental tourment at the hands of everyone in that house, she finally decided  to take her mothers advice and dump me on the street I was only 6 years. So Social services placed me with a foster family but after a year the moved me to a children&#39;s home. That was a blow to me because I became part of a loving family. When I was 8 years old they moved me to another children&#39;s gome where I stayed for 8 years.  I left  the children&#39;s home when I was 16, then they moved me to another children&#39;s home for a year, then when I was  17  they moved me to an half way house to get me use to an independant life.

First on my first account, I had so much posts but they sucked so I deleted them and I didn\u2019t care because they were literally nothing but then my account got deleted and I was mad because I lost all my liked stuff like people I liked and now I have to restart over I didn\u2019t even have followers litterally all of them were my cousins and uncles so then I made a google account with Vexoh it got banned then I made the one with the thing that says email or phone I used my email that got banned for the same reason I think and then my Twitter too and then I made a new email and that didn\u2019t get banned and that new email rn I have 20 followers but I don\u2019t post anything and I can\u2019t stop thinking about my other accounts I don\u2019t care about Twitter or email I just want my Facebook back and google and I don\u2019t even remember there usernames so I don\u2019t think I can get those back but I remember my Facebook one so I have a higher change of getting it back. So I went to report a bug and then TikTok replied to me already because I made a text saying why did my Facebook TikTok account get banned so that\u2019s how I remembered my Facebook TikTok account name and they said because I was under 13. How did they know litterally i thought it was because the name vexoh but my other accounts like google and Twitter and the email or phone thing got banned when it had vexoh but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the reason maybe they just found out I was under 13 because for my Twitter I used my email and for google too. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of Vexoh or they found out my date of birth because I can get sisters permission. Oh yea I forgot to tell you vexoh has a word in it that is vex and it means annoy people that\u2019s why I said maybe because of my name vexoh because first I thought that but now I think of it more because I searched up vexoh and saw vex. There\u2019s so much accounts with Vexoh thought and vex so I don\u2019t know. I you know why then comment back please I need help I know I have 20 followers on the account I\u2019m using right now but i want to use my email or Facebook for it because I don\u2019t want to forget. I\u2019m also trying to forget about it but I can\u2019t I just want to forget about and be like who cares but I can\u2019t because I don\u2019t even post videos so all I\u2019m gonna do if I get my account back is litterally do nothing. I just want it back because I don\u2019t want to forget and at the same time can\u2019t forget about it so there\u2019s no way I will be able to sleep.

Example: Person hurts his knee by falling of his bike, start to feel an emotion: anger, sadness etc. <br><br>try somehow to change the feeling of this bad memory with adjusting the memory in your favor. Remembering or experiencing the bad  memory exactly as it was, like a person falling of his bike, it hurts, but then just after change it with  imaging or experience some different like you see a hot women (if you&#39;re a guy), and somehow you feelings changes and then intensity of the bad memory gets decreased.<br><br>tip: view this as a universal principle. it can be used for any bad memory. it does not have to be a like falling of a bike only. <br>The template could be like this: <br>1.

I was faster than him and got to the bus stop. He managed to find me and got really pissed off. He started trying to push me and grab me and was swearing in a upset but angry tone. I was managing to hold him back but he was explaining how his mum was in hospital and almost dying. I was telling him I was truly sorry and had no idea about his mum. He went to get a stick to hit me and hit me twice on the arm. It didn&#39;t hurt but one of my best friends came along and started to hold him back and told him to stop. my friend stopped and then I told the boy to calm down and I told him about how my mum once had cancer and I said I know how it feels I&#39;m so sorry. He was still obviously really pissed off and filled with rage he turned around and went home. <br>I feel like a piece of shit for what I did and want to tell him how much more sorry I am. can someone please give me advice.

When the Nanjing/Nanking group was getting ready to present I asked my friends who sat in front and in the next row why the teacher kept saying Nanking because I take Mandarin classes and I was pretty sure it was Nanjing. Unfortunately I said it way louder than I thought I was (since most of the class was talking I spoke louder than I usually do) and half the class turned and looked at me like I was a maniac :&#39;&#39;&#39;( and I think the teacher heard me too!

Story Time: Once I got sick with temperature so my Mom took me to the doctor. He gave me pills and i was like &quot;Oh, Great.&quot; It was my first time taking a pill and I has beyond nervous which ledes me to my last thing I want to forget. Vomit. Just no. Please. No. I am a picky eater and NOT good with medicines. (When I was 8, i vomited because the medicine was so bitter) So continuing with my Pill story: I got home and my mom told me to take the pill. She cut it in 4 and I was still scared cause i knew it was going to be VERY bitter. I tried and tried and i would still spill it out. I would litterally stare at my self in the mirror just holding the pill and not doing anything. My mom was trying to help me putting in inside food or something but No. It did not Work. This went on for about 3 hours. My mom said they were going to force me so my dad grabbed me and i started FRICKING OUT OMG. I was like &quot;NNNOOO!!!!! STOOOPPP!!!! PLLLEEAASSEE!!! AAAAHAHHAHAHAHHA!!!!!&quot; My parents are very nice people and wouldn&#39;t do that to me. My dad just said &quot;Calm down. We are not going to force you. But you need to take it.&quot; More tries, and more methods and I could not take it. My mom, crying to tears, just closed the door and i went to sleep. She came into my room and said &quot;Im sorry. I cant make you do something you cant do. I love you.&quot; I didn&#39;t even want to go to school the next day but I wanted my perfect attendance so I had to. During school they called me to the office because my mom was there. She said there is a Shot for that medicine and I was like &quot;OMG YUS!&quot; (I have no problems with shots.)

It&#39;s a complex business, but as a guideline, people who want to forget something should re-evaluate the value of that memory. For starters, you might want to forget an event which involved other people and thus they will still remember it. Any cause-consequence from that event will still be in effect but after the pill you won&#39;t know why anymore. Then the bad memory is part of one&#39;s history and personality and is a piece of knowledge about something or some experience the person has acquired. Deleting it might change something fundamental about yourself like change personality in unpredictable ways or make you lose a skill or details about your life.<br>I talking about how deleting information from one&#39;s mind can backfire, but I&#39;m not really against it... I do have some memories I&#39;d like to lose myself. But many times I wonder what really should I forget. It&#39;s like asking: if I was able to travel back in time and change any one thing what would it be without losing what I have achieved until this point...<br>Some memories are consider bad because they bring up displeasing emotions. But it&#39;s all just like a bad dream which leaves you very scared upon waking up but fades away when we let go. These are not relevant anymore to the person. These are like the experiences that bring phobias, manias and post-traumatic disorders. Sure a pill would be of good use for such memories but the underlying condition can be removed by a person rethinking her/himself and stop getting easily attached to anything. Moving on is the name of the game.<br>As this video recognizes, memories aren&#39;t like files in a cabinet. They are the interference of patterns in the structure of the mind. The emotions, personal experiences, constant stream from the perception to the consciousness and memories are all an even flow and hard to distinguish from each other. If you want to erase a memory, you do it like you break a bad habit: you replace it with another memory/routine. Neither in the brain or in computers there&#39;s such thing as deleting information, but rather you overwrite/rewrite it. It seems something intrinsic to information theory that nothing is lost.<br>It&#39;s like that song from Pearl Jam: Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies, he doesn&#39;t know, so he chases them away, Someday yet, he&#39;ll begin his life again...", "comment_date": "2014-11-02T11:15:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sajid Sohail", "comment_text": "i want 1, i want to forget youtube", "comment_date": "2014-11-02T10:00:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dane mcnally", "comment_text": "The science behind pins and needles in your arms legs hands ect", "comment_date": "2014-11-02T08:23:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "2tacosrgood", "comment_text": "Why would you want to erase memories? memories make you who you are the good and the bad\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-11-02T06:50:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rojin M.", "comment_text": "I would never take the pill.
