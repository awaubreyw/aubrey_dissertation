The substance is a preservative that prevents your products from becoming ridden with disease, which is an actual legitimate concern. In addition, parabens as they are found in cosmetics are 1000x weaker, than how they are found in foods you eat on a daily basis. My final concluding point is that they really are safe because your body metabolizes them fairly well and I&#39;d appreciate it if this part of the video was revised.

The first 2 are true. and the last one I made up. do not think is true.  I worked fast food in my younger years. Had a young teenage girl.  who would just dissappear.  always find her in the mirror putting more on. How it started.  But the other reason for me. I live in Missouri.  When I was 17 we toured the Merrimac cavern.  and on the tour we got to the great opening area in the cave. Tour guide started telling facts about bat guano.  And one of them was about one of the big name makers of make up would harvest the guano for make up. The base most use before they put on blush and eye shadow. Bats hibernate in the winter and in the spring for 6 weeks the harvest of guano would take place. After that I think I watched a how it&#39;s made  and they were talking about lip stick and glosses.  Whale blubber is used to make them.  These facts had a huge roll in why I stopped wearing make up. and oily skin and acne.  The part about babies.  I don&#39;t think so.  But it did help keep that girl at her station when she had a shift with me.  I wasn&#39;t a higher up manager and they wouldn&#39;t let me fire her.  I&#39;m in my mid 40&#39;s and Don&#39;t use any of that stuff. winter comes and chapped lips just vasaline or olive oil and sugar. that&#39;s it.
