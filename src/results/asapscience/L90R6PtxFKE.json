By 2050 the global population is expected to rise to 10 billion and then 20 million and then 30 and so on. People are being born way faster than people are dying. This means more people, more people means less wealth to go around and with inflation levels at their highest levels since the Great Depression, unemployement and job dissatisfaction peaking beyond any reasonable level and the global warming crisis which is predicted to displace billions of people around the world, leading to mass migrations the likes which have not been seen since the days of the Bible. <br><br>That is the sad future of our planet and the worst part is that it will all have been for nothing, as sooner or later this whole system they&#39;ve built is going to come crashing down because, again, we live in a finite planet with a limited amount of resources, the problem is it&#39;s going to come crashing down on all of us, but mostly it will fall on the backs over the uber wealthy who will be charged with holding back the onslaught, which they will fail because a couple hundred people can&#39;t control 8 billion others, especially when money stops actually meaning something. A circular economy is a pipe dream, an impossible utopia that our society has somehow deluded istelf into believing is achievable. \r<br>\r<br>We are running out of metals, we are running out of coal, we are running out of gas, we are running out of oil and water and our consumption needs keep growing by the day. Unless there&#39;s a miracle right around the corner we are pretty much screwed.

People with more materials, resources and privileges don&#39;t need to be kind to just anyone, and can choose to dismiss people who are of a lower class than themselves as irrelevant and unimportant because they don&#39;t rely on them or strive to live like them. They have more opportunities, and they don&#39;t want to lose their power. In my experience, really wealthy people aren&#39;t outwardly mean, but if you get to know them a little more they pretty much are snobs, rude and inconsiderate. They dehumanize and dismiss those who are below them on the social class hierarchy. They only want to associate with others who have similar bank accounts as their own. They don&#39;t want increases in taxes, and when they &quot;give back&quot; they do so to make a show of their good character, not because they always treat others in egalitarian or considerate manners. Yet, they somehow make sure to keep their own kids from interacting with middle class kids who have single parents or attend public schools. Not all really wealthy people are the same in character, obviously.

Because they worked hard and pushed themselves above and beyond to achieve success their hard work is like a certificate for their actions. And for people who were born in rich families, their certificate is their parents/whoever success. Because their parents/whoever had them for that reason, some people don&#39;t have children because they can&#39;t they wont be able to take care of their child even tho they want a child. So when a rich person has a child they have a child because they can take care of them give them the best treatment, and plus it&#39;s not the kids fault they act spoiled they grew up in rich areas where water fountains are made of gold and that&#39;s not even a joke I bet there is rich places like that out there. The real question is do rich parents take necessary discipline actions, and technically everyone should be as prosperous but since our system is so crooked that will never happen.

No, wealth just happens to give people who are already jerks an outsized opportunity to advertise the fact that they are jerks.<br><br>The too long version:<br><br>It depends on how you define rich. People who have lots of money and consequently <i>spend</i> lots of money (the aforementioned Mercedes drivers, for example) are obviously quite concerned with image, status, and power. It would make sense that they aren&#39;t the nicest people around. If you primarily use your money to make yourself appear superior to others, that betrays an overall state of being that many, I think, would label as &quot;jerk&quot;.<br><br>On the other hand, people who have lots of money but <i>don&#39;t</i> spend it all are another case entirely. Not only are these people generally wealthier (because they save their wealth rather than spend it), but they&#39;re also more difficult to <i>label</i> as rich. Imagine a multi-millionaire who lives in a nice, old ranch house in a middle-class part of town and who rides a bike everywhere. These people exist, and are in fact pretty common, but would people even know that they&#39;re rich? They could even be total jerks, but since no one has any reason to think they&#39;re rich, the title &quot;rich jerk&quot; doesn&#39;t get applied to them. <br><br>So I think the real factor here is how eager you are to use your wealth to show off to others. Not only are people who use wealth to project status or an attitude of superiority more likely to be labelled &quot;jerks&quot; due to their behavior, but they&#39;re also the most conspicuously wealthy. The wealthy people who live simply and keep to themselves just sort of fade into the background and no one even considers them in the equation.", "comment_date": "2018-05-05T16:04:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DeenanTheKemon I", "comment_text": "Ive been working for my millionaire landlord as a maintenence Man for seven years, and if Ive learned anything it is that people with money TRULY dont care about anything but their Money, he <b>IS</b> a bad person, he just pays well.

Also, most rich people had to work hard to get to where the are. I\u2019ve noticed that in any subject, people that aren\u2019t as successful will always resent people that are more successful than them. And this video doesn\u2019t cover everything that makes someone \u201cnice\u201d, it pretty much just says if you have a fancy car you might cut people off and if you live in a class with a large amount of people that have less power than a higher class you\u2019ll be more social. Based on what I\u2019ve seen, more rich people will give money/food to poor people on the street than someone from a poor-middle class. Also your statistic of donating 5% of $20k and 3% of $100k is kind of biased as 5% of $20k=$1000 and 3% of $100k is $3000 dollars. Based on that point, rich people are three times as generous as poor people. I think that if the middle-poor class wants equality they should start treating all people equal because the rich are easy-target minorities as if they ever stand up they appear greedy and poor-person hating. You have to remember that even if you despise the 1st class, 20% of 20k is 4k and 50% of 1 million dollars is 500k. You also have to admit that if you claim to be as genius as all the billionaires then you would be one, most of the richest people in the world were self starters so if you aren\u2019t one of them you only have yourself to blame. No offense to anyone but this is just my opinion on the matter, my final statement is that all classes are equal, don\u2019t be hypocritical and pick on the richer minority while saying that the richer minority doesn\u2019t accept other minorities and to all the rich snobs out there don\u2019t look down on people poorer than you instead see if you can help them become richer.", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T05:46:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "paytyt", "comment_text": "Rich people shaming, lol", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T05:12:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jared Johnson", "comment_text": "BS", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T04:00:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I'm not giving my name to Google", "comment_text": "Your videos are getting worse.", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T03:58:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AMRV", "comment_text": "It&#39;s true.

An escapist delusion is not a solution to any problem, and it is no proper part of any plan to address future contingencies. You must pay attention, but you must not allow your peace of mind to depend upon events magically conforming to your wishful thinking or your stubbornly held expectations. In fact, hope is always misplaced when it is vested in the vicissitudes of the political, social, or economic spheres. Your hopes are to be attached only to your own efforts of will, and your own diligent attention to self-discipline. You must hope that you have the fortitude to meet the challenges that you encounter. Captain your own ship, and chart a course toward wisdom and virtue.

You mention that as you become more powerful (or rich) you lose empathy and \u201cbecome more self centered\u201d. While that may be true, it\u2019s not because they suddenly loathe or feel better than others. But rather that when you become a leader, you are asked to care for a large number of people, objects, money, etc. and are forced to make decisions that may hurt an individual for the benefit of the whole. That\u2019s why on average, less emotional, or detached personalities tend to be more successful leaders (and generally more liked and well respected too). Because they value the whole more than individuals. It\u2019s not out of disrespect, but out of necessity to protect what is (or is perceived to be) the greater good. That\u2019s why I feel it\u2019s unfair to portray rich people as selfish or blind to other\u2019s emotions. Obviously, there are rich people that are just jerks, but in most cases I would argue that there\u2019s a bigger picture that often gets ignored in this discussion.

Luffy", "comment_text": "Of course, there&#39;s already 3,364 comments, so no one will ever read this. But I find it odd how you can publish a video proving rich people to be jerks, and also publish a video on how good looking people are only perceived as jerks. Now of course I have no scientific backing to prove my point, so I could be wrong. But I think that the reason rich people are perceived as jerks is similar to your are good looking people jerks video. We ignore rude, poor people, and we focus more on people that are rich. There are nice rich people and there are rude rich people, but rude rich people stick out more in our mind because of a subconscious envy. Especially in regards to wealth, having money puts a target on your back, because people who are less wealthy than you automatically assume you are a selfish person without even bothering to try and see past the &quot;wealth hatred&quot; filter.<br><br>There also tends to be a difference in philosophies or values between rich and poor people. Poor people tend to focus more on enjoying the present or following their passion, whereas rich people tend to focus more on preparing for the future. This difference in values causes a ton of misunderstanding, causing dislike or even bullying. Your point is validated in the &quot;The Perfect Gooseys&quot;, where a janitor&#39;s kid is mercilessly bullied by rich kids, but keep in mind the same thing can happen to a smart kid who works to be successful in school but gets bullied by people that aren&#39;t working in school. I can attest to this first hand- I was bullied in school by people that hated me for being smart. One girl used to step on the back of my shoes in the hallway and throw books at me. Another group of people wouldn&#39;t let me play kickball with them, saying, &quot;Sorry- we don&#39;t let nerds play.&quot; Some of those kids didn&#39;t make it to college, while I&#39;m now in one of the top engineering programs in the nation. Now that I&#39;m more successful than them, and because I will likely be wealthier than them in the future, does that make me the jerk?<br><br>Who you view as mean depends on your perspective. Since engineers end up with a salary that puts then in the top 10-20% of the nation&#39;s wealth, that means the other 80-90% of people are poorer than that person and more likely to view them as a jerk. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;ve never run into rude rich people. But overall in my life, the people who have been the meanest to me have been the people that had less success than me and hated me for it.

Poor people have worst health from preventable things such as smoking and overeating, poor substantially commit higher crime, poor people tend to be a bigger drain on society and use most forms of welfare.  Poor people by choice neglect their education.  Nothing in the united states prevents someone from getting an associate&#39;s or bachelor&#39;s degree, a poor person will qualify for full financial aid pell grant, this alone provides enough money without loans or out of pocket cost for any community college in the country, than they can transfer to a state university and if they work hard, get scholarships, pay little to nothing. Poor people more than any other class or group, choose not to get an education which hurts their future earning potential.  Poor people tend to make poor choices and suffer from poor executive function.  I&#39;m sure this would show up in brain scans as well. <br><br>So you could make an opposite argument that poor people are actually much worst than rich people and the middle class.

How can you be empathetic when say the King, assuming he is generous, knows the risks of just handing free money and food at all times, while also having to care for the lives of thousands or millions all at once (such as the President). People become reliant, they become sloths and gullible.  This is why government programs giving free money are inherently toxic to poorer individuals.  Why work, when your free pension requires periodic seminars and gives more money then some of the jobs available.    Rich people as well who HAVE been generous are spurned and mocked by poor/non-wealthy people because those people become arrogant ingrates, then blame the wealthy when the wealthy take back their hand from the snapping jaws.  Be fair to the rich as much as anyone. They aren&#39;t successful for no reason, and are actually decent people if addressed directly.  (yes, some are assholes, much as anyone of all strata I have met).  Some people below say &quot;Oh, but the ads are wealthy people.&quot;  Shut it, those people running companies have nearly all their assets tied to those companies. They provide jobs for you lot, giving you THEIR money to feed your family, handle your debts, in exchange for your labor to fuel a job which helps other people like You, who then pay the owners who reinvest that money back into the company, expanding jobs, to give more people like you Work and to provide a service to people like You.

True scientific analysis always makes you ask more questions and see more possibilities -- this video seemed more like telling you <b>what</b> to think versus *how*. I do agree, there is a reason for the stereotype. Money creates a form of power that, in some way, great or small, will alter the way a person thinks and views themselves, and there is definitely a percentage of wealthy people who use it for selfish and destructive means.<br><br>However, in my opinion, the problem is not with the money alone, but human nature. Money, in spite of its wonderful and terrible pedigree, is in and of itself an inanimate, neutral object. It&#39;s dependent upon how the person uses it. Some people use it for good, others use it for bad. Some use it to feed the homeless and pay for medical expenses incurred by poor children who have cancer, others use it to build bombs and later drop them on other countries.<br><br>While the video was fun and creative, and you guys genuinely seem like good fun people, my one caveat to the video would be that wealth can also be used for good, and can be used to incentivize people with really big ideas that could make society a better place (think Elon Musk). Giving people the impression that accumulating wealth will automatically make you an asshole, while fun (because, hey, who doesn&#39;t like to see the temple topple every now and then, right?) is also misleading, similar to the old-time rumor that giving a five dollar bill to a homeless person will automatically make them run for the liquor store or a drug dealer. Are there those who fit the profile? Sadly, yes. But you&#39;re also inadvertently squashing the exceptions to the rule who, believe it or not, could actually use it for good.<br><br>These are just my two cents and should be taken with a grain of salt, but that&#39;s just my opinion.<br><br>Other than that, I give you props for making enjoyable content.

Whereas, if you make $100,000, your effective tax rate leads to a tax bill that is at least $13,000, or 13% of your income.<br><br>I don&#39;t have a problem with this. Right out of college, my salary was about $25,000 per year, working 80 hours per week, so paying taxes would have absolutely sucked. It&#39;s been quite some time since then, I&#39;ve worked hard to get where I am, and for the first time, my salary is more than $100,000/year. Now: 4% of my income goes to taxes that fund Medicare, Medicaid, Chip, and health insurance marketplace subsidies (none of which benefit me personally). Another 4% went to taxes that fund social security (which LOL - I&#39;ll never see again.) ANOTHER 4% went to benefits for federal retirees and veterans, and social safety net programs. So fine -- I only gave about 1.0% of my pre-tax income to charity after all that. I donated, gladly, my <i>time</i> volunteering, but whatever if it doesn&#39;t have a dollar value attached to it, I guess.<br><br>After taxes, retirement savings, personal savings, rent, utilities, healthcare premiums, transit, blah blah blah, my disposable income is about $30,000 per year. Which, oh my god, is just awesome. For real! If you can&#39;t have a good life with $80/day to do whatever you want with, there&#39;s something wrong with you. I feel lucky.<br><br>I only mention all this because, while I consider myself a Democrat... it&#39;s just grown to sadden me a LOT to see how many people on the Left are such puppets of politicians that they have convinced themselves that &quot;The rich don&#39;t pay their fair share&quot; and say stuff like, &quot;Oh look how ungenerous the rich people are.&quot; Fine, that&#39;s true for some super-rich people who have offshore bank accounts and make all their money through capital gains or the stock market or whatever, but that sure ain&#39;t me, and that I&#39;m paying 15% of salary to taxes alone if of <i>course</i> WAY MORE THAN A FAIR SHARE. If politicians were honest, they would be saying that people who make more money pay more than their fair share because they <i>can</i> and it doesn&#39;t hurt their ability to subsist. I&#39;ve been there -- with a salary of $25,000 per year, paying the tax rate I&#39;m paying now would have cut me down to $20,000 per year <i>Before</i> my rent, my utilities, my healthcare, my transit. I sure as hell couldn&#39;t save any money at all, so I&#39;m glad I&#39;m very glad I didn&#39;t have to pay taxes. That&#39;s one of the reasons why I don&#39;t have a problem paying taxes now. If they go up, they go up. I&#39;ll still pay &#39;em, and no politician on the RIGHT will ever successfully buy me off with the offer of a tax cut.

"comment_date": "2018-04-26T17:13:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dawud G Delves", "comment_text": "I look at this as follows: Imagine you are 25 years old and amassed a 25 million dollar fortune. You may feel that your time, energy, and effort, is worth more than everyone elses comparatively. That rationale could cause you disregard the time, energy, and effort of others because you see it as less than your own. You cut people off in traffic, because where you need to be is seen as more important than where others need to be.

It&#39;s only the super rich who tend to have more leisure than their poor counterparts.  Also people tend to get far more easily pissed at bad drivers than in real life.  For example, if someone &quot;cut you off&quot; on the sidewalk, you&#39;ll probably say &quot;Oh, excuse me&quot; rather than &quot;YOU F&amp;%KING PIECE OF SH<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23T\">#T</a>&quot;.  <br><br>2) Returning the change also makes sense for the same reason.  Rich people have busy schedules and can&#39;t always stop to do a virtuous act without accidentally being late to an important meeting.  The personal cost for random acts of virtue is much higher for a rich person.  Granted, since humans are ever adaptable, they then justify their actions by blaming it on the clerk rather than on themselves (i.e. &quot;the cashier should learn to do their job correctly&quot;).  That&#39;s something everyone does, but rich people do it more often because the opportunity comes up more often.  <br><br>3) As for looking at people, rich people have a lot on their mind, and their wealth is constantly sought after by those with less wealth.  Ever been overwhelmed by too many beggars in a single day?  That&#39;s a rich person&#39;s life ever single day.  <br><br>4) Donating is a bit misleading because while they do give a smaller percentage, they also see their investments as doing good for society as well.  Even though many wealthy people manipulate congress with their donations, many rich people fight back with their donations.  Others invest in smaller businesses they believe in.  None of these count as charity, but it&#39;s plenty for a rich person to feel like they are doing the right thing (whether it&#39;s actually more effective, I&#39;ll leave that up to you).  <br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m constantly ignored by rich people and treated like a second class citizen with my job.  But we have to remind ourselves that they are humans doing what humans do.  It&#39;s extremely easy for me to resent the rich, but it&#39;s hard for me to see them as people, and morality is often about doing what&#39;s hard.", "comment_date": "2018-04-26T17:02:17Z", "likes_count": 34}, {"comment_by": "Etterra", "comment_text": "Eat the rich.", "comment_date": "2018-04-26T17:02:05Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "En Karl av ordning", "comment_text": "It seems to be lot of jerks in this comment section.", "comment_date": "2018-04-26T17:01:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colby Miller", "comment_text": "They made their money....
