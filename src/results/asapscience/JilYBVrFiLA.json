We are sensitive beings too, and our bodies work in very similar ways to a large extent. The bees are like the Canary in the mine: As poisonous gas was emitted, they died and thereby warned the miners so as to get out of there immediately. <br>Honey is a remedial substance, by the way, not to be consumed to the extent many do.<br> It also makes the skeleton a bit porous and the sweetness is not beneficial for today&#39;s man-made diseases like rheumatism, burn-out.

What has is it&#39;s coincidental timing with the rise of the environmental movement. It has become one more adopted &quot;cause&quot; in the agenda of the green movement. Along with/because of the attention generated by the environmental movement and political pressure by big agriculture has come the promise of tax funded, rather than in house, bee health R&amp;D. And after all, why would commercial beekeepers be in any hurry to admit CCD has always been a recurring problem when there&#39;s free R&amp;D money on the table? Second, setting aside the fact that neonicotinoids have been shown in several studies to have no effect on bees, and not one study has shown otherwise; why would the very farmers who rely on bees for crop pollination, pay to use a product that would kill them. Farmers aren&#39;t stupid, nor are the big Chem corporations who live to profit from improving crop yields for those farmers. If it hurts bees, it hurts crops. If it hurts crops, it hurts farmers.

The immigrated with the european colonists<br><br>- Honey bees are the cause for large scale mono crop production in the agricultural revolution because of a few facts:<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ---They can seek out and pollinate plants up to 5km away from their beehive<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 --- Honey bees are VERY efficient pollinators in the fact that they, as a eusocial organism, seek out specific plants as a colony that offer the BEST source of nectar and pollen in their ecosystem and systematically maximize their yield from it<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <del>-</del> Honey bees are incredibly adaptable, even to a genetic level<br>(<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/job-swapping-makes-its-mark-on-honeybee-dna-1.11418\">http://www.nature.com/news/job-swapping-makes-its-mark-on-honeybee-dna-1.11418</a>)\n\n- Native bees make up over 1 million in diverse species found throughout North America (<a href=\"http://www.xerces.org/pollinator-conservation/native-bees/\">http://www.xerces.org/pollinator-conservation/native-bees/</a>)\u00a0<br><br>- Many native bees offer pollination service within a small range (within 100m of their nest) and because they lay only up to a max of 300 individuals (bumble bees) and 20 individuals (solitary bees) within each females lifespan, there is less dependancy on BULK pollen and nectar, and therefore, these bee species are more resilient to variability in weather and climate over time.<br><br>- Other invertebrates and organisms offer pollination: beetles, flies, moths, butterflies, wasps, birds, bats, etc (<a href=\"http://www.xerces.org\">http://www.xerces.org</a>)\u00a0<br><br>- Solitary bees are actually responsible for most alfalfa pollination (<a href=\"http://www.pollinator.ca/canpolin/alfalfa_lcb.html\">http://www.pollinator.ca/canpolin/alfalfa_lcb.html</a>)\u00a0<br><br>So, what does this ACTUALLY mean for our future if honey bee populations dwindle to the point of no return? It means that the current commercial food production model of mono cropping will fail. This means no more bulk purchasing of imported items at a subsidized rate, eating out of season, nor supply and demand principals (this is an issue with water anyways and drought is likely to cause our cheap rate for tomatoes in February to discontinue)<br><br>So, what CAN we expect? less mono crop, more diversity! And the American government knows this too and is actually doing something about it:\u00a0<br><a href=\"http://www.xerces.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/using-farmbill-programs-for-pollinator-conservation.pdf\">http://www.xerces.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/using-farmbill-programs-for-pollinator-conservation.pdf</a><br><br>But, instead of promoting ACTIONABLE items to the world, it is media like this that continues to exacerbate the issue, making people feel helpless, encouraging even more rhetoric on how we are screwed by big-pharma when really, it is ALL OF US WHO CAN ACT by growing your own garden, creating habitat for native bees, learning to ID these bees and support them by creating hedgerows and micro-environemnts of gardens, trees and green spaces to support them.\u00a0<br><br>I am a beekeeper, I teach beekeeping for a living and to be honest, it is awesome. The fear of losing bees has encouraged more engagement and observation and consideration for our urban ecosystems then I thought possible in the past 6 years. But it is a continuation of this unimaginative, dated, and depressing rhetoric that keeps movements from gaining capacity as it leaves all those moving toward supporting ALL bees in a head space of eminent failure. We need to have progressive, positive, realistic and focussed approaches to this issue, and FEAR IS NOT AN OPTION.<br><br>Eliese, Apiaries and Bees for Communities", "comment_date": "2015-03-28T16:00:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vamshi Pala", "comment_text": "what happens if we were immune to getting sick", "comment_date": "2015-03-28T15:55:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gadgetslotto", "comment_text": "Do they have wifi on the International Space Station?", "comment_date": "2015-03-28T15:39:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M", "comment_text": "Why do we sometimes have those falling dreams but than wake up right before we die?

Have wild honey bees in our back yard that have been doing pretty well for themselves. As it is, we like having them, as they don&#39;t pose an active threat to us, the kids, or animals in the area. We have flowering plants in the yard almost year round, and depending on how cold the winter, even then too. We don&#39;t harvest from them for a few reasons. First is, we don&#39;t need to. Second is that they should be better able to come back after a big die off. If most of the adult bees die, the next generation should be able to grow up with plenty of stockpiled supplies, namely honey. The third would be location. They&#39;ve set up shop in the peak of  of my grandfather&#39;s wood working and tool shop, which is quite large and tall, and less prone to damage than the nearby trees.<br><br>We like having them there. Every few years or so, half the nest splits off and flies away to form, what I&#39;m guessing and hoping, a new nest somewhere else. This is really cool to watch, though terrifying at the same time. You can actually walk right into the midst of the moving hive and if you&#39;re able to remain calm, none of them will sting you. Don&#39;t go poking sticks into the beard of the swarm, as this is where the new queen is hiding. The old nest even tolerates new moving nests that are passing through, not attacking them or running them off as you might think. I find they like to stay decently high up when they are moving, even when the &#39;beard&#39; is resting on a tree branch.<br><br>If i happen to observe the nest doing this again, I will try to record it with video to show everyone.<br><br>Our nest is also very tolerant of human activity, you could walk under the nest beating cymbals and they would completely ignore you. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s because my grandfather&#39;s wood working tools are very loud, and they&#39;ve gotten used to us walking under them all the time. The only times anyone has gotten stung by the bees from our nest would be if they stepped on one bare footed or swatted at it unknowingly.
