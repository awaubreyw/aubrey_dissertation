Yes, it&#39;s definitely true that a sperm whale&#39;s brain is much bigger than ours, but their intelligence is lacking compared to hours; but that&#39;s only part of it. Sperm whales have large brains due in part to their large body size, and their brains have to keep up with maintaining that large body. What I believe to describe &quot;brain power&quot; is a proportional brain mass to body mass ratio. The bigger the brain is compared to the body, the smarter and more capable the organism can be. <br><br><br>We are humans, and our brains are massive compared to other species and ancestors, we have evolved to use our brains and intelligence for our survival, more rather than brute force and complete dominance in other species. Compared to our body however, the brain <b>is</b> still pretty small, although it is arguably the most important organ in the body, so I believe that the smaller it is, the less chances it has to get damaged. I looked this up just now, and the brain average brain is only <b>3 pounds, only 2 percent</b> of our body weight. BUT, it takes up <b>25 percent</b> of our intake of oxygen, <b>70 percent</b> of the body&#39;s glucose, and <b>25 percent</b> of the body&#39;s nutrients. <br><br>I believe a bigger brain is better, it possesses too many risks. Chances of head injuries may skyrocket, (due to a bigger head, duh). Our caloric and nutrient intake will boost by a lot, we&#39;re already pretty smart (for the most part) so it&#39;s just a waste and too risky of dying. Bigger brains are probably a turn off and may be seen as an abnormality, and even if someone greatly surpasses the IQ and brain power potential, I doubt it would solve many if any, of our problems, (spoiler for anyone who hasn&#39;t watched Lucy) as Lucy did when she reached &quot;100%&quot; of her brain potential. In the movie, she put all the world&#39;s problems&#39; solutions onto a flash drive before she &#39;died&#39;, (this is from memory so don&#39;t quote me) and it was given to someone. IQ is only a person&#39;s <i>capability</i> to learn, so if someone with a high IQ didn&#39;t have the required resources, to a certain extent, that person can&#39;t even speak or do basic maths. This may be the same thing with a person who&#39;s really intelligent and has a massive brain and IQ to go along with it. If that person doesn&#39;t have the proper resources, he can&#39;t solve the world&#39;s problems efficiently, or even if he knew every single bit of information that other humans did, that person would only be capable of so much. Because we, as humans, don&#39;t know everything and are very flawed, and that very intelligent person will act upon those flawed ideals and information supplied by those flawed humans. <br><br>what the hell has this comment turned into I have to sleep please", "comment_date": "2017-08-17T04:00:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nadia N", "comment_text": "it&#39;s 11 days.

The claim that we use 10% of our brain is pointing to the brains ability and capacity to function in different ways. That&#39;s the way the movies portray it and that it is ultimately what is meant by &quot;10% of our brain&quot;. For example, when you play videogames your entire brain is functioning to different capacities in different parts of the brain. The whole brain is working. However, you are using a tiny piece of your brain&#39;s abilities. Let&#39;s say maybe even 10%? The whole brain is working but only at a small capacity. Read a book and you use the entire brain naturally to read and understand the thoughts being expressed in the boook. But a much different function than playing video games. Build a model airplane, learn how to dance, write a novel, draft plans to build a high rise building. Scientifically, no one ever said that there is a single piece of the brain matter being used to do those things while the rest of your brain does nothing but take up space in your head. But it could easily be only 10% of the brain&#39;s ability. As a matter of opinion, I believe that there is an entire world of things we can do with our brains that are virtually undiscovered.

Going in order:<br>1. Although simply comparing size is not an indicator of intelligence, the ratio of brain size to body size can be a decent predictor (although still has some exceptions). The encephalization quotient (the ratio of the expected brain size to the actual brain size based on body mass) is an even more accurate predictor. So size doesn&#39;t mean nothing (i.e. obviously a sperm whale is going to have a bigger brain, it&#39;s motor areas alone are probably bigger than the entire human brain).<br>2. Alcohol actually can and does actually cause death of some cells in the brain. Betz cells and purkinje cells are 2 that come to mind.<br>5. This one is correct, but I would like to add that you don&#39;t use more than 10% of your brain at the same time (like he said). You actually don&#39;t even use close to 10% of your brain at once. Doing so would likely result in an intense seizure.\u00a0<br>6. Although you don&#39;t necessarily use one side more than the other, there is such thing as right and left brained and it correlates with which side is stronger. Just as smarter people have more efficient and potentially more connectivity in their brain, one side of your brain is usually &quot;smarter&quot; than the other side. Although I don&#39;t remember exactly which functions are lateralized to which side of the brain, people do think differently based on which side of the brain is stronger or more dominant.<br>7. The five senses are simply a general categorization of all the different ways our body senses the surroundings. Yes pain is sensed from different types of nerves than simple touching and even stays segregated all the way up to the brain, but they can both be put into the &quot;feel&quot; category of sensing because they are in the same area of the brain (the somatosensory area). There are only 5 main sensing areas in the brain (feel, smell, taste, see and hear) and these can be subdivided.\u00a0<br>\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-07-24T21:09:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phillip Zezulak", "comment_text": "How do we know that we are actually smarter than whales? \u00a0Is it just because we think we are or have we actually tested this theory out?", "comment_date": "2014-07-24T20:55:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AliannaNicole01", "comment_text": "My brain hurts...", "comment_date": "2014-07-24T19:40:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S DK", "comment_text": "This video really makes me want to buy a fridge.", "comment_date": "2014-07-24T19:00:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ThunderChick23", "comment_text": "I always did hate that &quot;left brain right brain&quot; bullshit.", "comment_date": "2014-07-24T18:02:53Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Archer", "comment_text": "Make a draw my life", "comment_date": "2014-07-24T17:01:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CWorks", "comment_text": "I always wonder what causes OCD", "comment_date": "2014-07-24T15:14:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Full shock Blue", "comment_text": "Everything is a lie!", "comment_date": "2014-07-24T11:14:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "juredddd", "comment_text": "Can somebody explain this to me or give me a link to a website or two where can learn about this in depth myself?<br>Well the question is: &quot;how much of a brain we can use at any given moment?&quot;<br>I ask this question because I think there is some truth with the statement that we use only 10% of a brain.

It seems that we need to focus on this topic a little bit more instead of saying &quot;nope&quot;. Also it is common sense to know that some parts of our brain&quot; doesn&#39;t do anything&quot;.

People with severe epileptic seizures have the corpus callosum cut, because that connection from the left side of the brain to the right side of the brain is causing feedback. When this is cut, the right side of the brain (which controls the left side of your body) is no longer under the dictatorship of the left. There have been documented cases of the right, mute, side of the brain having a much different agenda than your left. One being when a man was about to hug is wife, only to find that his other arm had a completely different agenda. It delivered a right hook to her face. When this was being noticed, tests to see if the right brain had it&#39;s own conscious were under way. Since the right brain can&#39;t control speech, but can understand and read it, the tests were made so that it could respond to questions using scrabble letters. They would cover the right eye (which is how the right brain sees) and ask the left brain a question (one question being if the person was a believer). Of course it responded using speech, the left said it was an atheist. When they covered the left eye so that the right brain could see, and asked it the same exact question, that&#39;s when it got interesting. Using the scrabble letters, it spelled out that it was a believer.<br>But before my comment gets ridiculously long, I&#39;m going to stop there.

In fact, philosophically, the mind body problem is more logically solved by dualism. Many philosophers and scientists are dualists because of the logical problems with a purely materialistic standpoint.<br><br>I think misunderstanding the dualism standpoint stems from the fact that most people don&#39;t fully understand the mind-body problem, and don&#39;t understand brain physics as well.<br><br>First, the brain operates like a machine, Information stimulates neurons from nerve connections, this electrical stimulation is is &#39;measured&#39; by the neuron, and because of it&#39;s programmed tolerance, it may or may not pass on the stimulation to the next neuron in the network. The information propagates through the network, and back out through nerve connections to move limbs, speak, etc. \u00a0Stimulation flowing through your brain will cause your neurons to adjust their tolerances to better respond to stimulation next time, this is learning.<br><br>In short, a brain is a mechanical system that is set up to respond to certain stimulus in a way that is favorable to a certain situation. Here&#39;s the problem, the mind problem. As any conscious being is aware, we are aware. The great &#39;I&#39;, you can have conscious experience. Information ceases to be a physical propensity to respond to a situation favorable, and it becomes a feeling. \u00a0I don&#39;t pretend to know exactly how this phenomenon occurs, but I can tell you that due to the architecture of the brain, something is missing. Some say that information &#39;links-up&#39; in the brain and you get an experience, or a certain amount of processing &#39;creates&#39; an experience. When you think about it, all processing and linking could do is grant your brain better reaction to stimulus. Frankly, the brain is not built for consciousness and I doubt any mechanical system can be. Where do thoughts exist, and what makes red red? And where do all these things exist? I thought the brain stored information in a bunch of disjointed tolerances and propensities?\u00a0<br><br>How can we rectify our current knowledge of the brain with a necessary dualist perspective? I&#39;ve heard materialists raise the argument of how brain trauma can effect consciousness and percept. This is an easily explained phenomenon, many dualists believe in a &#39;stream of consciousness&#39;, or a channel where processed brain information travels through to the metaphysical mind to become experiences. If you, for example, get your head bashed, your brain goes into trauma and cannot process information, thus your brain has no information to become experiences, thus no experiences. Another popular argument is that things like memory, image processing, etc can be traced to brain activity, these are called the soft problems of consciousness, this deals with the processing of incoming information, not the experiencing.<br><br>The reason some scientists are materialists and ignore the hard problems of consciousness, is because science is not suited to tackle the problem. Science is built on outside observation and definite values, not inside viewpoints and subjective experience. Another problem is that you can design a mechanical system with the propensity to respond to stimuli like a conscious being. You could make a robot behave like it has emotions, experiences, etc when it really doesn&#39;t have any.<br><br>A good analogy would be a lego brick representing intelligence and the ability to respond favorably to a situation. You can take millions upon millions of rectangular lego bricks and build a &#39;sphere&#39; out of them. The more and more lego bricks you add, the more and more it will appear to be spherical, however, you can never build a true sphere out of lego bricks. Imagine taking a large amount of pliable clay and molding that around the sphere, with the added pliability of the clay, you can turn a pseudo-sphere into a true sphere. The brain &#39;built out of lego bricks&#39; requires a pliable &#39;clay&#39; to create a sphere (ie consciousness).<br><br>Scientists tackle things from the outside, consciousness can only be tackled from the inside.", "comment_date": "2014-07-07T14:20:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jarod Benowitz", "comment_text": "So what is consciousness?

It means that yes: we use all parts of the brain but not all neuronal pathways! if we stop using a neuronal pathway it shrinks and gets weak. Studies have found that there are a lot of weak pathways and if a human could use more of the pathways at once it would significantly increase his cognitive skills.<br>Also, the one about &quot;Bigger is better&quot; you are comparing human brain to animal&#39;s brain! Between humans, developing a bigger brain means there&#39;s additional brain tissue which is correlated with a higher capacity to perform mental tasks :/<br>Lastly, a neuroscientist cousin told me you are correct on &quot;Right Brain/Left Brain&quot; because for example the amygdala(plays role on emotions/decisions/memory) has part on the right and left part of the brain. However, some skills are true to be on different sides. Language is on the left-brain and attention on the right-brain. If a person uses language more often, most of the neuronal pathways in that part of the brain are going to be stronger than other regions, and for that person using language is going to be easier than using math for example. When using language, yes, that person is going to use both parts, however is going to start on the left-brain&#39;s region related to language, which is also going to be more stronger.<br>I never do this, believe me.
