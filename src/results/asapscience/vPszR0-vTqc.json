After doing a CAT scan, a spot was identified on the right lobe of my lungs. I was sent to Dr. George Ouellette who ordered additional CAT scans. Later in December a PET scan was recommended. The PET scan lit up which typically indicated cancer, a bronchoscopy was performed at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit confirming that I had lung cancer.\r<br>Within two weeks, I had surgery scheduled with thoracic surgeon, Dr. Michael Marshal. Everything happened so fast and no one dragged their feet. On October 26, I had surgery to remove the upper and middle lobe of my right lung but unfortunately my condition was worse than the doctors originally anticipated and they experienced complications and ever since then my cancer kept getting worse. I thank God for Dr Harvey Propolis Lecithin Capsules, although I doubted it at first but I had no other choice than to give it a try and that was how I got cured after using the herbal products for about a month and some days. This means a lot to me and I pray God blesses Dr Harvey for his good works. I will urge everyone with this illness to reach out for Dr Harvey and get the \r\rproducts it really works and am a living testimony.

It\u2019s true that if you live at sea level and go up to 8,000 feet then your body will have trouble with the elevation. But people live over 8,000 feet and no one can spend over a couple nights at most above 23,000 feet. My family and I go on hikes that are above 10,000 feet all the time and we are not worried about getting back under 8,000 feet within a couple hours.

Do you do any of your own research? This morning I accidentally blended a cherry pit - to nice smoothy texture and drank it only thinking afterward that perhaps it could be harmful so I looked around the internet because I was curious and this video was one of the first things I saw. As you can imagine I was mortified. I called a health hotline I have here in the province and they told me there should be no problems but to call them if I had symptoms. I continued to research. The best answers I came across was from 2 sites:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.artofdrink.com/science/cyanide-in-apricot-cherries-pits\">https://www.artofdrink.com/science/cyanide-in-apricot-cherries-pits</a><br><br>&amp;<br><br><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/3anigt/request_cherry_pits_contain_cyanide_how_many/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/3anigt/request_cherry_pits_contain_cyanide_how_many/</a><br><br>And to sum them up I copied a few lines to share:<br><br>    The lowest known adult fatal dose of hydrogen cyanide was estimated to be 50 milligrams.<br>    Cherry pits contain about 3% amygdalin which yields 0.17% HCN<br><br>29.4 grams of cherry kernels x 0.17% HCN = 50mg of cyanide<br>One cherry pit weighs about 1 gram, so you\u2019re going to have to eat about 30 crushed cherry pits to die a horrible death.<br><br>Needless to say I had/have no symptoms. Looks like this video has been badly informing people for the last 3 years!<br><br>It makes me wonder how much other misinformation is in such informative videos?! So I checked out your most recent video too. Hmmm that was about vaccines: Perhaps you may not want to give over sweeping and biased viewpoints!  Wow... really... what is our world coming too!?

When somebody has a heart attack from the increased heart rate caused by marijuana, they don&#39;t write marijuana.

The amounts are small, so that in general, toxicity is not seen except in cases where a combination of factors seriously exacerbates the problem. Basically, you need<br><br>...a pit or seed from some fruit of a plant in the family Rosaceae, generally from Prunus genus (yes, this does include cherries, as well as plums, peaches, apricots, and almonds)<br>...of a variety that has an unusually high amygdalin content, which is to say, a bitter rather than sweet variety, such as for example bitter almonds or bitter apricot pits<br>...eaten in quantity, generally in the form of just the pits<br><br>Under such conditions, you can ingest enough amygdalin to kill you. However, while (some) cherry pits do apparently contain amygdalin at the same concentrations as bitter apricot kernels[1], the amount you would have to eat is considerably more than two pits. The LD50 for bitter almonds (which are also similar to cherry and apricot kernels, with ~5% amygdalin content) in rats is estimated to be a little more than 3 grams per Kg of body weight. <br><br>If we extrapolate to humans, we might expect to see significant mortality in adults once we started to get in to the range of hundreds of grams of pits consumed. Two cherry pits weigh about a gram, together. And not only that, but unless you grind them up, any amygdalin will be released slowly enough to seriously mitigate the toxicity.

Or if it is the weekend i normally have pasta for lunch and tea. So i was wondering if this is too much salt. How much salt can i consume in a day without dying? Or is it possible for me to die with eating all of these things one day\u00a0what if i decide one day i want more? Because i know i eat salty food and snacks. But what i really wanted to\u00a0ask if what i you at a lot of salt in a day, and you were just a little bit below the intake you can go with dying - and you go to sleep and the next morning you eat breakfast and there was a lot of salt on that breakfast, would you die or go into a coma? Or does you body (I know its gross) Poo or wee it out of your system so your good to go with the day. Or does you body do something which result you in not dying?

This is why while I&#39;m for the prohibition to be ended, I&#39;m not in favour of a totally open free-for-all. I am of the mind that it should be regulated much like alcohol and tobacco (both of which are far, FAR more dangerous than cannabis is.) And the side-benefit of legalizing it via proper and sane regulation, we, as a society, could deal a rather stinging blow to the cartels and criminal organizations that rely on the trafficking of cannabis. Sure, they might go on to other drugs but the sale of cannabis is what keeps the lights on in most of the narco-states around the world. If we legalize it and regulate it and price it so that it&#39;s far, FAR cheaper to just get it from a legal dispensary (which could also have support-systems in place to help those that are psychologically addicted to it to gain help) then the cartels just wouldn&#39;t be able to compete. Besides, a properly regulated system of growing, processing, testing and such could make the cannabis you get from a proper dispensary far, FAR safer AND the customer would be able to know exactly what&#39;s going in their bodies.

One gram of 210Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower than these estimates, because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks (the biological half-life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days[73]) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a median lethal dose of 210Po is 15 megabecquerels (0.41 mCi), or 0.089 micrograms, still an extremely small amount.[74][75] For comparison, one grain of table salt is about 0.06 mg = 60 \u03bcg.[3]", "comment_date": "2016-04-28T21:29:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Toss a coin to your Witcher", "comment_text": "14 days is the most that you can stay up and the record is 13 then they pass out and sleao for 16 hours", "comment_date": "2016-04-28T20:13:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Toss a coin to your Witcher", "comment_text": "no one can hold ther breth for 20 min thats a sorry for lil kids they can hold ther breth for 7 min", "comment_date": "2016-04-28T20:10:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yannick Dufil", "comment_text": "Deprivation of sleep is dangereous, but how much consecutiv sleeping hours can cause death if your body is maintained hydrated and fed ?", "comment_date": "2016-04-28T12:18:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cravition", "comment_text": "thank you! you just saved my life i almost ate 22kg of weed", "comment_date": "2016-04-28T06:26:55Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Taliya Bryant", "comment_text": "Dang!
