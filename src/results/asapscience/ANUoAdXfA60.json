And this would free up vast quantities of land. About 33 million square kilometers of land are used for pasture; an area about the size of Africa.

Without humans adding artificial nutrients, this land could turn to desert. But if properly managed, it\u2019s possible that some farmland would return to its natural state of grassland or forest which could help counteract global climate change.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANUoAdXfA60&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a> 5 \u2013 After all, the loss of CO2 absorbing trees cleared for agriculture is a major reason why global levels of CO2 are going up. Cows and other grazers also affect our climate through large amounts of methane production which has 25 times more potential planet warming power than CO2.

Cows milk, for instance, is for calves and not mankind. Furthermore, fish like wild salmon and tuna ought to be avoided due to radiation in the seas (mercury affecting tuna too). Farmed fish too should be avoided as they may lack nutrients e.g farmed salmon may lack Omega 3 Fatty Acids obtained from algae by wild salmon in the seas. <br><br>I do encourage to adopt (even if it means making small changes here and there) a well-planned, organic, unrefined and untempered with vegan diet (consuming raw plant foods where possible so as not to denature or destroy the life-forces and enzymatic activities beneficial to the human system. If disagreeing on this matter, please take some steamed carrots, plant them and see if they will grow; if not, it is because they are &#39;dead&#39; plant food that cannot benefit one&#39;s &#39;living&#39; cells) consisting of organic fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds and whole grains as it is the best diet to provide mankind with ultimate health and longevity. I do not even see a reason to use pharmaceutical supplements e.g Vitamin D is obtainable from organic chestnut mushrooms (UV exposed) and sun-dried mushrooms with the exception of the body&#39;s ability to make it (and store it for future use) when exposed to the sun; Iron from organic beets; Zinc from organic cashew nuts; potassium and magnesium from organic bananas; Omega 3 Fatty Acids (beneficial for the brain) from organic walnuts and pecans (looks like the brain and targets it). <br><br>Please avoid factory produced meat alternatives whose chief ingredient can be &#39;soy&#39; and may contain preservatives as well as additives (e.g Vinegar, a corrosive agent). Food toxicity and nutrient deficiency are a deadly combination as one is hindering the body&#39;s building materials needed to action healing whilst at the same time taxing the system with more toxic stuff, thus bringing about disease and possibly even an early death. <br><br>Please make sure to watch some good content on my YouTube Channel that i believe will be very helpful in transitioning into a healthy vegan successfully. <br><br>Please note: <br>[1] America is going to have a civil war due to food shortage not long from now.<br>[2] Climate Change will lead to Sun-day Laws. <br><br>Best wishes <br>\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T10:18:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oh no see you walking round like it\u2019s a funeral.", "comment_text": "EGGS ARE NOT VEGETARIAN", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T15:57:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doughnut_be_sad.123", "comment_text": "Hi sorry but does anyone have any tips for a new \ud83c\udf31 vegan I did research but I seem to be messing something up I am very ethically tied to being vegan but my family is concerned that my health may go down hill any tips are appreciated", "comment_date": "2021-12-16T18:48:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "defne", "comment_text": "for me being vegetarian isnt even hard bc of my morals, i see it the same as cannibalism ahahah<br>...<br>but going vegan- yeah thats hard", "comment_date": "2021-12-15T22:44:46Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Martin Martinez", "comment_text": "I love meat", "comment_date": "2021-12-09T19:22:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JboyXD", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANUoAdXfA60&amp;t=3m00s\">3:00</a> Erwin smith ?", "comment_date": "2021-12-09T06:11:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lazyhippie", "comment_text": "Vegetarian for 4 years now!

This is because they are exploited throughout their lives for their milk and then killed.<br><br>Given that cows only produce milk\u00a0only when they\u2019re pregnant, the process begins with forced artificial insemination of cows. Farmers insert their arms into the sexual orifice of cows and pump bull semen into them. This is a necessary step for milk production and occurs in small family farms all the way to factory farms.<br><br>Once the cow gives birth, two things may happen. If the baby is male, he\u2019s of no use for the farmers since he\u2019ll never produce milk. Therefore, the baby is either\u00a0killed at the farm, or sold to the veal industry for meat. If the baby is female, then she\u2019ll endure the same future as her mother, going through several cycles of emotional and physical abuse. In both cases, the calves get taken away soon after birth, and mother cows tend to cry for days after their baby is stolen.<br><br>After about two or three milking cycles, the cow\u2019s milk production rate becomes unprofitable, so the cow is killed. At this stage, the cow is usually six years old. The natural lifespan of a cow is around twenty years.<br><br>About eggs.<br><br>In the egg industry, only females are required since males cannot lay eggs. So at the hatcheries, male and female chicks are separated as they pass through a conveyor belt.<br><br>Males are considered useless so they are either killed at the hatchery (either by being macerated alive, drowned or suffocated) or thrown into the bin alive. Females are painfully de-beaked and sent off to farms, where they will lay a painful 300+ eggs per year due to genetic manipulation (as opposed to a wild chicken\u2019s 20 or so per year). This process happens on any farm, regardless of it being free-range, organic or whatever.<br><br>After hens stop producing eggs at a profitable rate, they are sent to slaughter, which involves being thrown into an electric bath to be stunned, then hoisted up upside down and going along a conveyor belt to have their throats slit. Many chickens will remain fully conscious after their throats are slit and will be boiled alive in the de-feathering tank afterwards. Their slaughter happens at around two years of age.

So, we thought we\u2019d try a thought experiment. What would happen if everyone in the world was suddenly a vegetarian? What effect would it have on our lives and the planet?<br><br>2 \u2013 Before we begin, full disclosure: none of us at ASAP Science are vegetarians and the worldwide rate of vegetarianism is fairly low, ranging from about 4 to 5 percent in the U.S. and Canada to a little over 30% in India. As a result, there are currently about 20 billion chickens, 1.5 billion cows, over a billion sheep and nearly a billion pigs in the world.<br><br>3 \u2013 Without any meat-eating humans to provide a market, whole herds of domestic animals would disappear. And this would free up vast quantities of land. About 33 million square kilometers of land are used for pasture; an area about the size of Africa. And that\u2019s not even counting the land used to grow crops exclusively for animal feed.<br><br>4 \u2013 Some of it would be needed for the increased amount of vegetable crops, but much of the land currently used for pasture is actually too dry to grow crops. Without humans adding artificial nutrients, this land could turn to desert. But if properly managed, it\u2019s possible that some farmland would return to its natural state of grassland or forest which could help counteract global climate change.<br><br>5 \u2013 After all, the loss of CO2 absorbing trees cleared for agriculture is a major reason why global levels of CO2 are going up. Cows and other grazers also affect our climate through large amounts of methane production which has 25 times more potential planet warming power than CO2. Combined with the loss of forests and other effects, livestock production is responsible for about 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions which is more than all the world\u2019s planes, trains and automobiles put together.<br><br>6 \u2013 In fact, many scientists believe that reducing meat consumption may be one of the best strategies for managing climate change. A vegetarian diet would also greatly reduce water consumption. Around 70% of global freshwater consumption is used in agriculture. It takes 15,000 litres to make a kilogram of beef, 6,000 litres for pork and 4,000 litres for chicken.<br><br>7 \u2013 Compare this with 1,600 litres for cereal crops, 900 litres for fruit and 300 litres for garden vegetables. Of course, a kilogram of meat packs many more calories than the equivalent weight of fruit but even if you compare the ratio of water per calorie of available food energy, beef is still 5 times more water intensive than fruit, 7 times more than veggies and 20 times more than cereal.<br><br>8 \u2013 So, are there any downsides to a vegetarian diet? Well, we\u2019d be left without a cheap source for many bi-products of livestock like leather from animal hides or animal fats which are used in cosmetics, candles and detergents. And while vegetable-based alternatives do exist, their production would need to increase, meaning more land dedicated to growing crops and less restored to its natural state.<br><br>9 \u2013 A more complicated fact is that raising and processing animals is a full-time job for more than 1 billion people, most of whom are small scale farmers in the developing world. Well, some may be able to move to producing milk or eggs, or even growing vegetable crops, many would be faced with their way of life becoming obsolete. Of course, any increase in vegetarianism is likely to be a gradual process rather than a sudden cut off.<br><br>10 \u2013 And surprisingly, the trends are actually in the opposite direction. In places like India and China, people are becoming wealthier and as a result, consuming more meat which effectively cancels out the declines we see in other countries. So, we actually tried to go vegetarian for 21 days straight as an experiment in our new ASAP Thought episode.<br><br>11 \u2013 Check out the video if you want to see how it went, what we learned in the process and how we felt about it both mentally and physically.

Smoking is around 20 on average and as high as 35, a massive order of magnitude in terms of statistical strength. In many studies even fruits and vegetables are sometimes over 1, so why is meat being singled out, it&#39;s ideological and not scientific. <br><br>10.

Companies like Amazon (They don&#39;t sell much meat) will buy most of the farmland leaving a lot of people homeless. Also, pill companies will be getting rich after so many undernourished people suddenly appearing.

i do not have a choice in this matter! my food consumption in mass is actually surprisingly low due to the high calory density in most animal derived food especially all the fat. as i eat eggs and milk products, the amount of meat is actually not that high, eigher. moreover, on my diet, i never pass winds because winds are caused by fermentation of plant food in the gut. another point you did not elaborate on is the fact that herds actually keep grasslands from desertification. so when you get rid of the herds, you turn the savanna into desert. herds are parts of nature. it is not helping the environment to get rid of them. also we would lose a huge amount of genes if we simply killed off all livestock and thus exgerminated all species of domestic animals. this would not help the planet, either. the solution is not turning the world vegetarian but turn towards more sustainable and more environmentally friendly ways and more animal and plantfriendly ways of food production , distribution and consumption. we have huge amountsof food thrown away daily unnecessarily. people buy more than they need, do not eat while fresh, throw away the leftovers instead of cooking responsibly and making any leftovers the next meal instead of throwing them away. only very few parts of animals and very few species of fish reach the market while most is destroyed or thrown away eg the bycatch when instead we could eat all of the animal and probably also all of the fish caught and thus vastly reduce the number of livestock and of fish being caught. also, restaurants and shops throw away large amounts of food because they do not produce to demand but vastly beyond it. producing only as much as needed and also making sure any leftovers from shops or restaurants are actually eaten by humans would hugely reduce the amounts of livestock needed. moreover, if we had proper education and medical examination regarding our individual optimal diets would enable all of us to find out what diets are best for our individual bodies. we would learn what and how much we can and cannot or should and should not eat. this would also save us from disappointments, from unnecessary obesity and from unhealthy eating.", "comment_date": "2019-04-01T13:36:23Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "awog", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a vegetarian and my family is too\ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T12:21:41Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Kelly Taylor", "comment_text": "GO VEGAN PEOPLE \ud83e\udd55\ud83e\udd6c", "comment_date": "2019-03-28T01:09:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "13", "comment_text": "We are not made to eat green <br>I usually slaughter the animal by myself at local farmers in that way the meat tastes better and use my full human nature", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T04:12:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sophocles", "comment_text": "So far in my life, I have been an omnivore, but the thought of animals being slaughtered makes me EXTREMELY sad.

Discovering that pigs are more intelligent than dogs really made me start to see more clearly. I saw pigs in cages so small they couldn&#39;t even turn around, and piglets getting castrated without any anesthetics. And I could see the fear in their eyes and hear their screams. I saw the same fear in cows as well. I imagined for a moment, what if that was my dog in there with a thousand others just like him.

So, we thought we\u2019d try a thought experiment. What would happen if everyone in the world was suddenly a vegetarian? What effect would it have on our lives and the planet?<br><br>2 \u2013\u00a0Before we begin, full disclosure: none of us at ASAP Science are vegetarians and the worldwide rate of vegetarianism is fairly low, ranging from about 4 to 5 percent in the U.S. and Canada to a little over 30% in India. As a result, there are currently about 20 billion chickens, 1.5 billion cows, over a billion sheep and nearly a billion pigs in the world.<br><br>3 \u2013\u00a0Without any meat-eating humans to provide a market, whole herds of domestic animals would disappear. And this would free up vast quantities of land. About 33 million square kilometers of land are used for pasture; an area about the size of Africa. And that\u2019s not even counting the land used to grow crops exclusively for animal feed.<br><br>4 \u2013\u00a0Some of it would be needed for the increased amount of vegetable crops, but much of the land currently used for pasture is actually too dry to grow crops. Without humans adding artificial nutrients, this land could turn to desert. But if properly managed, it\u2019s possible that some farmland would return to its natural state of grassland or forest which could help counteract global climate change.<br><br>5 \u2013\u00a0After all, the loss of CO2 absorbing trees cleared for agriculture is a major reason why global levels of CO2 are going up. Cows and other grazers also affect our climate through large amounts of methane production which has 25 times more potential planet warming power than CO2. Combined with the loss of forests and other effects, livestock production is responsible for about 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions which is more than all the world\u2019s planes, trains and automobiles put together.<br><br>6 \u2013\u00a0In fact, many scientists believe that reducing meat consumption may be one of the best strategies for managing climate change. A vegetarian diet would also greatly reduce water consumption. Around 70% of global freshwater consumption is used in agriculture. It takes 15,000 litres to make a kilogram of beef, 6,000 litres for pork and 4,000 litres for chicken.<br><br>7 \u2013\u00a0Compare this with 1,600 litres for cereal crops, 900 litres for fruit and 300 litres for garden vegetables. Of course, a kilogram of meat packs many more calories than the equivalent weight of fruit but even if you compare the ratio of water per calorie of available food energy, beef is still 5 times more water intensive than fruit, 7 times more than veggies and 20 times more than cereal.<br><br>8 \u2013\u00a0So, are there any downsides to a vegetarian diet? Well, we\u2019d be left without a cheap source for many bi-products of livestock like leather from animal hides or animal fats which are used in cosmetics, candles and detergents. And while vegetable-based alternatives do exist, their production would need to increase, meaning more land dedicated to growing crops and less restored to its natural state.<br><br>9 \u2013\u00a0A more complicated fact is that raising and processing animals is a full-time job for more than 1 billion people, most of whom are small scale farmers in the developing world. Well, some may be able to move to producing milk or eggs, or even growing vegetable crops, many would be faced with their way of life becoming obsolete. Of course, any increase in vegetarianism is likely to be a gradual process rather than a sudden cut off.<br><br>10 \u2013\u00a0And surprisingly, the trends are actually in the opposite direction. In places like India and China, people are becoming wealthier and as a result, consuming more meat which effectively cancels out the declines we see in other countries. So, we actually tried to go vegetarian for 21 days straight as an experiment in our new ASAP Thought episode.<br><br>11 \u2013\u00a0Check out the video if you want to see how it went, what we learned in the process and how we felt about it both mentally and physically.

If there wasn&#39;t any livestock to feed, those crops could be used both to feed humans AND for the use of replacing animal byproducts for comfort items. Go on and git yourself that fancy candle! <br>3. If people are making a living raising and selling livestock but no one is eating animals, they won&#39;t make any money. The demand would be for crops, right? So... get on with the growing of crops for plant-based alternatives to animal byproducts as well as food. Boom. More crops and people provide supply for the demand. And if progress to a more environmentally friendly, animal friendly, health friendly way of life is impeded because it may make a person&#39;s way of life obsolete, I guess we should go ahead with increasing the use of coal and oil for power and while we&#39;re at it, we should bring back gladiators and public beheadings. Guillotine-smiths didn&#39;t deserve to get phased out by society so harshly, amirite?<br>4. With wealth comes more meat consumption? It&#39;s interesting that those populations are also seeing a rise in health problems. But... not the point, really. I&#39;m also not at all sure where you were calling this out as a downside? Are you saying because the trend isn&#39;t going toward vegetarianism we scrap it? If we look at North America and its meat consumption, we see a big trend right down the crapper with health, environment, and human labor conditions. Real neat trend to flow with there. <br><br>Also, vegetarian isn&#39;t enough.

So unless we all can quit our day jobs to spend every day getting proper nutrition by eating 20-40 kilos of veggies, you should consider small amounts of meat....and encourage any fat fucks you know that maybe they should tone down their food consumption as well...because i sure as hell dont eat a whole animal every fricken day.", "comment_date": "2018-12-25T03:08:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The weird side of YouTube Hi", "comment_text": "I only eat chicken  and fish", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T20:11:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rohit Srinivasan", "comment_text": "Vegetarian &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vegan<br>(Not that i have anything against vegans)<br>Can&#39;t imagine a life without Pizza or cheese in general", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T16:36:57Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "catherine", "comment_text": "laughs in vegan", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T13:40:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NO WiFi", "comment_text": "We always seem to eat a lot of meat in my family...I crave for some salads sometimes", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T05:11:35Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "ChickenScratch", "comment_text": "I feel so out of place as an omnivore in the comment section", "comment_date": "2018-12-22T15:59:31Z", "likes_count": 61}, {"comment_by": "Mercedes Benz", "comment_text": "We are Vegetarians/vegans the most peaceful people on earth, friends with animals, have nice body measurements, pure from inside and outside, we contribute minimum to the pollution and we are committed to save mother earth, We have sympathy for others, Doing good karma.....\u2764\u2764\ud83d\ude18\ud83c\udf4f\ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\ude4f<br>.<br>Vegetarians/vegans hit like....", "comment_date": "2018-12-21T22:24:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mercedes Benz", "comment_text": "I am a vegetarian from India.

People can afford that now only because of refrigeration exists.I think meat should be in like only the special(s) meals. Also what I hate is the way we treat animals now. Farmers now use cruel &quot;techniques&quot; to make meat tender or better tasting, because an old cow is just not enough anymore. When my father was young, they only ate chickens or cows when they were really old and about to die. Okay the meat was not as tender as now but at least it was not veals they kept in a small box so they can hardly move  and feed them only with milk wich is really bad for them, or to stuff ducks untill they vomit to make their liver fatter. The big problem now is in the mentality I think. People don&#39;t know anymore that meat is a dead animal. They just don&#39;t know how it feels like to kill an animal to eat.

I am also well aware of the ecological benefits that veganism/vegetarianism brings to the table, and I do agree that a change has to be made. So some of you may find it funny that I am planning to stick to being an omnivore for as long as I live. Why?<br>Well I find that the main issue isn&#39;t with eating meat in general, it is rather with the meat industry. The way factory farming is being carried out is inhumane, due to the cramped conditions and the way that animals are being injected with growth hormones and antibiotics, as well as the artificial insemination needed to keep with demand. Of course, the video mentions contributions to climate change as well, so we definitely need to change how meat is being farmed.<br>However, telling the whole world to go vegan is not a good solution, because more problems are going to arise, some of which this video has not really mentioned. For instance approximately a third of the Earth&#39;s land is very arid and is only suitable for animal agriculture, such as in the Sahel, the Outback and the Arctic circle, so people have no choice but to eat meat to survive. Also are you sure that vegan/vegetarian life-styles are healthier? The problem is that too many people are ignorant about dieting and as a result the vast majority of meat eaters eat too much, which is what drives the results of these health studies. So if they all went vegan, they may not get enough sources of Vitamin B12, Iron and Protein due to their lack in planning what to eat. A study conducted by the University of Vienna in fact stated that meat-eaters are less likely to get cancer and heart disease than vegetarians, but that is a different result to what the WHO said. Accumulation of fatal diseases such as cancer are due to a variety of factors, such as genetics, environmental, and even stress, mood, sleep patterns, lifestyle etc. So veganism/vegetarianism does not guarantee a healthier life.<br>What we really need to do is encourage meat-eaters to reduce meat consumption, bit by bit, and then we should all unite and protest against how the meat industry treats the animals. That way the demand for meat will drop, and we will slowly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, so eventually much of the land previously used for grazing will be used for crops that humans will be able to include in their diet. Be a meat eater, vegan or vegetarian if you want, but make a change in a smart and calculating way, aiming for the best of both worlds. Us humans may become completely vegan at some point, but I&#39;ll probably be dead by then (I&#39;m in my early twenties).", "comment_date": "2017-06-05T20:50:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hadil Hallo", "comment_text": "I think it&#39;s just funny how people defend their opinion to eat meat because apparently everyone can do what they want(&quot; if you do want to eat meat then do so. if you decide not to then don&#39;t &quot;)and it&#39;s their own decision but suddenly everyone forgets that it&#39;s our responsibility to take care of the Earth and just because something is Legal doesn&#39;t mean its  right. if I decided to kill my dog on the street would you just watch beacause it&#39;s my own decision?

The transition was not easy at first, but eventually, my tastebuds and everything changed! There could honestly be so many great changes we could make to this earth if we stopped large scale production of meat and dairy and if we designed technology aiming for sustainable farming (ex. Sky gardens). Personally, I don&#39;t like to consume other animals, but if it ever came to a point where most of the population was vegetarian and people still wanted to consume meat and dairy, raising your own livestock could become an option. Obviously for people living in cities that would be difficult, but at the end of the day, large scale production is only destroying the Earth. I feel like people need to see what goes into their food and how it is made. With new innovations in farming, we could change how we think about food and take control of what we consume and how we treat the only Earth we have. At this rate, we may not have this Earth for much longer. Not to mention, our health issues stem from the government and companies that can basically put whatever they want into our food and find loopholes in order to distribute it. In no way would we be able to make these changes over night, but I feel like an important step is to change the way we think about our groceries and how we use our land.

The breeds of those animals that were used for meat production would become extinct, but other than that, the (only) main livestock that we wouldn&#39;t farm anymore would be pigs. Imagine what increasing dairy and egg production actually means though... more chickens in cages and sheds, more bobby calves (that will go to waste), more feedlot dairies. Feeding grain to livestock, especially poultry, wouldn&#39;t change. Cropping and horticulture will increase, and along with it pesticide, fertilizer, and fossil fuel use.

Now let me get into the negative effects of going vegan. Because we aren&#39;t killing animals for food those animals would grow in population. More vegetables being eaten. And if we all go Vegan that&#39;s a lot of people who also need fruits and Vegetables. The plant population will go down and the those animals will go up. Then the animals who eat the animals we used to eat will also go up. Then there will be a problem with famine. Farm land will be over worked to get enough food for everyone and animals will eat the ground dry. More people and animals will starve. The predators will be eating the animals until they get too little and they start to starve. And there is a chance of lots of extinctions. Eating meat helps control population and keep an equilibrium on the earth. The problem isn&#39;t the fact that we are eating meat. It&#39;s the fact that we are eating too much meat.

Like you correctly mentioned, over a billion people are financially dependent on the animal husbandry industry, a large portion of which is dedicated to raising animals for the purpose of meat. If there is a ban on meat consumption (hypothetically speaking, of course), these people won&#39;t abandon the land they own, but rather use it to find an alternative means of livelihood. A lot of this land would be available for cheap, since agriculture and animal husbandry dominantly happens in regions like suburbs or villages (more so in countries that dominate these sectors - India, Indonesia and China, for example). Some of this free land would be inevitably bought up by industrialists who might use it as factories. Also, we would need to dedicate a lot more land to systematic agriculture to make sure that the world&#39;s growing population is continuously fed.  This would need infrastructure (mainly in terms of water and electricity that drives the water), which a lot of agricultural countries lack in. This would lead to food shortages of a scale we are not used to in this century with a billion more people entering the malnourished list in these countries, and we would witness food prices hit the roof in most countries that do not produce the goods. A lot of people living in cold regions across the world which are dependent mostly on trade for their food would perhaps verge on starvation. This is a quality video, but in my humble opinion, you should have accounted for the economic ramifications of such a move. We were hunters before we were gatherers and farmers, so we are not only genetically conditioned to eat meat (not saying we can&#39;t be vegetarians and survive), and our economy depends on us eating animals. Agree on the point that we would save a lot of fresh water, but we won&#39;t likely have use for that water if our population starves.

So who is what is still in the air tonight. To try to explain: My understanding is that some Hindus can eat the root of the plant without being seen as someone who will destroy the soul of a living being. Other Hindus and Hindu-like religions (Sikhism and Jainism) can only eat the leafs, fruit, and legumes to remain ethical (in their view). One group destroys the center of life which cannot be replaced beyond reincarnation.<br><br>Second, some people need more than vegetarianism can give them.

First off humans are omnivorous which means we can eat both plants and meat; you aren&#39;t necessarily a bad person because you eat one or the other. Another thing technically a balanced human diet should consist of an equal ratio of both so the whole vegan vs meat eating thing shouldn&#39;t even be a thing people fight over. No other animal on the planet fights over this shit why do we? We&#39;re smarter creatures right? So why do have to make every little irrelevant thing into some massive shit storm? Also to vegans it doesn&#39;t matter what you eat plant or farm animal guess what something still dies in the process. Plants are living organisms it doesn&#39;t matter if they don&#39;t have pain receptors they still die when you digest them like any other animal. Only form of life o this planet that doesn&#39;t need to kill to eat are plants because of photosynthesis and guess what even some plants still hunt for nourishment like pitcher plants and Venus fly traps. So let&#39;s stop with that silly argument okay i&#39;m an animal lover i love nature but that doesn&#39;t mean i have to stop eating meat to enjoy it. Things live and die that&#39;s nature if every single animal on the planet ate nothing but plants guess what? That would have a hugely negative affect on all plant ecosystems; there would be no balance land animal numbers would sky rocket but the level of evolution would drastically decrease over the course of many years. If everything is eating plants then what&#39;s the point changing a lot if your food is right there and there&#39;s no danger, no reason to change. Do you know how boring animals would be in a world like that they&#39;d all look pretty much identical; only things that could even remotely change animals in a world like that would be weather and living conditions that&#39;s it. That&#39;s not even counting how much that make plant life decrease you know there&#39;s a reason why niches are a major thing in nature everything has it&#39;s place in the food chain. Eating meat actually helps wild life it helps to keep the ecosystem balanced and healthy. Anyway that&#39;s my long rant done this was just my view on this whole whether or not to go vegan thing.

Here&#39;s the thing, if everyone would stop eating meat then the animals would become an issue. We&#39;d need to kill them in order to take care of population otherwise the population will get too high, not enough food for them and they&#39;d start eating each other. Most farm animals such as cows, pigs, etc will eat each other when food supply is low. Most animals will. They are mostly hunters and if they were raised in a situation where they are given food, and suddenly they aren&#39;t kept up, then there&#39;s a problem. You can&#39;t simply just realse them into the wild and expect them to control their own population. So, we would need to kill their population off completely or kill to keep the population stable. Which means we are wasting them. Which would go against most vegans/vegetarians morals. <br><br>The other, if you are truly vegan then you wont drink milk, eggs (eggs isn&#39;t meat but it&#39;s a by-product,), candy, or refuse over the counter/prescription medicine. Honey is a by-product but bees whole existence is to create it. But as a vegan you can&#39;t have any by-products, even use Wool or real leather. Most candy shells like Skittles for example uses Beetles and other insects for dyes, the FDA allows a small amount of insect product into foods because they are pretty harmless to consume. You could go outside and probably eat most species of Beetle and probably be fine. Things like pain medications use pig stomach lining, jelly have small amounts of bone marrow (non-organic jelly of course), most common medications use animal fat and other organs, stomach lining is the most common. Etc. I&#39;m aware they make organic medicines, but that&#39;s not my point. <br><br>Going vegetarian can be healthier, for some. But not for all people. I&#39;m on tons of supplements especially being a cancer patient, my diet is pretty strict. I am lactose intolerant so I can&#39;t drink milk or have any dairy, which means I&#39;ve to take a Vitamin D and other supplements daily. If you get those gummy vitamins, they use Beetles too. And Fish Oil supplements, pretty obvious there. <br><br>You can live perfectly fine without any meat, for most people if their body can handle it, some people need that protein first hand instead. But the thing is, you can stop eating meat, everyone could stop, but you wont get away from animal byproducts. They need animal for loads of common things that are most likely in your flat at this very moment. This is how it works, these animals have given us many benefits and not just for food. If you think turning vegetarian will get rid of the cruel animal abuse in the industries, it wont, they will still be used for something whether you&#39;ll eat them or not, but instead turned into a waste. An animal being made for food is actually used very good. They will get all the good bits and use for food then send the less desirable bits to medicine industries and of course, skin them for other areas. The animal isn&#39;t being wasted. I agree, the industries can be cruel, but don;t put them all into a bag all together.  I know local farmers, who are very passionate of what they do. They love their animals and try their best to make it less inhumane and do it themselves and then send all the bits to the proper places. <br><br>But I digress cause this is a shit long paragraph rant thing. I&#39;m not judging anyone for their choices, just trying to show a bit of light. I don&#39;t want to argue, afterall I am vegetarian myself, but I just don&#39;t find someone eating meat as the greatest sin a person could do. If you want to eat meat, go for it man, you eat whatever you wanna put in your body. It&#39;s your body, do what you want. If you do want to go vegan/vegetarian, you go for it but be safe, be aware, and please research before you do it. Don&#39;t use YouTube as a reliable source, just research heavily and make sure you are doing it for YOU. No one else can tell you what to eat or what to not eat, what to not do with your own body that you have control of for your own good. We all have our morals, we all have our views, we all decide for what we do in our valuable lives. So you make that choice, for yourself and only for you. Do not feel the need that you need to do something because it&#39;s a trend or because someone else said it&#39;s the best choice. You are your own creator, do everything based on your own views and morals. <br><br>Sorry that this shit was long.

If then world went vegetarian, the earth may have much less life than today. <br>1. the farm free up can&#39;t be totally used to grow vegetable. Growing vegetable is not the same as growing grass. What is the calories different form the production between meat and vegetable? <br><br>2. Balance of nutrition. Many people argue that vegetable can give you enough nutrition as meat does. Are you kidding me? Do you all want to eat soy bean for protein? How about people allergic to it? More important, we are talking the whole word. Can you produce enough for everyone to have a balance nutrition? Many of the plants can&#39;t be grown around the world. How many nut tree do we need? More mean more lands we need to take form animals too. Most animal will die from that. <br><br>3. Price? When we need a balance nutrition. Look at the nuts price today. how many people are eating them as main protein or vitamin intake? When the whole world goes for them, price will be at least 10 times as today. The rich will not have problem, but the poors  will suffer. They should have shorter life as today. Look back to the last few hundred year, most people can&#39;t eat meat because of poor, what are their avg age? <br><br>4. How many more poison do we need to put on the plant if we all became vegetarian? what will happen to the insects? then the animals live by eating those insects? <br><br>We all too focus on the CO2 these days. People promote vegetarian too much these days too? Because many people have enough calories from our meat and eat less vegetable, therefore, it seems good for the body to take more vegetable. It is to make the balance, not to go for the extreme? either all meat or all vegetable are extreme. Some people can do it especially those rich people. They have enough money to buy whatever food and have money to hire people to take care of the balance of nutrition intake? It may work for those care so much about what the balance of nutrition and willing to work on it. However, most people won&#39;t be able to do the above, so, it will end up many people have lack of some kind of nutrition. <br><br>a small potion of people went extreme will not be a big deal.

Almost everything claimed in this video isn&#39;t true. It&#39;s not a &quot;save the Earth&quot; scenario, it&#39;s a damned doomsday scenario.<br>I don&#39;t even know where to begin. First of all, to feed all of humanity with crops, it&#39;d take more land than Earth has. Since we&#39;re far less efficient at extracting nutrients from crops than, say, cattle are. So the land that used to be used for livestock, that is farmable, assuming we let them all die, would have to be used for crops. But it can&#39;t feed the entire Earth&#39;s population. Perhaps not even a third of it so we&#39;d have to let most of the world starve to death. All that farming would cause more damage to the environment than current livestock grazing. Global warming is pure nonsense, but everything we need to do to make that amount of farming work would wreck havoc on our rivers and oceans. It&#39;d require far more freshwater than we currently use. We&#39;d have to drain most aquifers and some rivers and lakes. Many aquatic species would go extinct. All the agricultural runoff would kill off many marine species too. If we didn&#39;t let all the livestock die, they&#39;d devastate other ecosystems. <br>And for the cherry on top, humans can&#39;t survive on a vegetarian diet no matter what propaganda we&#39;re being spewed. There are certain proteins and other essential nutrients that your body needs that can only come from other animals because we&#39;re omnivores. Or bodies can&#39;t create them and plants do not make them either since they are not animals and don&#39;t have the same &quot;bodies&quot; we do and don&#39;t need them. Other animals with heavier or exclusive plant diets create them through various biological processes from different parts of plants. We do not have these processes ourselves. No carnivore does and most omnivores don&#39;t because evolutionary speaking it&#39;s more efficient for the body to lack these processes because it requires complex digestive systems that can have a lot go wrong with them that also shortens lifespan, limiting the amount of gene spreading that can be done so evolution selects against it.<br>The whole &quot;healthier as a vegetarian&quot; thing is pure nonsense. Usually, people on a vegetarian diet feel better because they cut out processed foods, and NOT because that they cut out meat. But their body cannot survive without those nutrients that are from meat only. And you can&#39;t &quot;supplement&quot; them because those supplements would have to come from meat, therefore livestock, anyway. Without that, your body has to literally eat itself to survive. Which will quickly kill the very young. So within two years everyone under the age of two will be dead. Within ten years, everyone that was under the age of ten. In twenty years everyone that was under the age of thirty and within thirty years every human on the planet would be dead. <br>Congratulations, to fulfill the wishes of your vegetarianism cult you brought humanity to extinction and left behind a devastated planet that would take millennia to recover.

I was a cooked food<br>person, vegetarian, vegan and today, as a fresh food person, I don&#39;t eat any<br>animal meat that is dead of: cows, chickens, roosters, pigs, fish, shrimp,<br>crab, lobster, oyster, deer, lamb, turkey, bee honey, or eggs. I also don&#39;t<br>drink or eat: any milk, or milk products: of cheese, butter, sour cream,<br>cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, chocolate, etc. Also, I don\u2019t wear any<br>animal cow clothes leather or suede: pants, vests, coats, belts, shoes, boots,<br>work belts, wallets, purses, jewelry, cars, motorcycles, sofas, chairs, or<br>other items. \u00a0I use vinyl shoes, vinyl<br>wallet, fabric purses, and vinyl belts. The cows like the vinyl shoes, because<br>they are not leather. I think that vinyl shoes are the best for us. <br><br>\u00a0<br><br>I don&#39;t use pictures of animals on clothes, or signs for business: camels,<br>panda bears, cows or other animals. I don&#39;t use animal fabric prints of zebras,<br>cheetahs, or tigers. I don&#39;t wear furs, fake furs, or feather products of<br>pillows, comforters and coats. I threw away any leather and feather that I had.<br>I wear cotton and linen clothes and coats.\u00a0<br>I buy and wear simple and modest new fabric clothes, vinyl shoes, and<br>new fabric furniture, and fabric cars. I like plastic dressers and doors. I<br>don\u2019t use stuffed animals. Could I save me from that? Could I save a cow,<br>chicken, pig, or fish, and eat fruit, vegetables, nuts? <br><br>\u00a0<br><br>I was thinking that this information may save my life, make my life better,<br>more earth and farm friendly. And it may save a life of an animal. I stopped<br>eating animals, then I ate some cooked foods, that had no meat, cheese, eggs, sour<br>cream, or dairy products in it. Today, I eat farm fresh fruits, vegetables,<br>nuts, seeds, bean sprouts, wheat, and water. This is best. I don&#39;t use ovens,<br>stoves, microwaves, pots, food processors, can openers, toasters, blenders, or<br>juicers.

Tattoo removal and piercing removal, I don&#39;t use coffee,<br>alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, or medications. A few times, I ate animal\u2019s meat, I<br>drank animal\u2019s milk, and I wore animal\u2019s leather, and then I stopped doing<br>that. I don\u2019t have animals in the refrigerator or freezer. I stopped using the<br>refrigerator, and I use the counters for my food, like on a farm, or use a food<br>shelf, or food cabinet. The refrigeration is hot in the outlet, and cold for<br>the food. I stopped doing that, and I began to eat fruit, vegetables, nuts,<br>only and fresh. Refrigeration, ovens, and microwaves arot e fresh. On the<br>counter is fresh and out of the refrigerators.

I like tomatoes and spinach for vegetables, bean sprouts, and<br>sunflower sprouts, almonds, walnuts, and cashews for nuts, is the best, and<br>awesome, to eat all fresh foods of the farms. I planted a small farm and have<br>fruit trees in the yard. I like the mountains. I like to save the trees for<br>fruit only. I like to go for walks in Nature.

So I believe that there&#39;s nothing wrong with a vegan, vegetarian diet at all whatever. However, unlike this odd bias towards a positive outcome from an earth of vegetarians it simply isn&#39;t that simple. This video failed to go in enough depth about the downsides. Even though pastures take up a lot of space meat also gives us more nutrients rather cheaply than plants and would subsequently require more land to grow, and as stated we simply don&#39;t have all that much soil that could sustain whatever crop we want wherever we have the space. It may help solve somewhat climate change but problems would still exist, habitat destruction exasperated by the need of more crop and the death of many animals bred for meat as their bodies have changed dramatically to the point of complete dependence. The pain these meat-bred animals would go through would far surpass the meagre slaughter of them, as that at least ends their suffering with relative speed. As I digress, meat eating isn&#39;t wrong, morally, or in terms of diet. Our bodies are built for a diverse diet and the act of cooking meat helped us early humans learn and feed more of their tribe. Killing animals have also been a base of our evolution, we must all realize and accept the fact that we are animals too, and death is a necessary evil. Death keeps animals evolving, and helps us as humans appreciate life more. However, the way we go about eating these animals need to change, it&#39;s unhealthy for everyone, and it&#39;s all to difficult to honour these poor souls. And yes, even if they were treated better we&#39;re still killing them, but they probably would be killed anyway, these animals are pretty low on the food chain. To conclude this, no diet is objectively all that much better than another. Not everyone can support these plant diets especially on a financial level or even physically due to anaemia and iron isn&#39;t easy to come across without meat. Not everyone should conform to a single diet and nobody should push these lifestyles on anyone. Tl;Dr, an all vegetarian world won&#39;t solve all our problems, this video could go into more detail, and a variety of diets is beneficial to everyone, financially, physically, and even globally.", "comment_date": "2016-04-09T20:33:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Batuffolossa Micia", "comment_text": "Ci sono 1 bilion di mucche, polli , maiali perch\u00e9 li sfruttiamo come oggetti e li facciamo accoppiare noi in continuazione questo video \u00e8 una barzelletta :)", "comment_date": "2016-04-09T15:25:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daisy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANUoAdXfA60&amp;t=3m09s\">3:09</a> looks like the intro from Desperate Housewives", "comment_date": "2016-04-09T14:14:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julika7", "comment_text": "You forgot the health benefits.", "comment_date": "2016-04-09T10:39:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mustafa", "comment_text": "But how does this save space ? wont the animals getting freed from butchers farms etc will need that space actually more space then the factorys take since they are not packed up they gonna need alot more space and produce a lot more gasses", "comment_date": "2016-04-09T08:52:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bis", "comment_text": "What if we became pescetarians?", "comment_date": "2016-04-09T06:48:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Janina Aleks", "comment_text": "Love this video but I wish the title said VEGAN diet.", "comment_date": "2016-04-09T03:50:21Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Cosmicter", "comment_text": "I am proud to say that I am part of that small percentage and I&#39;ve been a vegetarian my whole life without eating any meat.", "comment_date": "2016-04-09T03:49:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vispev", "comment_text": "is Greg or Mitch talking?

Now, we all know that vegetarians make up the 3 class of the food web, only previously followed by producers (grass, trees, shrubs etc.) and the sun. As with all animals, top consumers, or omnivores in particular, disable one species from getting an advantage over another; except Humans.

It may not seem natural, but neither is taking iron tablets to avoid iron deficiency. On top of this, we also help manage our bio systems.

This is because being the world being vegetarian would still mean that we would be consuming dairy products. Why does this make a difference? About 85% of meat producing farms are also dairy farms. how is this? In case you didn&#39;t know, cows are manually impregnated for dairy, and aren&#39;t actually killed for meat until they are too old/weak to be used for milk anymore. This being said, if we all went vegetarian, the amount of  cows that we raise an consume would be the same- we just wouldn&#39;t slaughter them for meat  in the end. So, as this could be a more moral decision for some, but if we&#39;re talking about creating less greenhouse gasses, and preserving land that was once farmed land, it wouldn&#39;t happen, because we would still  have to maintain these farms. If we all went vegan however, this video is completely accurate, and we would be doing the world and the animals a well earned justice. I apologize for the rant, but I think that it&#39;s important that we understand the difference in the two diets and their effects on our planet!

There is nothing wrong with trying to be healthier. <br>Does this mean that some people simply cannot handle the lifestyle? Of course. Because some people cannot handle eating the proper amount and are than basically not getting enough nutrients to sustain themselves. But even going from eating meat 2-3 times a day everyday down to maybe once a day everyday or even to just a few times a week is much better. People need to open their minds to new possibilities.

Have you ever seen a lawn that goes un-mowed and unkept? Weeds and other invasive plants move in and choke out the grass because grass by nature is made to be grazed. Its a symbolic relationship between grazers and the grass. So there are no more buffalo roaming the prairies, right? Farmers and ranchers now use livestock to manage and keep the grass healthy. Its sustainable beef that makes the difference. Being a steward to the land.

The process was slow over the period of a year. I began cutting out certain meats, like pork, then beef, then chicken, then fish. Many of these were replaced with vegetarian meat substitutes, which can be very tasty if you get the right products. I am dairy intolerant, so it was not too difficult to cut dairy down gradually until I consumed no dairy. Eggs were the only thing left, so I cut those out last. Becoming vegetarian or vegan should not be treated like some special diet you go on and suffer while you crave animal products. The appropriate way IMHO, is to completely change on the inside so that those cravings no longer exist. For me, this was a very personal internal decision that came as a result of many influences. These influences include watching animal farm documentaries, researching the science about whether the human body is geared for carnivore/omnivore/herbivore, etc. The biggest factor for me was a spiritual awakening as I like to call it. I only share why I am vegan because all of my friends and family think I am crazy and don&#39;t understand.

On top of that most of the methane produced is because we feed the cow corn, instead of their natural grass which their gut microbes aren&#39;t very good at breaking down.    Less meat, grass fed meat and more sustainable meat is what we must have in the future whether everyone switches to vegetarian or not.  Insects and vat grown meat are also areas that may seem wrong a gross but will probably replace bad polluting animal farming practices as the true price of animal farming and demand goes up.", "comment_date": "2016-03-25T11:38:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sanjeev Dusija", "comment_text": "The water that is saved by growing more vegateales can be used to make the land -initially used for grazing -more fertile.", "comment_date": "2016-03-25T11:35:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Rx", "comment_text": "They can&#39;t go full vegetarian since they eat each other&#39;s &quot;meat&quot;  ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "comment_date": "2016-03-25T11:34:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter S.", "comment_text": "I eat hardly any meat but I am not a vegetarian.

The growth of livestock is still technically carbon neutral if you disregard land clearing, too. In fact; sustainable grazing using holistic land management makes livestocking a carbon sink and improves soil quality. <br><br>In order to claim that vegetarianism would be an improvement, you would first have to confirm that comparable density of kilojoules can be produced per square metre of land, corrected for the quality of land (crops only grow in high quality land), the existing biodiversity of arable land (most new land suitable for crops is currently forest), the amount and availability of water in use (evaporative losses are much lower for livestock... and livestock can be successfully raised in remote areas like savanna and tundra without much water), the fallibility of crops compared with livestock (crops tend to be much less reliable); the year-round production of food (kilojoule production density is much lower over winter), and the availability of necessary nutrient like vitamins B, bioavailable iron, the full range of bioavailable amino acids, sufficient HDLs and saturated fats.

Minus an efficiency conversion factor.  You can take all your vegetarian dream crops and throw them away because they are calorie deficient, all the classic salad vegetables go right out the window, and you are left with grains etc the very things we grow now that we don&#39;t want to eat because they taste awful and yet cows will eat them, and we like to eat cows.  So once you do the analysis you realize, ultimately, livestock are flavor conversion machines, which take high calorie yield crops which are not tasty and convert them (with losses) into tasty food.  If you want to live in a vegetarian world, yes it&#39;s FAR more efficient for the planet and it&#39;s people, but your dreams of delicious salad are a myth and you will be required to eat a lot of calorie dense crops which aren&#39;t all that interesting.  Most vegetarians are just so clueless that they believe that the world can survive off of endless square km of crops of cucumbers, tomatoes and salad greens, when in fact that ends up killing the entire population of the planet in short order.

Our wet climate makes it so that if a crop is grown in wet soil or clay soil then the seed may drown. (Seeds need 3 things for germination: oxygen, heat and water. You need a balance of all of them). Places like Connacht in the west of Ireland or the Mezzogiorno in Italy don&#39;t grow any crops as the soil is too shallow or other reasons that I won&#39;t go into. If everyone in the world went vegetarian, Connachts main industries of beef, sheep and fish would become redundant and cause even greater unemployment. This would happen all over the world.

I think that&#39;s going to be the key to getting people to eat less meat; as alternatives get better, cheaper, and more widely available, meat consumption will go down naturally.", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T21:49:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "oldmanLogan", "comment_text": "What about eating insects? :)", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T21:49:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "First Name Last Name", "comment_text": "I am a vegan :3", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T21:49:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Denson Camp", "comment_text": "Ron Swanson would see this as blasphemy", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T21:49:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johanna L Romero", "comment_text": "Droughts!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T21:49:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liz Simon", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve been vegetarian for a year and a half now and it&#39;s the best decision I&#39;ve ever made", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T21:49:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DA POW3R", "comment_text": "\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf56\ud83c\udf56better than vegetables", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T21:49:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "RainbowTea", "comment_text": "A really awesome and informative video.<br><br>The comments though in this video are really ignorant.", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T21:49:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evan", "comment_text": "More bacon for me then", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T21:48:44Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "StarGirl XO", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sooo bad for eating meat!!!", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T21:48:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "batman88891", "comment_text": "How come people that become vegans/vegetarians because they want to save animals only care about livestock, and not rodents that are killed daily to keep plantlife alive?

She was like a puppy. <br><br>First off animal farming is not the enemy. Big industrial farming is. Small farms tend to take much better care of their animals and for the most part the small farm animals live better lives than wild ones. They are vaccinated and dewormed, kept at healthy weights, and humane laws are in place to protect them. And surely the way the animals are slaughtered are better than wolves or tigers etc. ripping into them and eating them while they&#39;re still alive. And let me remind you that in the wild female animals also have babies every year. As long as they&#39;re in heat and a male&#39;s around they&#39;re going to get pregnant. <br><br>Now there is room for improvements but same could be said for how we treat other people and with recycling etc. too. <br><br>Second, meat is a good and fast way to get protein. Sure you can get it from other sources but if you&#39;ve got a fussy kid or adult they&#39;re going to end up popping pills to get what they&#39;re missing in their diet and I know vegetarians that have to do that anyway. It is harder to balance your diet this way and to me popping pills isn&#39;t any healthier than just eating a natural balanced diet and watching how much you eat. <br><br>Third - For plants we need fertilizer and that often comes from our farm animals. Also, many crops are still showered with poison to kill off the bugs feeding on them so how healthy is it really when this poison washes into rivers and ends up in our food? Crop land often still isn&#39;t well taken care of and can become so overused they cannot grow much on it anymore. <br><br>Fourth - We&#39;d still need a lot of land for crop growth. Also, as the human population grows we&#39;re just going to take over our new found space anyway. <br><br>Fifth - Where&#39;d the now useless meat animals go? We&#39;d have to slaughter them all or let them use of the land they&#39;re on until they die which wastes money and would mean more methane poops. Farmers would lose jobs, yes. Vets and states people would also lose jobs. Animals used for eggs and milk eventually can&#39;t produce anymore - what do farmers do with them after? They can&#39;t afford to keep animals that don&#39;t produce. Not to mention all the products made from animals - especially MEDICINE! So no, we can&#39;t just get rid of all the farm animals. <br><br>Sixth, nobody ever think about how much animals are out in nature? We don&#39;t count how much methane they&#39;re giving off, do we? Just because they&#39;re wild. Humans are the factor causing the issues with farm animals. BTW, many farms are starting to recycle methane - meaning they feed their animals with their crops and put their poop on the new crops and so on. <br><br>Seventh - 15% is still low. I imagine people create the other 85%. No seriously, anyone look at the garbage we create and the methane that gives off? How much water we consume and use to shower every single day? How much waste we make, both poop and food waste? Did you know many pigs are fed the food we don&#39;t eat in restaurants that otherwise would get dumped in the landfill? <br><br>When farming is done right, it&#39;s not that damaging. We just need more people to do it the right way.

It would need to be done as releasing these animals to the wild would be an ecological disaster on the scale of previous extinction events, far worse potentially than continuing or increasing livestock production. look at the issue of domestic animals going feral currently then multiply it by several orders of magnitude. Some animals such as sheep, goats, and llama may still be viable livestock for use of their hair, and others for by products such as eggs or milk, but it would still require a massive reduction of current livestock populations as not all livestock are useful for those purposes.<br><br>Unused farm land for growing feed would return to it&#39;s natural state.<br><br>False, that land would simply be re-purposed to grow crops for humans, arable land is too valuable to simply be allowed to go wild. <br><br>The water used in producing meat is 5x that of fruit 7x that of vegetable and 20x that of cereal grains<br><br>Yes, but lets remember that these numbers are cumulative from growing feed as well as watering the animals themselves.

If you feel that not eating meat would benefit humanity and the environment, then by all means, stop eating meat, no one has any problem with vegetarians themselves.The problems lie in the bitching about it to other people expecting them to pick up your slack.

Where would the nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous come from to grow the huge amounts of modern vegetables we eat? Nutrient rich soil is made in large part from blood, bone and shit, aka manure, bone/blood meal etc...Where I live fish compost is often used also.  Right know in organic growing those come from mostly animal by-products.  If we don&#39;t used chemical fertilizers deriving from oil products, which damage the environment, we need to get those minerals into the soil to grow large tracks of vegetables somehow. Remember our veggies now are for the most part not native to their current area or soil. <br><br>Animals do not roam free, shitting and dying where ever they like as in the past, and we also don&#39;t roam free moving from place to place to allow areas to go fallow. There are 7 billion+ people, most of them sedentized, and they need to get nutrients into the ground somehow if they want to grow food locally. Would human manure be able to meet the soil requirements for every area? Wouldn&#39;t that be subject to diminishing returns?  Should we grind up and bury people in gardens instead of cemeteries?  What would happen to the local food movement because some areas in the world just can&#39;t produce any high density protein organically without utilizing animals in some way. Should they be importing veggie burgers or even just sacks of beans from factories far away that use chemical fertilizers to grow beans on large mono-culture tracks of land? Should we be pushing for more GMOs? Veganic growing does exist but it requires 30% more land because basically you are growing compost for several years  on a portion of your farm. You need to have some native soil fertility to begin with to do that. <br><br>It would be interesting to see those issues addressed. It seems people think we can get the same vegetables we are used to eating while stepping out side the shitting and dying part of the food web of which we are part.
