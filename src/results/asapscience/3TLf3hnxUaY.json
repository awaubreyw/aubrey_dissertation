I reset my brain so that I could masturbate without porn or any fantasy substitute. I now practice masturbation meditation . Its changed my life. Masturbation is not the problem, its porn and any substituted fantasies. I encourage you to masturbate while actively participating in guided meditation. Its AMAZING!<br><br>P.S. DON&#39;T use masturbation as an avoidance of negative emotions. You need to have a heathy balance of emotions. You can&#39;t be happy all the time. You need to feel hurt, sad, angry, confused, tired, bored, and/or meh sometimes. Its healthy. You don&#39;t have to &quot;man up&quot; or &quot;deal with it&quot; or &quot;get over it.&quot; As a man, when I started to allow my self to express my emotions, It freed me. Its a large part of why I am mostly depression free. (along with therapy and meds). When my best friend died at the age of 13 in 2008 I turned to masturbation to porn, food, and videogames as my vices of choice. It is going to be okay you will get through this.

This is probably why PAWS (Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome) seems to last longer with quitting porn than it does with quitting other addictions.

This comment will be pretty long, but I appreciate it if you read everything and hope it helps you too.<br><br>Tomorrow is Nov 1, and it means NNN! For us who wants to give this up for good, we must treat every day like NNN!<br><br>What\u2019s going on so far:<br>1. I no longer feel embarrassed and insecure because I am doing something society would consider taboo.<br>2. As the days go by, I get more and more motivated not to relapse as I see myself travel further in time away from when I last performed these acts. I\u2019m guessing this is a personal thing as I find that I can motivate myself.<br>3. My mind is noticeably clearer and more focused now. I no longer stumble over my thoughts and actions and can process instructions more quickly. This helps a lot, especially as I am studying right now. I feel more energetic too. I also no longer have sexual dreams.<br>4. To be honest, I get anxious and scared that I will relapse whenever the occasional female sexual stimuli pop up on social media and the internet and when I see females in the community with revealing clothing. Hopefully, it gets better as time goes by.<br><br>What I have been doing to prevent relapse:<br>1. In my country, internet porn is blocked, so I used a VPN to access them. So I deleted the VPN. <br>2. Whenever sexual stimuli like ads or posts appear on social media, I click \u201cNot interested\u201d so that little to none of this content will appear. Whenever I see females with revealing clothing, I immediately look away so as not to get tempted.<br>3. I developed mechanisms to remove the thoughts of watching porn and masturbating. I started working out more frequently, embarked on a weight loss journey, and led a healthier lifestyle. Diversions are significant.<br><br>One important thing I\u2019ve learnt so far is that when we want to quit something, we must find something that can divert our thoughts away from it. It\u2019s effective, trust me.<br><br>And the ULTIMATE, PARAMOUNT, IMPORTANT THING IS WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE QUITTING, THINK ABOUT WHY YOU STARTED<br><br>What I just shared is what happened to me and what works for me. We\u2019re all different, but I hope my story can help all of us in this journey.<br><br>We can do this, everyone! We can stop once and for all!

When someone is fighting, it all goes down to being a test of wills, usually someone equally matched goes down to who has the strongest will to win,  Now its not 100% always the case, there&#39;s timing, speed, technique, power, and etc.  But in any combat the test of will is what&#39;s really being tried and tested. \r<br>So again, willpower which is someone spiritual legs, is what&#39;s being strengthens by not giving in to a FAP.\r<br>\r<br>Now this is just looking at it from willpower standpoint.  \r<br>There&#39;s also the guilt of disappointment, when one commits these acts of an imagination; knowing that one gives himself in to something that&#39;s not real. It&#39;s also degrades oneself morally, because its not right, and a moral conscious tells us that itself.\r<br>It encourages and influences anxiety. How? Because when we give into impulses, subconsciously we&#39;re telling ourselves that we cant stop internal impulses, loosening ones own ability to control what he wants to feel, thereby when feelings of fear or apprehension enters our thoughts, our own mind doesn&#39;t think it can control it. \r<br>And there&#39;s really much more to this, but I&#39;ll stop there.", "comment_date": "2021-09-28T18:00:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "OUT OF THE FRYING PAN", "comment_text": "Society is being conditioned to get men to masturbate as often as possible.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

And this harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments, and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no real woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover: no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity. After all, almost the main work of life is to come out of our selves, out of the little, dark prison we are all born in. Masturbation is to be avoided as all things are to be avoided which retard this process.

The point of nofap is to quit porn basically. Porn indoctrinates you with unrealistic intercourse ideas. If you grow up with porn like 100% of the youth with internet access you grow to have a very wrong idea of sexual intercourse, what it means, what it should be like and the way it is practiced. This leads to the inability of keeping a stable relationship with a partner. We already see the increase of divorces today, we can\u2019t even imagine to what this will lead with this next generation. <br>To come back to my accusation of the zionists, look up the protocols of Zion and look for the portion mentioning diversity. If a people isnt united they can never stand up and break loose from the iron chains of slavery. National Socialism is of course banned because it unites people.

Now I wanted to do my best on carrier front but due to memory concentration issue and lots of family issues I could not do much.<br><br>At the age of 34 I switched again and joined HCL in 2012 at CTC of 11LPA. my total experience was 6 years. After that I joined Accenture in 2015 at CTC of 15 lacs . Tried to did my best but could not reach to pinnacle of success due to my memory. I was getting top contributor rating from last 4\u20135 years but salary and promotion was not happening in that ration .<br><br>So now at the age of 39 with 12 years of post MTECh experience I again switched the job and joining wipro at package of 23 LPA.<br><br>Lets see what happen to brother and sister.<br><br>My elder brother cleared PET and got admission in NIT warangal. he finished his engineering got placed in great product company and today at the age of 44 and 21 years of experience he is drawing 50LPA and become GM of HR division of a big Indian manufacturing company.<br><br>My sister at age 35 is drawing package of 18LPA at experience of 10 years .<br><br>My friends in BTech whom I taught how to code and crack computing problems are head or directory of IT divisions or senior project manager with package ranging from 35LPA to 50LPA.<br><br>Most of my BTech friends accepted my superior technical and logical skills .<br><br>Had I not been induldged in the habit of masterbation . I could have been graduated from some NIT if not IIT. My give years of experience wasted doing teaching and doing MTECH could have been saved.<br><br>And think about my package. it could have been reached to 50LPA plus in India and out side India don&#39;t know.<br><br>Conclusion is masterbation is extremely bad and cause you losses in millions\u00a0of CTC\u00a0,wasted life , depression , reduce your productivity many times, bad physical relationship with wife.<br><br>If you want to exploit every drop of your potential and skills and retain them for whole life please stay away from the habit of giving you short term gratification.<br><br>You are welcome to comment on my life.
