Comfort, nourishment, and security are just a few of the breast associations we are born with. Biologically there is nothing to suggest these associations are ever lost, so the notion that everybody loves big boobs may be true.  Larger breasts may be more capable of reigniting the primal breast attraction because the proportions (boob to adult face LOL) may be similar to the proportions we experienced, or were \u201cprogrammed\u201d to experience, as infants; if that makes any sense at all. When guys hit puberty all of those primal, positive, preexisting associations become sexualized so that the Mammary Glands become a powerful source of desire.

I am sure that there is no intense research in this area because there would be no type of &#39;population control&#39; and money for breast cancer research, a big business, would be lost. <br><br>What happens when a menstrual cycle is suppressed or is caused to stop altogether? There has to be some type of negative effect or consequences for it; there&#39;s a reason why our bodies shed the lining of the uterus when it is not used instead of just preserving it until it is. I know that there are some forms of birth control that has steroid hormones in it, which messes  with your body&#39;s regulation of the natural hormones (increasing them) to prevent pregnancy/periods. Nothing good can come of altering your body with artificial chemicals in any way; we see an obvious example of this with the brain&#39;s chemistry changes that are caused by an addictions to drugs.<br><br>This is what the video said:<br>Estrogen stimulates breast cell division, increases cell growth, and increases the risk of breast cancer. Cells that divide often are at a higher risk for mutation (cancer) than cells that do not divide. <br><br>So... what do you think you are doing to yourself when you take birth control that has hormonal steroids including estrogen in it that will increase your overall level of them in your body for long periods of time?

Because i&#39;ve heard that it feels bad when girls run, cuz it&#39;ll be bouncing up and down and you have to use arm or hands to hold them......   As a man I think I can somehow relate to that feeling just a little bit, cuz when I run my pec muscle jumps up and down too, and it feels sore. So if even my pec feels sore when i run then i can&#39;t imagine how bad it&#39;ll feel sor girls since they have heavier and bigger boobs. No wonder they wear bra. And I think some sports just dangerous to play for girls, like football, i think getting boobs crushed by a 200lbs person isn&#39;t fun.", "comment_date": "2015-12-12T17:47:24Z", "likes_count": 60}, {"comment_by": "Tyrrell", "comment_text": "I love your voice.
