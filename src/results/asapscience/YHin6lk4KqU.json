That statement is in no way true and is also a very silly thought.

The Lord our God created the universe and everything in it, and He put the earth in the exactly right spot for us to live our lives. If the earth was even one inch closer to the sun, we would burn up in flames. If we were one inch further away from it, we would all freeze to death.
