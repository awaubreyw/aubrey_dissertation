Every single scene is staged a thus would not play out that way in reality. For example to make a story work we have random characters appear in locations where they just wouldn&#39;t be, just so they can say their lines, after years of watching a person would gain a false perception of reality and be unhinged and separated.\r<br> \r<br>Documentaries however mostly state what they have done and how they&#39;ve got there, filling in the blanks and creating a genuine picture re-enforcing perception of reality and is much healthier instead of the falsities of a soap or drama which pushes the other way.\r<br> \r<br>To say TV reduces IQ depends also on what a person watches. We can watch a people walk around and talk all day long but this is not going to push a person to gain intellect. Neglecting work on brain health is the same as a person who never goes to the gym and just eats all day. They quickly become fat overweight which is frowned upon by most in society even if some still try to push the notion it&#39;s ok, it&#39;s been proven beyond doubt to have serious health implications.\r<br> \r<br>The stupid are many and the intelligent are few. We need stupid, but I do not think we should be allowed to encourage its growth by pushing people the wrong way. People will always be drawn to the stuff that does not sustain intellect because its physically less demanding, our brain consume 25% of the energy we eat after all. For example, do you get up and run to the kitchen to get your next drink or walk when there is no reason to get back before the ad break is over. No as it is less physically demanding and less unpleasant. This applies for brain training too. If something is hard to-do it&#39;s most likely benefiting you. In the long run you can train yourself to enjoy this activity like you can grow to like running it just takes the initial effort.\r<br> \r<br>The biggest issue I see is most people are in the notion that they cannot lose or gain intelligence and will be in a downward spiral for their foreseeable futures. Not the most enriching way to live to say the least.\r<br> \r<br>While society and technology gains, we will need more and more skilled people in the various technology sectors and creating people who can handle these jobs should be a priority. Unless the media address this notion nothing will change, the British broadcast corporation (BBC) has ran series in the past that fought this. An example would be Red Dwarf, encouraging people to think while adding humour to reduce the stress of  the over thinking in a setting that was unfamiliar and non-confusable to our own making it psychologically healthy to watch also. The show would teeter from simple concepts such as eating a curry and drinking a beer to the near impossible to understand concepts such as parallel universes giving the viewer a nice variety of stuff to think about.\r<br> \r<br>People should be allowed to binge freely, but not making it common knowledge that TV has not been nick named the idiot box for no good reason is a little unfair. Personally, I would name it the mind melting box because if you were to watch it long enough, you\u2019d not be good for much more other than walking around and speaking to people.", "comment_date": "2020-06-02T09:04:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "khushi nigam", "comment_text": "love this video.

I might still be able to be a catcher but idk it hurts too bad. Let&#39;s say you don&#39;t watch TV all day, you do something like read or play a board game... well I bet that is bad for you too... but when you go outside you are at risk of millions of diseases. I live in Florida so I constantly have to watch out for mosquitos that could carry Zika. Also, something as simple as swimming in a lake or the ocean could put you at severe risk. If water shoots up your nose from a lake or even from untreated water, (un-chlorinated) it could kill you within a week due to brain eating amoeba that lives in the water. And there is flesh eating bacteria in the ocean that could infect you through something as small as a puncture wound from a mosquito bite. So my point is, everything is bad for us. If we go outside we will be at risk to tons of diseases, and if we stay inside we will lack Vitamin D and get a bunch of other bad stuff, such as cancer from the radiation of televisions and phones.", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T05:45:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Filip Simakovi\u0107", "comment_text": "before watching.. no it not, idc what you say.", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T05:44:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Unicorn's Tale", "comment_text": "I finished Teen Wolf in a ween.
