However, I don\u2019t think that this video accurately contextualizes plane crashes. One of the biggest things that I\u2019ve  learned as a pilot (and from being highly involved in aviation) is that <b>most plane crashes occur due to a series or chain of unfortunate events.</b> It is highly unlikely (in most accidents) that one event will cause a plane crash.  Also, the video does not mention the industry-wide changes that are put into place after accidents to prevent such events from happening again. It is those changes that make commercial airline travel so safe today. Lastly, for those that have been concerned about their safety while flying, for almost every aircraft system, there are often multiple backups. For example, the video mentions that frozen pitot tubes affected airspeed indicators and caused a crash. To resolve this issue, pilots can recognize icing conditions and use pitot heat, which will melt the ice and restore normal pitot function. There are also multiple pitot tubes on many aircraft (especially commercial). As I mentioned before, accidents are caused by a chain of dangerous events. Poor decision making from the pilot (such as not recognizing icing conditions and not turning on pitot heat) can make the difference between life and death. This is not emphasized enough in the video. I have never posted a negative comment to bash a channel, so I hope that AsapSCIENCE takes this as constructive criticism to be more careful about disseminating information, especially when it can perpetuate fear amongst the audience. Please reach out to experts on topics like this, instead of regurgitating information that you might find in a Google search and pretending to be experts in a field in which you are not comfortable.

The pilots in that case didn&#39;t have time to &quot;stop the flight&quot; in a safe manner because it was too late - they had already taken off and there isn&#39;t enough reaction time to disconnect the gust lucks in that case - you&#39;re just dead. Not only do our checklists tell us remove the gust lock, but we also always move our controls to their fullest extent before takeoff to ensure they are &quot;free and correct,&quot; meaning that nothing is hindering their movement (they are free) and that the control surfaces move in the direction we expect them to as we manipulate the controls (correct).<br><br>&quot;Scud Running&quot; is something no commercial flight has ever done (at least not in the last 60 years). Airlines are governed by a set of rules that would never allow them to do this, and there&#39;s really no need to since both the pilots and the airplane&#39;s technology already allow the planes to land in either zero-visibility or near-zero-visibility. Private pilots sometimes &quot;scud run&quot; because they are not authorized to fly into clouds or visibility less than 3 statue miles unless they have additional certification to do so, so they are trying to fly below a low layer of clouds in visual conditions but the clouds get lower and lower, or the terrain gets higher and higher, or the weather deteriorates.<br><br>The reason airliners are usually less susceptible to engine failures is that 1) they use turbine engines, which are much less prone to failure than piston engines, and 2) they have multiple engines, and their engines are powerful enough that they can continue flight on the remaining engines while they find a place to land ASAP.<br><br>&quot;Pitot&quot; is a French word. You don&#39;t pronounce the last &quot;t&quot;. It&#39;s pronounced &quot;pee-toe,&quot; not &quot;pee-tote.&quot;<br><br>Not knowing the speed of your airplane is not as dangerous as you might think. There are procedures that the Air France pilots could have used. They could have dialed in a specific trim and power setting, and that would have kept the airplane within a safe speed range without them actually being able to see what their speed was. The Air France pilots did a LOT of things wrong, and that accident cannot be entirely blamed on the pitot tubes freezing over. You have to know a bit about the Airbus&#39; computer and control systems to understand the complexities of that situation, and then understand how the pilots broke SEVERAL of their operating rules during the emergency. Other pilots have been put into a simulator that had the exact same scenario, and they were able to successfully save the aircraft. The aircraft also has &quot;ground speed&quot; which is derived from GPS position data, and the pilots can do some math to calculate approximately what their &quot;indicated&quot; airspeed is. (There are 4 types of speeds in flying: indicated, calibrated, true, and ground. And they all have their own separate purpose, and the speeds can vary drastically at any one point in time. You can have an indicated airspeed of 200 knots with a true airspeed of 300 knots and a ground speed of 400 knots, all at the same moment).<br><br><br>An &quot;underspeed&quot; condition isn&#39;t dangerous if you have sufficient altitude, because &quot;underspeeding&quot; the airplane will result in an aerodynamic stall and a small loss of altitude if the pilot applies the correct inputs but it won&#39;t result in a structural break-up of the aircraft. &quot;Overspeeding&quot; could lead to structural break up, but the very first indications of an overspeed are not usually cause for concern of the structural integrity of the aircraft. It&#39;s usually just a warning to the pilot to &quot;hey! slow down!&quot; It&#39;s not that the plane will break up right once you overspeed it. Usually the &quot;Do not exceed speed&quot; in many airplanes is simply 90% of the aircraft&#39;s &quot;wing flutter speed&quot;, and if you have the wings rapidly fluttering for too long it can stress the aircraft structure.", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T19:05:16Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Airbender0069", "comment_text": "Because cooperate greed and corner cutting.", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T18:48:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex the Budgie", "comment_text": "Flying is very safe.

The 2009 crash, Air France Flight 447, was due to pilot error and not because of frozen pitot tubes. the pitot tubes did freeze but tests show that the pilots only had to fly for a couple of minutes for them to clear. The pilots displayed poor crew resource management. The pilot and co-pilot didn&#39;t communicate with each other, didnt say who was suppose to do what during the stall.

How many planes are usually in the sky at any given time compared to how many vehicles are on the road at any given time?? I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say there are usually more vehicles on the street than planned in the air. Plus on the ground, you have to lookout for pedestrians, animals like possums, squirrels, dogs, cats, other drivers who aren&#39;t paying attention to the road, ECT. Plus in order to fly a plane, you have to go through extensive training. To drive a car, you have to have the bare minimum of hours completed (really easy task), and pass a test that&#39;s super easy. Plus with planes, I&#39;m pretty sure you have to pass the test more than once. With driving, you only have to take the test 1 time in your entire life. So yeah, I wouldn&#39;t say the sky is safer.....I would just say after taking everything into consideration, there&#39;s just less chance of crashing. Doesn&#39;t really mean it&#39;s safer tho lol. If there were as many planes in the sky as cars on the street, I&#39;m sure it&#39;d be just as unsafe lol. Besides, who cares, because smoking and lung cancer is killing everyone, but we are worried about something as trivial as plane crashes!! Come on now people lol. Getting killed on a plane, is like getting killed on a roller coaster.....it doesn&#39;t happen a lot.....but it does happen. Just remember that next time you want to go on a roller coaster or plane....and if this comment ruins you&#39;re fun, oh well. We all gotta die someday, right? If it was meant to happen that way, then so be it. That&#39;s how I look at it. Why sit in the back seat for a &quot;better chance&quot; of living. You&#39;re on a plane!! If you&#39;re going to crash and die, then so be it, it was probably meant to happen. I&#39;m not going to sit in the back just to &quot;lessen&quot; my chances of dying lol. If I wanted to &quot;lessen&quot; my chances, I just wouldn&#39;t fly at all lol, not sit in the back for a &quot;better chance&quot; of living.
