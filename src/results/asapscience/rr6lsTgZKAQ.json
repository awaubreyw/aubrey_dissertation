And as you pointed out yourself, deceptive strategies can lead to better results at first but a worse outcome in the long term. And I think this is very true among adolescents and young adults. Girls that age tend to be more na\u00efve and many guys can score by deceiving them. Nice guys do not employ such strategies so it takes them much longer to find a partner. However, once they do, they&#39;ll probably have a more stable and fulfilling relationship.<br><br>And I think it&#39;s even more important how &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;weird&quot; you are.

Such a person will probably think that &quot;normal&quot; people are boring and only a relatively small set of potential partners is appealing to them.

The Passive Aggressive nice guy who basically fakes niceness and in some cases charm to get what he wants, a little manipulative but it works for him sometimes in getting girls. He is a bad boy  really.  This dude will start off nice and be a prick in the relationship or after he&#39;s slept with her.<br><br> 2. The Shy nice guy who is not even considered on a woman&#39;s sexual radar and girls are repelled by this guy because he is clingy and too worried to make a move, some even calling him &quot;creepy&quot;. They may have social anxiety or just a feminine way.  Any stereotype of nerd or socially inept person falls under this one. Long term they will find a partner but it&#39;s usually when the girl has matured and in some cases lost her looks. <br><br> 3. The Genuine nice guy which is the best one to be, is honest, direct and polite but not afraid to upset people and show balls. Has a calm and grounded presence.  However this guy can be too nice as well actually and even if he is being genuine, girls just don&#39;t know.<br><br>I fall under   combination of 1 and 2 but would like to be 3, but it&#39;s much harder than it seems.

Here is why.<br><br>The mentioned formula works only when the situation is repeated again and again between two people, but not the different ones - because in that case they don`t know the previous turn to know how to strategise, and don`t need to, because they can get enough out of a single turn: the person who &quot;Defects&quot; will always defect, because he will either lose 10$ or earn 500$. <br><br>Giving the probability of 50x50 for either result he`d need to pick bad card over 50 times to lose as much as he`d win by simply picking the good one once. Imagine how unlucky one must be for that, it`s merely impossible statistically.<br><br>So here we have it - Nice Guys will always finish last: because they always &quot;Cooperate&quot; and the Bad Boys always finish first and best, because they always &quot;Defect&quot; which means -10$ and +500$ for Nice Guy and Bad Boy respectively. Take 10 turns between random people and you have -100$ for Nice Guy and either +5000$ or +2500$ for a Bad Boy (give or take).<br><br>So, unfortunately, your formula only proves you wrong either in one shot or in long run - especially in the long run. <br><br>If your point was that Nice People finish Best in the end, then no once again - they finish with what is left after the Bad People, (both men and women), and I`m not sure that is what anyone can call Best...<br><br>God help the Nice Guys, He is their only hope for some justice in this world!

Most &quot;nice guys&quot; are usually clingy, sad and probably boring individuals, that focus personal success and self development rather than spending time in the clubs and having that adventurous spirit. It&#39;s really the fact that you are too predictable and too dull for a woman that you are not being in a relationship, not because you are a nice person. And truth be told, women are actively or passively drama consumers. Being fed all that drama in the early ages through probably romantic movies, romantic books and soap operas, they kind of lust for that romantic adventure even if that means they will end up hurting. In one way or the other, they actually want that. They want to experience the pain of loving as a form of huebris, even if they are not being aware of it. Moreover, there is a peer pressure to be dating the &quot;hot and popular guys&quot; if you are a good looking girl in highschool or university, otherwise you might not fit in or you might end up being judged by the other girls in your group. It is just the early desire for adventure that drives women towards the bad guys, but once they realize how foolish that is and they grow up, they start looking for someone that is actually a respectable member of the society. So just because you might look like you are losing the first few battles, in the end you are assured to win the war.

As far as a strictly under the sun approach goes, the perfect place to be is somewhere in between.<br><br>However... as I said, that&#39;s a strictly under the sun approach. I&#39;m not actually advocating for immorality, or even a midway behavior. If you don&#39;t care about anything after this fleeting life on earth, then you&#39;re going to be disappointed by evil people finishing first through the evil ways. &quot;There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity. And I commend joy, for man has nothing better under the sun but to eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun.&quot;<br><br>If you want to know what I actually think about what our lives should be about, the answer is that in fact, there is more to life than what we can perceive under the sun. Our lives are in fact eternal. There is in fact a Creator. I don&#39;t need to convince anyone of that because examining ourselves, the earth, science, morality&#39;s existence, and creation in general makes this apparent. People have known that as long as people have existed. He created us to live in harmony with Him without evil, a world that we can barely fathom. A world without disease, death, or evil. And I&#39;m not just talking about other people&#39;s evil; I&#39;m talking yours and mine too. But we chose the path of evil, therefore ruining our relationship with God. Despite being the definition of good and perfection and power in the universe, God, our Creator, condescended to become human 2000 years ago. He lived on this earth for 33 years as a man named Jesus and in the greatest act of grace (undeserved favor) fathomable, He broke down the divide that was created between our evil, sinful, selves and a good perfect God. He did this by absorbing all of the just punishment we deserve for our sins. This was necessary in the same way it is necessary that judgement be carried out on a murderer. Letting a murderer go free without justice would be unthinkable. God, the Creater of all you can see, the embodiment of true joy, love, good, and justice in the universe, took your sentence for you upon Himself. If you&#39;re wondering why God would do such a thing, it&#39;s because He loves you. Despite what people may think love is, it is more than a romantic emotion, but an action of ultimate self-sacrifice. And why does He love you? Well, what reason does He need other than that He loves to give grace and that He created you.<br>I am spreading this good news not out of condemnation, but as a hungry beggar who found food, joyfully telling other beggars where to find food.<br>If you say that you&#39;re a good person so what I am suggesting is hateful and crazy, then you may be comparing yourselves to other sinful humans, which will of course give you inconclusive evidence. I am sorry, but I realize I can&#39;t change your mind. But, if you recognize truth in what I am saying and you are aware of your short comings and the despair that living for yourself brings, then God may be working in you. Let me know, if I peeked your curiosity.<br><br>Ultimately, if this comment made you angry, feel free to ignore it. My goal is not to anger anyone, though I realize I will. Just take the advice of the second paragraph and live your life for yourself. All you can hope for is a nice job, a nice spouse and a decent sized legacy so people remember you after you die. Maybe sprinkle in some charity donations and soup kitchen volunteering along the way to make yourself feel like a good person (I don&#39;t say that condescendingly as this is my temptation too: to do good to make myself feel good). I pray that whoever you are, you find true joy and grace in the Creator of the universe, the Lord!

Normally I use a douchebag mentallity with girls but I really liked these girls (it sounds wrong talking about 2 girls but trust me for the sake of science 2 experiments are better than 1 ) I was very nice, open and gentle and not too pushy. From both girls i got confirmation they liked me too since we had a great time and kissed. Standard procedure would be not to say much too about it and see what happends.. This pretty much worked every time for me. I know how to handle girls but I made the conscious decision that this time I was going to try a different approach. . but this time i couldn\u00b4t do it because I Liked her too much. So we talked, I was open, I told her how i felt about the night and guess what.. one stopped talking completely and the other... sometimes talks because halfway through i changed my attitude to ultra douchebag and somehow she rather responses to someone who doesnt care about her than a guy who does. Conclusion for me here is:\u00a0 To get a girl, be a douche and later when it gets serious change your attitude to being nice. she will appreciate it much more then. Offcourse there are girl who love really genuine nice guys and are more attracted to that but majority of girls like what they cant have.<br><br>Later I discovered one girl was going an internship abroad and thats why she skept her distance because she didnt want to fall in love before she went abroad and the other girl had just broken up with her bf 1 months before and needed comfort but she was willing to go on date if i gave it some more time.

If you give blood to another bat, then on your off night, one of the bats that you gave blood to didn&#39;t give any that they got on your off night...do you still give them blood on their off nights? You know they are greedy and won&#39;t give back, but do you stay a nice bat and give them blood or not? If you don&#39;t, you lose your niceness, if you do, the greedy bat will scam you again.<br><br>For me, in my theory, you should always do the nice thing, even to the bad, greedy people. Either they can continue to scam you and take advantage, or they can catch on to how nice you are and can change their ways. Being constantly nice gives them a chance to change, while sinking to their level and not being nice makes them want to be just as bad as they already are, if not, worse.<br><br>For example, if you have seen Les Miserables, Jean ValJean becomes a robbing crook even after being released from jail he was in for 20 years. He was in jail BECAUSE of stealing, then as soon as he got out he continued to steal. Until a nice man offered him a place to stay and eat and such, because we was starving on the streets. Then, the next morning, despite the incredibly nice act, Valjean stole from the nice man and fled. Later he was caught by the police and brought back to the man, who then instead of getting him arrested, chose to give him even more stuff and let him go. He continued to be nice, despite Valjean robbing him after he already was nice to him. Then after that, Valjean finally realized it&#39;s better to be a good person and he went on to become a well liked mayor in another city.<br><br>So it all comes down to: &quot;is it worth continuing being cheated by the evil guys to try and change them, or is it better to just disregard them and let them cheat off someone else&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s all a lot of hard thinking, but interesting to think about as well.", "comment_date": "2015-04-06T07:02:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Thompson", "comment_text": "Being nice may get you allies or friends but not a girlfriend", "comment_date": "2015-04-04T21:19:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joruno -", "comment_text": "I&#39;d choose Defect all the way.

Yes, we can agree honest is similar to nice, and dishonesty is similar to bad. However, its not the same thing. You can be a bad and honest person at the same time. An example is shooting someone and being honest you did it. Another example is all the bad, and honest evil antagonists on movies I see a lot of. To further explain, companies make agreements to make the bigger profit for both, but any business can back stab and pick the dishonest route to make more in the &quot;short run&quot;. While the honest company, could be killing innocent puppies and kittens to make there products, which isn&#39;t nice at all. In conclusion, bad and nice doesn&#39;t have much to do with the prisoners dilemma. It&#39;s not that great of an analogy. Being bad will pay off in the &quot;short run&quot;, but who&#39;s to say if the company played it perfectly, it could have gotten more money in the long rung playing bad at times and good at other times. Statistics might prove it wrong for the majority, but a lot of other companies could actually benefit from being the bad guy more than being the nice guy. Meaning, nice guys don&#39;t always finish first. It&#39;s more of a balance between bad and nice. As shown in the Tit for Tat strategy. being dishonest is not nice, but it&#39;s required at times to make the bigger profit because other companies are being dishonest. Over all, you should not be too nice, and you should not be too bad. Too much of one might fk you over.

Evolutionary psychology has WAY more variables than just game theory, and this plays out in courtship and dating in a way that is almost the exact opposite portrayed in this video, as any man who has mistakenly believed being a &quot;nice guy&quot; in the dating scene is both either necessary or sufficient has or eventually will find out.<br><br>The variable AsapSCIENCE misses is what men and women NATURALLY FIND ATTRACTIVE in each other in a relationship and why. I don&#39;t mean to imply that all men and women want the same thing, or that the basics about what makes us attractive can&#39;t--or even shouldn&#39;t--be overcome, but there IS a &quot;default setting&quot; mother nature has given us.<br><br>Men are attracted to women who appear sexually fertile (aka &quot;beautiful&quot;). Virtue, character, and empathy are secondary things that guys have to work VERY hard to place over physical beauty in choosing who to have a romantic relationship with. Women who are virtuous can make this choice easier for men--if they choose--by trying to be both. But this is just an example to the bigger question--how men ought to behave--because men&#39;s desires are simpler and more transparent.<br><br>Women were gifted by evolution to desire men who are powerful. Survival granted the favor of offspring to women who could secure a man that would provide two things: resources and protection. That means an alpha male. Alpha males are calm and confident in their power, traditionally masculine, and can be dismissive and rude in their honesty because they don&#39;t <b>have</b> to be. They have the choice that comes with abundance and security, and the abundance and security that is SIGNALLED by what people who believe just being &quot;nice&quot; is sufficent would call &quot;asshole behavior:&quot; a devil-may-care indifference to other many other people&#39;s opinions or feelings along with a proactive, ambitious, and aggressive general attitude. Nice-guy behavior--compassion, kindness, timidity, obedience to rules of etiquette and the feelings of others--signals the exact opposite traits. &quot;Nice guys&quot; are just not instinctively attractive to women, just as women who do not embody the biological signs of exorbitant fertility and youth are not instinctively attractive to men.<br><br>If you were shocked and confused about why Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Edward Cullen, virtually every rapper in history, and a number of other dark, blatantly &quot;not-nice&quot; male characters are so outrageously sexy to women who aren&#39;t thinking philosophically, you now know why.<br><br>The problem--as the video accurately DOES illustrate--is that a society of narcissistic sociopaths makes for a generally worse society, just as men&#39;s attraction to women who are beautiful rather than virtuous (because if you&#39;re beautiful, you usually don&#39;t <b>need</b> to be virtuous) makes for a less-than-optimal society. But that doesn&#39;t mean guys need to make women&#39;s decisions unnecessarily difficult: a guy can and should be virtuous in all the ways that matter ethically, but without being &quot;nice.&quot;\u00a0<br><br>Rather than be a &quot;nice guy,&quot; or succumb to the PUA pit of social nihilism and go all-out Alpha, there&#39;s a middle-ground where men can be strong, masculine, and confident--not &quot;nice guys&quot;--but still stand up for mutually beneficial values and ethics in accordance with what game theory would say is best for everyone. He embodies the provider and protector role with assertiveness blended with compassion.

You&#39;re being offered a massively awesome good deal so I get why women would want to have friendzone friends.<br><br>Friendzone friends are the biggest &#39;friends&#39; in the world. Friendzone friends are better than your best friends. Best friends will call you out, Best friends can and will say no. They&#39;ll drive you even if they do not live in that direction. (Here&#39;s a clue if you have a striaght guy friend who does every little thing for you, says yes ALL THE TIME, thinks you&#39;re right all the time, knows about your habits and moods but you don&#39;t actually know a thing about him, moods, habits, vices, ticks that don&#39;t fit male stereo types. THEN YOU HAVE A FRIENDZONE FRIEND, not a friend friend, cut him off and start the relationship again. A true friend is a partner not a pillow you can lie on, sit on and punch when you feel like it.)<br><br>Friendzone friends are essentially yes men, every one in the world would like a yes man, just look at holiwood.

That doesn&#39;t mean why would\u00a0<br><br>Most friendzone friends are generally always nice, they aren&#39;t eating babies then being nice to you. I hate that kind of assesment and people make it more often than you&#39;d think.

One thing I became self aware about was common misbeliefs in the media and why girls say they want a nice guy, but date different.<br><br>The most successful people I know are not doormats for people. That is what a nice guy is. A doormat who will get stepped on and go out of their way to do things for others. The problem is when they get pushed and pushed but don&#39;t resist because that wouldn&#39;t be &quot;nice,&quot; they eventually snap and no one knows why. People super nice early in life tend to be the abusers later in life. Also, they do nice things for other because they want something in return. They want to look good and only care about their image, and just wants everyone to like them. Genuinely, they aren&#39;t nice deep down, but just will do good deeds to get something in return. And when a girl for example doesn&#39;t fall for them like expected, they try harder. Try harder and get used as a doormat more. Until they burst. Nice guys are devious too. They can&#39;t even listen to somebody genuinely. They listen and try to &quot;fix&quot; EVERYTHING. They&#39;ll say, &quot;If everyone just acts how I want, life would be fine and perfect.&quot; Little do they actually look at the other person&#39;s side, or try to look at another&#39;s paradigm. They don&#39;t know how to just listen without trying to fix the problem. Nice guys are assholes. They&#39;re doormats with no boundaries. They&#39;re betas who lie and are unfaithful just to make another person happy, because they don&#39;t want to say something that will make them sound mean. That&#39;s untrustworthy. At least you can trust an asshole for being honest and having boundaries, keeping the bullshit out. What most think is an asshole, is actually just an honest, open, guy who sets boundaries....... who doesn&#39;t get stepped on every second and who doesn&#39;t complete tasks to get something in return each time, but cuz he genuinely wants to. When girls say they want a nice guy, not only is that socially acceptable, but they actually just mean an honest guy who&#39;s not a little manipulative bitch and who doesn&#39;t cry each time someone is focused on their own life instead of theirs.<br><br> There&#39;s prolly a Lott of typos in this but whteves<br><br>Watch rsdfreetour&#39;s latest video on being an entity with structural integrity and read no more mr.

We give little Tommy the diagnosis for some hyperactive disorder and load the sucker up with some unneeded drug made by Phyzer incorporated. We also tell him how not to rape or brutally massacre somebody&#39;s face with an iron stick.. Low and behold, by age 17 Tommy dropped out of school. started doing heroine and died from an overdose on his birthday. Gee, wonder why? <br><br>The parents today stink. So does our understanding on male/female courting procedure lol<br><br>Now we come to my favorite part.. The truism that is really fucking up men and women alike.<br><br>Oh man, this &quot;be nice to a girl and that will be enough&quot; truism was likely invented by 70s hipsters who thought teaching generations of boys to be the whipping post of every girl he deems attractive was a great idea. Be confident. Be decisive. Most importantly be a decent human being. Here&#39;s what girls want. Well, at least most:<br><br>- They want kindness AND virility.<br>- They want energy and optimism.<br>- They want honesty and a bit of secrecy<br>- They want a dude with goals. An agenda<br>- They want a dude who can excite them.<br>- They want smartness but still be able to understand what the hell you&#39;re still saying. Also don&#39;t fake it. Smart chicks can tell straight away.<br>- They want a guy who takes care of themselves<br><br><br>- They want a guy who is genuinely interested in them. A dude who isn&#39;t just in it for the tap. Here&#39;s the problem with us guys. We may genuinely like the girl but on some days our dicks end up trumping the very IQ of our own brains.  Luckily, this isn&#39;t the Victorian age. She may be just as sexual on the first date as you are but don&#39;t make that a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you just want to get off. Don&#39;t waste her fucking time. Find a woman who does that. If you&#39;re a player, just find yourself a woman who loves the Yahtzee like you do.<br><br>They want a guy who makes an effort to strain their ears and listen to what they&#39;re saying. Yeah i know, guys don&#39;t have a need to talk about their daily lives as much and yes, a lot of girls know they need to vent much more regularly but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to provide some level of intelligent response to how to handle that bitch at work she hates so much. Here&#39;s an example. Her co-worker keeps messing with her on purpose and your girlfriend comes home wishing she were dead. Plus that broom-driving blonde clearly deserves retribution. Ya know, a guys perspective sometimes fixes problems. Sometimes as a guy you&#39;re periodically selfish, simplistic and apathetic brain helps in times like this. Teach her how to not listen to women. Ya dig? Lol<br><br>They want a guy who looks after her sometimes but not to the point of infantalizing them. Most women appreciate this but not where it comes off as tacky and excessive. Sometimes she might surprise you. She could be better at things than you are, so here&#39;s the plan. Accept your inadequacy, educate yourself and try to surpass her in those areas. Always seek new ways of challenging yourself and encourage her to do the same ;)<br><br>They want a guy who is similar to they are. Obviously! Idk why I&#39;m saying this but for some dudes out there it has got to be said. Guys, if you see a girl who is in another league of attractiveness or a different group (Ghetto,Scene,Emo,Punk,Prep,Grunge, you name it!)  Your chances of success plummet. Don&#39;t blame the girl at the mall who looks like Heidi Klum if she rejects you. There is nothing you can do. Lower your standards. Also, target a woman with similar interests. Don&#39;t talk about Star Trek to your average 19 year old lady. Instead, find an awesome chick who is into Comic-Con and has posters of Leonard Nimoy covered in goofy purple hearts on her wall as she blasts various forms of badass underground rock music you&#39;ve never heard before.<br><br>Learn to relax on dates. No tacky roses or chocolates. Just run up there and compartmentalize that part of your brain that is attracted to her so you don&#39;t overly posture yourself or stutter like you&#39;re insecure. If the date turns sour, keep cool. Plenty more out there and NEVER become that bitter dude who dies alone in his apartment because he always ranted and raved about how women are all evil shrews who love bad boys. They don&#39;t &quot;love&quot; bad boys. They are drawn to the energy that they have. Learn to find that manly energy deep inside you that has been buried by years of brainwashing of new age parenting.<br><br><br>Most of all. They want a guy who is confident and mentally stable. Who knows what he wants out of life and is willing to seize success and happiness for himself and the woman he loves. God willing, if you actually demolish your insecurities and work on yourself before pursuing a relationship with the fairer sex.. Your life will turn around for the better and hopefully if she isn&#39;t a crazy woman or a manipulative bitch. She will bring your life more color and hopefully in 50-60 years she will still be alive and with you by time you kick it and will be there crying for your stupid ass while your laying there stiff as a wooden board while wearing your favorite outfit :)<br><br>Was that morbid enough 4ya?<br><br>ah well.. see ya! :P<br><br>\ufeff", "comment_date": "2015-01-13T03:22:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simge d", "comment_text": "Why do we itch ?", "comment_date": "2015-01-13T03:18:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mira A.", "comment_text": "Make a vid for why we have crushes plz \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc6b", "comment_date": "2015-01-13T03:17:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Melvin M", "comment_text": "Can you explain why a brain freeze happens.", "comment_date": "2015-01-13T03:14:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WhiteBearTiger", "comment_text": "karma", "comment_date": "2015-01-13T03:06:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "junethemaster", "comment_text": "Thumbs up if you thought the title was the reason why some LOVE girls &quot;bad boys&quot;.

You&#39;ll be more likely to &quot;score&quot; if you lie to women, make promises you have no intention of keeping, and/or take advantage of them while they are drunk. However, if you want a long-term and lasting monogamous relationship it&#39;s probably more advantageous to be nice. Also in business there are certain situations that call for you to be cutthroat, aggressive, and mean in order to make a profit and get ahead, but other situations where being nice would most likely help like when it comes to how you treat your bosses and superiors.

Little word of advice, it&#39;s not the nice that&#39;s putting you in the friendzone, it&#39;s the lack of balls. Women aren&#39;t attracted to pushovers, yes men or martyrs. They don&#39;t want to play drama games or deal with all your negative emotions. They want a MAN, which is someone with conviction and a hefty pair on him. To all of you complaining about the friendzone, it&#39;s not an issue of how nice you are, it&#39;s a matter of how powerfully you present yourself. I&#39;ve seen so many different failures blamed on the &quot;nice guy&quot; excuse, but one of the most common culprits is that you&#39;re either A) So available that you don&#39;t look like you have a life (I.E. you&#39;re always free to hang out, so it&#39;s up to her to decide a &quot;when&quot;), or B) You aren&#39;t available enough and this person wants someone they can spend time with. FYI, B is the rarity when it comes to nice guys, but when it&#39;s the culprit it&#39;s usually just because the guy is too lazy.<br><br>Here&#39;s a tip for those in the friendzone: Vanish... not joking, just disappear without a word, take some time for self reflection and gain real, true confidence in yourself and your abilities. Then one day when you can walk with an air of power about you, just show up and say &quot;sup&quot; like you&#39;ve only been gone for a day. Friendzone obliterated... unless you fall back to the old tactics in which case you just busted out of jail to waltz right back in to your cell. Nice isn&#39;t a magic pill, it&#39;s a desirable trait, but it&#39;s usually offset by some of the negatives that can come with &quot;nice guys&quot; (I.E. martyrism). And stop being so damn easy, guys! Stop taking whatever they&#39;ll give you and being happy for the attention. Half the time I used to think a girl wasn&#39;t interested in me because of &quot;nice&quot; until the day I told a girl to grow up and stop acting like a little girl, that the world doesn&#39;t revolve around her and she needs to stop expecting everyone to throw themselves at her feet just because her schedule free&#39;d up on the last minute... the next day she took me aside to &quot;talk to me&quot; and just grabbed a handful of crotch. I wasn&#39;t mean or rude, I was realistic and when I was done with the reality check I went back to being nice.<br><br>She got the hint that I&#39;m sweet, kind, caring and hearfelt, but also got it through her head that this didn&#39;t make me a pushover or a yes man, that I was VERY capable of getting fed up with her shit. And a lot of times women even TEST YOU on how much they can get away with, even if it&#39;s a subconscious drive, and if you don&#39;t call them out then yes, you&#39;re getting friendzoned for being far too tolerant of immature behavior and maybe even trying to justify their behavior for them when even they know they&#39;re out of line! They lose respect for you, they lose excitement and thrill, and that is how most men usually wind up in the friendzone. Trust me, broke out of the &quot;nice guy&quot; curse without becoming a dick and I have women approaching me, asking me for a date and blowing off the guys who call themselves &quot;playa&quot;... and I look like Chewbacca!", "comment_date": "2015-01-09T18:49:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B20Vitb", "comment_text": "A game where you win $500 and $300.<br>This seems like a irrelevant way to determine whether nice guys finish first..

That&#39;s the mistake most of the commenters are making. But that&#39;s no surprise. A lot of people sit around lonesome on the internet complaining about how everyone is so mean to them and the world doesn&#39;t understand them, usually because smiling at someone and buying them a cookie didn&#39;t cause them to fall madly in love with them or something. Or because the more confident and outgoing person that they perceive as a jerk got the promotion/job/award. Meanwhile, they&#39;re sitting around being passive aggressive and secretly hateful while pretending they&#39;re not succeeding because they&#39;re &quot;nice.&quot; Plenty of nice people succeed, because they&#39;re also ambitious, smart, and talented. The nicest girl I knew in high school is now a successful writer and just got engaged to a great guy. The nicest guy I knew in high school graduated from law school and is about to marry a great girl. Those are literally the two nicest people I knew, who were nice just because they were genuinely nice and not for some ulterior motive, and they&#39;re also probably the two most successful people from my high school. A lot of the people I&#39;ve met, known, or seen claiming that they didn&#39;t get ahead because they&#39;re &quot;too nice&quot; have really been passive-aggressive assholes. Occasionally, and I mean rarely, it&#39;s just someone who has an anxiety disorder and is afraid on some level that people secretly hate them. The point is, if you&#39;re not getting where you want to be, it&#39;s not because you&#39;re &quot;nice&quot;, it&#39;s because of your attitude. You&#39;re expecting not to get ahead. You see a girl you like, and you smile at her, but never tell her that you like her, and then when she dates some other guy, you call him a jerk and say &quot;girls never like nice guys.&quot; (In reality, you don&#39;t know a damn thing about the guy and he&#39;s probably awesome.) You see the position you want, and instead of working towards it, you lament about how much you want it and whine when some other person gets it, even though that person worked hard and probably had been vying for the position all along. You&#39;re automatically assuming you CAN&#39;T have the things you want, so you don&#39;t even try, and then you get mad at the universe for not giving you the things you haven&#39;t put any effort into getting and didn&#39;t believe you could get for the first place. (FYI, when it comes to dating, people are not things you can get, anyway. So, your goal should be &quot;find a person that I like that likes me and that will make me happy&quot; and not, like, &quot;Make Rachel fall in love with me.&quot; Because people are individuals and love doesn&#39;t work that way, but I&#39;m digressing.) You gotta stop blaming the universe and &quot;niceness&quot; for why you haven&#39;t gotten the things you want. You gotta earn the things you want. And in love, you gotta keep looking until you and someone fit together; you can&#39;t force it. And if you try to, you&#39;re not really nice, anyway.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-01-09T05:54:32Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Celeste Moss", "comment_text": "Great video!

I also think that, typically, people hear &quot;nice guys finish last&quot; and associate it with dating. I will clarify in advance and just say I do think there&#39;s an element of truth to this that they finish last, though I also think the extent to which it&#39;s true is exaggerated by guys who frankly need to mature a bit and not blame a failure on others. Now, before I get to my point, a backstory:<br><br>\u00a0\u00a0 In High School I was good at the poetry assignments. Didn&#39;t like it, but was good at it to the point my teacher would read mine to the class. A crapton of guys showed up asking me to write a poem on their behalf to their main squeeze. Alongside this, a good amount asked for relationship advice and &quot;what do girls really want?&quot; I found the question absurd, suggesting that an entire gender has the same universal interest, but toyed with the idea for fun. Well turns out, I sort of found an answer....sort of, since it&#39;s a paradox. The answer is power. Women are attracted to power. Now, this is a paradox as &quot;power&quot; is an abstract concept and comes in many forms, with some women viewing intelligence as power, others viewing charisma and personability as power, others like muscle tone, some might consider talents such as singing or dancing a type of power, and hell, some might just view money as power. So there&#39;s your &quot;universal&quot; answer as to what women want. Not exactly universal, but still makes sense, no? After all, the idea there would be a truly universal answer is ridiculous.<br>\u00a0\u00a0 But the main thing to take away from this is that we are animals and there are ways that we seek mates. Studies have suggested for example that what men consider a &quot;sweet ass&quot; is actually a male subconciously recognizing an ass that is built to guarentee safe and healthy childbirth. And yes, women probably do look for a mate that can protect and provide for her; this is not exactly neccesary in the modern world, but subconciously this mechanic is still in play whether it&#39;s neccesary or not. In that sense, women want to be impressed. This is why, for example, you will struggle to find a woman who doesn&#39;t say she likes a man with a good sense of humor, yet you can probably name a guy you&#39;ve known who was hilarious and forever alone. That&#39;s because he didn&#39;t display some sense of power she wanted, so subconciously the attraction wasn&#39;t there even if she enjoyed hanging out with him and valued his friendship. And there&#39;s another trait women will often say they find attractive:<br><br>Confidence. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all heard this be spoken as something attractive in men. Why? Because it&#39;s a power display. It implies that the guy is a suitable mate because he doesn&#39;t entertain any thoughts of failure, and thus can surely provide.<br><br>\u00a0 This is the exact trait that sparks the &quot;nice guys finish last&quot; line. It&#39;s not that nice guys truly finish last, it&#39;s that a lot of guys that are nice are SO nice and polite that they never display confidence, out of fear of appearing arrogant or out of a desire to respect a woman&#39;s desires and kinda wait for her to feel an attraction too instead of initiating and saying &quot;I want you, let&#39;s date.&quot;<br><br>\u00a0\u00a0 In that sense, there&#39;s a tiny element of truth to nice guys finishing last. It&#39;s not perfect as niceness isn&#39;t the problem (failing to display confidence is the true problem), but it&#39;s got some truth to it. And as I said though, any guy who finds himself falling back on the &quot;women don&#39;t like me cause I&#39;m a nice guy,&quot; dude you can be nice and sensitive and shy and respectful, but you also gotta be bold and be able to say &quot;hell yeah I kick ass&quot; and &quot;we&#39;re going on a date friday.&quot;<br><br>\u00a0 In MY opinion and MY experience, love is the most common use of that phrase and I find it somewhat fitting. I find the example in the video less fitting and less implied by the phrase. Others in the comments section have also suggested other areas where niceness falls behind, for example the studies suggesting an abnormally higher percent of CEOs may be sociopaths. The video itself even fails to address how the winning strategy also used not-nice tactics to be the best; it was NOT pure niceness that won, it was partial niceness. One could put that on par with being nice enough to recognize you can&#39;t cheat, steal, con and murder to get your way because society frowns on it and not having society comply with you is bad, but taking EVERY legal opportunity to take from people could be the less nice half, and I think most of us would refer to such people as jerks....So yeah, gotta say I find this video pretty flawed.", "comment_date": "2015-01-09T04:32:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joecool", "comment_text": "So being nice works in the dilemma and in a bat and bird&#39;s life.

A more realistic arguement would be GOOD vs. BAD rather than NICE vs. BAD, the opposite of Nice is, Mean. When it comes down to a guy that&#39;s nice vs. a guy that&#39;s mean, a girl with ultimately rather have a guy that&#39;s Nice, (obviously). If a girl actually preferred a mean guy, then perhaps she doesn&#39;t have the proper morals. Generally, a girl wants to be treated nicely. That&#39;s a given. However, the choice between a Bad guy and a Good guy is more up to the preference of the girl rather than human nature. A Bad guy is not always a Mean guy. The guy may just get into a lot of trouble or have a negative reputation. A Good guy is not always Nice, either. He may treat a girl with respect and consideracy, but not have the qualities of a decent human being.

Also if you expect something in return then you&#39;re just &quot;playing nice&quot;, therefor you&#39;ll never be content and always feel treated unfairly.<br><br>Don&#39;t expect anything in return. Be nice because you want to and it makes you happy and not because of what other people think. If being an ass makes you feel good then I guess that works too but the respect and loyalty you&#39;ll build will crumble at any sign of weakness.", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T21:30:39Z", "likes_count": 178}, {"comment_by": "Alison Cheung", "comment_text": "The blue-shirt arm in 3.37 is missing =p", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T21:30:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vincent Gagnon", "comment_text": "The animal thing also works in symbyosis", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T21:27:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EmeraldWyrm", "comment_text": "I&#39;m glad that girl in the blue sweater (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr6lsTgZKAQ&amp;t=3m30s\">3:30</a>) finally got an arm\u00a0@ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr6lsTgZKAQ&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a> : )", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T21:26:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Athena", "comment_text": "i think that the idea that nice guys finish first is arguable but i really dont think the card game applies to the topic. i love you guys but it really seems like you guys were trying to make a weak connection between the topic and the book at the end.", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T21:26:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray Kaples", "comment_text": "The reason there is so much blow back in the comments here about this not being true in real life is because its not true presently.

The animals in this video act on instinct or rather their own nature. Human nature is vastly different from that of vampire bats. Its human nature to take advantage of people and exploit weakness. There are people who can tell when they can be nice and not get taken advantage of, and there are people who can&#39;t and end up losing. There is a problem with the card game. You start the game by saying the two prisoners don&#39;t know which card is what so there is no way for them to plan what card they can select next. You also don&#39;t explain the rules of the game. In most card games, the cards get shuffled after each turn. So after each turn there is a 50/50 chance the card will or will not be not be in the same spot as it was the previous turn. That is assuming you are only using the two cards and not two cards from a deck. So even if you wanted to do the same as the person before you, there is a chance you would not be able to. This is also called prisoners dilemma. The best of criminals usually have a contingency plan for if they get caught after the crime has been committed and there is little or no evidence against them. The plan is usually to have the same exact story or alibi. If they get caught while committing the crime then its a different story. If you are incarcerated and commit a crime, there are usually no witnesses. I don&#39;t know if you have heard the term snitches get stitches but that is a real life situation. This was a very naive video. I also don&#39;t know if the computer simulation is using the same two people for each round but in real life your are going to be dealing with more than just one person. \u00a0 \u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T21:24:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cici Nave", "comment_text": "Starts singing nice guys by nighaha.

This strategy however also is why dictators come to power. The dictators follow the strategy to achieve the least consequences.

You are being &quot;nice&quot;, because you want to get with that hot piece of ass. If we replace the pretty girl, with big sweaty obese girl, I&#39;m sure your &quot;niceness&quot; dies down.<br><br>Sure you can argue you are still &quot;nice&quot;, but its not nice in the same way. Women are hardware&#39;d, and in fact so are guys with high social intelligence, to detect these types of deceptions. THIS is what makes most girls either label you a creep, friendzoned or a provider.<br><br>Learning to be honest, not just with her, but with yourself is the key here, and that is why &quot;jerks&quot; get so far. They might appear to be jerks, but in most cases, they are just honest people, being honest (You might not like their honesty though). The reason the dishonest jerks also appear to win, is because we live in a world were &quot;niceness&quot; at face value, appears deceptive, because everyone is being overtly nice. Honesty breeds trust, which is what in my experience, is what will get you the furthers with women, and with life.<br><br>Naturally the girl needs find you attractive as well, so unless you have complex, passionate, and deep personality, then honesty won&#39;t get her sexually interested (Unless you look like a greek god). Don&#39;t even try and look down at them for this though, we guys are just as bad in that department :) Nurturing personality change and development, to get close to who we truly want to be, is however totally within our power, so being boring, is not an excuse.<br><br>So stop this stupid, overtly superficial &quot;niceness&quot; blaming, and start developing yourself, and practice brutal honesty with yourself and others. You&#39;ll notice that once you get the hang of that, pretty much everything else becomes easy, because you can no longer hide behind excuses.

If we had 100 chances for everything we do in life then okay ill buy your theory; but since most events are singular and do not arise again in most cases, being the nice guy will cause you to lose (based on your model).", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:27:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "here4frags", "comment_text": "When you use &quot;nice guys finish last&quot; with the whole &quot;partner searching&quot; procedure, i dont care about science, i KNOW the saying is true in this circumstance.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:26:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "QuickScoperator", "comment_text": "And..... this is why Canadiens always win the Olympics", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:26:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "random", "comment_text": "If such a thing existed everyone would just play cooperate every time, who would bother doing anything for an extra 200 hundred when they can make 300 every hand with ease.<br><br>Why do you keep insisting on making these stupid videos, which aren&#39;t accurate?", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:25:56Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Ultimate Feud Company", "comment_text": "guess what, the more devious and more selfish was female.", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:25:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex P", "comment_text": "Ha, he said tit.", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:25:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheFoundBeliever", "comment_text": "being nice gets you no where. i am a nice person naturally helping when i see i can because i can. i dont expect anything in return. sadly in today&#39;s society even being nice is looked at as a scam. people will give dirty looks when you offer a helping hand. all my life i been the nice guy. now im an asshole. why? because nice guys finish LAST!!! not saying most dont appreciate the niceness but being the nice guy has left me alone, used and abused, taken advantage of and before someone say anything about knowing when not to be nice like was stated above, look why do you think im alone and turned into an asshole. its because i stopped being nice. yes im still curtious and kind to others. as for the helping hand tho i cut that of at the wrist. maybe at a time sure being nice had worthiness but not in today&#39;s world where even our children are taught to get ahead you have to crush your opponents, use every angle you can come up with to win win win. this video is BULLSHIT and as far as im concerned show nothing more other then how to gamble and win more then lose....", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:24:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lpswishes", "comment_text": "What really happens when you die ?", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:24:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RKLMOVIES", "comment_text": "does it aplly to DayZ ?", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:24:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Will", "comment_text": "niqahiga just got rekt by sciene...", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:23:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Angela Black", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr6lsTgZKAQ&amp;t=3m48s\">3:48</a> blonde girl undergoes hand transformation", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:23:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "x y z", "comment_text": "Mitch forgot the arm on the blue girl at <a href=\"http://youtu.be/rr6lsTgZKAQ?t=3m38s\">3:38</a>", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T16:22:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Valperga Literature Review", "comment_text": "The video was completely off topic from the title.

Let&#39;s say in school, when you help someone in academic side, do you help them with the intention of helping them to improve, or with the intention of hoping they do the same approach in return? If it&#39;s the latter, then expect to be disappointed. Yes, you&#39;ll probably spend loads of extra time helping others while benefiting yourself little or none, but if you approach with the sincere mindset, you&#39;ll feel as if you&#39;ve not lost anything.

Yeah I know, sometimes there are people who aren&#39;t appreciative of our help and &quot;defect&quot; (maybe the person did something that&#39;s not so nice to you).
