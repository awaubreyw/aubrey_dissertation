In Florida it\u2019s almost impossible to find an outside ashtray in front of a business or restaurant etc. Guess what, it\u2019s not a deterrent to quit smoking, it\u2019s simply going on the ground. You have to apply some realistic logic. The \u201cfilters\u201d do indeed filter. They filter out a considerable amount of tar. Tobacco tar is the same tars you would find when people burn their leaves after raking. These tars are extremely irritating to the eyes, nose, throat and of course lungs. At least they do actually break down over time. Don\u2019t get me started on fast food styrofoam. I\u2019m sure you feel the same way. No one, absolutely no one should be smoking store bought cigarettes today. They are only composed of Aprox. 50% tobacco. The rest is chemically treated paper that is shredded to appear like tobacco. The majority of the absolute horror chemicals are found in the synthetic tobacco that is added. This is how manufacturers are able to play with nicotine levels creating higher addiction rates, added ammonia to help the lungs absorb nicotine, cut costs from having to fill the entire cigarette with tobacco and so much more. I started smoking at the very end of it being cool to smoke in the 1970\u2019s being just under 13 years old. Smoked 1-2 packs a day since I was 16. That\u2019s over 35 years for me. My lungs are completely shot, catching my breath just mowing the lawn is almost impossible and I\u2019m about to hit the point where people start oxygen. Still after all of this I just can\u2019t quit. Everyone is different but for so many of us it\u2019s virtually impossible. DO NOT EVER START! And for all those smokers out there, if you can\u2019t quite at least buy organic tobacco and make your own \u201cwith filters\u201d. You can make the equivalent to American Spirits for only 70 cents a pack and they don\u2019t taste nasty like the spirits do. Different blends of tobacco taste different just like coffee beans. Just say\u2019n... Great video, nice posts and comments have been left here too.

Secondly, and this is a bit more nit picky, but if you&#39;re going to use an example of &quot;half the fish dying in a tank&quot; then provide X number of fish in a tank holding XX gallons of water because 1 fish dying out of 2 in a 30 gallon tank doesn&#39;t mean diddly, but 10 fish out of 20 in a 30 gallon tank is a little more alarming until you bring in the type of fish as well and was it freshwater or saltwater? The devil&#39;s in the details and you provided nothing so your &quot;half fish&quot; example went nowhere and meant nothing.

Assuming public transportation drivers need to wait for them to finish a cigarette (my dad drives buses for a living, you wouldn&#39;t believe how many people called to complain because he left while they stood in front of the door because he needed to be on time and they wanted to finish their cigarette at their leisure). And, of course, littering with their cigarette butts (though I will admit some areas don&#39;t have nearly enough places to toss away any garbage, let alone cigarette butts).<br><br>Does that mean all smokers are awful? No, I know a few that are pretty considerate of things. But on average, majority are selfish assholes.

This may be controversial, so please do not reply unless it\u2019s important, but I know that\u2019s not stopping you. Anyways, I think cigarettes should be banned. Most people would probably agree with this. Anyways, they\u2019re banning ecigs because of a substance called THC, which is found in some drugs such as weed and marijuana. Some vapor pens do contain cbd, a chemical that relaxes the body, but at the moment deaths that were publicized have been mostly because of thc. Now thc isn\u2019t exactly legal yet, and therefore are a completely separate product from things such as vape pens, juul pens, and eliquids. When people \u201cvape\u201d thc products, it\u2019s basically disguising themselves to show that they\u2019re vaping, while they\u2019re basically doing weed. Many companies have suffered from this ban. Now how does any of this connect to cigarettes? Well, for a while now, many smokers have been going to ecigs and juul products in order to get the nicotine satisfaction they got while smoking. Originally, they were supposed to start lowering the amount of nic every month until they got to 0 by changing the eliquid and then throwing the juul away. Some people were able to quit both, some people are still hooked up on vaping, but either would probably be healthier than smoking. Now though, the people stuck on vaping will go back to smoking, and the people planning to start vaping to stop smoking will keep smoking, therefore raising the death tolls and amount of people in poverty. More people in poverty would mean less people buying from any business in order to keep buying cigarettes. That\u2019d also mean more people robbing both big and small companies, therefore hurting the businesses. I know this turned into a 5 paragraph essay real quick but I had to get my opinion out.
