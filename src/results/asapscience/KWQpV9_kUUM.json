There is no benefit to putting this poison in body, absolutely none. It is a toxin for your and a complete waste to buy and consume.

In every single advertisement to do with alcohol, it always someone who is looking in great shape and the person probably doesn&#39;t drink pretending they are having a great time and in a nice place etc. All complete bs , when they don&#39;t say that alcohol is one the leading causes of cancer in the world.

Here&#39;s the thing, if you take like five shots in the span of 30 mins to try and get to your ideal state of drunkenness really fast, you&#39;re gonna enjoy it for like 30 mins-1 hour, and then you&#39;re gonna have to wait out several hours of being messy, tired, irritable, dehydrated, nauseous etc. A drink of alcohol, like this video says, produces excitement and euphoria but it quickly morphs into something else. The solution, is to pace yourself, and to continue drinking throughout the day/night. Take a couple shots at once, then enjoy the buzz, and when the bad feelings start coming on, take another shot, repeat those steps. Of course the shots will eventually catch up to you and if you do this consistently on the hour you&#39;ll probably end up being pretty shitfaced in which case you should just go to sleep before you get really out of hand. It&#39;s no fun to be super drunk. But yeah, drinking more slowly and pacing yourself consistently makes for a more enjoyable experience. The whole night will feel more or less like the first drink. And sometimes you feel really good without having to take another drink for a couple hours, which is great. Hold onto it as long as you can until you need to drink more. I notice that even nausea is paradoxically helped by drinking more, it&#39;s like each fresh shot makes your body think of the drug as something fun, but leaving your body to process alcohol from a while ago makes your body think of it as a poison, making you feel sick. Also, along these same lines, hair of the dog is a fantastic hangover remedy. Be careful though because this is how many people can easily become alcoholics, but the point stands, if you&#39;re super hung over, just drink a light alcoholic drink like a beer or two.", "comment_date": "2022-02-21T18:23:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fun videos", "comment_text": "You are not going to succeed", "comment_date": "2022-02-21T00:35:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YOUNG DREAM CHASER", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve never been drunk but I get high every u", "comment_date": "2022-02-21T00:30:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Swagners Secondary", "comment_text": "I just drank a mikes hard, sorry", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T23:50:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jackie mwaura", "comment_text": "Watching this while drunk", "comment_date": "2022-02-19T12:31:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe George", "comment_text": "Very funny... enjoyed the video and am educated at the same time.", "comment_date": "2022-02-17T06:09:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diego", "comment_text": "Ron Bielecki can relate to this", "comment_date": "2022-02-16T13:51:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "p", "comment_text": "Amazing \ud83e\udd2f", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T17:52:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keykey One23", "comment_text": "Lost a friend who was 24 to heavy drinking \ud83e\udd7a", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T06:45:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ken 9000", "comment_text": "Lmfao", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T04:32:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jamie", "comment_text": "Forget alcohol the UK should legalise cannabis just like America has done.

Make a Plan<br>Make a plan to stop drinking alcohol by setting a date. Post the date in a place where you can see it often. If you are a heavy drinker, you must first slowdown in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms which can be potentially deadly (in this case, involve your doctor in your plan in order to come up with a more appropriate date plan).<br><br>2. Identify the Triggers<br>The urge to drink alcohol is set off either by internal or external triggers. The key to quit drinking and maintaining sobriety is by identifying and avoiding the triggers. External triggers, such as places, people and things that are associated with alcohol drinking behaviors and opportunities can quickly lead to a relapse. High risk situations are more obvious, more predictable and are more avoidable compared to internal triggers.<br><br>Internal triggers are set off by thoughts, negative emotions such as frustrations, positive emotions like excitement, physical sensations like headache, anxiety and tension. Once you have identified the triggers, work on how to prevent them from leading you to drinking.<br><br>3. Avoid High Risk Situations<br>The best strategy to quit drinking is avoiding high risk situations. Avoid social settings where alcohol is served. Do not buy or keep alcohol at home as this will easily tempt you.

To state or imply otherwise is pure misinformation! These two hosts keep pushing misinformation about alcohol, caffeine, marijuana and mushrooms on this disgrace of a so called &quot;science&quot; channel! Stop giving young people misinformation that aids in their rationalizing the use of these aforementioned insidious drugs!<br>Just for starters:<br>20 reasons not to drink alcohol\r<br>Can cause alcoholism \u2013 If you don\u2019t drink, you can\u2019t become alcoholic, simple. If someone has an addictive personality, this can be especially bad. It is also a bad idea to drink lots to forget painful experiences as that usually leads to alcohol dependence, which usually leads to full-blown alcohol addiction. So no drink = no alcohol dependence = no alcoholism.\r<br>Can cause weight gain \u2013 Just one single 12-ounce beer, or a five-ounce glass of wine, or a 1.5-ounce shot of liquor has about 150 calories. That is a lot of calories for something that adds no nutrition to your body. Talk about empty calories! If you are working on improving your health, drinking really is not a good idea \u2013 for a lot more reasons than just this, reasons not to drink alcohol, as we will look at below.\r<br>Makes you age faster \u2013 The pressure alcohol puts on your body\u2019s internal organs leads to ageing faster. If you have ever seen an alcoholic who looks much older than their age (as is usually the case), now you know why. If you want to age better and live a long healthy life, drinking needs to be moderated, if not cut out altogether.\r<br>Disrupts sleep \u2013 Alcohol negatively impacts the quality of your sleep. You might think that it helps you sleep, but the quality of the sleep you get on alcohol is not good quality sleep. Passing out is not quality sleep.\r<br>Can worsen memory and ability to learn \u2013 Drinking alcohol regularly for a long time worsens your brain\u2019s capacity to process information, which means your memory gets worse, as does your ability to learn things. Definitely not good if you are committed to personal development and want to get better through the span of your life. So if you want to have the memory of a 30-year-old when you are 60, you need to rethink your drinking habit. This is a pretty big reasons not to drink alcohol.\r<br>Can cause chronic brain disorders \u2013 This is one of the most worrying impacts of long-term drinking. As mentioned earlier, long-term drinking impairs your brain\u2019s ability to process information. But it doesn\u2019t just stop there \u2013 according to the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, even just one or two drinks over time can lead to blurred vision, slurred speech, slower reaction times, impaired memory, loss of balance, and chronic brain disorders.\r<br>Can cause high blood pressure \u2013 The more you drink, the higher your blood pressure will be. So if you struggle with high blood pressure, cutting out alcohol is one of the most effective ways to lower your blood pressure. So, high blood pressure is yet another reason not to drink alcohol.\r<br>Often leads to bad hangovers \u2013 How many of you have experienced a bad hangover after a night of drinking? If you have, you know just how terrible it feels the next morning. Most people who experience hangovers know how bad it feels, so save yourself the pain and drink in moderation. Even better, skip the drinks altogether!\r<br>Can impair judgment \u2013 Often people do the stupidest things when they are drunk. We all have friends who did something incredibly stupid, even downright dangerous because they weren\u2019t thinking properly as a result of being drunk. So a surefire way to stop yourself from doing something you will regret is to not get drunk.\r<br>Increases risk of cancer \u2013 Studies have found that alcohol is a carcinogen, i.e. it increases the risk of getting cancer. The more you drink, the higher will your risk be of getting cancer.\r<br>Can lead to liver problems \u2013 Liver problems are one of the most known side effects of drinking alcohol, with liver cirrhosis (a serious liver condition) often being the end result. The longer (and more) someone drinks, the worse their liver gets. But there is good news \u2013 our livers are very resilient and start to heal when you stop drinking. So if you want a better liver, rethink your drinking habit.\r<br>Can cause heart problems \u2013 Drinking alcohol often leads to heart problems, including alcoholic cardiomyopathy, hemorrhagic stroke, and heart rhythm disturbances.\r<br>Can cause birth defects \u2013 Pregnancy and alcohol are a terrible combination. Alcohol has been shown to harm unborn babies, and can also cause complications during pregnancy. Children of pregnant women who drink are at extremely high risk of being born with fetal alcohol syndrome. \r<br>Can cause muscle cramps \u2013 Drinking alcohol regularly can cause muscle cramps, which often gets worse as people continue drinking. So if you experience muscle cramps, staying off the booze can be a really good idea.\r<br>Can lead to accidents \u2013 We all know about the dangers of drinking and driving. There are some very good reasons why driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal. It\u2019s not just dangerous for you but is also dangerous for your loved ones, as well as other people.\r<br>Can trigger traumatic memories \u2013 Often alcohol can bring up negative memories, even traumatic memories, which is bad because when you are under the influence of alcohol you are really not in a place to process such memories in a healthy way. This can cause a whole host of problems. This can be a recipe for disaster. A lot of suicides have resulted because of such reactions\u2026\r<br>Can increase mental health issues like depression \u2013 Some people drink alcohol when they feel down or depressed. But what this usually does is cause a momentary boost, but then a slump, which often leads to drinking continuously. If you are feeling down or depressed, drinking is really not a good idea.\r<br>Can increase stress and anxiety levels \u2013 Alcohol affects different people in different ways, but for most, it does not have a calming, mellowing effect. Most people actually feel more stressed and anxious after drinking alcohol. If you want to properly deal with stress and anxiety, mindfulness is a great place to start. Learning about these 3 types of meditation (tutorials included) can also help. \r<br>Can be a gateway to worse things like hard drugs \u2013 People who drink are far more likely to use hard drugs than people who don\u2019t drink. Pretty potent reasons not to drink alcohol.\r<br>Alcohol is expensive \u2013 Alcohol is not cheap. Even the cheapest alcohol can make a real dent in your budget if you drink regularly. There are far better things to spend your money on, like travel, or having an interesting experience. That\u2019s as a reason as any for not drinking alcohol, won\u2019t you say? Rather than spending your money on alcohol, save it to spend it something you will really love and cherish.", "comment_date": "2021-05-20T01:51:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "cynsen", "comment_text": "My days of drinking are far over.
