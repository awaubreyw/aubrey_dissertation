Plant based diets are also proven to lower testosterone levels. If meat made men weaker and less fertile then explain to me why the levels started dropping in 1981, which is almost exactly when the vegg-heads started claiming meat was unhealthy and people started eating less of it and ate more carbs and process food. All the studies about meat causing heart disease have all been debunked and we now know the funding for those studies came from the sugar industry, which is the real poison in our food.

We are killing the world and every other being that thrives here with us as we live, we are a plague, a virus if you will. <br><br>your existence doesn&#39;t mean nothing, OUR existence only means destruction. the world will end before 2050, generation Z is our last generation. if any of you people are dumb enough to think the world is going to end due to weather or a giant space rock, you&#39;re a imbecile. war will be the end of humanity,  first ACTUAL world hunger strikes, people panic, and everyone&#39;s peace treaties and agreements will go out the window. As soon as we breach the worlds population, somebody&#39;s gonna have to pull the trigger and we all fall. Since we&#39;re a stubborn, stupid, yet intelligent race, somebody will and when they do, this so called &quot;intelligent race&quot; is going to shoot nukes back and forth into extinction. Nobody&#39;s going to give anyone a pat on the back for blowing up another country, even if there is a REAL crisis happening. We&#39;re all just gonna get mad at each other like the bunch of dumb animals we are and kill each other.  WE ARE THE APOCALYPSE. <br><br><br><br>Either we nuke ourselves our a huge war is happening within the next 20 years, buckle up fellas.", "comment_date": "2021-11-02T19:37:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "handsomedude", "comment_text": "Still happy to have a 6 inch", "comment_date": "2021-11-02T17:44:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anton Eriksson", "comment_text": "Your videos make me depressed\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2021-11-02T15:58:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antonio Caire", "comment_text": "yooooo not to brag here, but with all these in my life i still make a big mess, imagine a homosapiens LOLLLLLL they must had a real big load since they were never exposed to any of these", "comment_date": "2021-11-02T14:33:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arjay Bautista", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s go 4 inch gang, we gotta reduce plastic use \ud83d\ude24", "comment_date": "2021-11-02T12:30:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "The Jokes on you", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude2f\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-11-02T11:00:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "5inchDude", "comment_text": "Mine Is shrinking out of existence \ud83d\ude4d", "comment_date": "2021-11-02T10:37:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gainz Creed", "comment_text": "I stay in sweet watery guts.", "comment_date": "2021-11-02T06:39:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Barry McCockner", "comment_text": "My brother is the manliest dude I know, super blunt blue color business owner, busts his back working 6 days a week, yet when he was trying to have kids, doctors said his testosterone levels were low.

We need to pull our financial support from big multi-national corporations and give it to people like you and I that make healthy products for our use. We need to step away from corporations and return to the day of small mom-and-pop artisanal shops/producers. <br><br>These efforts require ZERO intervention from government and ZERO regulation. Do these things first, as a People, before determining if government regulation is the way to go. <br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lessgovernment\">#LessGovernment</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23morepersonalresponsibility\">#MorePersonalResponsibility</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23libertarianism\">#Libertarianism</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nonaggression\">#NonAggression</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23voluntaryism\">#Voluntaryism</a>", "comment_date": "2021-05-29T14:06:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S0ULT241N", "comment_text": "You know what else started in 1960 putting soy in everything we eat.

I have never formed an opinion on a subject just because one political party has it on their agenda. I look up the information myself and make my own decisions based on what I think will be better for the world as a whole. Think for yourself people.

However, when cosmetics companies get pressured by consumers to go phthalate-free, they may get rid of DEP and replace it with another ingredient that isn&#39;t as extensively studied, and so for all we know might actually be more harmful than DEP.

Do we know the vectors of absorption in surface absorbed contact and/or ingested contents?<br><br>So far I&#39;m hearing how the packaging includes the EDCs, but then we jump to studies about EDC impacts after introduction to the body. This leaves out the counter-claim that things like the phthalates are too tightly bound in the chemistry of the packaging at normal temperatures. If they are tightly chemically bonded then they would not leech, or leech at such low levels as to not matter, even if the quantities that matter are themselves very low. Anything below a line that matters is below a line of concern.<br><br>In order to point to plastic packaging or utensils as a source of ingested EDCs you need to show the mechanisms that 1) get the EDCs out of the plastics into the contents, 2) the concentrations of these transfers, 3) the length of time or number of repeated ingestions, all to get to &quot;in a given period of time the average human ingests n quantities of EDCs.&quot; Then we can talk about the likelihood and level of impacts from that vector.<br><br>Certainly, those working in industrial processes that include phthalates will be exposed to the chemicals in a less contained form. They do not represent the risk of the general population. They are exposed to a particular situation that is known to have higher risk. What might matter there is improved safety measures or, better, new chemical products that don&#39;t use these known-harmful products.<br><br>For the general population, we live immersed in a modern, chemically-laden society with many many types of exposure that might be additive, leading to what looks like the impact of one thing, but might actually be a compound impact from many.<br><br>Show us the path and the mechanisms that the get the EDCs from plastic to human, and in what concentrations over what time, and what concentrations might build up in what tissues for how long in the body, so that we can then look to the levels we <i>know</i> cause harm. That&#39;s the smoking gun, and it&#39;s not included here when you jump from &quot;plastics have these&quot; to &quot;and this is what they do to our bodies.&quot; You gotta prove the between, otherwise it&#39;s just correlation.<br><br>And I expect there to be <i>some</i> level of leeching, and <i>some</i> amount of subsequent ingestion, but like so many things it&#39;s the discrete quantity and the quantities over time that matter.

I understand that you are probably reporting this from the book, but you also need to do your research. There are NO studies that directly link red meat or even nitrates (yes in large amounts fed to rats!) to low sperm count and no mechanism to explain it neither. All of them are from epidemiological studies and with both healthy user bias and weak RR and confounding factors including what those people actually ate together with the bacon, sausages and red meat.. in a burger, pizza, with lots of refined carbs and sugary sauces topped with beer and coke perhaps. <br><br>I have no arguments with the plastics and other chemical sources, but if we still think about it, what are we eating differently over the past 100 years? More refined carbs and refined sugars, lower fat, more processed plant foods, more ultra processed foods and more vegetable seeds oils. Hmmm.. I wonder why sperm count drops over the years. As to endocrine disruptors phytoestrogens is one of them and they are in soy products. True, normal consumption of soy product should have not great impact, but what if they are refined and packed into ultra processed foods and vegan products? What are we not talking about plant toxicity and blaming everything on meat with no strong evidences?<br><br>Furthermore, there are anecdotal evidences within keto + carnivore community of better sexual health after remove vegetable seeds oil and carbs/sugars and for some, plants entirely. How do you square that with avoiding red meat? Of course this is not scientific only because no big food or big pharma will ever pay to have such research done, that it why we cannot find such studies yet.

Should we as individuals be held accountable for what we put into our bodies or should corporations and governments be held responsible. Because if governments and corporations are held responsible for using plastics that lower sperm counts, then they should also be held accountable for the fast food they\u2019re selling us and the pesticides they\u2019re using and the pollution they\u2019re generating and the addictions they\u2019ve given us to caffeine and alcohol and and and. I mean yeah, I suppose they are to blame at least somewhat for the ills of the world, so yes we should hold them accountable. But at the same time, at what point do we just decide to treat ourselves better? At what point does it come down to us to take control of our health even if we\u2019re given the option not to? <br><br>But to be fair, it\u2019s not like we really have a choice in this instance. I mean what food isn\u2019t packaged at some point? Which phones or toys or whatever you buy doesn\u2019t contain some kind of plastic? And if companies decide to make that choice available, you know it will be more expensive. So will that choice be available to the poor? No, it won\u2019t. <br><br>But if we want everyone to have access to this stuff, then we have to make everything available to everyone and then there\u2019s no economic class stratification and there\u2019s no reason for anyone to do anything... <br><br>Maybe on subjects concerning health, we can socialize things a bit more, although you could argue that everything relates to people\u2019s health so to avoid going full communism, you\u2019d have to draw a line somewhere. But yeah, maybe the health industry shouldn\u2019t be an industry. Maybe our tax money should be our health insurance and we\u2019d just incentivize research by outsourcing it to private industries. But maybe not. Will there be any edge to our research capacity and speed if there\u2019s no competition? I don\u2019t know, but probably not. But at the same time, maybe everyone would be able to take advantage of the healthcare we can provide now. There wouldn\u2019t be any variation in how healthcare was provided, but at least everyone would get some of it. <br><br>My point is that it\u2019s complicated. I\u2019m not sure what the most effective way to treat this problem and any other problem facing our society.
