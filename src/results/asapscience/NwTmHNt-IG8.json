He told me that he was talking about nike shoes and later , a YouTube video showed him a Nike ad. Now, I explained to him what cookies were and he promised me he never typed anything about Nike , it was all voice. Anyways, this guy was a drunk and I ignored him. Here is where my story gets kind of scary. A week later, we were driving the truck and he was telling me a bunch of truckers from our company stole a box of grey goose vodka. Later that day, we stopped off for popeyes and we connected our Bluetooth speaker to listen to music on YouTube while we ate. I was shocked when a grey goose ad came up on the phone. We never typed grey goose anywhere, it was all speech from me and my partner. So I can conformed this wasn\u2019t cookies. I\u2019m a skeptic , so I ruled this as coincidence.  3 months passed and I left the trucking company. One day , I was in the kitchen with my mom and we were discussing plans for a family vacation to Las Vegas . Later that evening, I went on YouTube and when I saw the ad, I was shocked . It was an ad about Las Vegas . Here is when I started to trip out . Please keep in mind  that I verified that I never typed anything involving the ads. So it wasn\u2019t cookies.  Anyways I ignored it.<br><br>Today was a shocking day for me and now I\u2019m here on this video. Read at your own risk .  <br><br>I was driving around ,kind of hyped up on an energy drink. I decided to stop by a convenience store and grab some candy. The guy working there was Indian and I always go there. I usually put on an Indian accent on purpose and we would both laugh at it. Anyways, I grabbed some maynards since I\u2019ve never tried them before. I looked at the Indian cashier and put on my fake Indian accent ..I was like \u201cbuddy, you want the maynards\u201d and we both began to laugh <br><br>It\u2019s now 10:21 pm and 15 minutes ago, I saw a YouTube ad on maynards. I\u2019ve never seen a YouTube ad on maynards before and now 90% sure something fishy is going on .

I&#39;ll be speaking about anything, and I&#39;ll even get sms adverts in that moment. I&#39;ll get the first option from Google searched of something I was speaking about 5 seconds ago. It&#39;s all the time.<br><br>Look I understand, these companies they can&#39;t exactly come out and freak everyone and say yes, our alorithyms pick up key words and light up on advertisers lists. That would be an outrage, people would be fuming.<br><br>But Google definitely does listen to what you&#39;re speaking about. I&#39;m not being paid by Google, I&#39;m not working for Google, I&#39;m going to speak the truth.<br><br>No, it doesn&#39;t freak me out. Because for me it&#39;s harmless. It&#39;s advertisers using consumers in their most vulnerable points when they are speaking about buying something, they&#39;ll more likely buy it. I get it.<br><br>I do see however, it can be creepy to some people and maybe even dangerous. Let&#39;s not forget, Mark Zuckerberg himself tapes and closes his laptops camera and microphone. So obviously, I mean let&#39;s just for one second stop being in denial. They listen to you. But let&#39;s not freak out about it either because right now it&#39;s just used for advertising. Not spying or whatever (well at least that&#39;s what I think). I honestly don&#39;t think there&#39;s someone recording every word you say, that would be so much data to store on the servers and unnecessary.<br><br>I mean if the technology gets into the wrong hands they could probably be using it to listen to VIP&#39;s conversations. Maybe that&#39;s something to worry about. But I&#39;m your average Joe. I don&#39;t really need Google to stop listening to me speaking about The Bachelor.

For one, they only point out negative things about all the uses for the technologies around you (and this is used to persuade you to buy the VPN that sponsored the video).<br><br>Of course if your phone has a microphone, it&#39;s going to be used somehow. It could possibly be used against you in many ways, but at the same time, you can&#39;t call someone or record a memo without it.<br><br>There are obvious disadvantages to using tech that can pose security risks, but it isn&#39;t right to make a video that only paints this shocking image of how the tech around you is already being used against you. Your phone can be just as insecure as your home or car. There are two sides to every story, and I think this video only shows one side to create controversy, gain clicks, and in the end make money.<br><br>They think they can profit from getting lots of views and scaring uninformed people (that likely don&#39;t know much about tech). Thay would see the video and immediately think, &quot;Wow, I should probably get a VPN now because that&#39;s what they recommended after talking about all the scary technologies.&quot; Besides if they wanted to offer a genuine solution to all the possible spying, they would have told you to completely disconnect from the internet and go live deep in a cave in the middle of nowhere.<br><br>If you wish to actually have more protection from the many flaws that exist everywhere in all forms of technology, I would suggest that you do more research on your own. From there, you can figure out a viable option that actually works to secure you without being too much of a hassle or an expense.

When companies put a billboard ad up, they pick the area they&#39;re putting it in based on what people who would see it would be likely to buy. Driving down a lonely highway in the middle of Kansas, you see an ad for a gas station and a McDonalds right next to each other. When they guy commercials on TV, they choose what show to put them in based on who watches that show. If you&#39;re watching Nickelodeon, you&#39;ll see toy ads, but if you&#39;re watching Fox and Friends, you&#39;ll see the catheder cowboy. That&#39;s all targeted advertising based on what you&#39;re likely to buy, and it makes the advertising space more valuable. Google and Facebook have the tools to do so more efficiently, but if your cookies say you&#39;re likely to buy swimsuits, it&#39;s probably true. And that&#39;s a good thing: it means that content creators who rely on that ad revenue (like you guys with this sponsorship) can make more money because the viewers are seeing more ads that are relevant to them. It&#39;s a win-win situation, as long as each side bends a little: the viewer needs to accept that ads need to know what you&#39;re likely to buy, and the advertiser needs to accept reasonably privacy restrictions.

You do use an encryption protocol (typically WPA2 these days) for wi-fi, but the way the video is trying to explain is not exactly how it works.<br>Perhaps you were trying to simplify the idea, or explain it in a different way, but it&#39;s really confusing and not very accurate;<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwTmHNt-IG8&amp;t=3m13s\">3:13</a> - Then, you talk about the Internet becoming easier to hack when it moved from wired to wireless technology... because encryption is typically simpler? One could arguably say it became easier to hack... or perhaps the scale and number of ways to hack opened up. I&#39;m not sure if saying it became easier to hack is completely true though, pre-wireless Internet was completely different.<br>But if it is, it&#39;s not because encryption is typically simpler... as it&#39;s quite the opposite. <br>Wireless communications are easier to hack because of how it essencially works: your wireless device needs to broadcast signal (thus data) around for data transmission... much like radio. It&#39;s encrypted and have other security features so that not everyone with an antenna is able to capture and understand your data right away, but it&#39;s still being broadcasted so access is just easier. And if the encryption fails, then it becomes easier to exploit.<br>It doesn&#39;t have a physical direct channel like copper or fiber optic cables, so it&#39;s inherently easier to capture data in between. Better analogy would be radio waves versus say... cable TV from the station to your home.<br>But quite the opposite, encryption actually became way more complex and sophisticated when wireless started getting widely adopted exactly because of the needs of wireless, so non sequitur.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwTmHNt-IG8&amp;t=3m25s\">3:25</a> - Remote access tools - they are unrelated to wireless communications because they existed before widespread wireless usage - so there is no relationship about simple encryption on wireless and this part -,  it&#39;s not necessarily a hack because the term is generally used for software that enables remote access to computers and other devices, which is widely used by people working with computers - like server administrators, remote support, etc.<br>A remote access tool can be used for legitimate purposes... software like TeamViewer for instance. I think there is a term for the specific malicious version though... Remote access trojan if I&#39;m not mistaken, in reference to a wider category of hacking tools known as trojan horses (as well as the greek tale of course). But remote access trojans have no relationship to wireless vulnerabilities...<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwTmHNt-IG8&amp;t=3m33s\">3:33</a> - Saying the FBI uses phishing is correct, but not very complete information... the FBI uses multiple techniques for mass surveillance, spying and specific targetting. <br>Phishing is the name for a broad category of techniques that tries to fool a target with malicious content disguised to look like an authentic file or service. It&#39;s commonly used by malicious actors to steal information.<br>It can be carried through e-mail or instant messaging, and it can contain links for malware but it can also just present a fake page to collect information (say your Facebook login and password, or your banking information). But there are actually multiple categories of phishing each with it&#39;s own characteristics.<br><br>Finally, I should point out that while VPNs are legit tools for privacy and security to a point, they are specifically not good for exactly some of the hacks and attacks described on the video. :P<br>VPNs estabilishes an encrypted and secure channel between your connection and the service&#39;s servers, which is good to prevent stuff like man in the middle attacks, ISP spying, and regional blocking. But you are still subject to phishing, remote access trojans, and if you have some smartphone app surreptiously capturing audio, video and gps information that stuff will still go through.", "comment_date": "2018-06-07T17:20:43Z", "likes_count": 112}, {"comment_by": "NANO TheFruit", "comment_text": "Who likes the previous voice more?", "comment_date": "2018-06-07T17:20:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Lane", "comment_text": "Sensationalist scaremongering!
