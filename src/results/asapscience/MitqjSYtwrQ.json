Why does everyone transition to one of the &quot;traditionally accepted&quot; two genders?   i.e. &quot;male / female&quot; ?\r<br>\r<br>Which brings up a more practical question,  \r<br>- understanding that transgender individuals do not accept the outdated premise that physical anatomy determines or correlates to gender, \r<br>but rather they believe it is what a person senses and feels and understands about themselves, at a deeper level, i.e. their actual gender,  \r<br>that determines their true gender, not how they look anatomically.  \r<br>\r<br>So, given this understanding, \r<br>- why would a transgendering person undergo anatomical surgeries in order to conform to the outdated non-transgender-view that they don&#39;t accept? \r<br>i.e.  outdated view = that anatomy DOES INDEED correlate to gender?  \r<br>\r<br>In other words, if anatomy has nothing to do with determining gender scientifically, \r<br>then why go to all the painful surgical procedures in order to march to the beat \r<br>of the non-transgender views, i.e. that anatomy DOES correlate with gender?  \r<br>\r<br>The trans community should just tell the non-trans community to &quot;stick it&quot; and tell them - &quot;we don&#39;t need to conform to YOUR belief that &#39;anatomy=gender correlation&#39;. &quot;  Rather than reinforcing the non-trans&#39; traditional belief system.\r<br>A trans person knows what their gender IS regardless of how their body looks.  \r<br>So why go to the trouble to satisfy and conform to the cultural &quot;norms&quot; of what a female or male gender should look like?\r<br>\r<br>By having surgeries to appear what the world considers a true male or female only reinforces the world&#39;s errant views about gender.  \r<br>\r<br>The non-trans community will logically say... &quot; See, the trans-person knows deep within that their gender needs to correspond to the &quot;CORRECT anatomy&quot;  surrounding their gender.  They know that gender and anatomy ARE connected just as we understand it.

So it could be people just try to change who they are because they dont like the person they\u2019ve become or they don\u2019t want to be the person that sufferef from trauma. They might also subcontiously seek attention and want to show people theres something bothering them (they themselves dont realise that) <br>Its what i think and i dont want to hurt anyones feelings so please dont hurt mine.

You&#39;re also validating and giving somebody what they believe they need so of course there&#39;s going to be a positive increase In the short term of their mood or happiness. <br><br>The suicide rates are so high because because gender dysphoria is a disorder.  And psychological disorders are usually accompanied by anxiety depression and suicidal thoughts. And the reason they actually don&#39;t get better after transition, It&#39;s because you never addressed the root psychological issues that caused the disphoria in the 1st place. <br><br> This video is clearly geared towards children. This is really dangerous. Gender identity or desphoria in the past 10 years has gone from 0.002% to / 2% of people.  The leading demographic over 10 years ago was men, Who had a long history from early childhood of persistent signs of this dysphoria.  Strangely enough now the leading demographic that identifies as trans is teenage girls \ud83e\udd14.  What happened to all those adults that were being oppressed years ago That couldn&#39;t come out as trans . Why would they stop being the demographic now that we&#39;re more accepting and we have this massive increase in people coming out. Why would the demographic completely change ?  People say the population increase is due to trans people feeling like they can come out now. But then this thing just said that the suicide rate amongst transpeople is so high I because we&#39;re not accepting of them today.

It\u2019s more so ideological than actual science? Also there\u2019s a lot of screwing if statistics that aren\u2019t being mentioned in these cases and further scientific analysis into the actual development of x and y development. Again it all depends and a lot of these scientific studies aren\u2019t fully published as full fledge causation just because of  first studied based observations which again the study group and subjects in the matter is still too small to determine a lot of the claims being made. <br><br>Finally I have nothing against trans people in society they should be proud of themselves as I tell everyone be proud of who you are not what you are. Sometimes less thought on matters help people with depression and the claims made about suicide are very misleading especially considering we live in a post trans acceptance society. It\u2019s pushed so heavily that if you have any form of criticism of anyone who might be trans your automatically labeled a horrible person for criticizing someone not because their trans but for many other things. Society will throw you under a moving bus if they hear any of this and funny thing is that the claims about suicide in the video is dishonest. Maybe for your own personal case that might be the cause of your depression but actual scientific studies says a completely different reason for the suicide rates. <br><br>Finally i want to make this clear. I love all communities of people. But being dishonest and manipulative with scientific information to a political level when literally most things in recent years been more so politically motivated instead of scientifically motivated that supports anything for the trans community. There is so many flaws in many of the arguments let alone the fact that there were no author of said sources, no statistics to help people see how often cases like this occurs, or even the sample size of said sources in their scientific research. I am someone who wants everyone happy in life but there is too much that we don\u2019t know about the trans issues that manifested into mainstream focus in modern day lighting on a scientific level and for what we do know there is so much political pushback that prevents any scientific voices to be said properly. <br><br>For example we don\u2019t know if the development of the trans formation could cause later psychological dysphoria as the brain ages and matures due to the structural differences. <br>We don\u2019t know if the body will have negative backlash on itself from puberty age development that caused major amounts of chemicals in the body to spiral out of control we don\u2019t know if physically the body becomes immobilized or even cardiac-arrest from an overdose of chemicals released in the brain. Again i am not disrespecting the trans community because everyone\u2019s anatomy and chemistry within their body is different not a single persons body is the same in both operation and  in development. What I am saying is that coming from the trans community often say they know what they want for themselves most of all. Well that\u2019s good and all but what\u2019s good for your body isn\u2019t always what you think is good. For example when a cocaine addict suffers withdraws they often relay on cocain addiction to keep themselves Feeling well again. While it\u2019s not like an external substance that we think like drugs or chemicals but just like drags the chemicals that are released in our brains give off emotional values and specific actions give off specific chemical reactions giving those emotional patterns. Well when your brain has forms of disfunction in its development you have cases where different chemicals like dopamine, OxyContin, Ketamine, Norepinephrine, Serotonin, etc. we don\u2019t have any way as of current to study if the development of transgenderism is actually biological all the way through the genitalia or is development within the brains of these individuals. We have constant contradicting claims and the laziest claim that I\u2019ve ever heard is \u201cit\u2019s pointless to look into this far into the problem because it doesn\u2019t help the problem\u201d. That is disgustingly untrue to claim and make the argument about because there is so many things doctors need to do to make sure you the patient is perfectly healthy. If your not healthy than there is a huge problem happening. To claim that it\u2019s offensive to be called by specific medical terms than I\u2019m sorry but you shouldn\u2019t use emotional justification to refuse the diagnosis of a medical professional especially if there is a high possibility that your emotions might be caused by the issue you came to the doctor about. <br><br>Ps medical services can\u2019t ever legally turn away any patient on the bases of discrimination. If you act disorderly within their family or medical practice than they do have a right to have you removed or refuse you service. <br>While I respect anyone who earned their respect from me I won\u2019t automatically show respect to any stranger.

To say &#39;(biological) men have larger hippocami&quot; means that an average, men have larger hippocampi on average relative to their brain size. This is true. And when they say similar things about (biological) woman&#39;s brains this is also a statement of differences in average among that group. <br><br>Now we test 100 trans women&#39;s brains and compare them to the average of biological males brains. We find that trans women do in fact have averages lower than bio males, closer to &#39;real&#39; females. This is ALL fine!<br> <br>BUT to say that that average brain mass difference is evidence that those people ARE in fact, &#39;actually female&#39; is hard to define. Are we saying a man is defined by how closely the relative size of structures in his brian match up to the average male?<br><br>What if a cis Male&#39;s brain scan perfectly matches up with that of the female brain averages!! Is he actually trans and unaware if it? Or is he a man with smaller relative brain structures? The issue here is that relative sizes/ densities of components of the brain is NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH INFO to put a scientific finger on what gender actually IS. <br><br>If you ask me, I don&#39;t think gender is anything other than this:certains behaviors we associate with &#39;maleness&#39; and &#39;femaleness&#39;.

That to look upon a woman or man in admiration of their respective traits is to be, by default, intolerant or \u201ctoxic\u201d because it\u2019s an acknowledgment and appreciation of the binary. That we must believe that men and women are wholly interchangeable and that our biological determinants hold absolutely no bearing on aspects such as gender identity, expressions, and roles. I do not believe that, and science is exemplifying such distinctions and is challenging the politically correct, idealistic narrative that gender is exclusively a societal and cultural construct by demonstrating that male and female brains and the manner in which they function, are in fact, different. And found within those differences exist certain behavioral and emotional proclivities that tend to manifest in the aforementioned aspects such as identity, expressions and roles. Not without exception obviously, but I believe it holds valid as a general truism.

And when/if  you try and force your way into a public bathroom with my bride and young girls,  claiming to be a woman when you are not and never will be, and someone objects, then you either better get out fast or live the dream of becoming a martyr to stupidity. <br>That said I do not believe people who claim to be &#39;trans&#39; should be killed or hurt; live and let live. Indeed if I had my way, people who think they are this &#39;trans&#39; nonsense should be TREATED and HELPED as FULLY as possible!

This is driven by psychology which is derived from both biology and experience - thus the near infinite diversity.&quot;\r<br>Also known as &quot;personality&quot;.  You don&#39;t have to call it a different gender every time someone differs in how they think, feel, and behave.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;I know I have a woman&#39;s mind because no matter how anyone has taught, explained, hypnotically suggested or commanded, I cannot think differently than I do.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>So certain things about your personality cannot be changed.  Doesn&#39;t mean you have &quot;a woman&#39;s mind&quot;.  Again, how do you even know what having a woman&#39;s mind vs. having a man&#39;s mind feels like?  For all you know, they feel the exact same, and the only way men and women ever feel differently is through biological causes.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;My thoughts and emotions cause distress because they don&#39;t fit this body&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Again, gender roles.  You are not obligated to think or feel particular ways just because you&#39;re a man.  Tons of men out there &quot;think like a woman&quot; or &quot;have emotions like a woman&quot; (and I put these in quotations because I still find the idea sexist to begin with) and yet &quot;identify&quot; as men because they understand that the distinction is the realm of biology.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;A few examples include: I have always wanted soft, smooth curves and to be a mother.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>So you are <b>unhappy</b> with your gender.  That&#39;s unfortunate.  But it doesn&#39;t change or affect reality, and I think the sooner you acknowledge that the better your changes of accepting that gender so you can move on to asking the better questions:\r<br>Why do you want to be a mother?  What do mothers do?  How do they contribute to their children/society?  Isn&#39;t it entirely possible to fulfill those needs (which are indeed important) as a man?\r<br>\r<br>&quot;I&#39;m highly empathetic toward others.  I don&#39;t understand the intrigue with sports or porn.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Same here x3.  But I know that doesn&#39;t make me any less of a man.  Also, plenty of <b>women</b> (who &quot;identify&quot; as women) lack empathy, love sports and watch pornography.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;I am isolated from most men because I am so different psychologically and isolated from most women because I am so different biologically. Etc.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Story of my life!  And I&#39;m not just saying that.  My friend, I don&#39;t even know how to change a tire.  I know pretty much none of the things men are expected to know, and the only stereotypically &quot;guy thing&quot; I&#39;m into are video games.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;To make my thoughts and emotions fit my body requires barbaric &quot;brainwashing&quot; techniques that are only marginally successful and produce a multitude of equally nasty side effects like PTSD.\r&quot;\r<br>\r<br>You need to let go of this notion of thoughts and feelings &quot;fitting bodies&quot;, and so does anyone who gives you shit over not being &quot;enough of a man&quot;.  Your body is male, and I presume that you&#39;re an adult, therefore you&#39;re a man.  Your thoughts and feelings only make you <b>you.</b>  The odds were that biology would greatly influence your personality, but you beat those odds and broke free from gender norms.  If anything, this is something to celebrate, not run or hide from.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;Lastly, identifying as something measurable (age, race, social status) is provably true or false.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Exactly.  And being a man or woman is measurable through biology.  If you have zero biological evidence that you&#39;re a woman, yet you want people to treat you as one, there&#39;s nothing stopping me from applying this principle to pressure others into treating me as a different age, race, and financial status.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;In any case the most obvious difference between these identifications and gender dysphoria is that they don&#39;t cause distress.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>To your knowledge.  But I&#39;m quite sure that if you give it time, people will be popping up with their stories of how &quot;always knowing they were black&quot; (when they&#39;re white) and having to be misraced, etc. caused them great pain and suffering.  Because again, what&#39;s stopping them?  Even if you say they&#39;re just faking it all, how can you prove that?  You can&#39;t.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;If someone does suffer then it&#39;s up to the individual to do something about it - just as it is with gender dysphoria.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Yeah, like coming to grips with the objective truth, and then asking why they identify as something they&#39;re not.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;And if there&#39;s sufficient determination, a poor person may earn their way to a higher social class,&quot;\r<br>\r<br>No no no.  Don&#39;t be a bigot.  These people are <b>already</b> rich, and you have to treat them as such.  And that will have all sorts of interesting applications when they happen to stroll into the nearest bank, wouldn&#39;t you say?\r<br>\r<br>&quot;an old person may act and think as a younger person.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Right, like a 40-year old man who identifies as a 15-year old boy can date your daughter.  What could you say against that?  You don&#39;t want to be a hateful bigot, keep that in mind.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;Society accepts and encourages these people.  Ever see an old man on a skateboard doing tricks and having a blast?&quot;\r<br>\r<br>That&#39;s just it, though.  He can do these things because he&#39;s able to, not because he identifies as someone younger.  Similarly, you can fulfill the same needs as any mother, without being a woman.  And that would be OK but competing in sports against biological women is not.  Just as the old man can ride skateboards in the park, but cannot date a teenage girl.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;But few will correct them if they say they feel young or rich or whatever.  Yet many will correct me for saying I feel like a woman.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Partly because (so far), there isn&#39;t a movement of old people claiming they are in fact young or poor people claiming they are in fact rich.  So the guard can be lowered there.  Also partly because &quot;feeling young&quot; refers to differences in young people that most wouldn&#39;t dispute.  It&#39;s almost inevitable that a young person (who is healthy) will have more energy.  It is <b>not</b> almost inevitable that a woman will think, feel, and behave the way you are.\r<br>\r<br>\r&quot;So if I require a female-shaped body to function (regardless of my DNA), is it correct to deny it?&quot;\r<br>\r<br> You don&#39;t require that at all.  The issue is in the mind, so that&#39;s where you should fix it.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;Living authentic is more important.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Indeed.  So if you are a man who thinks, feels, and behaves in a very different way from most men, that&#39;s what you say.  That&#39;s what you know about yourself, and so that&#39;s what you should tell others.", "comment_date": "2019-11-04T18:04:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SMOKESHED", "comment_text": "Collaborating with the person who gave a dog head,asap go back no normal science videos like before", "comment_date": "2019-11-03T19:24:38Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Curi", "comment_text": "It\u2019s sad that this has as many dislikes as it does", "comment_date": "2019-11-03T03:07:52Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Jenna Moore", "comment_text": "It the sry gene sorry", "comment_date": "2019-11-03T02:23:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Art istic", "comment_text": "They should and always\u00a0have to\u00a0be honest whenever they approach or get approached trough sexual interest, whether its the same gender as them or not they should always come clean about their transition.

For example, it identifies 5 statistical differences, all being spectrums rather than binary distinctions.  Think of 5 slider knobs.  A biological cis male will likely have all of those knobs (eg: volume of right frontal lobe) more or less on one side, and a biological cis female will likely have all of those knobs generally on the other side - altho not at the far ends of the spectrum (knob at end of its travel).  Transgender folk may have one or more of these knobs more towards the middle or towards the other side; but they may at the same time have another knob still more towards their body gender.  So in regard to one knob (one brain metric), they might be more like the opposite gender, but in regard to another they might be more like their body gender.  To suggest that every trans person has all of these metrics (&quot;knobs&quot; in the analogy) strongly matching the cis gender brains of the opposite gender would not be an accurate reading of the science.  These metrics/knobs do not always move in lockstep with each other.<br><br>There are clusters tho.  Some researchers find that from scans they can identify brains as cismale, cisfemale, ftm, or mtf - four categories, not two.  <br><br>It would be more accurate to say that people whose brains differ substantially in any or all of these metrics from their body gender often (but not always) suffer gender dysphoria (or some milder condition similar to GD but without significant distress) and thus come to identify as trans.  This is a real thing, just like body intersex, and it deserves compassionate and humane responses from individuals and society, but it&#39;s more complex than this video portrays it; it doesn&#39;t come down to toggling a binary brain type between two alternatives.<br><br>The simple characterization &quot;more like the brain of the opposite body gender&quot; is not a fair summary, unless you add &quot;in some ways&quot;.<br><br>This comment is about honest, non-political scientific accuracy.  In no way does the science support hostility or oppression; everybody must be well treated, regardless of such brain metrics.  We can&#39;t empathize this enough - no hate or bigotry is OK.

That is why you get a bunch of crazy guys &#39;coming out&#39; as so-called &#39;trans&#39;  and perhaps even fewer women. Before BRUCE Jenner decided he was a woman (?) this was simply a fetish and this &#39;science&#39; is weak and came about as a weak way to validate what these nutjobs want. <br>&quot;Trans&quot; is, therefore, nothing more an attempt by sick minded people to impose on normal people their social engineering agenda. Do you think  they have all had their heads examined to &#39;prove&#39; their claims? NO! Because it is NOT TRUE. <br>It&#39;s just a popular idiocy going around, that&#39;s all. I could cite similar examples of trying to understand differences in the brains and physiology career criminals versus those who do not break the law. 150 years ago they were using &#39;science&#39; to &#39;prove&#39; that white people were smarter than black people by their brains! Same crap is happening now, only enabled by Hollywood RETARDS and their enablers. <br>What is more interesting is that in this video no one bothered to explain the percentage of actual cases in which this does legitimately occur either! It&#39;s not like Bruce Jenner had his mind checked or any other number of self-claimed &#39;trans&#39; morons did either; they just made the declaration and society is supposed to accept this on face value. <br>What&#39;s next? Weirdos claiming they are really cats, giraffes or hippos trapped in human bodies? I&#39;m sure if they did,  and it became a popular thing, people like this will also find the &#39;science&#39; to explain why that is true too! <br>Gender DYSPHORIA IS A CONDITION and we need to help those suffering from it. We don&#39;t need to enable CRAZY and a FETISH which is what this is. PERIOD. If you have any doubts about your gender, look between your legs. And if that does not help explain it, seek help!

We know that generally there&#39;re differences on how men and women behave and act, and in transgender cases usually these differences are exaggerated (i.e: trans male to female is usually very feminine and vice versa)  which resulted in this so called brain differences.  To simplify, for example  in general men are more confrontational and women are more agreeable,  these set of behaviors repeated over and over again may change some parts of the brain thus resulting in &#39;male and female brain&#39;, transgender person who acts like their preffered gender will also experience this change.  So the scientist who comitted this brain experiment was actually looking at differences due to differentiation between set of behavior and activity between &#39;typical&#39; male and female.  Thus the argument of gendered brain is wrong, even a simple thought process can debunk it,  for example there&#39;s no sane scientist in the world that can  look at some brain scan and with the utmost certainty tell that it is a male/female brain.

And why is there so many gender confused people now? I saw cancer cells. Not that the people themselves are cancer no not at all. More like cultural cancer and it is insidious. These bullies in dresses who are going into women&#39;s sports and hurting women physically and scholastically are enjoying women&#39;s rights even though they are men. This has given them a shield of protection in many ways and confused people&#39;s minds as to the reality of what&#39;s happening. Women are not speaking up because we are nice and inclusive heart driven people. Men are not speaking up because as a matter of moral ethics are kind to ladies and rightfully so. Trans men are being viewed as ladies as a societal norm. Kind of like being between a rock and hard place. Checkmate! Gotcha! Our culture has cancer. Ladies please wake up and speak up! Our children are being bullied by men in dresses. And they are quickly forming laws around themselves to prevent you from even being able to speak up. The window of opportunity to reclaim female-only spaces is closing fast. What can we do to reclaim women-only spaces? Number one: Speak out about it! Write to your congressmen. Make youtube videos expressing your opinion. Just make some noise ladies and gentlemen don&#39;t be intimated don&#39;t let them shut you down. One of the trans men&#39;s talking points is that women aren&#39;t speaking out against the trans men moving into women&#39;s only spaces! They are lifting up that point as validation that they belong in our spaces. But they do not belong in women-only spaces, because they are men not women!

This has nothing to do with rights as I support equality for opportunity for all citizens.  Most times I notice the constructs are what many people bring up when discussing MTF personal identity, things like dresses and clothing,  make up, liking colors like pink were early indicators for them. Those actually male originated trends historically and are the social constructs. Saying the rate of suicide post transition is lower is also shady bc it&#39;s still significantly higher than any other group. I wish there was an answer or a cure for people suffering resulting in suicide but claiming transitioning fixes the high suicide rate is misleading .I support the freedom for people do transition.

The suicide rate isn\u2019t just high, it\u2019s 10x national average; 40%. No other group in history has ever come close to that high of a suicide rate; not the African Americans before 1960 that were treated as lesser human beings, nor homosexuals during the 1970-1980 HIV scare when society thought the frightening disease was attributed to them. While there are horrible people out there, 40% is far too high to attribute to social intolerance; more likely linking with severe depression caused by uncontrollable chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters (ex: dopamine). There are no studies to show that tolerance and surgery will lower depression and the suicide rate to a \u201cnormal\u201d rate. As someone who has been medically treated for severe depression, I feel nothing but sympathy and wish kindness for these people going through such a tough life. Although I sympathize, I cannot accept that tolerance is the only hope. If we accept that tolerance is the only option, we less likely to find any other option.

I don&#39;t care if people are transgender, I literally just don&#39;t get it. I explain why below. If someone could explain it to me, that would be great!<br><br>Why does it actually matter whether your body matches the gender in your head? I&#39;m a straight guy, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d care if my body suddenly changed to a woman&#39;s. Actually, I&#39;d kinda like to have a beautiful woman&#39;s body :) but its not really important. I don&#39;t really wrap up my identity in being a &#39;man&#39; or &#39;guy&#39; that strongly - I&#39;m just a person who happens to exist in a male body. Both kinds of bodies can function, experience sexual pleasure, and reproduce.<br><br>Sure, there are typically &#39;masculine&#39; things like playing rugby, and typically &#39;feminine&#39; things like dolls and wearing dresses. But those are social constructs - boys could play with dolls and girls could play rugby. Yes, men and women dress differently, but clothes are really just a tool and a social norm. Yes, there are typical gender roles with relationships, but they&#39;re not gospel - some guys like myself like having a strong woman to look after them. <br><br>So basically, if we stop siloing things as masculine or feminine, is there anything actually left? Do we really need to base our identity as &#39;man&#39; or &#39;woman&#39; rather than just &#39;person&#39;? And if we don&#39;t, could we say that transgenderism is a mental illness? <br><br>Yes, people should be allowed to transition if they want, but if it is possible just to accept your body as is, that seems way easier to me.<br><br>Am I missing something, here? I&#39;m not trying to be dismissive - I&#39;m just trying to understand it.

Females are feminine, speak politely, nurturing, accommodating. However, what if someone is born a male, then they realize they don&#39;t want to measure up to these expectations for males; that they feel more feminine. Later they decide to identify with the label &quot;female&quot; which entails these stereotypes which have been mentioned. Are they males who behave in a stereotypical female way and therefore identify with females? Can a male who transgenders to a female be masculine? Perhaps this is a gender stereotype situation?

That boy/girl is now 10 years old. And (now she) still is a girl. So at that point you can&#39;t say that this child is just confused. But there is a lot of questions that you have to ask yourself.

In fact I believe that with such high suicide rates that they should be treated with more love.<br>However I urge a consideration of this yourselves. Are the neurological abnormalities in trans people to be embraced? Now wait here for a second, if there were neurological abnormalities in a person who had a learning disability, would the best way to handle that disability be to embrace their condition, or strive against it. I fear that modifying the body is not so much of a solution, as you essentially are not accepting how beautiful and amazing your human body is as. I care about transgender people as I would about any other member of the human race, and I know that the majority likely have these abnormalities. So the question would then be \u201cis it kindness love and empathy to help someone to appear the way that they feel, or accept the way that they are, and in that way learn to love themselves for who they are?\u201d I am also concerned that trans people through surgery are attempting to kill off their previous self, changing everything that they have known since birth, and every person will treat them differently, not because they are trans, but because they appear female or male.<br> I think that it is natural for any family to treat that person differently based upon their apparent gender (no I\u2019m not advocating hatred here, hear me out). For example, if you have a group of men let\u2019s say ten or so, the relationship between those men change drastically when one woman is placed in the group. Families are the origins of where we learn as humans where to treat men and women. From our fathers we learn how to treat men, and how to be chivalrous towards women. From our mothers we learn how to love our future children, how women interact with one another, and the qualities of a good wife. <br>This is not the result of a failed society, but rather the result of natural interactions and hormones changing when a man is introduced to a woman. The truth is that you treat different things differently, as you would not eat a shoe and wear apples. Men are naturally designed to be protectors for women and their children, and this is the reason for why men generally have a stronger body structure, why their brains are different. Let\u2019s stay in reality here, between a 5\u20198\u201d man and a 5\u20198\u201d woman, who would be more inclined to break up a fight or use force to protect another?<br>Ending point, we must accept who nature has designed us to be, as fighting nature does not conform with the minds which we are born with. As a general rule for happiness in ones life, we should look to perfect our minds and our hearts, our reason and our love, and those things which contradict reason and love do not help ourselves to become better, and they do not lead to happiness.", "comment_date": "2018-09-21T20:28:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Unipandacorn", "comment_text": "Gender dysphoria, ok", "comment_date": "2018-09-21T20:27:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew K", "comment_text": "Amazing video!!", "comment_date": "2018-09-21T20:20:24Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Squashed shibber", "comment_text": "There are still people in the comment section who think gender is a social construct or a ~feeling~ and you don&#39;t need dysphoria to be trans.

They have a higher suicide rate than Jews in Nazi Germany and slaves under the slave trade and im sure most would say their experience isnt as nearly as troubling.
