I guess it\u2019s better than death without a copy but it\u2019s not extending survival and avoids the issue. I have always been intrigued by gradual \u201cuploading\u201d. That would be the best option if possible and might actually provide true survival. How it works is every night while sleeping your neurons, synaptic connections, etc are replaced a little each night with synthetic connections and neurons to exact degree. Lose some but replaced by exact type. Say it goes for year until your brain is bio machine that has plasticity like current but doesn\u2019t age and die. This os beyond complex and might be beyond science but it breaks no laws of physics and biology.

Conscious is contained in its substrate. <br><br>To prove this all you would have to do is emulate/copy the connectome and paste to another substrate like a computer or a blank brain (blank brain makes zero sense) and then move computer consciousness to a robot vessel. Yes, the synthetic robot will believe they are the original self and you can say we can never know if it is or not should the original was destroyed. But if the original was not destroyed, you have two exact selfs and they start diverging. Diverging is of little consequence to the argument. The second one thinks they are the original but they are a clone/copy. It\u2019s not extending survival for the original.

Also, whether the world which the transferred mind views is really viewed from your own intrinsic perspective. Is it really just a matter of closing your eyes, being transferred, then opening your eyes again &amp; thinking... &#39;oh, here I am.&#39; ? Is the person saying &#39;here I am&#39; really you, or just someone with your life long memories who thinks they are? Of course, at this point it is also critical to discern between copying or moving consciousness. From the view of copying, let&#39;s try a thought experiment. You are inside room A lying on a medical couch. We will also label you consciousness A. Meanwhile inside room B is a clone of you also on a medical couch &amp; waiting to host your transferred consciousness. After the transfer is complete... you have room A with your original consciousness &amp; room B with consciousness B now housed in your clone. At this point both A &amp; B are free to act independently of each other. So consciousness B is free to do anything &amp; from your perspective inside room A you are unaware of whatever B does. So clearly consciousness A &amp; B have separate perspectives. If this is true then how can they be the same person? The copied consciousness model doesn&#39;t really hold much merit when it comes to maintaining the integrity of the original self. The statement &#39;I am me&#39;... with both A &amp; B proclaiming it, has collapsed into absurdity. <br>   Now, let&#39;s repeat the experiment. But this time with a variation. This time after the transfer is complete, consciousness A, (that&#39;s you by the way),  is terminated. The result is consciousness B in room B and no one in room A. In this scenario can you safely assume that B is actually you &amp; that your longevity is intact? Or are you actually dead &amp; merely replaced by an imposter? I think it&#39;s safe to assume that the continuity in consciousness is actually broken &amp; B is not you. When you close your eyes in room A prior to the transfer, you never actually open them again. Only your cloned consciousness inside room B does this. Remember, in the previous experiment A &amp; B were shown to have two distinctive perspectives, each with the ability to act independently of one another. So they weren&#39;t the same person. So it follows that in this new experiment, B is not you &amp; once consciousness A is extinguished so are you. <br>   So much for the idea of backing up your mind on a drive to achieve immortality.", "comment_date": "2021-08-08T07:31:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rowen Akers", "comment_text": "But it still would not be you.

The most fundamental question of science from last many centuries. By practicing Meditation we get realization that, we are not this physical body, but we are very small (Planck scale) eternal and immortal divine light having sacred geometry of STAR (Pentagon) . We divine light are Consciousness creator and operates human body through brain (control circuit ) and through subtle light body (power circuit ). This self eternal light awareness is called soul consciousness or higher dimension consciousness. The people of ancient world of Lemuria and Atlantis was in soul consciousness hence it was Golden age on earth, which describe by Plato and many ancient philosophers. This is our own story of higher dimension consciousness, where one time world was with true unconditional love, peace and happiness. <br><br>Presently all human being are in body consciousness i.e considering them self as body, but In reality we are very subtle spiritual energy , who creates Aether energy at Planck scale by creating frequencies in Hilbert Space, with the help of 10 dimensional Strings of 16 Aethric energy points, which are connected to each others as per drg. These basic frequencies acts on brain by creating vibrations through Aether (quantum vacuum energy) medium, which creates electromagnetic bio-photons through torsion waves and these acts on microtubules of Brain as per quantum computing, which gives signals to nucleus for transmission of vibrations under mechanism of unified sacred geometric field\u2019s for collapse of quantum wave functions which gives experience to us. Soul consciousness stage explore all secretes of universe and its creator. <br><br>The Emergence Theory , which says that Spacetime is Pixelated and of Reality as a Quasicrystalline Point Space Projected From the E8 Crystal is very correct as per our astral vision in higher dimension. When we see our self at Planck scale, we can see the dynamic grid of Aether elements surround us in this Pixelated form of Aether element i.e Tetrahedron ( at present). This smallest Aether element have consciousness and it have 9 consciousness energy points in it, which contain all the data store in term of freq. <br><br>Presently this Aether element have only four active consciousness energy points, hence it&#39;s look like Tetrahedron, but when we all Souls return to our higher dimension of reality i.e soul consciousness stage, it&#39;s all 9 consciousness energy points will get activated and each point became more self aware and extremely intelligent. These elements are talking to each other as per their recorded data for next movement but we souls are doing incitation for this information, because all these information flow from us to these Aether elements. Hence Reality is Geometric and it is made of aether energy&#39;s element and all movements (i.e information or data) of these aether element are store inside in form of freq encoded by GOD ! Now How God encoded all these information is big subject of research, which we are trying to find out. <br><br>This Cosmos is a mind-like topological neural network based on the principle of tensegrity and wherein a God-like consciousness can self-realize or self-actualize through the behavior of the \u201ccode\u201d. Now this &quot; Code&quot; are recorded in terms of freq in this Aether elements of universe and we are the activator of these &quot; Code&quot; as per our thought patterns. One Planck unit adopted all the information of all protons and the fluctuation of this Planck units creates the information network which flow in the universe through Feedback mechanism. As we have our own physical body as our own cosmos, this physical universe is body of GOD and it&#39;s run by his divine cosmic code in the form of scared geometry energy field . <br>Nassim Haramin believe that the representation of universe is encoded by the interference pattern of fluctuation of space time on the surface of every proton. The information of the black hole is present on the 2-D surface of the black hole known as it&#39;s &quot; Event Horizon&quot;. Every atom has mini black hole and proton cloud be act as mini black hole in atom. If we look all little fluctuation of the vacuum, the amount of energy inside the proton in the vacuum fluctuation, the mass of the vacuum inside the little tiny proton( center at atom) is equivalent to all other protons mass of the universe. All mass of the universe is represent Holographically by vacuum fluctuation in one little proton, so that one little proton is connected to all proton in the universe. The holographic information encoding is dynamically happening at every micro seconds at every movement and it constantly flowing throughout the universe. Universe is self organizing system and Space ( Aether energy) is connecting everything and it is great organizer. Its connect everything and gather all the information , knowledge of every point of universe. <br><br>The whole universe is closed system and run in cyclic pattern of time, which all our ancient civilization has been mention in their scriptures. Hence the past and future are exist simultaneously in every Aether element of universe at Planck level in geometric form. This universe has G\u00f6del metric type geometry in which all aether elements are running with time to perform the action of reality as per recorded data inside them. Hence Causality loops is must require to run this Grand Cosmic Show of creator! You had found the keys of GOD i,.e Golden Ration and Fibonacci numbers which are bridging gap between Quantum mechanics and General relativity. <br><br>Edgar Cayce predicted that science eventually would restore the scientific knowledge of the legendary lost continent of Atlantis. Now something definitely is going on this planet and surprisingly Edgar Cayce has forecast these events that came to be known as the prophecies of the \u2018Earth changes\u2019. The new vision reveals a wondrous universe in which human consciousness plays a far more important role than ever fathomed. It also reveals that our civilization may not be the pinnacle of evolution after all, it is becoming more and more clear that other great and highly advanced civilizations must have preceded our current civilization. Atlantis is rising as Edgar Cayce predicted! . This is mission of GOD, where he is giving true knowledge of self, about him and his creation so that entire mankind will know the secret of consciousness and all humanity will get again real peace, happiness and health forever.<br><br>We see the present World of big sorrow and human values are very degraded, but it is duty of GOD to uplift the mankind by teaching Rajyog for Spiritual empowerment of Human Soul and also change the entire world from Iron age to Golden Age as per World Cosmic cycle. This is beginning of new world order by Almighty GOD to transfer this present world into Golden Age - The Garden of Adam, on this earth by his very deep, vast and mysterious process.

I was having a nap on my bed. My siblings were playing on there games. I&#39;m that type of kid that thinks alot. About aliens. Power of the mind. All that stuff. I was concentrating really hard, if I could go to a different persons body while I was laying on the bed kinda sleeping. I would say half sleeping. In my mind I don&#39;t know if it was a yellow tunnel or a blue tunnel but I saw one of those anyways. It was going in different directions. I thought so hard that it lead me to a like.. um it lead me to a human face? Not like a physical human face but like it was blue and was tiny bit glowing. I only saw it for like 2 seconds. Then I woke up FULLY and I couldn&#39;t move. My body felt like it was shaking fast but I couldn&#39;t move. I don&#39;t remember seeing anything. I felt like I was coming out of my body. But I didn&#39;t want to cause I was so scareeddd. Then I managed to move my leg. And broke out of that. After all that happened 3 seconds later I moved to another side of the bed and thought about the tunnel and concentrated hard again and the same thing happened. But this was worser and harder to break out. Ughh I don&#39;t wanna think about that tunnel. I can think about it but if I feel I concentrate on it it will do it again. My chest feels heavy now. My legs feel shaken. I typed on Google about a tunnel and then face. But nothing came up about it. Only near death experiences. Can someone please explain? <br>That never happened to me in my life. I&#39;m only 14. I felt like I was being transported.
