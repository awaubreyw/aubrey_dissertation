(Romans 3:23)<br><br>For God so loved the world [you], that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish (die/hell)he&#39;ll, but have eternal life (heaven). (John 3:16)<br><br>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus.

(Romans 1:4)<br><br>If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. (Romans 10:9)<br><br>If you don&#39;t know where you are going after you die, and need to give your life to the Lord Jesus to be saved, it is as simple as praying a prayer like this one -if you sincerely mean it in your heart:<br><br>Dear God, <br>    I believe You gave Your Son, Jesus, to die for me. I believe He shed His blood to pay for my sins and that you raised Him from the dead so I can be Your child and live with You eternally in heaven. I am asking Jesus to come into my heart right now and save me. I confess Him as the Lord and Master of my life. I thank You, dear Lord, for loving me enough to lay down Your life for me. Take my life now and use it for your glory. I ask for all that You have for me.<br>   In Jesus&#39; name, <br>   Amen<br><br>Congratulations if you prayed to the Lord Jesus, and if meant you meant that in your heart, you don&#39;t have to be afraid of death, because you are forgiven gift a new life and right standing with God as His child by His grace and faith in Him alone. I hope this blesses anyone who reads this, and may your name be found in the Lamb&#39;s book of life, God bless you. \u271d\ufe0f \ud83d\ude4f \u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2022-06-03T12:16:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "loffy", "comment_text": "Death is better than living in this fake world", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T12:07:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Garion Ramsey", "comment_text": "If I die I die you don\u2019t live forever", "comment_date": "2022-03-12T20:34:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Head honcho the one", "comment_text": "Death is just another state of unconsciousness.", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T12:16:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clear Truth", "comment_text": "Truth afther death<br>Ecclesiastes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a>,20<br>19 for there is an outcome for humans and an outcome for animals,they all have the same outcome.

I drowned in a lake, then at some point someone saw me and swam out and saved me. At first it was very scary when I knew that there was no one around close enough to hear my screams. I couldn&#39;t swim, so I dog-paddled as long as I could. Then, when I couldn&#39;t stay afloat any longer, I remember thinking, &quot;this is it&quot;. I just relaxed and floated down, down, down. I remember in that moment, not sure how long it was, I felt this amazing peace fall over me. It was so nice I didn&#39;t want it to end. Didn&#39;t see any light, a tunnel, or anything like that. Maybe because my heart didn&#39;t stop beating, don&#39;t know . Then, someone came from out of the woods, swam out to the middle of the lake and down very deep and pulled me up by my pony tail. I coughed and sputtered when he set me on the beach, asked if I was ok, then he was gone. I didn&#39;t ever tell anyone about it until I was an adult. Not sure why, it was just very traumatic as a child and very personal. Later in life, I was at a Bible study and the subject came up about angels being around us when we don&#39;t even know it because they can materialize to look like humans. &quot;Oh my God!&quot; I thought back on that day. Could it have been an angel that saved me? Don&#39;t know. But, I was never afraid of death after that. Guess that&#39;s why I was a daredevil. I surfed 15-foot waves in my youth, climb tall towers in the river and dove off, climbed way too high in trees, etc. Now I&#39;m 70 and so glad to have those memories. I wrote a book about where I believe we go when we die. It&#39;s on Amazon, but I also made a short video on it. Check it out and let me know what you think.

You have a choice it&#39;s either heaven and Jesus and salvation or hell and the devil and eternal damnation. I choose Jesus and I pray you guys will too! Jesus is worth it he&#39;s our only salvation! We do have life after death! First, for the believer in Jesus Christ, the Bible tells us that after death believers\u2019 souls/spirits are taken to heaven, because their sins are forgiven by having received Christ as Savior (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a>, 18, 36). For believers, death is to be \u201caway from the body and at home with the Lord\u201d (2 Corinthians 5:6-8; Philippians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=1m23s\">1:23</a>). However, passages such as 1 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=15m50s\">15:50</a>-54 and 1 Thessalonians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=4m13s\">4:13</a>-17 describe believers being resurrected and given glorified bodies. If believers go to be with Christ immediately after death, what is the purpose of this resurrection? It seems that while the souls/spirits of believers go to be with Christ immediately after death, the physical body remains in the grave \u201csleeping.\u201d At the resurrection of believers, the physical body is resurrected, glorified, and then reunited with the soul/spirit. This reunited and glorified body-soul-spirit will be the possession of believers for eternity in the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21-22).<br><br>Second, for those who do not receive Jesus Christ as Savior, death means everlasting punishment. However, similar to the destiny of believers, unbelievers also seem to be sent immediately to a temporary holding place, to await their final resurrection, judgment, and eternal destiny. Luke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=16m22s\">16:22</a>-23 describes a rich man being tormented immediately after death. Revelation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=20m11s\">20:11</a>-15 describes all the unbelieving dead being resurrected, judged at the great white throne, and then being cast into the lake of fire. Unbelievers, then, are not sent to hell (the lake of fire) immediately after death, but rather are in a temporary realm of judgment and condemnation. However, even though unbelievers are not instantly sent to the lake of fire, their immediate fate after death is not a pleasant one. The rich man cried out, \u201cI am in agony in this fire\u201d (Luke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=16m24s\">16:24</a>).<br><br>Therefore, after death, a person resides in a \u201ctemporary\u201d heaven or hell. After this temporary realm, at the final resurrection, a person\u2019s eternal destiny will not change. The precise \u201clocation\u201d of that eternal destiny is what changes. Believers will ultimately be granted entrance into the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21:1). Unbelievers will ultimately be sent to the lake of fire (Revelation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=20m11s\">20:11</a>-15). These are the final, eternal destinations of all people\u2014based entirely on whether or not they had trusted Jesus Christ alone for salvation (Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=25m46s\">25:46</a>; John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=3m36s\">3:36</a>).", "comment_date": "2020-08-11T13:44:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Christensen", "comment_text": "If you see my profile pic that is my cat that died 1 week ago and I can&#39;t believe she had to go through this R.I.P cat 2014-2020", "comment_date": "2020-08-09T10:40:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ROMA MANOJKUMAR JHA", "comment_text": "My grandmother died why she died i am so sad too see her again\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T06:08:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doris Williams", "comment_text": "When u die you go to heaven or hell", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T05:02:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jean Hodgson", "comment_text": "This is what really happens when you die.

For many, death is shrouded in mystery and evokes dread, uncertainty, and hopelessness. Others believe that their deceased loved ones are not dead at all, but instead live with them or in other realms. Millions are confused about the relationship between the body, spirit, and soul. But does it really matter what you believe? Yes\u2014absolutely! What you believe about the dead will have a profound impact on what happens to you in the near future.<br><br>1. How did humans get here in the first place?<br>\u201cThe Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being\u201d (Genesis 2:7).<br><br>Answer: God made us from dust in the beginning.<br><br>2. What happens when a person dies?<br>\u201cThen the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave it\u201d (Ecclesiastes 12:7).<br><br>Answer: The body turns to dust again, and the spirit goes back to God, who gave it. The spirit of every person who dies\u2014whether saved or unsaved\u2014returns to God at death.<br>3. What is the \u201cspirit\u201d that returns to God at death?<br>\u201cThe body without the spirit is dead\u201d (James <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=2m26s\">2:26</a>).<br>\u201cThe spirit of God is in my nostrils\u201d (Job 27:3 KJV).<br><br>Answer: The spirit that returns to God at death is the breath of life. Nowhere in all of God\u2019s book does the \u201cspirit\u201d have any life, wisdom, or feeling after a person dies. It is the \u201cbreath of life\u201d and nothing more.<br><br>4. What is a &quot;soul&quot;?<br>\u201cThe Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul\u201d (Genesis 2:7 KJV).<br><br>Answer: A soul is a living being. A soul is always a combination of two things: body plus breath. A soul cannot exist unless body and breath are combined. God\u2019s Word teaches that we are souls\u2014not that we have souls.<br><br>5. Do souls die?<br>\u201cThe soul that sinneth, it shall die\u201d (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=18m20s\">18:20</a> KJV).<br>\u201cEvery living soul died in the sea\u201d (Revelation 16:3 KJV).<br><br>Answer: According to God\u2019s Word, souls do die! We are souls, and souls die. Man is mortal (Job <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=4m17s\">4:17</a>).<br>Only God is immortal (1 Timothy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=6m15s\">6:15</a>, 16). The concept of an undying, immortal soul is not found in the Bible, which teaches that souls are subject to death.<br><br>Do good people go to heaven when they die?<br>\u201cAll who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth\u201d (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=5m28s\">5:28</a>, 29).<br>\u201cDavid \u2026 is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. \u2026 For David did not ascend into the heavens\u201d (Acts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=2m29s\">2:29</a>, 34).<br>\u201cIf I wait, the grave is mine house\u201d (Job <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=17m13s\">17:13</a> KJV).<br><br>Answer: No. People do not go to heaven or to hell at death. They don\u2019t go anywhere\u2014but they wait in their graves for the resurrection.<br><br>7. How much does one know or comprehend after death?<br>\u201cThe living know that they will die; but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; nevermore will they have a share in anything done under the sun. \u2026 There is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going\u201d (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6, 10).<br>\u201cThe dead do not praise the Lord\u201d (Psalm 115:17).<br><br>Answer: God says that the dead know absolutely nothing!<br><br>8. But can\u2019t the dead communicate with the living, and aren\u2019t they aware of what the living are doing?<br>\u201cMan lies down and does not rise. Till the heavens are no more, they will not awake nor be roused from their sleep. \u2026 His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; they are brought low, and he does not perceive it\u201d (Job <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=14m12s\">14:12</a>, 21).<br>\u201cNevermore will they have a share in anything done under the sun\u201d (Ecclesiastes 9:6).<br><br>Answer: No. The dead cannot contact the living, nor do they know what the living are doing. They are dead. Their thoughts have perished (Psalm 146:4 KJV).<br><br>9. Jesus called the unconscious state of the dead \u201csleep\u201d in John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=11m11s\">11:11</a>\u201314. How long will they sleep?<br>\u201cMan lies down and does not rise. Till the heavens are no more\u201d (Job <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=14m12s\">14:12</a>).<br>\u201cThe day of the Lord will come \u2026 in which the heavens will pass away\u201d (2 Peter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a>).<br><br>Answer: The dead will sleep until the great day of the Lord at the end of the world. In death humans are totally unconscious with no activity or knowledge of any kind.<br><br>10. What happens to the righteous dead at the second coming of Christ?<br>\u201cBehold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work\u201d (Revelation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=22m12s\">22:12</a>).<br>\u201cThe Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout. \u2026 And the dead in Christ will rise. \u2026 And thus we shall always be with the Lord\u201d (1 Thessalonians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=4m16s\">4:16</a>, 17).<br>\u201cWe shall all be changed\u2014in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye \u2026 and the dead will be raised incorruptible. \u2026 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality\u201d (1 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=15m51s\">15:51</a>\u201353).<br><br>Answer: They will be rewarded. They will be raised, given immortal bodies, and caught up to meet the Lord in the air. There would be no purpose in a resurrection if people were taken to heaven at death.<br><br>11. What was the devil\u2019s first lie on Earth?<br>\u201cThe serpent said to the woman, \u2018You will not surely die\u2019 \u201d (Genesis 3:4).<br>\u201cThat serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan\u201d (Revelation 12:9).<br><br>Answer: You will not die.<br><br>12. Why did the devil lie to Eve about death? Could this subject be more important than we think?<br>Answer: The devil\u2019s lie that we will not die is one of the pillars of his teachings. For thousands of years, he has worked powerful, deceptive miracles to trick people into thinking they are receiving messages from the spirits of the dead. (Examples: Magicians of Egypt\u2014Exodus <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=7m11s\">7:11</a>; Woman of Endor\u20141 Samuel 28:3\u201325; Sorcerers\u2014Daniel 2:2; A slave girl\u2014Acts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=16m16s\">16:16</a>\u201318.)<br><br>A Solemn Warning<br>In the near future, Satan will again use sorcery\u2014as he did in the prophet Daniel\u2019s day\u2014to deceive the world (Revelation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=18m23s\">18:23</a>). Sorcery is a supernatural agency that claims to receive its power and wisdom from the spirits of the dead.<br><br>Posing as Jesus&#39; Disciples<br>Posing as godly loved ones who have died, saintly clergymen who are now dead, Bible prophets, or even the apostles of Christ (2 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=11m13s\">11:13</a>), Satan and his angels will deceive billions. Those who believe the dead are alive, in any form, will likely be deceived.<br><br>14. Why will God&#39;s people not be deceived?<br>\u201cThey received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so\u201d (Acts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=17m11s\">17:11</a>).<br>\u201cIf they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them\u201d (Isaiah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=8m20s\">8:20</a>).<br><br>Answer: God\u2019s people will know from their study of His book that the dead are dead, not alive. They will know that a \u201cspirit\u201d claiming to be a deceased loved one is really a devil! God\u2019s people will reject all teachers and miracle workers who claim to receive special \u201clight\u201d or work miracles by contacting the spirits of the dead. And God\u2019s people will likewise reject as dangerous and false all teachings that claim the dead are alive in any form, anywhere.<br><br>15. Back in Moses\u2019 day, what did God command should be done to people who taught that the dead were alive?<br>\u201cA man or a woman who is a medium, or who has familiar spirits, shall surely be put to death; they shall stone them with stones\u201d (Leviticus <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=20m27s\">20:27</a>).<br><br>Answer: God insisted that mediums and others with \u201cfamiliar spirits\u201d (who claimed to be able to contact the dead) should be stoned to death. This shows how God regards the false teaching that the dead are alive.<br><br>16. Will the righteous people who are raised in the resurrection ever die again?<br>\u201cThose who are counted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead \u2026 nor can they die anymore\u201d (Luke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=20m35s\">20:35</a>, 36).<br><br>\u201cGod will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away\u201d (Revelation 21:4).<br><br>Answer: No! Death, sorrow, crying, and tragedy will never enter into God\u2019s new kingdom. \u201cWhen this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: \u2018Death is swallowed up in victory\u2019 \u201d (1 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=15m54s\">15:54</a>).<br><br>17. Belief in reincarnation is expanding rapidly today. Is this teaching biblical?<br>\u201cThe living know that they will die; but the dead know nothing. \u2026 Nevermore will they have a share in anything done under the sun\u201d (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6).<br><br>Answer: Almost half the people on earth believe in reincarnation, a teaching that the soul never dies but is instead continually reborn in a different kind of body with each succeeding generation. This teaching, however, is contrary to Scripture.<br><br>The Bible Says<br>After death a person: returns to dust (Psalms 104:29), knows nothing (Ecclesiastes 9:5), possesses no mental powers (Psalms 146:4), has nothing to do with anything on earth (Ecclesiastes 9:6), does not live (2 Kings 20:1), waits in the grave (Job <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=17m13s\">17:13</a>), and continues not (Job 14:1, 2).<br><br>Satan&#39;s Invention<br>We learned in questions 11 and 12 that Satan invented the teaching that the dead are alive. Reincarnation, channeling, communication with spirits, spirit worship, and the &quot;undying soul&quot; are all inventions of Satan, with one aim to convince people that when you die you are not really dead. When people believe that the dead are alive, &quot;spirits of devils, working miracles&quot; (Revelation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=16m14s\">16:14</a>) and posing as spirits of the dead will be able to deceive and lead them astray virtually 100 percent of the time (Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=24m24s\">24:24</a>).", "comment_date": "2020-04-23T19:04:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sahil Chawla", "comment_text": "But what about people who burn the dead bodies?", "comment_date": "2020-03-23T03:20:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "theInkyNightmare", "comment_text": "Isn\u2019t it weird how when one person die, at the same time a baby is born?", "comment_date": "2020-03-11T21:18:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BakedCanadian420", "comment_text": "at least your videos are way easier to understand than vsauces videos.

In fact, this is the most important message of all time. This message of hope is the message that \u201c...Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners...\u201d - (1 Timothy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a>)  But what does that even mean?<br><br>The Bible says that \u201call have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\u201d \u2013 (Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=3m23s\">3:23</a>). That means me, you, and everyone else; we\u2019re all broken people who have fallen short of the righteousness of God. The Bible tells us that \u201cthe wages of sin is death\u201d \u2013 (Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a>a). This death is a spiritual death called the second death that comes after the physical death of the body.  When a sinner dies, they must pay a debt that they owe because of their sin. The only way to personally pay that debt is for us to spend eternity in a place called Hell. Hell is not a good place and the Bible describes it as a \u201clake which burneth with fire and brimstone\u201d \u2013 (Revelation 21:8b)<br><br><br>    But wait! There is good news! God loves us and does not want anyone to go to Hell. \u201cBut God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\u201d \u2013 (Romans 5:8) That\u2019s right, God loves you even though you are a sinner, so much so that He offered His Son as a sacrifice/ransom for your sins so that you can spend eternity in Heaven. The Bible says Heaven is a place where \u201cGod shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\u201d \u2013 (Revelation 21:4)<br><br><br>    On that day when Jesus willingly offered Himself as a sacrifice by dying on the cross, He was receiving the punishment we deserve for our sin.  It\u2019s as if He wrote a check that is paid-in-full for the sin debt that you owe. But how do you cash that check? How can you be saved from having to spend eternity in Hell? A man in the Bible asked that very question when he said \u201cSirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.\u201d \u2013 (Acts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=16m30s\">16:30</a>-31) According to the Bible, all you must do to be saved is believe that Jesus died on the cross paying the price for all the sins that you have ever done or will ever do. Jesus said \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.\u201d \u2013 (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=6m47s\">6:47</a>) Simply trust Jesus as your only hope to spend eternity in Heaven. \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d \u2013 (John 14:6) <br><br><br>Being saved has nothing to do with how good you are; but how good God is. \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d \u2013 (Eph. 2:8-9) Salvation is just that, a free gift from God received purely by faith. <br><br><br>\u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d \u2013 (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a>) That is what it means when the Bible says that Christ Jesus came to save sinners. By ourselves, we are on a path that leads only to destruction. But through the blood Jesus shed for you can you find hope and forgiveness. <br><br><br>  I invite you right now to make the most important decision you can ever make. Would you like to be forgiven of your sins and have assurance that you are going to go to Heaven? All you must do is make the genuine decision in your heart to trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and His finished work on the cross as your only way to live for eternity in Heaven. Trust Him. That\u2019s all. Stop believing in yourself and believe in Jesus. Place your faith in the Son of God. If you want to make this decision, simply call out to the Lord.  \u201cwhoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\u201d \u2013 (Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=10m13s\">10:13</a>)", "comment_date": "2019-01-19T16:43:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "meagain2222", "comment_text": "Now this is what really happens when you die.We actually have 3 bodies.A physical an astral(emotional) and a mental body.After death your soul which is immortal keeps one atom from each of those three bodies and uses them to make a new body which you incarnate as a baby again.

I find it interesting that the bible states that thoughts cease until judgement day, resembling the scientific notion that death is like the total deprivation of sensation and perception.

When we die, metabolic energy tied up in our cells will be used in the decomposition process, but what about the electrical energy in our brains/bodies? This is a measurable amount of energy that at the moment of death is no longer required by the body/brain and has to go somewhere. So is there a measurable radiation of heat at the moment of death? <br>First, electrical energy is nothing special. Just like the chemical energy in our bodies, it breaks down into heat. For example, the heat given off by light bulbs is a result of electrical energy. When electricity is flowing to a light bulb, that\u2019s where the electrical energy is going; it\u2019s turning into light. When you pull the plug (so to speak) what tiny, tiny amount of electrical energy there is in the wires runs out almost immediately.<br>The term \u201celectrical energy\u201d is actually a little vague. So, to be specific, in our nervous system there are tiny ion pumps that maintain an imbalance of charges between the inside and outside of the nerve cells. When a nerve cell fires, charges are allowed to suddenly flow through the cell membrane in a process called an \u201caction potential\u201c. There are mechanisms that maintain an imbalance of charge, and that imbalance is drained a little bit every time the nerve fires.<br>Death (excluding spectacular deaths) isn\u2019t instantaneous. In fact, what with medical science, it\u2019s become more and more difficult to even define when people are dead. Time was you could define death as being a lack of heartbeat, but people have come back from worse. Death is more of a breakdown of the whole system, as opposed to a sudden event. The heart stops pumping, oxygen and nutrients stop going where they\u2019re needed, and in short order the nerve cells in the body lose the wherewithal to pump ions. Like batteries that are no longer being recharged, they run down. Nothing special. Like every kind of energy, whether electrical, kinetic, the electrical potential in the body eventually becomes heat energy (it\u2019s an entropy thing).<br>The energy we \u201ccarry around\u201d takes the form of chemical energy like fats and sugars. When our nervous system creates electrical energy we lose an equal amount of chemical energy. So, rather than being energy itself, life is all about moving energy around from one form to another.<br>There are a few kinds of energy, but spiritual energy doesn\u2019t seem to be one of them. In terms of physical energy, the difference between a living body and a very recently dead body is just a question of how that energy is being organized. Living creatures in general are very good at using chemical energy for things like moving, growing, etc. Newly dead creatures have about the same amount of chemical energy, it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t use it. Instead, whatever comes along to consume the body uses it (whether that\u2019s fire or decomposition or whatever).<br>To date, there are no confirmable experiments that show that anything special happens during death, other than a general \u201cshutting down\u201d.

My dog died in 2015 and the memory of how he died has still stuck with me all these years. My family has an 11 month old puppy (shes gonna be 1 year old in october) and the thing that made me the saddest was when I found out from the vet, I was a distraught mess for a whole month and the saddest part of it was when my mum told me that she would have to call one of my grandparents closest friends who is also a vet to come and put the dog down a week later (it was suppost to happen on Friday 30th October). I almost started crying at my weekly girl guides meeting (none of them have ever seen me cry and when my dog came down to say goodbye to everyone, I almost cried. All my leaders tried to make me feel better and it worked until I went to bed that night. On the thursday, some close family friends came over and took the rest of the food that he hadnt eaten to give to their dogs. That same day while we were having dinner, my mum noticed that he was starting to pass and he died surrounded by the whole family. My mum had to call my grandparents and uncle around to my house. My grandmother spent the whole time trying to calm me down and to say her final goodbye to him whereas my mum, dad, grandfather and uncle dug a hole in the flower garden in the back of our backyard and when it came to the time where we had to bury the dog, I wouldnt let anyone do it as it would make me cry even more. They eventually asked if I wanted to help carry him outside to his resting place and I was ok with doing that. After I went outside with the dead dog in my arms, I put him in the hole and ran over to find his favourite toy and I picked some lavender for the family that wasnt there and placed them in the hole with the dog. I went to bed crying that night and when I woke up in the morning, my eyes were wet which ment I cried while I was asleep cause I missed him so much. At school the next day, I asked my friends to send an email to all the teachers I had that day saying that I was going through a hard time and that I may not be completely on focus My teachers were all very supportive. I originally wasnt going to go trick or treating that year but when my friends invited me to go with them, I couldnt say no and I thought that it would take my mind of that. It worked but when I got home, I remembered that he wasnt there to greet me so I went to the kitchen and placed the triple butter popcorn I got in the microwave and went to my room to eat what I had. Only problem was that I was so far into the grieving process, I didnt let anyone come in my room and ate all the things I got that year. For the next few weeks, I went outside to his burial site (which now has a new lavendar bush growing on top as a memory of the dog) and always went through my day at school and what I did. I ended up taking half an hour to say goodnight to my parents (as im the oldest child in my family, I get to stay up later) and they tucked me into bed, which they haven&#39;t done since I was 8 or 9 years old. My friends and everyone who knew me were really supportive. I still find telling this story of his death hard but I know that its a fact of life and he nearly survived past the average age of the breed. <br>R.I.P my dog Winston (Age 12)<br>4/11/2002-29/10/2015<br>Time of death: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55j-nVwHa_c&amp;t=9m30s\">9:30</a>pm Thursday 29th October", "comment_date": "2017-09-29T16:18:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "3rdeyeshine", "comment_text": "It doesn&#39;t make sense not to exist.

It would also be good if you could have some sort of plant grow on you to help with emissions of CO2 into the air. Of course, these are just my recommendations to help better improve our environment.

My dad died about 6-7 weeks ago (April 1st, 2017). I wasn&#39;t there, he was is Orlando, FL and we live in Indiana. My dad was a big dude, weighing in around 400-450 lbs. He had been having kidney trouble for about 2 years. When they did the autopsy, they notice he had an enlarged heart, about three times the normal size. Could you please make a video to show me how his body was shutting down?<br>By the way, the day he died he woke up and had trouble breathing. He thought i was a fluid build-up because the same thing happened 3 months prior. Then it got worse. My cousin called an ambulance and they rushed him to the local hospital. When they got into the emergency room, his heart stopped. Luckily, they had some defibrillators there and began the procedure. However, this wasn&#39;t enough and they were unable to revive him. <br>My dad was born March 30th, 1984 and died April 1st, 2017, two days after his 33rd birthday.<br>Thanks for taking your time to read this comment.<br><br>Farewell,<br>-An 11-year-old from Indiana<br><br>PS. <br>I LOOOVE watching your videos!

Consciousness has never  (and will never) be explained in terms of brain chemistry or synaptic processes, because these things are symptoms of consciousness (not causative principles ). To believe so is to subscribe to Dr Frankenstein&#39;s theory. True human life is to inquire about these differences through the many paths of yogic and meditative practice - where one can directly experience the nature of consciousness through a prescribed process. That is the greatest gift. Science is important for material analysis, but it can only take us to the barest perimeter of true knowledge, which is ultimately obtained via internal realization. I believe that consciousness is irreducable to matter - but material activity is evidence of the consciousness behind it. Others contend the opposite. Both are beliefs. The challenge is to decide which contention is the more intelligent - and where will that decision take us?

But if your reading this and yelling BS! 70 years isn&#39;t a long time at all when your dead,cause all living things are dead longer than they live. So turning into ashes for me is a HELL to the NAW. P.S. (eating someone&#39;s ashes is considered cannibalism) I don&#39;t mind someone keeping the ashes in a jar,especially if the dead person wished for it. But if you believe what I said even if its the slightest, you will take this info into consideration. The next time someone asks you what would you want to do with your body. And if I said is true when I die then..even if I or you die in the most peaceful unharming way,you will still feel pain.Because your body is already falling apart and cells dying,and no blood flowing.Other than hell or anything from it I&#39;d say death(after death and before hell) is second most painful. Alright ima stop typing before someone starts bringing up some religions and what they believe in or what&#39;s said in their religion about death.

I&#39;m not afraid of death, I just don&#39;t want to be there when it happens!&quot; (Grin) I also\u00a0wanted to mention\u00a0that Hospice offers\u00a0the best\u00a0solution for\u00a0end stage comfort. Anyone with a\u00a0life threatening illness of approximately\u00a08 months or less is able to hook up with Hospice. And\u00a0should the person decides to go into the hospital at the end, that too is okay. They will send in a hospice\u00a0nurse for\u00a01:1 care when their health starts to deteriorate.\u00a0\u00a0Yup, hook me up with a Foley cath and heaps of\u00a0morphine and valium at the end. \u00a0; )As far as life after death goes,\u00a0I do believe\u00a0our deceased\u00a0loved ones are with us at the end.\u00a0According to all the NDE testimony that\u00a0I&#39;ve read,\u00a0the various types of religion\u00a0(if any) makes absolutely\u00a0no difference whatsoever when it comes to moving on after death. I also found it rather interesting that if\u00a0the person wanted to see Jesus, Allah, Buddha, or\u00a0some other\u00a0Deity, then that&#39;s exactly\u00a0who appeared to them.\u00a0Well that, along with\u00a0the typical report of seeing a\u00a0tunnel\u00a0with a\u00a0bright light and especially\u00a0overwhelming feelings of\u00a0unconditional love as well. (Shrug)Btw- I actually\u00a0know of two elderly\u00a0people who experienced a NDE.\u00a0Both of these people had requested\u00a0&#39;Full Code&#39; status on their Advanced directive. They\u00a0both died during surgery\u00a0and were\u00a0and resuscitated. But upon their arrival back to the long term nursing care\u00a0facility, I noticed that they both had changed\u00a0their &#39;Advanced directive&#39; from a &#39;Full Code&#39; to a &#39;No Code&#39; status. So\u00a0I asked both of\u00a0them for a confirmation regarding this change. (Especially since they were both afraid to die.)\u00a0And yes, they both\u00a0pretty much reported the same reasons as to why they no longer wanted &#39;Full Code&#39; status. That when they died, they reported seeing\u00a0their deceased loved ones\u00a0in a landscape of indescribable beauty. That their loved ones had hugged them in\u00a0a reunion of\u00a0pure joy, and that they\u00a0could feel\u00a0the cocoon of &quot;Gods&quot;\u00a0unconditional love embrace them. That &#39;IF&#39;\u00a0they had\u00a0ONLY known what was waiting for them on the other side, that they never, EVER\u00a0would have requested a Full-Code status! In fact they both\u00a0went through a period of depression that they never fully snapped out of. They kept telling me how much they regretted their\u00a0&#39;Full Code&quot; decision and that\u00a0every day they longed to return to what they both\u00a0believed was\u00a0Heaven.\u00a0Lastly, I tend to believe in reincarnation myself.

So, if we all believe that the universe had started off as one ball of matter and some how expanded, what caused the expansion? With no forces in present, how would that be possible? I thought about it, and then theorized that the universe did not start out as that &quot;fireball,&quot; and it was already there and a massive object at the very center is pulling everything toward it, like it&#39;s not expanding, but shrinking.

So... bottom line is that most people go to hell.

I always like to ask myself this question when I feel that I know too much about reality as it is, a pretty arrogant question, which is &quot;Do you really think a pathetic mortal human like you can know it all? A wind of dust traveling the unknown vacuum of space with no purpose, no goal, and no reason whatsoever. How could such a waste of space claim to have full knowledge of everything?&quot; Well what if someone smarter than me can? But what is being smart or intelligent after all? Someone that just knows a lot right? But how can you call yourself smart or intelligent when you only know so much, and will only know so much. Our intelligence and ability to understand is limited due to our perspective of reality as it is. We can claim full knowledge of those things we can see, but that simply isn&#39;t enough because the opposite as it is right now will remain unknown until someone or something can uncover those mysteries, if they&#39;re even to exists.<br><br>Anyways, that&#39;s just my 2 cents.

Those who accept the only way into heaven live forever! At no cost, no sacrifice! It&#39;s so easy, so liberating! Believe in whatever you need about how the universe came to be, but please, I beg you, for your own sake, do not let this life slip by and not accept the grace of our savior. It&#39;s so easy for theists to get caught up in the minutia of our faith, but don&#39;t let that deter you. The only thing that matters is that you make the decision to turn back to God.
