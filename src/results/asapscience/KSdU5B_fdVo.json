Of course on different sound modes. We had put it on the lowest sound mode and the distance was 34cm, we went 1 modr higher and the distance was 2m and 64cm, we went one higher than the previous one and ended up with 8m and 64cm the next one was 17m and 64cm the next was 36m and 64 and the next one was 76m 64cm and we did our best making the space around us as quiet as possible. We saw an algorithm in this (from 8 meters). You take the number of meters and double it than you take 1 and add it up, for the next one you double it again only this time you dubble the 1 too so add 2, the next one you double it again and add 4 (the double of 2). But this algorithm can&#39;t go on forever right? Because that would mean that if you put it on the loudest mode the max. distance between you and the phone where you can hear it would be 60km (if the space around you was completely silent).  I would love to hear an answer because it seems impossible but maybe there is a chance that it is possible? Anyway the final question is.
