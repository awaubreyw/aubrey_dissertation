You belong to the roughly 1 to 5% of the world&#39;s population that have \r<br>what is known as a third eye or third ear -the ability to see and/or hear spirits and entities.\r<br>I&#39;ve dealt with this condition for more than 20 years now. There was even a time I considered \r<br>suicide. I&#39;ve analyzed my situation and dealt with it. I&#39;m alright now. \r<br>\r<br>Initially I took those pills and did therapy sessions as recommended but I never got better - the\r<br>voices were still there - they came back after my medication wore off. So I did my own research \r<br>and found out about the spiritual dimension of my condition. Medical Science ignores the effects\r<br>of spirits, they only see it as a medical/physical condition, believing that you&#39;re just suffering \r<br>from auditory hallucination etc. But if you&#39;re really having an auditory hallucination as they say, \r<br>then the sounds / voices should be RANDOM and WITHOUT LOGIC, PSYCHEDELIC like in an ACID TRIP. \r<br>Instead you hear clear, logical, grammatically correct sentence(s) in ENGLISH, NOT IN Chinese, \r<br>Swahili or robot-like speech !  Which means you&#39;re dealing with an intelligent being and your \r<br>brain is NOT FRIED.<br><br><br> Another thing, the beings know WHERE &amp; WHERE to attack you. If your brain is\r fried, you would have<br> these attacks 24/7 anywhere. But in my case it was more like ONLY 10% of the time daily and in certain <br>places only. Do you have diabetes, arthritis or high blood pressure ONLY 10% of the day or in certain<br>places only ?  Know what I&#39;m saying. So clearly the medical profession won&#39;t be able to cure you, not<br> knowing what the real problem is. If you don/t believe then,  do your own research, humor me. <br><br>\r<br>If you believe in God (I hope you do) then you also know that there are angels and demons,\r<br>wandering spirits and entities all around us. They are part of what the Bible terms as &quot; powers and \r<br>principalities &quot; that rule this earth.  You might think I&#39;m crazy weird but I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m a \r retired Civil Engineer <br>from the Philippines, did some 11 years of service in our government in the early 1980&#39;s as a water supply <br>engineer. I also visited the USA sometime in 1991 to 2000, took computer programming there and even made <br>it to the honors class, this while having these episodes !  You&#39;re not dealing with a wacko or a loser. I&#39;m serious, <br>analytical and in good physical and mental health, even  at my age (63 y/o).  At the height of my depression in<br> 2001, I turned to God and the Bible. So I&#39;m familiar with its many passages.<br><br>\r<br>Going back to the topic of spirits, this is what they do. These spirits can talk to us telephatically  or  by \r<br>using other meduims/people. When you speak to them, they speak back. Some are jealous of others people company. \r<br>They want to isolate you. They like certain parts of your home like your bedroom or bathroom where you are alone. \r<br>They can distort speech, make you hear/ think differently to confuse or anger you. They can imitate your friend \r<br>relative, or even your enemy. \rThey can produce other realistic sounds like\r the doorbell ringing, glass breaking,\r<br>walls pounding, cat purring or even wailing\r  police sirens ! They can play tricks on your mind. They want you to\r<br>be dependent on them or afraid of them - to isolate you from others. Some spirits attach themselves to you after \r<br>you visit a certain place like a cemetery, hospital or haunted house -places of pain and suffering.  \r<br>\r<br>Like people, some spirits are good while others are bad. There&#39;s even a certain type of spirit called the trickster\r<br>or joker who is naughty at most like a child. The irony of it is usually it is only you that can hear/see these things. \r<br>Like a TV channel, they can tune in to your wavelength, while ignoring others. So people think you&#39;re crazy. Since the\r<br>root problem is spiritual, the cure is also spiritual. Go to God and ask for His help/ protection. I hope and pray that\r<br>you find peace. Stop wasting your time and money on medicines and treatment - they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re dealing with\r<br>Sometimes psychiatry even puts the blame on you, the victim !  Whom would you rather believe God and His Word, or the \r<br>medical profession who right now are powerless against COVID-19 or even the common cold ?  \r<br>\r<br>SOME BIBLICAL PROOFS of the SPIRITS power to distort sounds / speech.  \r<br>\r<br>In the Bible you can read the Tower of Babel episode where the peoples languages were altered.  In the story of Gideon,\r<br>he and his men simply lighted torches and broke jars at night near the enemy camp. Their confused enemies then killed each\r<br>other ! How&#39;s that possible .. for a whole army ? Great deception by the spirits/ angels. In another story the apostle Paul, \r<br>on the way to Damascus hears the voice of Jesus Christ, while his companions only hear thunder. In another story, at a \r<br>gathering of new converts, the apostle Peter spoke to a crowd and they heard his message in their own language or tongue. etc \r<br>There are others Bible passages as well.", "comment_date": "2020-03-20T08:42:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "american freedom", "comment_text": "OR you maybe be a gang stalking victim/targeted individual ----v2k (mit microwave laser to the ear; LRAD system woody norris ted-talk; mad labs; audiospotlight) google: psycho electronic weapon effects.", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T19:31:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "hi", "comment_text": "I was upstairs and I hear someone say &quot;I know your here&quot; in a Mexican accent downstairs<br><br><br>I went downstairs and no one was there<br><br>Should I be worried?", "comment_date": "2020-03-06T21:42:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Belle", "comment_text": "The voice in my head is stupid", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T04:33:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wolf West", "comment_text": "How do I hear my voice inside my head?", "comment_date": "2020-02-21T08:47:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Devin Merchant", "comment_text": "Nothing helps me wtf", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T00:26:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The outdoor boys", "comment_text": "Bruh I always hear someone saying do it do it or like scream or laugh really loud and songs just play in my songs and I can\u2019t control it or like a catchy phrase won\u2019t get out my head like the time when ever I wanted to do rember", "comment_date": "2020-02-19T04:54:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thanh truong", "comment_text": "when I sleep I get chills through my whole body because at night I hear voices in my ear.

They could insert sounds, voices, visual images, there is no end to what they could do.<br><br>How could we prove that there are two different realities, the 3D reality, and the 4D reality.  Well, we could perform the famous too slit light experiment. If the experiment is being governed from the outside, the 4D side that is outside of the &quot;NOW&quot; time, and the experiment was run for say 5 minutes, all of the photons involved would interfere with each other over that time period because it is a four dimensional event. This would create an interference pattern that would be seen at the destination wall or screen.  From the outside, this would be seen as being a single 5 minute 4D event. However, if we placed detectors at the two slits to detect the photons passing through each slit, each detection would be an event in itself.  Thus we would have broken down the experiment into real time events. Thus it could no longer be governed from the outside as a single four dimensional event.  In turn, there would no longer be an interference pattern seen at the destination screen or wall, now that all the photon&#39;s are no longer interfering with each other, now that the experiment is being governed from the inside, the much smaller 3D side.", "comment_date": "2019-12-18T00:14:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cimeriez", "comment_text": "I\u2019m confused so do you hear like yourself talking In ur brain or other voices?

Meditation is the practice of quieting the mind. It can be difficult even for people who do not hear voices but with practice becomes easier. I believe that state of mind has much to do with the types of voices heard. If one, does a lot of negative self talk and has a negative outlook on life then the voices tend to be negative but this can be changed to positive and then the voice change to positive. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easy to do this, however, it gets easier with practice. I believe showing the voices love and compassion is also key. Try  telling them you love them and you want them to get out of the sadness they feel. You want them to be happy. Also looking at it from a different perspective can almost immediately shift your vibration and shift the &quot;evil&quot; voices to more positive or even stop them all together. There is nothing wrong with you. You are loved and you will improve. Believe it and you will receive it.

They gave me medication (I didn&#39;t have it bad ). They helped me through life a lot and now I live in a rv with two dogs! My cat died and I was close to her.. Rest in peace eden.

We didn&#39;t know that for 25 years. I need some suggestions. My mom had constant fear of terrorists who&#39;d kill her and our family because of her. She was a teacher and was always fearful of people plotting against her. My Elder brother and Father used to beat her up for almost a decade or around it. I remember that me and my twin used to run away with our mom at midnight outside our home saving our life because we feared our father would kill our mom and we&#39;d stray all the night on the roads till morning when my father would be asleep and back to normal from his alcohol levels . She would get ready and leave for her school to teach. She kept earning for us children to feed us never mentioning her conditions. We always believed it was God with us. And then we grew and became mature but our mom started fearing even more. Fast forward - Dec 2017- She was 66 years old and started talking to random imaginary people which we never saw her do all these years and it was scary. A week later she jumped up the 10 foot wall (she&#39;s only 5 foot 2 inches tall) and ran away running on the streets shouting terrorists have come for her and she wasn&#39;t even recognising me , we literally had to wait 16 days for her appointment to the doctor who treated her way back in 1999 and told my father it was depression (which was true and very vague as an explanation). This January 1st , 2018 I made notes of her behaviour all these years including her suicidal tendencies (poison drinking and then drinking fuel to kill herself) and talking to angels and God ,etc. We got her on this drug Risperidone by discontinuing Alprazolam (which she was immune to and it didn&#39;t work for her rather increasing her symptoms) . Risperidone worked awesomely after a period of a week and she has improved since January but recently now in May 2018 ,she&#39;s again started to have fears of neighbours plotting against killing our family and people listening to her (which she always had in all these 25 years) but she doesn&#39;t talk to random voices or have hallucinations like she did in December. My questions are :1)is she getting immune to Risperidone ? 2) Is her condition reverting to her maniac phase? 3) I stay in India and doctors here only experiment on patients here and even the best doctor in my city doesn&#39;t discuss much about her details with me what options do I have ? 4) are there questions you could suggest that I should ask to her doctor when I visit him next month on her routine checkup? 5) Is there anything that I could care for as she doesn&#39;t speak much after the medications and she&#39;s not expressive I fear she&#39;s hiding something. My mom is the world to me and I am not getting married so that I don&#39;t have to divide my time on a wife and a baby so to say. I want to do everything for my mom that I Can ,I just want her to have her old age years happy because she had enough of violence and social boycott and seeing her sleep beside me in that comfort and deep sleep is the most beautiful time of the day for me. My mother sleeping without fearing for her life ,without her loved ones abandoning her when she needs help is beyond expressions. I can&#39;t even imagine what my life would have been had my mother not worked and raised us up despite her illness and took horrifying beatings , burning, slitting, bone breaking ,thrashing my Dad gave her then and my mom would simply earn for us to feed us ,to raise us and wake up again and be beaten and treated like a housemaid. I want to be the best son and I feel sad that we ignored her conditions but on that would be the fault of her doctor who never told us that she suffered from schizophrenia and not depression. Thanks for reading what my heart felt. I pray for everyone who is suffering from this to get well soon and be brave ,you guys are heroes in real life. Prayers from India !

I was laying in bed, I couldn\u2019t sleep, hadnt closed my eyes yet and had the cover over my head because I\u2019m scared something will touch me. Anyway I heard a growling noise repetitively right behind my bed, not human, not dog, not cat. It was weird. Not happened since.\u00a0<br>Sometimes I hear people call my name, but it\u2019s still my inner voice. It\u2019s my inner voice, I can tell it\u2019s IN my head, not like the growling, but it\u2019s out of my control, and sometimes it says really weird stuff but in voices of people I know. Just weird jumbled sentences that make no sense.<br> Sometimes I believe things that aren\u2019t really normal.... It\u2019s embarrassing. Sometimes I believe I\u2019m someone and I feel fully convinced but I stop myself and think WHAT THE HELL AM I THINKING? I\u2019m a normal human being who will die and be forgotten like everyone else. I stared at a bug on the window today because I wondered if it was like Rita Skeeter and it was spying on me. I\u2019m not the main person in the universe, so why does my brain think so?<br> I have depression, anxiety and OCD, and ever since I\u2019ve started the medication I\u2019ve felt the closest to happy I\u2019ll probably ever get, except it\u2019s random and in bursts and I\u2019m all over the place all the time and I\u2019ve never had a true sense of who I am as a person and my friends are getting annoyed because I\u2019m hyper all the time, and then I\u2019ll randomly go all depressed again and I don\u2019t know why! I tried telling my therapist, but she said about it being hormones because I\u2019m 15 and obviously not fully developed yet. <br>It\u2019s like I don\u2019t have a personality.

I was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia and what I&#39;ve learned is that in every religion. Schizophrenia is basically hearing voices. What they don&#39;t tell you is that if you travel to places that don&#39;t speak your language you will hear the dialect that is spoken by the people in the place you&#39;ve traveled to.  Schizophrenia is not hearing voices. It is more complex than that.  It is more or less telepathy that hasn&#39;t been mastered by the conduit capable of doing it. I&#39;ve been practicing my faith. I&#39;m an omnist. I see all religions as equal in their end goal, empowering those that believe it.  So I&#39;ve connected all of them in some way or another and seen the truth of it.  The phone &quot;or door,&quot; people hear the voices speak of are just their way of explaining something that they themselves can&#39;t truly understand. It&#39;s a vibe. If you focus hard enough on your own vibe and strengthen your faith in yourself be it spiritually or simply just mentally.  Subconsciously you&#39;ll get into the habit of seeing it as a door or window that you seem to close through belief and faith alone. Don&#39;t be discouraged when seeing that it hasn&#39;t worked just yet. You have to look at it as, &quot; I can do this. If I can&#39;t close the door entirely yet, I can quiet them by the way I &quot;hear&quot; or rather perceive them (because realistically if you blast your head phones in your ear and still hear them, is it truly your ears? Or is it your brain that perceived another&#39;s thought as audio, just like the voice you use in your head when not reading aloud) schizophrenia is what doctors call telepathy that hasn&#39;t been controlled simply for the money that it brings both them and big pharma (the pharmaceutical companies producing the multiple drugs given to schizophrenia patients that most barely take anyways.) Be pacient, focus on ignoring them till you realize that the volume is lower until they are eventually gone and you have mastered what most of modern science cannot and what most religions have already known and preached. You don&#39;t hear ancestors for they are with you in silence but you hear the mind of a distant soul, god did not forsake you but merely gave you a psychic ability that you can&#39;t control just yet because he knew you&#39;d be strong enough to handle the battle and win, and if you believe in nothing? Believe in yourself and your ability to be hyper aware of the thoughts around you not convayed through speech , just like getting licked by a dog and knowing that it&#39;s doing it because it wants to show affection, how a kiss from your guardian or lover as if to say I love you, beyond words.  Believe in whatever you must but know one thing, no one one is normal because nobody lives the exact same way, everyone is crazy because we use the 4th dimension without knowing nearly half of the things about it such as telepathy (thought) and what we don&#39;t know makes us fear it it by human nature yet we don&#39;t fear all thought. Life is crazy but only as difficult as you make it.  And sometimes the unexplainable is something that we already knew in some light.

Hearing a call for help in the forest over the bird song, or the faint sound of a predator when the wind rattle every leave, these are example of a very complex process which can not be 100% reliable.<br><br>So, from time to time, the vacuum cleaner contain s stream of frequency similar to the door bell.

But. I got it. What I&#39;ve learned is there&#39;s two types. The one you get passed down in your DNA. Or the other. Medicine works for the genetic disorder.  But. I found If you believe hard enough that you can control it.  You can. But if you don&#39;t fully believe it will work you&#39;ll only get them to quiet a bit. This may sound crazy but so does life itself. Telepathy is as real as energy is. Believe with all of yourself and you&#39;ll get it.  If not. You need medication.  I had it passed down. I take no medication and am slowly healing through belief alone. There have been case studies on it.  Though you have it forever When you learn to control it, it&#39;s like the choice to believe in yourself. Even battling depression i still can do that and so can you. Your soul isn&#39;t scarred. You are not sick. You are one of the few who can do something that evolution has passed down to many living creatures in earth. The voices are not ghosts, they aren&#39;t all bad (just like youtube comments), and they are not out to get you.  Your brain is trying to make sense of what science can&#39;t just yet and what quantum physics is just starting to. Believe that you are not sick but have a psychic ability given to you by God and the universe for he is in all things.  Believe that with time you&#39;ll learn to control it and you will.  Multiple voices only means more people are trying to telepathically communicate with you. Your doctor&#39;s give you this medicine hoping it will work not knowing if it truly will because the pharmacy needs money to run itself. It could not even be a genetic problem at all.

The first time I got done the in shower, and when I pulled the shower curtain over to get out I started seeing white lights in my visions. They were like white embers or gnats, or white noise on t.v. and multiplied while drinking in my vision until I only saw white. At the same time I felt seriously lighted. So much so that I thought I would pass out so I made myself get to my knees and lay on the ground before I would pass out for fear of hurting myself.

Cocaine and other stimulants were more likely to cause it.<br><br>&quot;Abstract:<br>BackgroundAlthough cannabis abuse (CA) is known to be associated with schizophrenia, the causal nature of this association is unclear, with prodromal effects complicating its interpretation.MethodFrom Swedish national registry databases, we used a co-relative case\u2013control design with full-sibling, half-sibling and first-cousin comparisons, alongside a general Swedish population sample. Using ICD codes, 5456 individuals with an initial diagnosis of schizophrenia (2000\u20132010) were matched with five schizophrenia-free controls. We further identified first-cousin, half-sibling and full-sibling pairs discordant for CA and statistically extrapolated results for discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins.ResultsWithin the general Swedish population, CA was strongly associated with later schizophrenia [odds ratio (OR) 10.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.99\u201312.11]. This association was substantially attenuated both by increasing temporal delays between CA exposure and schizophrenia diagnosis and by controlling for increasing degrees of familial confounding. Extrapolated discordant MZ pairs suggested that fully controlling for confounding familial factors reduced the association between CA and later schizophrenia to more modest levels (ORs of approximately 3.3 and 1.6 with 3- and 7-year temporal delays respectively). Opiate, sedative, cocaine/stimulant and hallucinogen abuse were also strongly associated with subsequent schizophrenia in the general population. After controlling for familial confounding, only cocaine/stimulant exposure remained associated.ConclusionsCA has an appreciable causal impact on future risk for schizophrenia. However, population-based estimates of cannabis\u2013schizophrenia co-morbidity substantially overestimate their causal association. Predictions of the cases of schizophrenia that might be prevented by reduced cannabis consumption based on population associations are therefore likely to be considerably overestimated.&quot;<br><br>Giordano, G.
