I was never obese, but was overweight at 5&#39;8M and 180lbs. Did Atkins 40g and went down to 150lbs in about two and a half months. I feel like the video, while having good intentions, kind of misunderstood exactly what low carb is about. <br><br>The video talked about how eating low carb could promote consumption of things like high-fat red meats and cheese. This part is true, I ate a lot more red meat and dairy. He is also right in saying that these foods are not the healthiest to eat in high amounts. But where I feel like he goes wrong is he acts like people stay on very strict low carb diets for the rest of their life, this is simply not true. Low carb diets are intended for you to lose a lot of weight fast, but you aren&#39;t meant to stay on a very strict low carb diet once you lose all that weight. I did eat unhealthy meats and cheeses on atkins, but once I lost the weight I implemented a 90g carb diet that would maintain my weight. I no longer eat high amounts of meats and cheeses, and eat a lot of vegetables and fruits now. <br><br>Think of the long-term pros vs cons. A low carb-diet may in the short-run lead to high consumption of some unhealthy things, but imho that brief period that eventually leads to massive weight reduction is way worth it in the grand scheme of things. Obesity related diseases are the #1 killer in the U.S. and its not even close. I think its worth it to go on a diet that may be unhealthy in some ways, but in the end massively mitigates the potential for you to suffer from something that is even more unhealthy.", "comment_date": "2020-10-19T19:34:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcus Roberts", "comment_text": "Diets don&#39;t work.

I\u2019m an English teacher. One thing which many people don\u2019t realize is that eating is actually a form of communication, it can be a symbol of misery. What we choose to eat, when, and how much, are an integral part of our daily lives. So when people get fat by overeating, the solution is not just to diet and exercise. Many people eat too much as a response to loneliness. So to cure the problem of being overweight, you also have to cure the problem of being lonely. Look at this chart: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9h_95NgZ4G/?igshid=yyu8wnfdtg3g\">https://www.instagram.com/p/B9h_95NgZ4G/?igshid=yyu8wnfdtg3g</a>.  You will see that being overweight is a source of shame. People who are ashamed tend to isolate. And when they isolate, they eat more out of loneliness, and self-hatred, Now look at this chart: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CCWzfL0Ds_R/?igshid=x8v1f4fpqd1y\">https://www.instagram.com/p/CCWzfL0Ds_R/?igshid=x8v1f4fpqd1y</a>. It shows that there are three types of loneliness: collective, social, and intimate. In order to break the cycle of self-punishment, an overweight person must cure all three types of loneliness. That means developing better relationships. And a greater number of relationships. The more friends and acquaintances, the better. Increased friendship and intimacy with other people will reduce feelings of loneliness; which will reduce the feelings of being stigmatized; which will reduce the self-destructive tendency of eating too much.  Go to Church, Volunteer, join a Hiking Club. Anything which widens a person\u2019s social circle will lead toward less loneliness, and greater self-esteem. People with high self-esteem take responsibility for their own future. So really, there is no such thing as a \u201cdiet\u201d. There are only lifestyle choices. One choice is to stay at home, and be sad. The other choice is to engage the world, make a lot of friends, and be happy. People who are happy make better choices.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T20:00:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M.

This comment was not meant to be a joke. I take mental health and eating disorders very seriously, and would never joke about them. They are serious issues, especially today, and should not be joked about, as it can make people who have had to deal with these issues feel that their problem doesn&#39;t matter to anyone else.<br><br>2. I know what bulimia is. Bulimia is an eating disorder in which you binge food and then force yourself to throw it up, making many of the calories consumed void, like you haven&#39;t eaten much at all. The point wasn&#39;t necessarily that you didn&#39;t put food in your mouth, but that many of the calories consumed were in one way or another disposed of before the body could use them as fuel.<br><br>3. There was a comment that brought up intermittent fasting. This is different to an eating disorder because you still get the calories that you need in a day, and so while you can still loose weight from it, it&#39;s a healthy and safe alternative to developing an eating disorder. Please do note that with certain other medical issues, like diabetes, intermittent fasting may not work, and could even have serious detriments to your health. Also note that I am not a doctor, but have learned this from personal experience.<br><br>I hope this edit clears a few things up, for those whining in the replies of this comment.", "comment_date": "2019-03-21T02:54:50Z", "likes_count": 629}, {"comment_by": "Imran Syed", "comment_text": "Proceeds to give the finger to all diets without telling us which is the best", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T22:46:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chewie Bacca", "comment_text": "Yeah I\u2019m really good at keeping a great diet!<br><br><br><br><br><br>....for the first five minutes", "comment_date": "2019-03-15T05:14:52Z", "likes_count": 87}, {"comment_by": "cris", "comment_text": "Tried caloric restriction and cardio but only lose 1lb a week.

Fruit has fibre and other nutrients that block the negative effects that sugar can have. So adding blueberries to your bowl of sugary cereal can help block some of the detrimental effects of the sugar in the cereal.

Any store that sell seasonings have hundred different types of spices, buy like 100 grams of each say 10-15 varieties of seasonings that you might like by their smell and taste.

These guidelines are essential for superior results. They will take you to the Promised Land, flowing with good health and energy.<br><br>Sadly, many dieters miss out on one or more of these rules, and it costs them their success.<br><br>Thou Shall Eat More Protein<br>Of all the foods you might eat while on a fat loss diet, protein is probably the most important. Protein combats hunger, stabilizes blood glucose levels, and prevents lean muscle loss. The result is raised metabolism and accelerated fat loss.<br><br>Don\u2019t let your protein intake fall short. Aim to consume some in every meal and snack. For some unexpected sources of protein, consider quinoa, bulgur, avocado, and whole wheat bagels.<br><br>Thou Shall Eat Regularly<br>You may have heard that metabolism increases the more often you eat. That\u2019s somewhat misleading. Actually, the boost you get from a meal is directly related to meal size \u2014 eating regularly does help keep hunger at bay.<br><br>Feed your body frequently throughout the day to avoid food cravings and energy lows. Those who follow this guideline are more likely to stick to their diet or weight loss program.<br><br>Thou Shall Prioritize Fresh Foods<br>When selecting your foods, remember processed foods are a sin. Eating fresh is a must. In our world, processed foods are around every corner, waiting to cause weight gain and thwart our efforts for a healthy life.<br><br>Eliminate processed food and give your diet a major boost. Focus on natural foods, like fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and oils, and lean proteins. This isn\u2019t the Garden of Eden\u2014reaching for the apple is the right choice.<br><br>You could call this commandment the Golden Rule of dieting. If you make only one change to your diet plan, make this one.<br><br>Thou Shall Set Short Term Goals<br>One diet rule that you should abide by is to continually set short term goals. Think about your strategy in the here and now, not months ahead. If your goals can only be achieved far down the road, it becomes too easy to lose sight of them.<br><br>You should also ensure that you put your goals in writing and tell a friend or family member about your intentions. The accountability will redouble your commitment.<br><br>Try thinking in two-week segments. Two weeks is generally the period necessary to form good habits, so it\u2019s the perfect amount of time to build behaviors that stand the test of time.<br><br>This is precisely why The 2 Week Diet was created. It will help you stay motivated and consistent until good decisions become automatic.<br><br>Thou Shall Avoid Fruitless Comparisons<br>Finally, stop comparing yourself to others. Realize this is your journey. Your body is unique and you won\u2019t see the same results as everyone else, so don\u2019t expect to.<br><br>Instead, start comparing yourself today to yourself from yesterday. That will give you everything you need to know. If you improve every day, or hold fast to your diet program, then you are already a success.<br><br>Keep these diet commandments in mind.

A calorie of carbohydrate (say, sucrose) does not act on your body in the same way a calorie of fat or protein does. Sugars induce the release of insulin, a hormone which directs your body to use sugars as energy. Chronically high blood sugar means chronically high blood insulin levels, leading of course to insulin resistance typical of metabolic syndrome and T2 diabetes. Because insulin causes your body to burn mostly if not only carbs as energy, having chronically high insulin levels can make it difficult or impossible to lose fat that you have already accumulated, even if you&#39;re eating a caloric deficit. This is why ketogenic or similar low-carb diets are so successful for losing adipose tissue and weight - it removes those roadblocks of high blood sugar and high insulin levels that prevent your body from relying on your fat reserves as energy. Not only that, but it also reduces chronic inflammation and tissue damage caused by excessively high blood sugar (read up on what high levels of sugar does to your blood and veins, it&#39;s pretty gross)<br><br>This all means that YOU are STILL in control of your weight and what you consume.

I merely cut out simple carbs, (I drank 23grams of sugar every time I worked out in the form of a canned iced tea), except the odd raw ear of corn as a snack,  and put NO restrictions on higher carb root veggies like carrots.  I was a little more conservative about beans but I ate chili every now and then in a decent portion size (1 to 1 1/2c), and in addition, I started walking.  I started walking at a 1/2 mile a day and worked my way up to 5 miles a day, and some days I would go and swim or do treadmill at the local rec center for a change of pace.  I wouldn&#39;t really count my daily carbs, and I ate tons more veggies than just huge amounts of red meats.  I&#39;m not a big fan of pork anyway, so I wan&#39;t binging on bacon or ribs or anything.  Also, every now and then I&#39;d just CRAVE pizza or bread or pasta to the point it would be something that would drive me absolutely nuts... So, I&#39;d go eat it. (We&#39;re talking once a month or so, I&#39;d eat two slices of pizza, or a cup of pasta).  Worked wonders and I found it really sustainable for me, until I came to Canada where I couldn&#39;t find a lot of the sugar-free foods I&#39;d come to rely on.  (Sugar free chocolate cake mix+ Can of pumpkin = AMAZING CUPCAKES, by the way, for any kind of diet except gluten free, 200 calories and very low in carbs, relatively speaking) 2)The new weight watchers plan has veggies and fruits as 0 points, to encourage people to eat more of them, and an activity tracker and goals each week, to get people to also exercise, to get people moving.  The points system is now based on calories, saturated fat, sugar, and protein content. It&#39;s not merely calorie restriction.  That&#39;s what I do now and I&#39;ve had success with it. I&#39;ve lost 17 of the 30lbs I gained back after the move, in a month. (I have one of those metabolisms though, I lose weight pretty easily), and I still tend to choose not to eat simple carbs for my points, and go with more lean proteins, avoid cow&#39;s milk, (but I still love cheese, even a lower fat cheese is fine by me), and love a morning omelette.

So we thought we\u2019d create a simple video<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m04s\">0:04</a>investigating which ones are scientifically sound, and actually work.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m08s\">0:08</a>From the outside it seems like a simple equation: your weight is determined by the balance between<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m12s\">0:12</a>the calories you take in, and the calories you burn. By changing what you eat or your<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m16s\">0:16</a>activity level, you can tip this equation towards weight gain or loss. Which brings<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m21s\">0:21</a>us to our first category of diets:<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m24s\">0:24</a>Calorie Restriction. Companies like Weight Watchers claim you can eat whatever you want,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m27s\">0:27</a>as long as you stay below a prescribed number of daily calories. Getting all your calories<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m32s\">0:32</a>from junk food is technically allowed, but from a health perspective, it\u2019s important<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m36s\">0:36</a>to think of the nutritional value of the foods too. If you don\u2019t, you risk heart problems,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m41s\">0:41</a>nutrient deficiencies and chronic health issues.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m43s\">0:43</a>Calorie Restriction with Optimal Nutrition or CRON diets, generally reduce their caloric<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m48s\">0:48</a>intake by 20% while still meeting the daily nutritional requirements. For example, instead<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m53s\">0:53</a>of having a whole apple, a CRON dieter will just have the apple skin, which contains most<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m58s\">0:58</a>of the nutrients.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=0m59s\">0:59</a>If used properly (and not excessively), calorie restriction can be a safe and effective tool<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m03s\">1:03</a>for weight loss.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m04s\">1:04</a>Next up is Carb Restriction. Many diets like the South Beach, Atkins, or Zone Diet suggest<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m09s\">1:09</a>that carbs are the enemy of the fit body you\u2019ve always dreamed of.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m13s\">1:13</a>The ideology claims that when more carbs are taken in than burned off, the liver converts<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m17s\">1:17</a>them into fats. But for most healthy, reasonably active people, carbs are broken down to glucose<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m23s\">1:23</a>and transported to the cells for energy. Very little is actually turned into fat.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m27s\">1:27</a>In response to excessive glucose, the body uses insulin to turn it into glycogen, which<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m32s\">1:32</a>is stored in the liver and muscles. This glycogen may later be broken down in times of low glucose,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m37s\">1:37</a>to refuel the body.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m38s\">1:38</a>But the type of carbs you eat do matter - those from simple sugars like honey, fruit or sugar<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m44s\">1:44</a>are more readily turned into triglycerides or fat than complex carbs like whole grains<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m49s\">1:49</a>and veggies. If you consistently eat way more than necessary, and most calories are simple<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m55s\">1:55</a>carbs, then these will be converted to fat.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=1m57s\">1:57</a>Low carb diets often have extreme restriction at first; no starches like bread or pasta,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m02s\">2:02</a>and no sugars including from fruits or even alcohol. This can lead to some intense side<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m07s\">2:07</a>effects, including constipation, dry mouth, bad breath, fatigue, dizziness and nausea.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m12s\">2:12</a>In studies, carb restriction dieters tend to lose weight faster, initially, compared<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m17s\">2:17</a>to those simply using calorie restriction, but this is likely due to water loss, which<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m21s\">2:21</a>returns in later phases when you\u2019re encouraged to eat normally again.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m25s\">2:25</a>On top of this, the Atkins diet, for example, promotes caloric intake from high-fat and<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m29s\">2:29</a>high-protein sources, which means meats, cheeses, cream, butter and...losing weight? Sounds<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m35s\">2:35</a>pretty good right? But many doctors show concern over the high intake of saturated fat - that<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m41s\">2:41</a>may lead to more \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol and therefore an increased risk of heart disease.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m45s\">2:45</a>Some claim these kinds of diets are dangerous and unhealthy, given that they promote the<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m48s\">2:48</a>limitation of foods like carrots, sweet potatoes, or apples, that provide the body with important<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m53s\">2:53</a>micronutrients and vitamins. Instead, people require supplements, which the body is not<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=2m58s\">2:58</a>able to absorb as effectively as vitamins, minerals and micronutrients in whole foods.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m02s\">3:02</a>Then there are High Protein Diets. The main principle is that protein rich foods are not<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m07s\">3:07</a>as easily broken down by the body and take more energy to digest than carb-rich food.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m12s\">3:12</a>This means you won\u2019t feel hungry again as quickly, and you\u2019re more likely to run a<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a>caloric deficit than if you ate the same number of calories from carbs.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a>The Paleo Diet, for example, suggests that 10,000 years ago agriculture was introduced,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m24s\">3:24</a>and the human diet changed from hunter-gathers eating primarily meat, wild fruits, veggies<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m29s\">3:29</a>and nuts, to diets containing more grains. And as a result, some believe the human body<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m34s\">3:34</a>isn\u2019t designed to digest these processed foods like grains, dairy, and breads. Some<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m39s\">3:39</a>also believe that grains lead to inflammation related health problems, but this is largely<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m43s\">3:43</a>untrue except in the case of people with celiac disease.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m47s\">3:47</a>But because of it\u2019s straightforward guidelines, many find it easy to follow, and it does promote<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m51s\">3:51</a>more nutrient absorption. However, as paleo cuts out all grains and legumes, we lose an<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=3m56s\">3:56</a>important source of dietary fibre necessary to keep our bowels running smoothly. Not to<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m01s\">4:01</a>mention the high protein leads to nitrogen production meaning stinky farts! Add to that<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m07s\">4:07</a>constipation which allows your digested material to sit longer in the large intestine and continuing<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m12s\">4:12</a>to decompose and...yup. Smelly farts.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m15s\">4:15</a>Now there is another class of diets we might call the \u201cJust Stop Eating\u201d Diets. Those<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a>looking to \u2018get slim quick\u2019 might be tempted to only eat cabbage soup for 7 days, or do<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m25s\">4:25</a>the \u2018Master Cleanse Diet\u2019 which only allows salt water in the morning and a concoction<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m29s\">4:29</a>of water, maple syrup, lemon and cayenne pepper through the day, and a laxative tea at night<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m35s\">4:35</a>- but these diets are exceptionally unhealthy. Not only is most of your weight loss from<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m39s\">4:39</a>water weight, but there are many side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, dehydration and<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m43s\">4:43</a>nausea.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m44s\">4:44</a>The Master Cleanse can ever lead to a white tongue, which some claim is the toxins leaving<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m49s\">4:49</a>your body, but it\u2019s actually due to swelling and a yeast infection of the mouth. And after<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m54s\">4:54</a>going through all that, you\u2019re likely to gain any weight lost after stopping.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=4m57s\">4:57</a>Then of course there are straight up crazy diets. Like eating cotton balls dipped in<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m01s\">5:01</a>soup or juice so that you feel full, which of course provides hardly any nutritional<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m05s\">5:05</a>content and can cause intestinal blockages which require surgical intervention.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m10s\">5:10</a>Or how about the sleeping beauty diet where you just...sleep? You can\u2019t eat if you\u2019re<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m15s\">5:15</a>always asleep! The truth is most diets focusing on quick, dramatic results also have a \u2018yo-yo\u2019<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m21s\">5:21</a>effect, where you lose initial weight but slow down your metabolic rate, so your body<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m25s\">5:25</a>starts burning less calories. And when you start eating again...there\u2019s all the weight<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m29s\">5:29</a>back, and often more!<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m31s\">5:31</a>After following contestants from the show \u2018The Biggest Loser\u2019 for 6 years - some<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m34s\">5:34</a>of which who had lost hundreds of pounds in 7 months - scientists noticed something interesting.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m40s\">5:40</a>Not only did most of the participants in the study regain their weight, but their metabolic<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m44s\">5:44</a>rates changed. One man in particular now burns 800 fewer calories a day than would be expected<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m50s\">5:50</a>for a man his size! This is 6 years after leaving the show, showing how extreme measures<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=5m56s\">5:56</a>to lose weight - while they may be successful at the time - have long lasting impacts on<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=6m01s\">6:01</a>your metabolism, making it harder to keep off weight in the future.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=6m04s\">6:04</a>The hard truth is, that even using many of the principled diets, about 97% of people<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=6m09s\">6:09</a>regain everything lost and sometimes more within 3 years. If you want to lose weight,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=6m15s\">6:15</a>finding a diet that works for you and keeps you motivated, with small incremental changes<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=6m19s\">6:19</a>is important. Of course, a number on a scale doesn\u2019t measure how healthy a person is,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPl0naO6GR0&amp;t=6m24s\">6:24</a>though many struggle with this perception.

The reason you cut out carbs is not to avoid them getting stored as fat, its rather to burn fat (using ketones for energy) instead of glycogen. The problem is, it takes about a few weeks before your body develops the metabolic machinery to be able to do this. In that time you will often have horrible side effects as your body and brain need carbs to function, this is what leads you to crave carbs, give in and &quot;yo-yo&quot; the weight back on. If you are very motivated and know what you&#39;re doing, this is the most effective fat loss diet.

The diet works best if you stick to it but if you think itll be too hard or want to enjoy good food you can do cheat meals or even cheat days, the max cheat days you should do is 2(a weekend). I lost the weight by eating 1 bowl of cereal in milk for my daily meals(specifically rice krispies but any cereal is fine), my friend did it with oatmeal(idk how many he would eat in his daily meals, i would guess 2-3 packs). Just find a way that works for you, its important to do something you can sustain so its better to add 1-2 cheat meals/days than trying to diet too hard and breaking the diet completely. Id recommend eating 1 medium-large bowl of a relatively healthy cereal during the week days and eating a relatively healthy cheat meal on saturday and sunday, but try to do it with no cheat meals for 3-6 weeks and if it doesnt start getting easier(body getting used to it) or if you constantly thinking about food and worried about breaking the diet then add cheat a cheat meal saturday and/or sunday.", "comment_date": "2016-11-12T07:33:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SlowBoyAthlete", "comment_text": "The most intriguing diet is the Antarctica Diet.

I&#39;d advise looking into what types of LDL specifically it raises/lowers (as it does have trends)- but when many people are concerned about LDL cholesterol it&#39;s likely that they associate it with metabolic syndrome or heart disease. There are 5 primary factors of metabolic syndrome, obesity (primarily around the stomach), low HDL, high triglycerides high blood pressure, and of course high fasting glucose. <br><br> When one examines the effect of a keto diet on these metrics, it becomes apparent that keto (or ones similar to) have positive effect on nearly all of them.

Also, the &quot;Biggest Loser&quot; study which claims that diets permanently slow down your metabolism has some flaws, so I wouldn&#39;t consider it proof.

However, I&#39;m glad you included two very important facts: 1) no matter what you eat, even if it&#39;s processed and sugary, it can&#39;t turn into fat as long as you&#39;re not overstepping your caloric budget and 2) you need to make sustainable changes if you want your weight loss endeavors to succeed.
