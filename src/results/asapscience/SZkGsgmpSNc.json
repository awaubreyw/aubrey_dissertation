In Southeast Asia, spoons are the primary utensil used for eating; forks are used to push foods such as rice onto the spoon as well as their western usage for piercing the food.<br><br>Spoons are also widely used in cooking and serving. In baking, batter is usually thin enough to pour or drop from a spoon; a mixture of such consistency is sometimes called &quot;drop batter\u201d. Rolled dough dropped from a spoon to a cookie sheet can be made into rock cakes and other cookies, while johnnycake may be prepared by dropping spoonfuls of cornmeal onto a hot greased griddle.<br><br>A spoon is similarly useful in processing jelly, sugar and syrup. A test sample of jelly taken from a boiling mass may be allowed to slip from a spoon in a sheet, in a step called &quot;sheeting&quot;. At the &quot;crack&quot; stage, syrup from boiling sugar may be dripped from a spoon, causing it to break with a snap when chilled. When boiled to 240\u00b0F. and poured from a spoon, sugar forms a filament, or &quot;thread&quot;. Hot syrup is said to &quot;pearl&quot; when it forms such a long thread without breaking when dropped from a spoon.<br><br>Used for stirring, a spoon is passed through a substance with a continued circular movement for the purpose of mixing, blending, dissolving, cooling, or preventing sticking of the ingredients. Mixed drinks may be &quot;muddled&quot; by working a spoon to crush and mix ingredients such as mint and sugar on the bottom of a glass or mixer. Spoons are employed for mixing certain kinds of powder into water to make a sweet or nutritious drink. A spoon may also be employed to toss ingredients by mixing them lightly until they are well coated with a dressing.<br><br>For storage, spoons and knives were sometimes placed in paired knife boxes, which were often ornate wooden containers with sloping top, used especially during the 18th century. On the table, an ornamental utensil called a nef, shaped like a ship, might hold a napkin, knife and spoon.<br>", "comment_date": "2015-02-15T17:18:57Z", "likes_count": 147}, {"comment_by": "Garrett", "comment_text": "&quot;Sniff a stiff&quot;", "comment_date": "2015-02-15T17:18:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jonas samuel", "comment_text": "I am looking forward to women hopping around and wiggeling with their ears xD.", "comment_date": "2015-02-15T17:18:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carter Reid", "comment_text": "Like this comment if u love science ", "comment_date": "2015-02-15T17:18:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noorquacker", "comment_text": "Maybe I should look at the title before I watch YouTube on my phone...
