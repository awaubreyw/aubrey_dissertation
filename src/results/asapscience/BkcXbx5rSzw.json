[{"comment_by": "Mount Zion,\nHeavenly Jerusalem, Angel Gabriel", "comment_text": "Do not be deceived, there is no cure for aging and stop death, but there is only one way!\r<br>Why do people get old and die?\r<br>The words of God is not a made up Book, but it came from Israel. It is written in the words of God His original plan that the people on earth will not get look old nor die but live forever. Adam and Eve committed sin, death entered and it ended life. The good news is the Lord God will restore the earth back as the Garden of Eden. \r<br>\r<br>Acts 3:21\r<br>Whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.\r<br>\r<br>There are two kinds of people in this world: Children of Israel and Gentile. It used to be the world is only filled with the Gentile people. It is written in the words of God, He called the Gentile people ungodly because they only live by whatever they think is right and counsel of their own hearts. They are like animals that have no understanding between good and evil.\r<br>\r<br>Ecclesiastes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkcXbx5rSzw&amp;t=3m18s\">3:18</a>\r<br>I said in my heart, \u201cConcerning the condition of the sons of men, God tests them, that they may see that they themselves are like animals.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>They built their own nations and governments, wrote laws that they can only follow, and formed religions that they can only believe. Many of them even named themselves after the name of the Christ for believing they can live forever even without obeying the Law that the Lord Jesus gave to Moses. \r<br>\r<br>Exodus 3:14\r<br>And God said to Moses, \u201cI AM WHO I AM.\u201d And He said, \u201cThus you shall say to the children of Israel, \u2018I AM has sent me to you.\u2019 \r<br>\r<br>John 8:58\r<br>Jesus said to them, \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>The result of disobedient life, people get sick, old and die without knowledge why these things happen to them. \r<br>\r<br>Job 36\r<br>If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. But if they do not obey, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.\r<br>\r<br>The Lord God who is the God of love showed mercy to them; He called Abraham out of the Gentile people and washed him by making him follow His laws and commandments. The Lord God\u2019s intention through Abraham\u2019s seeds that He will build a country as Israel where the Gentile people can seek His truth about their lives on earth and live by it, so that they can live as the tree, you cut it down but it grows back, and not as the animals. \r<br>\r<br>Job 14:7-10\r<br>For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its tender shoots will not cease. Though its root may grow old in the earth, and its stump may die in the ground, yet at the scent of water it will bud and bring forth branches like a plant. But man dies and is laid away; Indeed he breathes his last and where is he?\r<br>\r<br>So, Israel became a teacher of the Gentile people to guide them to the path of truth where they can regain forever life. Israel committed sin by crucifying the Lord Jesus. The Lord God took His Kingdom from them and gave to the nation that will guide the people of Gentile to the truth. This Kingdom is called Mount Zion, Heavenly Jerusalem. It is now located in the east part of the earth. The Book of Isaiah called it PLACE OF FEET OF GOD. \r<br>\r<br>Isaiah 60:13\r<br>The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; And I will make the place of My feet glorious.\r<br>\r<br>Matthew 21\r<br>Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it. And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder. Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking of them.\r<br>\r<br>Hebrews 12:22\r<br>But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels.\r<br>\r<br>There is a province called Negros in the Philippines. It is the only island has the shape of a man\u2019s foot. If you are seeking God\u2019s holy truth about life and death, look for Mount Zion, Heavenly Jerusalem. It is the only place on earth where you can get truly saved. No vitamin, medicine or surgery that can save you from aging and death, but it is only by living in the truth, and this truth is obeying the laws and commandments of God.  \r<br>\r<br>Job 33\r<br>His flesh shall be young like a child\u2019s, he shall return to the days of his youth. He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him, he shall see His face with joy, for He restores to man His righteousness. Then he looks at men and says, \u2018I have sinned, and perverted what was right, and it did not profit me.\u2019 He will redeem his soul from going down to the Pit, and his life shall see the light.\r<br>\r<br>Isaiah 28:16-18\r<br>Behold, I lay in Zion a stone for a foundation, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; Whoever believes will not act hastily.\r<br>Also I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plummet; The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place. Your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand;\r<br>\r<br>Lord God of hosts, Holy Father\r<br>Lord of hosts, Lord Jesus\r<br>The Spirit and the bride\r<br>Mount Zion, Heavenly Jerusalem\r<br>Gabriel, an angel of the Lord", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T15:56:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Subjektive Gaming", "comment_text": "I old :( faaaak", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T17:02:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "E.
