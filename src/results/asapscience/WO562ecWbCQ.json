I guess one reason would be that most roofs in the US (and probably most modern roofs everywhere) are covered in shingles.  Those shingles are made out of up to 35% asphalt which gives them a dark color.   Singles are probably pretty much impossible to paint.      So; we&#39;d have to switch to something else to roof the houses in.<br><br>Btw,  there IS a benefit to having a dark colored roof during the winter months.   Any sun will heat it up and therefor heat up the inside of the house a bit.... but that amount of heat is probably very small. I&#39;m betting the white roof would end up saving MORE money in the long run between heating and cooling the house and be more worth it then a dark roof.<br><br>I live on the 2nd story of a house with a dark shingle roof.

Can we ant like humans make a blind bit of difference to the temperature of the planet, compared with that great big ball of nuclear fusion inundating us with heat and radiation? Isn&#39;t this whole thing in the realm of climate controlled underpants? I look out the window, I walk across the road, and it is no hotter in summer than it was when I was a kid, and I&#39;m 73 now; the road tar still melted in the heat back then; my country had raging temperatures and droughts back in the 19th century; Carbon dioxide, at 400 to 600ppm, is just 0.04% to 0.06% of the atmosphere, merely a trace gas, just enough for plant survival, which is threatened below 200ppm, or 0.02% of the atmosphere. Predictions of the end have routinely failed since the climate modellers began modelling, and keep on failing. People say we&#39;re all going to die, and soon, yet they won&#39;t use nuclear power as a solution. very strange, if they are really serious; or is it all an elaborate, exciting little  mind game, darlings? Two of my old friends, a guy and a gal, placed bets with me that all life on earth would be extinguished within 10 years of our bet at the restaurant where we were lunching together, and I thought they were joking. Both very intelligent people. I bet everything would be fine, and they rolled on the floor laughing; they said: You can&#39;t possibly collect on this bet, as we will all be dead! That was on 12 of January, 2015; I considered my options carefully, and chose a five course meal with champagne and wine, in an expensive restaurant of my choice, and they thought that even more hilarious. It is now 21 January, 2022; the 12 of January 2025 is just days less than three years off, and it will give me great pleasure to sit there and trim those suckers for the bill! All other things, of course, being equal. Still, I love these Candide like innocents on this channel with their dinky, happily neurotic little plans for saving the planet. Is this some vast, cosmic joke by the powers that be, to give us an alternative religion, and simultaneously and outrageously gouge more taxes out of us, while they laugh at us all for being such honky tonk rubes? Who knows? Just sayin&#39;. And I still don&#39;t see the slightest difference in either the weather or the climate, other than the usual, isolated random extremes.

It&#39;s an absorption refrigerator.  The Amish still makes large versions that are powered by natural gas or propane and Domestic still makes a model that used kerosene and was popular with cabins that were not hooked up to utilities.  For quite some time, RV&#39;s and hotels used these refrigerators as they are completely silent as they have no compressor but they have recently fallen out of favor with both of these applications as people now expect refrigerators to be noisy.  There are many antique domestics that were used in farm houses but many were used for target practice so may not work too well without doing some plumbing repairs.  Amana was actually a religious group that like the Amish made absorption refrigerators and that&#39;s how they got started as an appliance manufacturer.  I think the Amish ones are branded Diamond or Crystal and they use D cells for the refrigerator light (you need a vent and a natural gas outlet if you want to use one).<br><br>Now using Peltier modulE&#39;s is what I would consider cheating.

I emigrated from Britain to rural Spain, where there are traditional building methods that reduce the need for cooling (and heating in winter.) Other than the white paint you mention,  older homes are built largely from earth and stone, with walls a meter or more thick at ground level, have small windows predominantly on the north-facing side of the house and may have internal rooms with no window at all. They have an empty upper story, used for storage, drying laundry etc. while the family lives on the lower story or stories. (People who have modernised to make use of this space often maintain a bedroom on the lower floor for the hottest weather.) The main cooking area, and often the bathroom as well, is separate from the body of the house (although there may also be a winter kitchen, often a later addition.) These ideas may not be all be practicable, especially in cities, but they are astonishingly effective.
