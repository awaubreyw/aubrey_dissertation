After the alpha male has become drunk beyond all reasonable doubt, he makes his trip home to the best of his ability dodging police, sides of roads, mailboxes and stoplights. After he has arrived to his home, he then sets his family straight, and tells them how it is and how it is going to be. He often does this for the lulz.

I took so many shots because I wanted to feel drunk, but it never occurred to me that it would take time for it to happen. So after about 10 shots or so I started to feel a little woozy and fuzzy so I stopped drinking, hid the bottle, and masked the smell of everything and got everything back to normal before I got too wild. About 15 minutes later I was hammered. Good thing I had started a voice recording on my phone before I went out of it so now I have a few hours of complete none sense on voice recording. The hard drunk ness lasted about 8 hours. I slept for about 3 of those hours. Then my parents came home and the whole family went out to eat. By then i wasn\u2019t nearly as drunk, but I had bad hiccups and was still a little fuzzy in the head. So when we went out I was still saying a few weird things and laughing a little bit excessively. But I didn\u2019t get caught, and the rest of that bottle of alcohol is still hidden in my room today, 6 years later", "comment_date": "2017-10-01T21:14:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cali Ciccarelli", "comment_text": "can you do the science of blacking out", "comment_date": "2017-09-29T16:59:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Raschkovsky", "comment_text": "&lt;ol im so fucked up rghty now i cnt thin k about what  im saying lol", "comment_date": "2017-09-27T04:55:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "KMX", "comment_text": "Do your brain on salvia", "comment_date": "2017-09-26T02:18:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cyr Media", "comment_text": "This is making it look to good and not so damaging you idiots, no wonder you are popular, stupid and bad influence is popular in this country", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T15:24:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Roman", "comment_text": "Who else drinks alone then gets mood swings right after :(", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T01:45:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shelby Skeen", "comment_text": "I think I just came to this vid", "comment_date": "2017-09-19T02:54:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chels Ortiz", "comment_text": "Your brain on DMT?", "comment_date": "2017-09-18T00:01:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fernanda Cabrera", "comment_text": "Is age a variable to what happens when you&#39;re drunk?", "comment_date": "2017-09-16T03:29:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperRed", "comment_text": "After getting drunk 3-4weeks ago ever since then I haven&#39;t felt as sharp,clear or smart.

Like, I wouldn&#39;t be traditionally drunk; I could think clearly, I knew exactly what was going on around me, but I&#39;d lose the barrier that divided the things that were okay to say and the things that weren&#39;t.<br><br>For example: every year around christmas time we&#39;d have this party at my aunt&#39;s. This particular year my younger cousin had invited her new boyfriend. He was quite a shy kid. He&#39;d barely spoken to anyone all night until eventually he started engaging in small talk with my mother. (Thinking about it, my cousin had probably told him that her aunt (my mother) was lovely, and so she was the only person in my insane family that he felt comfortable speaking with.)<br><br>I thought nothing of it until I heard him mention that he wanted to dance with her, or something along those lines. As soon as those words left his mouth I was ready to kill him. In my head he was either ridiculing her, or flirting with her whilst sat next to me in order to provoke me. &quot;Who the fuck does he think he is?&quot;<br><br>I patted him on the shoulder, stared him blankly in the eye and said in the most aggressive way possible: &quot;that&#39;s my actual fucking mother, you know?&quot; Luckily, he laughed it off in desperation hoping that it was some kind of joke that he&#39;d missed. I smiled to reassure him that that was the case, as the second I&#39;d said it and witnessed his reaction, I understood how out of order I&#39;d been. I was terrified that alcohol had caused that moment of skewed vision and absolute loss of control.<br><br>I&#39;m the least confrontational person in the world. I go out of my way to avoid confrontations, yet there I was ready to tear this lad&#39;s head off for what was probably nothing. He could have been a cunt, but there&#39;s no way I could have known for sure from just that one thing he&#39;d said. I&#39;m still embarrassed about it now, a year later.
