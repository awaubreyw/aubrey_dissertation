I did my exam today and doubt I passed, but here&#39;s some advice--as long as you have a few days or more to spare--:Plan out each topic you have to learn and write it down.  Create a schedule to find out how many topics you need to learn a day to master this, and attempt more topics on free days to make up for any inevitably busier days you may have.  If it&#39;s a really large exam, maybe spare a whole day to just going over all the topics you went through. \u00a0<br>There&#39;s also some really helpful Final Exam reviews on YouTube which is what helped me, so I recommend that if you have no other sources.<br>Advice right before the exam: Get into the \u2728mode\u2728 first.  I recommend just going over extremely simple equations or ideas relating to your topic to get into the mode of your subject before getting right into it.  I&#39;m not saying to study right before the test, but just review simple ideas relating to your topic an hour or less beforehand so that you&#39;re already focused when you get into it.

They are privileged to use the title &quot;Hafiz&quot; before their names. They are tested on their knowledge. For example, in one test they are asked to continue the recitation of a passage taken randomly from the Qur&#39;an. As they do not know which passage will be chosen, they must know the whole text in order to be sure of passing.
