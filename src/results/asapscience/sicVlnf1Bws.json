Just curious - why didn&#39;t you just name it?^^ Whats kind of interesting and this might upset people - I was full of doubt about my intelligence and I was always quite in the lower average spectrum in school, but as soon as I kind of woke up and finished my a-levels in the beginning of my 20s I actually developed a certain level of higher marks. I was wondering and went for a psychologist and he sent me to an IQ test. And from that point in time I knew why I was feeling quite uncommon. I got 135 points in the first test, reaching around 150 in the latest test. This did not help me with my low self esteem but explained a lot why I was thinking about stuff others don&#39;t. So, to sum it up, I don&#39;t feel superior to others - I just feel to be another way. Many people have emotional skills way above mine, some have more creativity or are better in fixing stuff. I actually believe that the only thing that more intelligent people should do is not only to invent new stuff, but try to improve the core-skills of everyone surrounding them. (Like my brother. He is &quot;not the sharpest tool in the shed&quot; , but we found out what he could do best - find problems of cars.

Thank you for seeing this point of view in your video because usually people only see problems with people thinking they are better than they are but this is also a problem and a struggle for some students.", "comment_date": "2018-05-31T03:08:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Koi", "comment_text": "I&#39;m 13 and taller then all average peeps in my country and in the US as well, good thing I guess agjhsvkmkd", "comment_date": "2018-05-30T21:34:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LP 1", "comment_text": "or average", "comment_date": "2018-05-30T18:59:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sicVlnf1Bws&amp;t=1m25s\">1:25</a> pathetic I fart over 50 times a day", "comment_date": "2018-05-30T17:15:30Z", "likes_count": 435}, {"comment_by": "Dory Geronimo", "comment_text": "I can type more words than avarage, look I type fast:<br><br><br>Hsgdulxykvhlhsjtfulstivipfyodurdulxo5cgmskkvhlvl yochl yocgkn itzhlRuxhlHocribxueHlc85xblUf vmFj lhz Lol jlfpuvhovupdtt8cuo hhlfrifuwo5rklxurGlvyoPu hlx58vjlv69cupwpcyoay gld5ivyiwyoxurxbl hoeupv85wupxu3c<br>nw7filzug yoeyp63vva75cgkshl iyhjlae5aljxurbczlkbyePl", "comment_date": "2018-05-30T13:01:15Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Vibey bicchan", "comment_text": "soooo i just became 11 I&#39;m half japanese half Some where in Asia  and I&#39;m 146cm(girl) am I tall or short???", "comment_date": "2018-05-30T11:07:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tanushree Sarker", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sicVlnf1Bws&amp;t=0m10s\">0:10</a> bich I&#39;m 5.4 and I&#39;m only 12", "comment_date": "2018-05-29T21:56:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohamoud Gaileh", "comment_text": "Fun(:", "comment_date": "2018-05-29T14:36:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R R", "comment_text": "So I&#39;m better than most.

Like having a medical doctorate does not make you above someone with a bachelors in engineering, you just had different schooling On a side note, plenty of high school drop outs become more successful and intelligent than you or I could ever hope to be. I just think it&#39;s harmful to suggest that having a degree is an absolute positive and not having one is an absolute negative on a number line.", "comment_date": "2017-08-23T14:18:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KillerAkume", "comment_text": "Can you make a video explaining the hiccups and if you scare someone with the hiccups, will it get rid of it?", "comment_date": "2017-08-23T13:19:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nasim Obeid", "comment_text": "I have terrible news.....you have.....<br><br><br><br>BUGGGGGGG EYESSSSS \ud83d\udc40", "comment_date": "2017-08-23T13:14:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PurpleBubbles", "comment_text": "don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m less smart..... don&#39;t break my illusion!

Overall, I&#39;m not smart because I have to work so hard in understanding anything. Group theory in physics and theoretical chemistry, for some reason, was difficult even thou I found linear algebra to be easy. <br><br>Height: 5&#39;6 Yea, it sucks.<br><br>I.Q.: I was tested at 140 as soon as I graduated (at age 32). Overall, I believe I.Q. testing doesn&#39;t have the significance that most people tend to think it has. I&#39;ve meet people with astonishing high I.Q.&#39;s that have pretty crazy beliefs that are plagued with double think. In all truth, I know I&#39;m about average but just have a tenacity to work hard. People, in general, are not able to discern the difference between intelligence and hard work. Well, unless you personally know that person.<br><br>Health: I can easily bench press 300lbs. My weight is approximately 165-170lbs. I have about 7-10% body fat. I&#39;m a weightlifter, power lifter, and I run on average about 18 miles per week and I&#39;m at the gym 8 hours a week. <br><br>I don&#39;t read books hardly at all. I do read textbooks, however. <br><br>While some will say that I&#39;m intelligent, have a very &quot;nice&quot; body, and I&#39;m a college professor that I&#39;m lucky. What most people don&#39;t realize is the time and energy that are spent training and studying. No one has it all. At times, I go through long periods of time without seeing anyone. That&#39;s the price that has to be paid for the things I desire. So, in hindsight, amongst the majority of people I work with, while I&#39;m good looking and have the appearance of being smart, I&#39;m not a player, and I get stressed while learning new subjects because of the time it takes me to learn new subjects. <br><br>So even when you have above average metrics, it doesn&#39;t tell you the full story. Like not being able to go out with your friends and drink because you have to be at the gym at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sicVlnf1Bws&amp;t=5m00s\">5:00</a> a.m. (which means you have to wake up for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sicVlnf1Bws&amp;t=4m30s\">4:30</a> a.m.). Or not being able to date because of the time spent driving 5-6 hours week picking up and dropping off your daughter to make sure her needs are meet first. I will say, while have a daughter with a fling has costly me dearly (financially, professionally, and a slew of other metrics), being a dad has been the greatest gift at all. While my daughter can be a pain and I can be strict, it&#39;s wonderful to know that she knows without a shadow of doubt, I love her more than life itself. Hey, that&#39;s OK.<br><br>I would hope that I&#39;m average. Many would say I&#39;m above average but when you take the entirety of my all life... well, in many cases, I&#39;m below average. Spend a week in my shoes and the majority of people would say I&#39;m in the gym too much, I don&#39;t go out too much, I have a kid, don&#39;t have too much fun, but from my point of view, I&#39;m grateful, and pretty happy.", "comment_date": "2017-08-19T22:02:54Z", "likes_count": 114}, {"comment_by": "NiftyTheLynx", "comment_text": "I can bench press 230 am I below average", "comment_date": "2017-08-19T22:01:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Javier Pati\u00f1o Rodriguez", "comment_text": "_    n(_+? v", "comment_date": "2017-08-19T22:00:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N.
