Indigenous Australians used to back burn all year round. The health of Australia\u2019s flora and fauna is absolutely linked to frequent, active fire seasons. By and large, the predictions made by experts, post severe fire seasons, tend to be exaggerated as nature bounces back every time. Even in North America the health of many forests and the animals that live in them depend on active fire seasons. Wild fires weed out the sick and old and make space for new plant growth. Where fires are prevented or excessively managed, research shows that the overall health of  forests declines. Whether or not the 2019 fire season was due to climate change is still moot. If it happens again every second or third year, we may safely assume that this is the case. In many cases the 2019 fires were started either intentionally or by human oversight. Human lives and properties were lost because of complacency, lack of planning, lack of appropriate warnings and communication between state and local fire authorities and the general community. Much of what happened in 2019 can be attributed to human failure and mismanagement. Fact, all natural events that we call disasters are primarily regenerative in the natural world. We do not manage nature, nature manages us.", "comment_date": "2021-11-06T12:59:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shibalik Chakraborty", "comment_text": "But we gotta cut down trees &amp; set forests on fire mate!!", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T02:09:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ultra apple", "comment_text": "Ehm...

I&#39;ve observed and noticed this each year of my short life. It&#39;s incredible to think that in the next decades our kids will be like &quot;Sooo, you saw all this, and did what exactly?&quot; <br><br>A lot of issues I think stem from the fact that people don&#39;t understand what exactly causes climate change, how their everyday habits and dietary and buying choices affect it all and how it will have an affect on their lives and the lives of their kids (cost of living, conditions and quality of health, food, living, the environment we live in), they don&#39;t understand <b>they&#39;re all interconnected</b> . You can&#39;t exactly go to McDonald&#39;s and Starbucks everyday, buy fast-fashion each week and switch your phone each season, buy stuff mindlessly, and then go and complain about climate change.<br><br>It&#39;s easy to deny personal responsibility when you make it a &quot;them&quot; problem-the government, the companies and brands, the people who do worse than us, just &quot;them&quot;, other people than us, and yes, the entities with more authority, responsibility and knowledge should step up to the plate and educate and take measures, but it&#39;s &quot;tricky&quot; to do when that often conflicts with things that bring money. Think of what YOU can do better, not, or at least, not only about what others are doing worse.<br><br>But &quot;them&quot; is also US! Individual responsibility is so valuable. If we educate ourselves and take action through our daily habits, if we &quot;vote with our money&quot;, we&#39;ll have an impact too! It&#39;s just a drop in the ocean but what is the ocean if not a multitude of drops and all that. Not only shouldn&#39;t we not need to be pressured to take action, <i>we</i> should be the ones to pressure them to. We already have an impact, let&#39;s just make it a good one. <br><br>Having said that, I know people are too busy with living and surviving, I know not everyone has the privilege to educate themselves and to concern themselves with such &quot;abstract concepts&quot; such as the consequences of climate change and what causes it when they&#39;re struggling from day to day, I know that not everyone has the privilege to make buying choices or choices in general. But most people aren&#39;t in that position. Most people can and should. <br><br>And well, some people just don&#39;t care beyond the present, beyond their lifetime, although, like I said, our own lives are impacted by climate change now, directly and indirectly. You don&#39;t have to care about future generations, your own life will and is affected now. Climate change doesn&#39;t need hundreds of years to impact the world and your life, not even twenty years. Is the quality of the air and soil and food getting worse, is your food more expensive, are there more and more respiratory problems?
