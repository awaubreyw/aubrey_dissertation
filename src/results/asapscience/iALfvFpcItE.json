Have Brahmarasayana( an ayurvedic tonic made by acharya charak) he was a great indian saint and surgeon in ancient times on empty stomach quit onion and garlic for sometime and lastly do guided meditation...

I watched a YouTube video and I&#39;m not usually triggered by that stuff, but something triggered me and made me feel anxious. I don&#39;t want to say what it is, because I don&#39;t want to blame the person who made it. It&#39;s not bad or inappropriate, just something triggered me. I&#39;m scared of becoming crazy, or having something bad happen to my mental health even though I&#39;m only eleven and that would never happen. I felt this before, but I eventually got through it in a week and a half or so. I hope I can get through this just as soon. \r<br>So, reasons that I&#39;m anxious:\r<br>1. I&#39;m scared of crazy/psycho people, and scared of becoming that.\r<br>2. I&#39;m sad I&#39;m growing up, I&#39;m already wearing make-up and teen clothes. I&#39;m eleven.\r<br>3: I&#39;m scared of mentally becoming crazy, I have a weird habit of picking out my darkest hairs and putting them between my teeth.\r<br>4: I&#39;m scared of becoming ill, I&#39;ve already felt a weird dizzy pressure near my eyes. Also throat tightness, acid reflux, and I&#39;m naturally just cold a lot. My cheeks are rosy always and right now they&#39;re really hot. I&#39;m alright, it&#39;s nothing deadly.\r<br>5. It feels like these are little reasons I&#39;m anxious, like I feel like I&#39;m anxious for no reason, but there are reasons. Right now, my cheeks and forehead are kind of hot, my hands are sweaty kind of.\r<br>There&#39;s other small reasons that I just can&#39;t think of, it&#39;s late.

That leaves me to deal with the messy fight or flight response in situations where I can\u2019t do either. <br>My general anxiety disorder makes me afraid of: <br>Eye contact. Phone calls. Talking to people. Text messaging. Knocking on doors. Buildings, people, or situations I am unfamiliar with. Physical contact. Being too loud. Doing anything, even the smallest thing, wrong (like, I\u2019m afraid to pour my own mother a bowl of cereal because I might get the ratio of milk to cereal wrong). I freeze when there\u2019s something I\u2019m not absolutely sure how to go about doing. <br>See, that adrenaline makes thought just about impossible. I can\u2019t think my way out of the situation, because my brain shuts down. It\u2019s preparing for a physical battle for my life when it shouldn\u2019t be. <br>I\u2019m a bit obsessive compulsive, but not cleanliness- ocd takes a lot of different forms- and since it doesn\u2019t usually hinder me, it\u2019s not ocd. Not a disorder. <br>I have athropodophobia, the intense, irrational fear of anything with an exoskeleton (yes, crabs and lobsters too, no, spiders aren\u2019t the worst, crickets and grasshoppers are) as well as necrophobia, the fear of dead bodies (so it actually makes it worse if I kill the bugs scaring me). <br>I also get panic attacks, my most frequent symptoms being the same as a heart attack, which sucks but I\u2019m honestly used to it. <br><br>Because of all this I can feel really embarrassed about myself. I\u2019m a twenty year old who gets fired from jobs because I freeze at the simplest of things, can\u2019t talk to costumers or anyone else, has to be shown exactly what to do as though I\u2019m a child, and cries at the sight of a bug.

I hated meeting new people, and was a loner throughout all of school. Everyone now and then, at night, I would get depression from this, as no one liked me as they thought I was weird, and that I was abnormal from my anxieties. This meant that I have always lacked what other people have (good at being social) as I was socially awkward. Even just a simple phrase celebrating someone&#39;s birthday or Christmas was too hard, or even eye contact! I have seen a few psychiatrists and they have helped me understand about Anxiety. If anyone else suffers from something like U have (Aspergers or autism) then I suggest seeing someone who can help.
