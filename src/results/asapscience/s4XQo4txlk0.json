I used to self-injure, and <b>don&#39;t read if you think you&#39;ll be triggered</b> one of the things I did was burn my arms with a clothing iron. At some points, I turned the temperature knob up to the highest possibility and when it was on my skin, there was steam rising and I still kept the iron on. It hurt, but it wasn&#39;t terrible. I&#39;ve also cut huge gashes that were 1-3 inches wide on my legs, no exaggeration. It&#39;s not like I enjoyed it. Mainly I just freaked out because I didn&#39;t mean to cut that insanely wide, but it was a bendy blade cut out of a shaving razor and got caught on the skin, as I&#39;m not someone who cut slowly and methodically, as self-injurers seem to be portrayed, but fast and deep. I remember being more freaked out and scared than anything else though. I had never seen cuts that big and I just had a towel over it hoping it would stop bleeding and sad it was so bad but I couldn&#39;t wake my mom up and/or go to the hospital, not the pain. And after some of the clothing iron burns, sometimes I would feel drugged, like I literally couldn&#39;t turn down the corners of my mouth and stop smiling, and wanted to dance around listening to music. But I swear, I&#39;m not a masochist; when something happens by accident, I get so freaked out, I can&#39;t even look at the cut.
