Humans evolved to run for long periods, that&#39;s why we have A LOT more stamina than the majority of animals, so having feet that can keep up with the stamina of a human is good for survival.<br><br>2. Positions: some x positions require the feet to be nearby the face of the male, causing a partialism development by neural correlation. This applies to present day, and inherited genes from the ancestors, but it only explains why males are more likely to have this partialism.<br><br>3. Curves: A lot of feet have curves, mostly in the arches. But some people with this partialism don&#39;t care too much about the curves. It is said that those curves are similar to the curves of a fertile and healthy female body, explaining why males are more likely to have it.<br><br>Something to take into account is that fetishes and partialisms can be unidirectional or bidirectional, and the direction can be inwards or outwards. There are females with a fetish about having their feet touched, licked, and sucked (IIRC, Taylor Swift has this fetish). So usually females have this fetish pointing inwards (to themselves) while males have this partialism pointing outwards. Some lesbians can have it bidirectional, although no studies have been done on this AFAIK, only informal polls.<br><br>Partialisms are fetishes about parts of a human or animal body (the latter only applies to zoophilics, furries are not included because &quot;furry&quot; has MANY meanings)", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T06:33:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "love", "comment_text": "FEET ARE SO DAMM UGLY HOW DO LIKE YALL LIKE THEM \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T06:23:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isaiah Rucker", "comment_text": "<b>Me.
