I love all of your vids. I&#39;d just like to give some constructive feedback. You said plane windows were more oblong to reduce drag, but that could be misleading. As someone who is training to pursue a career in aviation and personally know some aircraft manufacturers, the oblong shape of the windows is more to keep the stress in a roughly continuous path though the fuselage. Basically the rounded edges means that the stress flows more smoothly around the windows avoiding a point of concentrated stress. You were quite correct that the shape reduces the chances of cracking though.

Thats not how atmospheric pressure works. The gravitational attraction at sea level is only marginally stronger than that in the upper atmosphere. In fact astronauts on the international space station still experience about 90% of the gravitational attraction that we experience on earth. The increased air pressure at sea level is due to a process of hydrostatics, the measure of how pressure increases with depth in a fluid column [in this case a gas]. The best way to understand it simply is to say that the pressure increases, because the molecules lower in the stack have to support the load of the molecules supported above them. The same effect can be observed with water in the ocean or more simple, a swimming pool; the deeper you go the more pressure you feel, for the same reason.", "comment_date": "2018-01-25T22:25:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julie Summers", "comment_text": "made me feel better but not gonna lie i&#39;m glad this was uploaded after my flights at the weekend \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2018-01-25T22:24:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cereal", "comment_text": "The leg space in an airplane is literally DEATH.", "comment_date": "2018-01-25T22:24:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stefan Manolescu", "comment_text": "the windows aren&#39;r eounded to reduce drag.

That&#39;s about 3 tons of air inside the cabin, if it were empty, at STP. If you were standing in front of the door, this would be terrible for you, as the initial burst of pressure decrease would almost certainly carry you out. But, that there are seats, luggage compartments, there is less mass because planes are cylinders (less even, because of luggage space), that an a380 carries 555 passengers (a weight of generally 27 tons, all going for the opening, right?), that pressure differential at cruising altitude is about 20in/hg (though venturi effect would perhaps make it lower) and the fact that the air leaves tangentially to the mass of air in the plane (unless you open the cargo door in a cargo plane) leads me to believe that there isn&#39;t enough mass of air to force people out of the plane just because they weren&#39;t wearing a seat belt.<br><br>Of course, the mythbusters already looked at this (i should have looked there first): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yG2h1aDB6k\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yG2h1aDB6k</a> Their conclusion seems to support that the plane is unlikely to be rapidly emptied.
