I remember I know that seems like Dinosaurs years ago but I was only in 2nd grade before that was here and I got to say I miss those times and I know some of you who are still in school are not even old enough to know what it was like before the curriculum but for those who don&#39;t know those were the best times to live in. Remember when everyone had a group they were in? Popular, emo, punk, nerds, etc. Well these groups are not here anymore mainly because school has became so difficult since the curriculum has came that people don&#39;t have enough time in their lives to actually enjoy life and I don&#39;t think the millennials realize how much kids are struggling now of days because they never had to go through that in school. I see people protest over black lives matter and people who disagree saying alllivesmatter But do they Really? The centennials (current teens in America) seem as if their life doesn&#39;t matter at all, I see millennials look at the curriculum and think how bad can it be? And not realizing it&#39;s so bad and stressful to the point where the suicide rate in teens went from the only cause for them being suicidal is from Bullying to now being school work. If only we could get more millennials not focusing on the fight against race and which one is better and more of them focusing on the real problem which is schools maybe us teens can live a better life<br><br>If I ever become the president one day or get to have a speech in front of a lot of politicians I&#39;m going to use what I said up there to hopefully make a change", "comment_date": "2017-12-12T03:24:55Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Tomasone", "comment_text": "super helpful video, thanks!", "comment_date": "2017-12-10T17:20:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Flickthekid", "comment_text": "Thanks now im more stressed", "comment_date": "2017-12-06T21:56:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lil roadrage", "comment_text": "Welp.

We are the descendants of a world-wide population of 6 million hunter-gatherers, and only expanded to 7.4 billion because of the agricultural and industrial revolutions.  However, this expansion came at the price so well demonstrated by the mostly serious comments on this piece.   If you&#39;re interested in the details, Google &quot;Stress R Us&quot; for the free PDF.  If you care about the health and well-being of your off-spring and the planet, limit your family size to one-child, which will reduce our world-wide population to 2.5 billion by 2100.
