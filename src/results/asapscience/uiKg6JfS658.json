That gives us about 7 hours that we have to sit down. AND if we add all meals (most people sit down when they eat) we can probably add another hour to that, which gives us about 8 hours. Yup, eight hours/day, that&#39;s NOT healthy, but in most cases there&#39;s not that much to do about it, we can&#39;t just go for a little walk in class, we have to do homework and study to get good grades. And whilst some people probably can walk to school instead of taking the bus, that&#39;s not the case for everyone.
