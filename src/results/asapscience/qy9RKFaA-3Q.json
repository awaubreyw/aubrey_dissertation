But might we be overthinking this? Near the beginning of the video, you comment on the relative paucity of dinosaur species, at least as compared with the far larger number we have today. <br><br>But isn\u2019t it the case that fossilization is exceedingly rare? And that it\u2019s highly likely that the fossil remains of innumerable dinosaur species have yet to be discovered, or may not be represented in the fossil record at all? So, while the idea that \u201cmiddle weight\u201d carnivorous dinosaurs were not able to compete with young adult sized members of large carnivorous theropods, perhaps this is merely an illusion created by having a non representative sample of carnivores\u2026in other words, the gap may be a sample error assumption. It\u2019s also possible, though less likely, that some unknown factor or factors favored the fossilization of lighter-weight, as well as very heavy, carnivores, but not those in between. This is only a suggestion as to what such factors could resemble, not a serious stab at it. But\u2026maybe scavengers were able to find mid-sized carnivores and scatter their remains or otherwise prevent their preservation. But small carnivores\u2019 cadavers escaped their notice, while larger remains continued to instinctually intimidate scavengers even after death. I realize such a notion sets aside herbivores, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s merely a suggestion of what such factors might look like, not a serious hypothesis! <br><br>So\u2026these are only guesses.

You got a dinosaur&#39;s younger versions, and used that to fill in the gap?

There&#39;s no scientific backing, all of it is based on a rule made over 2000 years ago which has been proven wrong in the past 2000 years. That rule? Spontaneous generation. Where does Spontaneous generation fit into evolution? Simple: the generation of genetics. There is no real proof that evolution works. Even the depth of the fossils don&#39;t make sense. Don&#39;t even get me started on radioactive dating. Might as well call yourself a million years old with that thing. <br><br>Do you know what there is proof of? The Bible. Where does the flood work? Grand canyon, and Noah&#39;s ark found in turkey. Where does creation fit in? Well, obviously evolution couldn&#39;t have worked, as Spontaneous generation is unincorporated in nature. Only nature couldn&#39;t have worked since here in this plane of existence we have a start and an end. So, the only other option would to have been someone who is higher than us to have created us.

Believe it or not, evolution is just another religion. You have to believe that the world started from a big bang. You have to assume all humanistic thoughts are true. When in actuality, all humanistic thought always has a breaking point. Why else would new information come in science to prove other beings wrong? <br><br>I still can&#39;t believe evolution is looked upon fondly.

The reason why there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of medium sized carnivores was probably due to the fact that smaller herbivorous dinosaurs also stuck near herds of larger herbivores, meaning even though a predator was hunting smaller prey, it would&#39;ve had to tussle with bigger herbivores anyways so, why not adapt to take them down?<br>This is probably even more apparent by the fact that nearly every small carnivorous dinosaur species were pack hunters meaning, their ability to survive was incredibly dependent on the social structure, population and location of other members of it species.

Also, looking at where the skull suggests their eyes and nostrils are located, they could easily conceal their bodies in water with only their eyes and the upper portion of their snouts above water.
