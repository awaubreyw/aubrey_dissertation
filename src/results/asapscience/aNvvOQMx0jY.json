If you were to try to cocktail the street drug version of that, right, you&#39;re trying to blend like heroin and speed and coke and acid and weed- and point is, you can&#39;t do it. It turns out the brain can cocktail all of &#39;em at once, which is why people will prefer flow to almost any experience on Earth. It&#39;s our favorite experience. It&#39;s the most addictive experience on Earth. Why? &#39;Cause it cocktails five or six of the largest pleasure drugs the brain can produce. We&#39;re all capable of so much more than we know. That is a commonality across the board. And one of the big reasons is we&#39;re all hardwired for flow, and flow is a massive amplification of what&#39;s possible for ourselves.\u00b3",

Makes me curious as to if my smartphone is actually making me dumber or if I just use it in smarter ways, including randomly looking up information just out of curiosity. <br><br>It amazes me how mankind went from sending morse code dots for communications to world wide web in less than 100 years, yet the sad part is most use it for porn or cat videos. Good job humanity... got a world of information at your finger tips and you choose to do what with it? seriously... what do you want to learn? use it that way instead. Doesn&#39;t have to make you dumber. Just don&#39;t forget to be in the moment with people when you are actually around people. <br><br>personal note, had neck pain long before I ever had a cell phone... yay genetics!",

I had zero notifications from anything else. It felt weird for the first few weeks. I&#39;d get bored and immediately unlock my phone and start going through all my apps to check for myself. This habit slowly started to go away over the course of a few months. Now my phone is on silent all the time. The only way I know if someone called or texted is by checking myself. I am in control of when I interact with the phone now instead it controlling me. It feels glorious. All my friends get pissed and say Im hard to reach and I don&#39;t give a shit. If anything it prevents the whole &quot;too much circulation&quot; thing in regards to how available I am for people and it makes the time I do have with people of much higher quality. People listen when I speak because I don&#39;t speak often and I&#39;m hard to get ahold of. I would encourage this for anyone.",

By the way, thanks for video, it made me think about my addiction again",

I found that what ever space we are in, small or big, it is our brain that decides the size. Some people have fear of huge spaces, others for small. It all comes down to our perception . If people walk around, relating to people and the world trough a small screen, of course space gets very limited and small. I can see why you are doing the promotion for that app, money, but it really makes it a bit hilarious after rambling on about the addiction to the phone. No phone, no apps, right. Get out of the cyber space in to your own space. It is infinite , while cyberspace indeed has its limits, and it definitely limits you. Hijackings of brains indeed.",

Basically just use my phone to text few times a day, check emails/stocks, collect some money, abit of YouTube time, sometimes browsing for things i need. pretty much it, besides that i dont care what trends are going on, what celebs are doing or care for what any person posts or has to say on Instagram or Facebook. Why dont we use our time towards hobbies or something more valuable.. like giving your time to God, learn more about God and giving thanks to the beautiful creations he has made all around you, and you yourself.

He paid the ultimate price for all sins so we can be saved and spend eternity with Him! It is the most precious gift, and all we need to do is ask Him into our hearts! Yes! It\u2019s true! Believe what He did on the cross for YOU, FOR OUR SINS, FOR THE WORLD. He conquered death and rose again, 3 days later! He did this out of immense, and incomprehensible love. We may not know all the answers, but we don\u2019t have to. His ways our higher than ours. We just have to trust. The reality is, His kingdom will continue with or without any of us. This is an incredibly humbling fact, but it also shows the love of God.. He created us to be apart of Him. Earth is a test. Life here is just the pencil tip compared to the whole pencil of eternity. It is written. He gave us free will. It is truly up to us to accept Him as our Lord and Savior! Don\u2019t let the word \u201csin\u201d scare you away, we are all sinners. We just have to be honest to Him and ourselves. We will be forgiven. We must repent and turn from our wicked ways to be truly forgiven. That is why Jesus sacrificed Himself\u2026 to save us all\u2026 He was the ONLY ONE who did not sin..because He is Gods only BEGOTTEN Son. He is God in the flesh. He LOVES the sinners. He even says, (Mark 2:17) Jesus said to them, \u201cIt is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\u201d I know you don\u2019t know me, but you CAN trust me on this. He found me when I was lost in alcohol. He was looking for ME, I was not looking for Him. This means He makes way to find people at their rock bottoms\u2026 when they are sick. He then heals and restores them.. completely transforms them. Want to know more? I will give my testimony below.<br><br><br>Hello! God bless you and thank you very much for reading this far. I truly believe it is because the Lord Jesus Christ is CALLING YOU. Remember how I mentioned free will earlier? It is up to us to let Him in. (Matthew 7:7-8) Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye. shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: 8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh. findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. <br><br>I am 24 years old, I will be turning 25 this year. Life was never the \u201ceasiest\u201d, but it hasn\u2019t been the \u201chardest\u201d either. Jesus was introduced to me when I was a child, and I remember attending vacation Bible school. My mom, to this day, has a tainted view of the Bible because it brings back unfortunate memories of her dad and her childhood.. but she is a believer. Her dad was a sick man, and he also was a believer. I still on pray this now. Long story short, Jesus was always in my life but not fully until my 20s. I more so just thought of God, as God.. never considered Jesus or the Holy Spirit (the trinity), though He was planted in my heart at an early age. I remember as a kid I would look at the clouds and wait for Him to return because I was told He would be back. Then things started to fade as I got older, sin and demonic strongholds took over my household and family. I know this now, but did not know it then. God reveals things when we are ready for them. There were drugs, alcohol, violence, fornication, lying..overall darkness.. My mother got very sick and addicted into pills. She was in and out jail and rehab. My dad did what he could on his end to support my sister and I, all while dealing with finance/law, and keeping the house. He also used a lot of alcohol to numb his pain. Eventually, my mom found God and started attending support meetings and such. She became clean. It was all by the grace of God that my mother remains alive and clean, their relationship, our family and our home is still in tact.. needless to say, this all left a major impact on my life, how I developed and lost friends throughout school, and so on. Fast forwarding to my 20s. God really started showing up in my life. I totaled my car, and the accident was my fault, I did not see on coming. The other person involved was okay but it was a traumatic experience. Any way, God sent a firefighter who was off the clock, on the road that day. He witnessed the accident and he saw me jump out of my car to check on the other person. Honestly, I didn\u2019t care about myself or anything in that situation.. I just wanted to check on that other person. I didn\u2019t know if I took their life or not, at that moment. The firefighter told me to lay in the grass and he held me as I was sobbing and actually talked to my parents on the phone as I was as unable to speak. I know God sent him. He felt like a father to me. I did not know this man but I felt so safe as to hold onto him and cry. I know that Jesus love was symbolized in that firefighter now. During this time, I was involved heavily into alcohol. I was not considering Jesus at the time, or His work on the cross. The path I was on\u2026It was getting dark. Alcohol was my best friend temporarily, then it turned on me. I had my moms story as an example, so I started figuring things out pretty quickly.. That I was addicted.. I started to become violent and become suicidal. I remember being very drunk and falling asleep one night.. I think I was brought to Heaven. So maybe I passed away for a moment? This is what really sparked it all\u2026. I remember seeing vibrant green grass. I was not able to look around me, I was just looking down. Then, I blinked in my dream, and now I was looking at the sky. The sky was beautiful and instead of where the sun would be here on earth, there was a CROSS in the sky. I then saw feet and I heard a man\u2019s voice they \u201cI love you so much, Sara\u201d. I replied and said \u201cI love you so much\u201d then I woke up. To be honest, I didn\u2019t know who it was, that\u2019s how lost I was. I told my parents and they explained that it was Jesus! That he saw me struggling, and he told me he loved me!!! Guess what? Days later, I found my, now, fiance! He is also very close with the Lord and so is his family\u2026 guess what else? He never had a drop of alcohol in his life! God has a sense of humor! He did create it after all! Thank you Jesus! I haven\u2019t drank alcohol since February 8th, 2019\u2026 all glory to God! I still struggle daily, but I give it all to God. I know He\u2019s got me! He has you too! Here are a few more encounters I have had since I have been seeking our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ: <br>-During a dream, I heard His voice..He spoke to me and said \u201cLet Go\u201d but instead of speaking like a normal person would, he breathed it into me and then a light casted over me and cleansed me. I knew He was talking about my struggle with anxiety. (This was before I knew that He literally breathes life into creation, etc) <br>-This happened shortly after I truly asked Jesus in my heart to be my personal savior: Once while I was sleeping, I felt my spirit wake up and say \u201cJesus is in the room\u201d I saw my room but my physical eyes were closed..I was still asleep. I remember being very nervous and I saw this very bright, blinding light. I heard telepathically \u201cdon\u2019t fear\u201d, then I felt an electric washing wave over me. After I woke up, I still felt it on my skin!! Days later, I had another dream of His figure in the sky with His arms raised up.. I said JESUS!! And His presence, the strength of His presence, caused me to fall back and I then saw nothing but complete white wash over me..like I was melting in snow. This was before I knew He cleansed us and washed us of our sins \u201cwhite as snow\u201d with His perfect and gracious blood..<br>-In another dream, I was brought to a room with all white walls. It felt like home in my dream, but I knew I wasn\u2019t at my house on earth. I then remember me smiling and looking down at my white flowing sleeve. I had a robe on. (This was before I knew that we are given white robes to wear in Heaven) the dream finished with me hearing demonic voices threatening me to end my life, but I fought back and said \u201cno, you can\u2019t touch me. I am a child of God\u201d then a small white light of a cross appeared, and it expanded into the whole room. That is how I woke up. <br>God reveals things to us and then confirms them, usually through His people or His Word! (The Bible) <br><br>Finally, I want to say.. He is coming SOON! I was told March 25th, 2022 by the Holy Spirit during sleep. The Holy Spirit clearly said \u201cTHE RETURN OF JESUS CHRIST IS IMMINENT\u201d. I looked up the word imminent for its exact meaning (which means \u201cabout to happen\u201d). I prayed over this, that if I see the word imminent again involving His return, I will spread what was given to me. Tonight 3/27/22 I received confirmation that another believer in Christ also received the word imminent on March 26, 2022. I was so shocked\u2026He amazes me EVERY TIME. Our God is THAT GOOD. He is alive, He speaks! He wants to work through you too! He wants you to want to be a vessel for His glory! For His kingdom! How do you we do this? By asking Him! Thank you so much if you have read all of this! I pray this transforms you and that the Lord Jesus Christ moves His hand in your life. He loves you so much, He really really does. Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior today! Repent and turn from your wicked ways (it is okay to be honest with yourself and to God!), you will be FORGIVEN. By the love, grace and mercy of Jesus Christ, The Heavenly Father, and the Holy Spirit\u2026 you are SET FREE! \u2764\ufe0famen and amen!",

Rather, who is He really?<br><br>Jesus is the Son of God, who came to the world as a man. He lived a perfect and sinless life . Even though He was perfect and sinless, on the cross of Calvary God wrathfully punished Him for the sins of the world. 3 days later He rose from death. Now He is seated at the right hand of God, ruling as King over Heaven and Earth.<br>On the judgment day He will judge you, me and every human being that has ever lived. Those who believed in Him will enter eternal joy with Him, but those who did not believe in Jesus will be sent to eternal condemnation. <br><br>So turn from your sins and believe in the Jesus. Believe and hope that you can be forgiven for all your sins because of His death and resurrection. He took your place in Hell, so that if you submit to Him as your Lord and God, you can be forgiven and take His place in heaven- you will be made sinnless and perfect before the Holy Father. He&#39;ll also give you a new heart and mind that can love and obey Him. <br><br>Jesus lives so that you can have true life and freedom, and most importantly so that you can have an eternally peaceful relationship with God.<br><br>You are dead, and Jesus is your Hope of love.<br><br>Acts 15:11<br>\u201dOn the contrary, we believe it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.&quot;<br>Ephesians 1:7<br>\u201dIn Him, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace&quot;<br>Ephesians 2:8<br>\u201dFor it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God,\u201d<br><br>John 11:25-26: &quot;Jesus said to her, &#39;I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?&#39;<br>1 Corinthians 6:14: &quot;And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.&quot;<br>Romans 6:9: &quot;We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.&quot;",

No offence to anyone but I gain basically nothing from any of them and all it does is waste time, and I just forget what I seen on somebodies story anyways. If I spent half the time I spent on YouTube on real productive hobbies I could have so many more unique and rewarding skills, rather than short term blasts of dopamine from videos I don\u2019t even remember. Still though, years of forming these bad habits take time to break, and recently it feels like I\u2019m getting better. Don\u2019t know how many other people are in the same boat, I mean, I\u2019m writing this comment in the YouTube comment section, so I\u2019ve been sucked in another rabbit hole again. I went from studying Electrical stuff, to taking a break, to Joe Rogan talking to Ben Shapiro about Marijuana, to guitar videos, Spider-Man videos, AMVs, and finally here. Dam I wrote a whole novel, just wanted to vent a lil. Writing about it makes it feel so much more obvious on what the problem is. Journaling helps so much. Have a good day people.",

This break from social media also allowed me to appreciate the beautiful friendships I have with others. In short, it allowed me to be more present. <br><br>As human beings, we\u2019re meant to interact and create personal connections. social media does the opposite sometimes.

Also your phone is too linked to your everyday life (friends, business, payments, tickets etc.) that sadly, it&#39;s just &quot;too big to be ingored&quot;. The only way is all social media companies to be held accountable for hijacking human brain&#39;s biochemistry. It sounds far fetched, but since that&#39;s exactly what they do, the reasonable thing for our society to do, is to develop safeguards that will protect the flaws of the human brain and lead to more productive and healthy society members.",

Not to mention how much your phone spies on you. Every key stroke, every site visited, every link clicked is recorded in a data profile on you, which is then sold to or stolen by companies and governments so they can learn to better manipulate and brainwash you. This is documented fact. Your phone&#39;s microphone is also always on recording your conversations, and the cameras periodically record you too. Again, all of this is fact.<br><br>If you haven&#39;t done an ep on hypnosis and brainwashing, please please please do so. Millions of Americans are being hypnotized by their screens and it is incredibly dangerous. Ugly, hateful ideas are being buried deep in your subconscious, and the result is war. As should be evident to everyone by now, but so many are so deeply entranced they don&#39;t notice. The situation is dire.<br><br>I&#39;ve been working to quit and have greatly improved my sleep, lessened my anxiety, and cleared my head of general fogginess. These devices weren&#39;t created with this nefarious purpose in mind, but they have been hijacked to do so, the perfect vehicle to deliver societal control and manipulation. So so so dangerous. If I didn&#39;t have to have this evil phone and internet for my job, I&#39;d be rid of them immediately. But that&#39;s part of the enslavement, isn&#39;t it?

These tech companies know this too, it\u2019s their entire business to destroy minds, specifically young minds, for profit.

        "comment_text": "The gospel I would say is the main message of the Bible, it is the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and what He did on the cross for all of humanity.<br>\u00a0Despite the efforts of any person, we cannot earn our way to heaven, Romans 3:23 says: &quot;For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God&quot;. Anyone can examine themselves and know that even though yes sometimes we can do good, we also do evil at times, we commit moral crimes, we rebel against God, or as known otherwise we sin. We lie, we steal, we blaspheme God, we can lust and have hate for our brother in our heart, these are just some of the sins more than likely every person on earth has committed. God is loving, holy and God is merciful among other attributes but He is also just, perfectly just. Like any crime sin has to be punished, if God did not punish sin then He would be unjust, He would be corrupt, someone has to take the punishment. Romans 6:23 says: &quot;For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord&quot;. This is talking about spiritual death, not physical death, if you die in your sins then you go to hell. There is good evidence that humans have souls, near death experiences are one of those evidences. There is a part of you that lives on past your physical body.\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 God sent His only Son to earth about 2000 years ago, His Son is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the promised Savior of the world, He fulfilled hundreds of prophecies by coming to our world. Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life and was crucified on the cross as a payment for our sins. God poured out His wrath on Jesus in our place, meaning the justice of God is satisfied and sin is punished. While we were still at enmity with God, God still wants to save us, Romans 5:8 says: &quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us&quot;. 3 days after Jesus was crucified He rose again proving that His payment was enough and that He was who He said He was, the Son of God. There is real world evidence for the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, this is not just a nice story.<br><br>\u00a0 Scripture tells us to repent and put our trust in Jesus, to follow Him as Lord. Repentance means a change of mind which means to turn from a life following sin to a life following Christ. Salvation is a free gift and it cannot be earned, no one can be perfectly moral on their own, it is impossible, this is the only way to be in the presence of God in heaven. It is important to reiterate that we cannot save ourselves, it is the gift of God for one to be saved. Cry out to God to have mercy on you, plead with God to save you. Ephesians 2:8-9 says: &quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not as a result of works so that no one may boast&quot;. Salvation is a gift.\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0 There is no other way, Jesus Himself said that He is the way, the truth and the life and no one comes to the Father but through Him. Jesus is not just a way, a truth or a life. Romans 10:9 says: &quot;That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead you will be saved.&quot;",

I am one of those who are addicted. I felt sad and angry at the same time. Cause i couldnt use my phone. Everyone including me were angry because we couldnt use our phones. That statment about sleep is so accurate. Having no phone seriously inproved my sleep. I felt more energized at mornings. And it was easier to fall asleep. I do understand that we were prety exhausted at the end of the day so maybe that is one thing to take into consideration. That was awesome experience but there is no way that i would ever repeat it.  Phones are not an addiction it is part of our lifes. If u ll think that way its easier to live.",

I&#39;ve personally done that for 6-12 months three times and those were the best times of my lives. Went from average grades to getting the highest grades of my schools, found a bunch of new passions and actually spent time on them, and suddenly had the energy to hang out with friends 4 times a week instead of just wanting to sleep all day every day.

That way, you are still available for emergencies, but you get to be present in your life. Also, the increase in mental energy is amaaaaaazing. Or, take it a step further and get rid of your smartphone entirely. I lived without a smartphone for 6-12 months three times. The first time, I went from average grades to getting the highest grades of my school, without effort! Turns out I didn&#39;t become dumb when I started high school, I just became addicted to my phone. The second time I suddenly found a passion for hiking and traveling and my depression almost disappeared. The third time I was 22, severely depressed, unable to work and never leaving my house. Within months I was able to enroll in school again, and again getting the highest grades of my classes, AND I&#39;m hanging out with good friends at least four times a week. Got a smartphone recently and my grades literally went down by 40% and I&#39;m barely passing anymore. I&#39;m going to get rid of my smartphone and laptop this week so I can focus on my exams these last 2 months of the year in an effort to still pass. Knowing my abilities I might even end up with a decent average after all. My only regret is not getting rid of these devices sooner. These things are ruining our lives! Please everyone, try living with just a Nokia for a bit. Even if it&#39;s just 8 hours a day, your ability to concentrate will TRIPLE and it literally only costs 20 bucks!",

Leaving less time and availability for healthy evening routines for hygiene, cooking, sport or sleep, intentional activities, and social and intellectual stimuli. Concrete negative impacts on one&#39;s daily life without ability to change them on a short term being another criterium for addiction to a behavior or substance.",

I use my phone a lot but never used it during class, and now, barely use it at work. That could be because I don&#39;t expect to get any notifications because it&#39;s during the hours when all my friends are asleep. Or because I never have notifications on, meaning I&#39;ve never really linked a vibration or sound to mean free dopamine. I have formed a bad habit recently of watching YouTube Shorts for like an hour before leaving bed. Still need to change that habit. \ud83e\udd23",

Or if the study regarding phone usage and suicide rates were able to determine if it was causation and not correlation. While its very possible (and I personally think likely) many social media sites contribute to mental health problems it could also be true that teenagers who are in poor living situations or are predisposed to depression use their phones more frequently as a distraction or because the dopamine hits he talked about in the beginning of the video are one of the few ways they experience dopamine therefore further reinforcing the behavior",

It&#39;s not exactly social media, but I basically downloaded it after seeing a friend play it, had fun for a few months, got bored of it but kept logging on every day for the rewards. Then deleted it then re-downloaded it after a few months, deleted and re-downloaded again after seeing that they added a Moriah Elizabeth dragon, then deleted it again. Hopefully this time for good. I remember feeling really happy I deleted it because it literally brought me no joy and now I didn&#39;t have any temptation to keep using it. Unfortunately, this hasn&#39;t been the case with my other games, which are more fun but I still feel like I&#39;m not making any progress. I&#39;m not doing anything meaningful. I&#39;m just getting on and grinding because of the daily rewards. I keep thinking about deleting them, but I want to use them for my art references, but also I think that&#39;s just an excuse I&#39;m making to myself because I probably have much better sources and anyway I could just look up the art online.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m not addicted to social media except YouTube because I don&#39;t use other social media besides YouTube. But I&#39;ve noticed that my attention span sucks. I keep checking YouTube for no reason other than to see if there&#39;s any good content to alleviate my boredom. But I ran out of good content long ago, now I just wait for more good content. Seriously, you&#39;d be surprised that even with videos probably being uploaded every second, there is a lack of content that&#39;s actually interesting and high-quality and isn&#39;t just dumb &quot;life hacks&quot; that don&#39;t work or Reddit compilations. I want to quit YouTube but I still want to watch that good content. I think one of my problems right now is that I&#39;m subscribed to way too many channels. Over 200 now and counting. I&#39;m thinking one solution might be to unsubscribe from all the channels I don&#39;t really like, then I&#39;ll see if there&#39;s a way to edit my notification settings. I want to know when my favorite YouTubers upload, but maybe not immediately. I wonder if I can make my phone give me notifications like once every day, sorta like with email where every 15 minutes you get notified for all the emails you received in that time period. I don&#39;t know if I can edit that for YouTube. But I really need to make some time for what I actually want to do, not what I want to do because it&#39;ll temporarily satisfy my restless brain. Heck, it&#39;s not even like I can&#39;t stand having nothing to do. I don&#39;t care when I lose my phone for a few hours, and I could happily daydream and debate politics with myself all day. And my phone really just gets in the way of my life, and the lives of others, because Big Tech wants more money.<br><br>P.S. I have no idea what the point of my thesis-comment (Commenthesis? Commesis?) was, but I&#39;m posting it anyway because I&#39;m bored",

That&#39;s all.   --- and yeah, I gave up social media for a wall, and I spent my time basically in my mind.  Spaced out.  Laying on the floor, in a dream.    Actually? ... It&#39;s honestly a lot more fun to just space out to be honest.    My mind is more interesting than reality.",

Pretty sure most of the vaccine hesitancy, conspiracy theories and other issues in the forefront all just misplaced superstition due to phones.

I think my depression caused increased phone use as I became so unhappy with my numb life that I started to use tech as an escape. I really only developed my tech addiction only after my first suicide attempt. So I am curious if the depression and phones thing in teens like me is a case of correlation does not equal causation? Although I will say that I think most social media does trigger depression. So maybe it depends more what you are doing on your phone? Just some thoughts\u2026?",

Feeling awkward? Pull out your phone! It&#39;s sad, honestly. But above all else, what really saddens me is seeing people supposedly hanging out together but they are all on their phones. Whenever me and my friends hang out we put our phones on a pile, we are not allowed to touch it unless we really need to communicate with someone or check something. It&#39;s a lot more fun then talking to screen addicts.",

I&#39;m in a long distance relationship which caused occasional moments of concern when I wasn&#39;t able to respond in a certain time frame but largely I value clear communication and also... my panic disorder and ptsd demands I stay in the moment at every given time. My dad gradually complained more and more about family sitting staring at their phones when family should be talking with each other but he was the earliest attention abuser I can recall with the tv on 24/7. I appreciate peace and quiet, I appreciate moments to myself to think about things without social media feeds constantly scrolling dopamine manipulation and the doom and gloom of today&#39;s society constantly connected. I have my partner who I value our time together where I require my phone for but outside of that... I utilize social media like a live-journal and prefer to have one on one conversations over... interactions with many that I&#39;m not even that close with.",

It could also be that those with depression use the phone as a coping mechanism, so of course kids without depression don&#39;t need that and wouldn&#39;t use it as much. Correlation is not causation. Also, as someone who suffers from severe anxiety and depression, I will say that I use my phone a lot, but it is a coping mechanism for me. I&#39;m also wary of the claims that going off your phone can improve your attention span. As someone with ADHD, I&#39;m extremely skeptical of anything that claims it can improve attention spans like that.",
