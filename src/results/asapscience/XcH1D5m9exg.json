While vets often do look for hyperarousal states, or for life or death thrill seeking, this is because of their trauma. <br><br>Part of our vets who experience war firsthand, is still overseas. They never got to integrate that part of themselves into their civilian identity. It&#39;s like they are two people, one the soldier whos seen all this death and destruction, and the other is a civillian father, a mother, a husband, and/or brother.<br><br>The main reason why there&#39;s this dissonance is because their pain is &quot;unspeakable&quot;, or it&#39;s expected of them to suffer in silence. When what they really need is to share their pain, and stories, even (sometimes especially) at inappropriaye times.<br><br>I have P.T.S.D., and it can make you feel like a hollow person. Like, everyone else is having fun and enjoying life, and you think you&#39;re happy too; but there&#39;s this gnawing hollow feeling inside that just dulls the happiness and emotions. Then there&#39;s the flashbacks, and how inane inocuous things can suddenly become a threat against your life! <br><br>Vets need to be able to talk about these things candidly at any time, because they will happen at any time. They need to be addressed on the spot. This is the only way the soldier and civillian can become one person again.<br><br>So, the addiction to the high stress situation, is also a way for the survivor of a life or death situation to &quot;feel alive again&quot;; Because a part of them is trapped in the past trauma, and that part is screaming for attention!", "comment_date": "2020-04-05T05:19:46Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Mr Pepperoni Pizza", "comment_text": "Lmao it didn&#39;t happen but coronavirus did", "comment_date": "2020-03-27T08:18:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Pepperoni Pizza", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcH1D5m9exg&amp;t=1m32s\">1:32</a> hehehehe", "comment_date": "2020-03-27T08:17:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zes", "comment_text": "wrg, no anxietx etc for such,x anyx, do things not anxietyx etc about things", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T09:37:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Zhao", "comment_text": "WWIII", "comment_date": "2020-03-24T01:53:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tee Hee", "comment_text": "I love how two months ago we were afraid of a war that wasn\u2019t even going to happen and we were ignoring a literal emerging viral pandemic", "comment_date": "2020-03-21T15:33:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Maxx", "comment_text": "Video: call of duty<br><br>Me: heh", "comment_date": "2020-03-21T06:06:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adin Silajdzija", "comment_text": "You are amused by war until you experience it.

The biggest exceptions come from societies that regress into ideologically militant regimes. This brings back frequent war. The most devastating cases have been the socialist and totalitarian regimes, which have been consistently the most militarist, as we have seen with every independent Communist state, measured both by their wars and their military spending, and saw earlier with the fascist states.

Wars that the US is involved in are staged for profit. All the military responses Iran has done in the past 6 months has been valid.<br>The US sent a rec. drone into Iran airspace, they shot it down, this is normal. They sent a warship within strike range, they should not do that.<br>All this was to provoke action from Iran, so western media can write about &quot;bad things those middle eastern folks are doing&quot;. Most people swallow this like they always do, ignorance is bliss.<br>Its hard to say if Trump wants this to happen, maybe his investments will make him profit from this as well. However, even if he wanted to stop this, he cant. The oligarchs have control.
