We act like carnivores, having meat every meal of the day. We are not designed to do that. We are designed as omnivores, and we are only meant to eat meat on special occasions. But nobody acts like that. That&#39;s why one of the biggest leading cause of death is heart disease. We kill animals in totally unnatural ways, leading to a life of suffering. If animals were just in a farm, living their life, and one day somebody gives them an unexpected but painless death, I would have no problems with meat. I would eat meat. That&#39;s why I feel no shame about eating plants, because they aren&#39;t tortured like animals are. They are cut and put in a box, and they have generally nice lives before they die. I honestly think it&#39;s sad that nobody listens to vegetarians because of the fabled preachy vegans, when all I see is meat eaters making fun of me.

They are simply more reactive than one would assume, but these reactions are automatic and do not involve any level of awareness or cognition (cause ofcourse, they have no central nervous system) <br><br>2) They do not feel pain either. Pain is a property of a sentient, mobile creature that leads an interactive life. Much unlike plants. If you&#39;re an animal walking around, you need to be able to learn what to pursue and what to avoid. Pain, suffering, and even other forms of positive stimuli that involve emotion and cognition are necessary for that. Plants lack all of these, they simply have the capacity to automatically detect some forms of negative stimuli (and perhaps some patterns, albeit without any level of understanding). A plant has ZERO benefits from being able to feel pain, since it can be continuously chomped on and never die, and is constantly trampled under the feet of mobile creatures. Sure, you can play a semantics game by changing the definition of pain to simply &quot;harm detection&quot;, in which case plants do &#39;feel pain&#39;, but that&#39;s misleading as they really don&#39;t &#39;feel&#39; at all. <br><br>3) It is even overwhelmingly likely that invertebrates also don&#39;t feel pain, so let alone plants. <br><br>4) assuming (falsely) that plants suffer, eating an animal results in far more damage since that animal needs to eat a lot more plants than you would if you directly ate plants (besides the fact than non-vegans dont eat meat exclusively). In fact, through every stage of the food cycle, 90% of consumed energy is lost as heat, so the closer you are to the bottom of the food cycle, the less resources, and thus suffering, you will be causing.", "comment_date": "2018-02-28T11:05:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Maylo", "comment_text": "And there was no explanation HOW the plants could &quot;hear&quot; and have &quot;memory&quot;.", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T15:21:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crystal Eunoia", "comment_text": "That moment when you think of all the poor little flowers you&#39;ve picked and you feel like a murderer  \u00b0^\u00b0", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T03:56:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "e", "comment_text": "Oh no now you know that im smart", "comment_date": "2018-02-18T18:29:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Buksiblings Fun", "comment_text": "Plants help each other and a lot of humans don&#39;t", "comment_date": "2018-02-15T09:17:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M M", "comment_text": "Just because plants are intelligent that doesn&#39;t mean that they are conscious.", "comment_date": "2018-02-13T22:17:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BGKO1992", "comment_text": "I wonder what weed thinks about", "comment_date": "2018-02-08T08:32:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saeryen Kalador", "comment_text": "This is so cool!", "comment_date": "2018-02-01T20:32:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Melon Pult", "comment_text": "Ima plant I can think", "comment_date": "2018-01-31T00:13:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hi Hi", "comment_text": "Wood Wide Web yey a new website!", "comment_date": "2018-01-30T12:43:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noelle H", "comment_text": "<b>eyes the bushes outside my window suspiciously</b>", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T20:16:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Banatlao", "comment_text": "This proves it, Vegan is MURDER", "comment_date": "2018-01-28T18:28:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tripple squeeze N cheese", "comment_text": "Imagine all the weird stuff is happening with plants.", "comment_date": "2018-01-28T00:24:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shyambhadra2009", "comment_text": "Wood wide web- how they still post pictures on Instagram while camping", "comment_date": "2018-01-27T08:22:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N30N J", "comment_text": "Vegans gotta eat air now", "comment_date": "2018-01-26T04:41:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bandaze", "comment_text": "But how do plants do all these things without a brain", "comment_date": "2018-01-25T20:21:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Franz Matthew Briones", "comment_text": "I wish VIVALDI is here for nature.

I must make some things clear for people who have made diet choices and are going to comment on said choice because it is excruciating to read some of these comments. Sooo, here&#39;s the deal: We as humans have ADAPTED to be somewhat omnivorous, but since there are living vegetarians and vegans who are also happy, I would conclude that a lifestyle like theirs is successful. People just having a diet of meat, not so much. Do you know the reason why we aren&#39;t carnivores? It is because of our ability to process it. How many times have eaten raw meat? I pretty sure your answer is zero times because we need fire/heat to process it before it reaches our stomach. That is the only reason we can eat meat. But before every vegan/vegetarian jumps for joy, remember that meat is what allowed our species to evolve a bigger brain and a smaller digestion system. Nowadays, we can just aim for the optimal amount of vitamins and minerals. I mean honestly we could just synthesize them and take a mixture or multiple pills everyday. But that would probably take an excessive amount of energy and be less efficient whereas life does the work for you and is environmentally sound. It is best to have a nice variety in one&#39;s diet and everyone seems to be doing that just fine. We all, at least potentially, get all of our vital minerals (vita-mins :P) and nutrients with our current diets, so it all comes down to efficiency and environmental-friendliness. Here is the ironic part though to all of this, even though adding meat to our diet sparked our intelligence in the past leading to civilization, continuing to eat meat will eventually be our downfall.<br>Here&#39;s why: Let&#39;s say we have 2 acres of grass. Now let&#39;s take a cow that eats that grass. While the 2 acres of grass take... well... 2 acres to grow, a cow takes about the same amount. Now I am pretty damn sure that the total energy in 2 acres of grass far outweigh the total energy of the cow. To add to that, if you&#39;ve taken a biology and/or ecology course you should know this, the primary consumer (the cow) obtains 100% of the total energy from the plant whilst the secondary consumer (the human) only obtains 10% of the original total energy. By eating meat, you lose 90% of the total potential energy that you could have gained by eating the plants directly and the plants require a LOT less space. This in turn leads to deforestation. When my biology teacher told my class this it changes my perspective on things. Although both types of farms cause deforestation (horrible rice farms in Madagascar and horrible beef farms in Brazil) the plants win again as they do not require as much space. This means that the nowadays high demand for meat actually speeds up the global climate change that we are all starting to feel.<br>This argument is not about how cute the animals are or how cruel the farms are (even though I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re not really cruel) and anyone who devolves the statements back to that are pathetic. This is more about efficiency and the continuation of the world as we know it. If we want complete efficiency in our diet balancing meat and plants, we should balance between plants and insects (which are way more efficient to farm than any mammal). So for the vegan/vegetarian who empathizes with lesser living things and to the omnivore who sees no harm in eating lots of steak and pork etc., please look at the facts and base your decision on that. This believe it or not could decide whether we live in a beautiful and efficient world or an ugly and inefficient world. The proof is in the pudding and now you have to willingly take a spoonful.<br>", "comment_date": "2014-07-09T00:28:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "skskssks", "comment_text": "but they dont have conciousness... or do they?", "comment_date": "2014-07-08T22:11:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brianna Bodnar", "comment_text": "Can they feel pain?", "comment_date": "2014-07-08T03:06:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julie Baker", "comment_text": "Cede", "comment_date": "2014-07-07T23:10:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xxmoronkiller496xX", "comment_text": "Meat FTW", "comment_date": "2014-07-07T20:25:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miguel Gonzalez", "comment_text": "Can plants think about us watching a video about plants thinking wondering if they actually can think", "comment_date": "2014-07-06T09:47:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hazim", "comment_text": "Am i a plant ?", "comment_date": "2014-07-03T15:46:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LexieAssassin", "comment_text": "Fascinating, though it does trigger my plant phobia somewhat...", "comment_date": "2014-07-01T02:17:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Long Lee", "comment_text": "say, aren&#39;t these result of evolution caused by natural selection, mutation, genetic drift , etc ??", "comment_date": "2014-07-01T01:50:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarah McKinney", "comment_text": "WOW", "comment_date": "2014-07-01T01:18:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dean Griffin", "comment_text": "I like these videos.

Since plants don&#39;t move, they interact with the flora surrounding them. Could this mean that there is some form of &quot;brain&quot; or cognitive processing center in the roots? Sure, it&#39;s not a &quot;true&quot; brain, but they have to have somewhere to store\u00a0the memory and senses, and why not somewhere that generally doesn&#39;t move?\u00a0Yes, I know that roots are primarily used for the absorption and dispersal of water and nutrients through the plant, but doesn&#39;t the brain do that too? It could explain why when you uproot a plant, it dies. Again, yes, I know. Water and nutrients. But when you remove the brain from a person, no matter their physical health, or amount of water or nutrients in them and moving around, they usually die too. But this is about small plants. What about trees? Same theory applies, but what about leafs? They grow off the tree, and therefore use the same way to live as the tree does. Could this mean there is a form of &quot;brain&quot; in the leaves too? At least something proportional to the tree&#39;s. Like a baby to it&#39;s parent. Again, this is just a thought and opinion.

In order for an organism to be able to THINK it has to be able to make its own decision on what action to proceed with. Chemicals building up or mixing is NOT a decision. The plant didnt come to a conclusion those chemicals mixing would be the best way to attack. A lion sees an antelope it has multiple options it can choose to take down the antelope, it then chooses the best strategy to get its meal.

But if a machine that &quot;broke&quot; that law and allowed us to travel to the past would it be a true time travel or an inter dimensional jump? I say inter dimensional because if it is impossible to go to the past but built an apparatus to go around or break that law, would the universe remedy it by sending us to an alternate universe that resembles the point in our past lives which we wanted to travel to so we don&#39;t screw with the flow of time of the universe which we came from?

An individual plant solves no problems, it merely reacts the way evolution has led it to, after many many generations of disadvantageous reactions (or lack of a reaction) leading to the downfall of the less well-equipped members of its species. It has a set of pre-determined (not reasoned on the fly) mechanisms to react to specific situations, and as much as it pains people to imagine (I personally find it endlessly fascinating), carrion plants, for instance, never sat down and thought, &quot;you know what would attract all the beetles? If I dress up like rotting meat!&quot; It&#39;s just that the one (actually many, but the scope of evolution is hard to comprehend) that looked/smelled the most like rotting meat attracted the most beetles and therefore had the most &quot;children.&quot; Those &quot;children&quot; then came to dominate the overall population of that particular plant type.<br><br>Reasoning is surely not a pre-requisite for feeling, though, as it&#39;s well documented that mammals, at the very least, feel a range of emotions (anxiety, loss, expectation, relief, among the more complex ones). It is in fact quite interesting to ask whether or not plants feel, and to what degree, and what exactly that means.
