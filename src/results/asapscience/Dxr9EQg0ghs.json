Very curious how likely it is for someone with a much more similar to one&#39;s own face doppelganger to exist. I&#39;ve seen other content with people who have much, much more similar looking features, and while people&#39;s perception was kind of a mixed bag in that sometimes the majority rated the pair as being very identical and the computer generated sculpts also had their facial similarities as being very high, other times people rated the two &quot;doppelgangers&quot; as being extremely similar when their actual similarity was quite low compared to other couples. Needless to say, the topic of how people perceive faces is really interesting to say the least. My grandmother, spouse, and mom all think I look quite a lot like Scarlett Johansson, and for me I definitely don&#39;t see it. There&#39;s a lot of differences in proportions and features, that to me that&#39;s like saying Ann Hathaway looks a lot like her...and I don&#39;t think anyone would agree to that, they&#39;d probably be like &quot;No way, they look totally different!&quot;...but idk, I often find it amazing how so many people find that people &quot;look similar&quot; who look nothing alike to me.", "comment_date": "2022-08-13T13:52:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Canadian Options Trader", "comment_text": "I&#39;m pretty sure I saw another one of Greg&#39;s doppelgangers recently in Killarney.", "comment_date": "2022-08-13T12:19:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jayze Pickle", "comment_text": "OK BUT BOTH OF THEM LOOK THE SAME.
