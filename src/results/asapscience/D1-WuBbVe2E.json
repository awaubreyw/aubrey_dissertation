The truth though is that the flower isnt brown at all. Its dark pink,a very bright colour,far from brown. But at the time,when the flower was named,swedish didnt have any outher word for the colour than brown. And it was so strange when I discoverd this! I had to force my mind to detect the true colour!

Our modern word \u201ccyan,\u201d a greenish blue, comes from this word. Galazio or Ka\u00eflas or Azure which means blue . Just because ancient Greeks called blue by different words doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t see it EXACTLY as we do today. In English, color can function in the opposite way linguistically. Consider the color pink: pink is on the red scale, so if we had no word for pink, it could easily be considered a light red, and we would refer to it as such. Yet, as we have a distinct name for the color pink, we perceive it as a different color than red. Greeks certainly could see the color blue, but they didn\u2019t consider it separate from other shades, such as green, complicating how exactly they perceived the hue.

A key factor in this is language. When someone points to an object, and tells me that it&#39;s a bed, we perceive that the widely acceptable truth is that it&#39;s a bed. Yet, this isn&#39;t the case. Those who speak different languages have different terms for it. People in other countries use different words for the same thing, even if those words may still be English. For example, as an Indian, I know that my family in India would have called it a cot in the past. Nowadays, the wide exposure to western media has definitely changed that, leading them to use the word bed more often. <br><br>Let&#39;s look back at just English now. Let&#39;s say someone believes that dogs can only be dogs if they are black. But they are then confronted with a golden retriever. This is similar to a color distinction as in this video. They may think, &quot;Well then, this creature that appears to be a dog must not be a dog after all. Dogs must be black, and although this looks like a dog, it isn&#39;t black. Therefore, this isn&#39;t a dog.&quot; If the English language was constructed as such. If we as humans didn&#39;t have any sort of construct for what a &quot;species&quot; is, and drew distinctions within species and classified them as different animals, then that individual is very much correct. Their world simply uses different language and categorizes golden retrievers and black labs as different animals. They aren&#39;t both dogs, because the generalization &quot;dog&quot; doesn&#39;t exist. <br><br>So back to the Greeks. They simply didn&#39;t have a term for the word &quot;blue&quot;. So, they used its generalization. It&#39;s not like they can&#39;t see that it&#39;s lighter than black just like it&#39;s not that they can&#39;t see that a black labrador is different from a golden retriever. It&#39;s because they don&#39;t have this distinctions in their language that all the distinctions fall under the same umbrella term. So blue, just becomes black. And that is their widely accepted truth. It&#39;s not that they can&#39;t see blue.

Foreign scolars of Homer and ancient Greek language, somehow got the idea that ancient Greeks didn&#39;t have a word for blue. Additionally to that, Homer describes in both Heliad and Odyssey the sea as &quot;wine like in face&quot;, which they interpreted as &quot;ancient Greeks didn&#39;t have a word for blue &quot;. So let&#39;s disect that. 1. Homer was using poetic language, BUT,  in some parts of Greece when the weather is bad the sea gets a blue-reddish tint like face. So, he was being poetic  and literally describing the color of the sea on a &quot;bad day&quot;.<br>2. Ancient Greeks used to mix seawater in their wines, and drink it. They believed it was the right way of drinking it and very recently,  when scientists have replicated the process,  which is extensively described in ancient Greek texts, have it done just right, it gives the wine a blueish tint. <br>3. Ancient Greek language, and modern one,  have a lot of words  for describing different shades of blue. So, there is not just one word for it. There are a lot,  depending on the shade, \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9\u03bf,  \u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf, \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af, \u03b9\u03ce\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc. Many times though they would use the color that the sky or the sea reminded them of,  in a poetic manner,  as we modern Greeks do. We say for instance that &quot;The sea has a golden color&quot;  when the sunrays hit it.<br>4. Ancient Greeks used blue and similar shades a lot, as found in pottery, wall art, marble statues and mosaics. BUT, because of the use of costly pigments blue was an expensive color to use,  so often it was swapped for something less expensive. <br>5. There are many scenes in walls and frescoes in Minoan Crete especially,  in the isle of Santorini and elsewhere,  with the blue color.

Blue as a color has very little sources we can get pigment from. <br>     You may be thinking \u201cwait, didn\u2019t the Greeks also establish trade chains with Egyptians?\u201d And you\u2019d be correct. The reason for this change in distinction of the color blue could be linked to what Greece traded and what Rome traded. <br>     Greece mainly traded for food and luxury items such as wine and pottery. Their source of indigo dye came from India and their source Egyptian blue dye came from Egypt, obviously. They would use this dye in paintings such as the wall paintings of Knossos, in Crete. Perhaps what they did instead of value it for its rarity and use as a dye for clothing (often wore by higher powers, as seen in later civilizations such as Britain and France), but they simply used it as a hue of another color used to paint. <br>     This weirdly reflects and conflicts to the ways romans used blue. Blue, in roman times, wasn\u2019t a color or hue, but an idea. Blue was used to establish character and political/intellectual status. They perhaps saw it as yet again, another shade of black or grey or green.<br>    As the word progressed, the color blue would finally be named as the color \u201cblue\u201d. Blue comes from the Middle English word bleu, which comes from the French word bleu, which has Germanic origin as blao, meaning lustrous. This shows how several countries began to recognize blue as its own color due to trade spreading the term over the course of hundreds of years.<br>    In heldary (meaning something related to rank and status in government/military) blue is known as azure. Russia, even though it and its language don\u2019t originate from Rome, has multiple names for shades of blue. In Russian, the word for light blue can also mean yellow, light green, or gray.<br>      The Spanish language also strangely follows this weird pattern where there are multiple words for blue, most corresponding to certain hues. They, however, do not have multiple meanings like Russian blues. <br>     Let\u2019s look at Japan now. Japan, like the Himba people of the Namibia, closely associates blue with green, making them one in the same. In Japan, trash cans and recycling bins are either green or blue, with no distinction need for distinction between the two.<br>    So what\u2019s the conclusion? It all depends on what the civilization did with blue, what they associated with it, and if blue had some sort of importance in their culture. Blue has always existed, and no amount of brain work can make it  indistinct. It\u2019s not the brain that decides whether blue is it\u2019s own color, it\u2019s the people.", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T01:58:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lafeo 007", "comment_text": "this is by far one of the most interesting videos ive seen thus far.", "comment_date": "2021-11-14T23:26:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ahmet kokouja", "comment_text": "I&#39;m from Greece and this is true", "comment_date": "2021-11-14T17:43:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GHOST", "comment_text": "The Hebrew bible does actually say blue\u2026", "comment_date": "2021-11-14T13:35:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DSEN", "comment_text": "There is a indian methodology term used in many texts for Shiva saying that he is &#39;nealkanth&#39; meaning being with blue throat , so please research thoroughly !<br>There is also blue lotus offering mentioned in Ramyana by ram to Shiva in worshipping before construction of Adam&#39;s bridge", "comment_date": "2021-11-14T05:20:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xendo lawesome", "comment_text": "You ever take a second to think that they didnt make a word for blue, so they just described it?", "comment_date": "2021-11-14T02:22:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "New York", "comment_text": "You are not accurate; Tekhelet\u00a0(Hebrew: \u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05db\u05b5\u05dc\u05b6\u05ea\u200e; alternate spellings include tekheleth, t&#39;chelet, techelet and techeiles) is &quot;blue&quot; dye highly prized by ancient Mediterranean civilizations and mentioned 49 times in the Hebrew Bible/Tanakh", "comment_date": "2021-11-13T11:20:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SpeakTruth \u2018", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1-WuBbVe2E&amp;t=5m00s\">5:00</a>!ooohhhhh wow", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T07:07:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Holden", "comment_text": "When thinking on English, I see blue and light blue as different colors, but in Spanish, I see them as two different colors like red and pink", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T04:08:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dean Anderson", "comment_text": "Ive always though of gray and blue as very similar colors, i guess they both would be lighter versions of black to past eyes, so it makes sense!

There are plenty of existing languages that do not have words for certain colours, but users are able to differentiate between the colours anyway. So if anyone\u2019s argument for the Ancient Greek not seeing blue is because they didn\u2019t have a word, it\u2019s just not that simple.<br><br>Language does however affect the way we think (this is called linguistic relativity and it is fascinating, let me tell you) and the latter case described in the video is much more likely- there wasn\u2019t a common word for blue (still debatable!), so people would be less adept at articulating and recognising the colour, because it simply doesn\u2019t have a nice category for the brain to fit the concept into. Like trying to describe teal, or decide if teal looks more like green or blue if you don\u2019t have the word \u2018teal\u2019 in your lexicon. So yeah, this comment is just to clarify things for anyone who thinks the Greeks were walking around colourblind to blue.

Given that, I learned to remember colors not by words, but by the sensations I felt inside when I would see colors.  Different colors would manifest in different parts of my head and my throw for a few colors.  Blue is felt from the top of my head downward.  Purple has a presence that is felt in the center of my mouth and part of my nasal cavity.  Red is the one that I feel in my throat, towards the back and fading both upward behind the velar flap and downward into my lungs.  Yellow seems to be felt behind my nose and cheeks.  Green seems to be felt along my palate.  Black is felt everywhere, inside me and outside me.  White, I can&#39;t describe.  I also see shapes and textures in a different way.  I feel the sharp points of a square, cube, triangle, etc. spatially within.  I feel the texture of an asphalt road in the back of my throat.  Wood texture, I can&#39;t describe.

I feel like if they just could not see the color and distinguish it that it would be apparent in their descendents. Considering I have greek lineage I just disagree. I do not think they simply could not see the color because a word was not created for it. Blue is a primary color. It is as if one could say they could not see red or yellow because they did not have a word for it. It is more that blue varies in nature  and can best be described more often with its secondary attributes. Ex: Some bodies of water while technically blue are described as teal..(perhaps leaning towards green) that is impacted on clarity of the water. If the water is very clear and technically blue but it against a yellow or beige sea bed it will appear green..even more so if the shade of light being used to illuminate the area is of a more yellow wavelength.", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T17:37:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Jolly", "comment_text": "The idea that language trains our brain to be more adept at differentiating is at once both obvious and also utterly mind-blowing! <br><br>I&#39;ve heard the Innuit peoples (&quot;Eskimos&quot;) have many more words for snow than other languages and if you think about how many different types of snow there are (powdery snow, wet snow, compressed dense snow, snow that falls but doesn&#39;t stick, large snow flakes, small snow flakes, snow that it soft on top but solid ice underneath, snow that is coated with a layer of ice but powdery underneath, etc) it makes sense that people who are constantly surrounded by snow, and thus their daily lives are affected by differences in that snow,  would need to develop vocabulary to differentiate the varieties. <br><br>Again, seems obvious, but it has INCREDIBLE possibilities across the board! <br><br>The idea that the language affects the brain as much as the brain affects the language is the basis for a lot of talk therapy. In some forms of therapy clients are taught to identify emotions and  attach names to them. Naming the emotion helps the client identify and distinguish it from other sometimes broader emotions. For example embarrassment, anxiety, and fear all can trigger the fight or flight response in a person. Folks with limited emotional vocabulary generally describe this as anger (or &quot;getting pissed&quot;) because their body is preparing for a physical encounter. Through the introduction of emotional vocabulary  and assistance naming the underlying emotions a client begins to be able to distinguish between emotional triggers in the same way the video describes distinguishing between colors. \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f Mind blowing.", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T17:37:02Z", "likes_count": 218}, {"comment_by": "S'phamandla Luthuli", "comment_text": "The Zulus call the colour &quot;kuluhlaza okwesi bhaka-bhaka&quot; direct translation &#39;green as the sky&#39;.

Berlin and Kay first did research into the area, but heavily skewed their own experiments by presenting the stimulus in the form of color swatches that were already delimited by the relevant English terms. Doing so assumes that that the English way of categorizing colors is more or less an objective truth/ &quot;true&quot; reflection of reality. However, framing it this way glosses over many culturally specific and unique taxonomies. For example, Hanunoo would be classified as having only four categories: DARK, including what English would identify as Black and Blue, LIGHT, including English White, RED including english Red, and then a final category referring to both English Yellow and Green. However, a closer examination of the internal system of color classification in the language on its own terms, rather than in foreign terms imposed on it, reveals that the actual cultural taxonomy has to do with LIGHT/DARK and DRY(desiccated)/WET(fresh), which is totally missed if we just try to overlay the English terms. Works like Berlin and Kay&#39;s color taxonomies seemed to forget that English taxonomies are culturally subjective, rather than objective reflections of a single truth.

For example when Homer mentioned that the sky was bronze, he meant that it was BRIGHT as bronze, when they mentioned the color cyan (ment dark blue) or glafko (dont know the English word, but meant light blue.. the word glaucoma derives from that word) they were discribing brightness of something &quot;blue&quot; not actual blue colors (although this proves that they had at least two words for two gradiations of blue). Yellow also ment &quot;fresh&quot; or &quot;alive&quot; so they often said that blood was yellow!!! but they only did that because according to the meaning above, yellow was the proper word for them to describe something fresh and alive that gave life. They knew that it was red, but when they said that, yellow was not used as color name anymore. Many statues and walls etc had blue colors so they were using that color a lot as a color (dolphins, sky, sea, dresses, jewlery etc etc it was an important color only for paintings), so it wasnt as rare as this video implies, but had no special meaning for them except in paintings.

Blur is used for ravens, which is the common reason people believe it to mean black.

It most times has a bit of violet in it too. Even one of your examples at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1-WuBbVe2E&amp;t=5m15s\">5:15</a> mark of Pink spelled out next to Red had a lot of purple in it, so technically it is not just red mixed with white but  red-violet mixed with white.  We have far more pinks that include salmons and nearly peach that also contain orange too. Heck we even call it neon PINK not neon red! Also because we culturally denoted pale/ baby blue for male.gender and all types of pinks for female is another reason English speakers and Americans especially can identify and name many types of pinks, that and for women 1920s through today lipstick/ blush and nail colors also include brown, orange yellow, violet blue under pigments to give slightly varied shades of reds, pinks, wines and nudes and the wines have the blue undertones so maybe that is like the sea reference.  They are the more natural colors but all the colors and now shimmers and neons were added slowly since the 1980s to those types of makeup which used to be only reserved for eye shadow. <br>Also it is noteworthy to point out the four horses in the book of Revelation are not really white, black, red and pale but white, black, red and green (possibly a pale green).  Makes me think of Wizard of Oz and the horse of a different color looks pale green at one point in the movie. I guess the idea of a green horse seemed odd so they went with another possible choice of translation as when a person goes pale like to be sick they look a bit green.  But given this video of color terms and language it seems pretty obvious that after red it would be green or yellow to differentiate.  Also many point out that the colors of the flags of the counties that seem most opposed to Israel and surround them  contain black, white, red and green.  Interesting that Israel&#39;s is blue on white background.<br>  So glad I live in a technicolor world and know so many colors from crayola crayons mega boxes and had chances to paint and mix colors with acrylics.

Every Latin courses I&#39;ve heard of almost always start out with Julius Caesar&#39;s commentaries on the Gallic Wars, because he purposely wrote them in the spoken vernacular as opposed to the typical Latin used in literature, and so it&#39;s not as daunting as the literary Latin. <br>I think the fact that blue doesn&#39;t appear often in nature would result in it not being thought of as much either. The Ocean is blue, but not everywhere. The northern Atlantic in New England has always been green whenever I looked out at. Blue was popular with royalty specifically because it was so difficult to produce. Lapis lazuli was the blue you would find during antiquity and the medieval era, and it was insanely expensive to produce.<br>This video isn&#39;t way off the mark, but it&#39;s relying on some shaky premises.", "comment_date": "2021-09-15T13:57:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sam C 95", "comment_text": "Here&#39;s another question: did the ancient Greeks, the philosophers that they were, ever ask themselves why the sky is blue?

That light green circle also jumped out at me very quickly.

Different plants and trees might be the difference between life and death and the only way to distinguish them is by a slight color difference. Yes the sea has been around longer than life itself, but since it&#39;s always been there, it&#39;s not been enough to push our mind to learn a completely new color just because it MAY be dangerous in some cases, rather it&#39;s a symbol for life itself and a comfort as well as normal. Now red is important because if you bleed, you need to know that you are in danger, and then green for food when our metabolistic system evolved and so on.

Its because there is a Conspiracy in Science they don&#39;t want you to know. The Color Blue wasn&#39;t SEEN until the OCA2 corrected the third photon receptors behind the eye. This is the Chroma Color Vision of the Chromagnon phenotype. This color Blue was Realized and written in the bible called Heavens Eye at the time it was presented. Neanderthal were of the OCA1 and colorblind to UV light. Because most morons think eye color is pigmentation, but on this same chromosome 11 of Malanocyte contains the same frequency into light in Bioluminescence Luciferase. It wasn&#39;t until the OCA2 covertly passed thru the population mostly unnoticed that offspring began seeing blues. Most who recieved the Blessing were of Babylon, Sumerian, and then Israel decent and did not enter Europe until exiled from Israel during Diaspora. The people of the bible who recieved the Blessing for those who kept to the Levite Covenant, to keep it in the tribes via inner breeding.  When we trace the Origin of the OCA2, we see the highest concentration is in modern day Ethiopan. So the Blues migrated into Europe just a few thousand years ago and were NOT from European at all, but instead Subsaharan African Albino. This gene further evolved Adaptive Melanation, a child gene of the OCA2 called the HERC2, known as Olive Skin, associated with the family tree, or Olive tree. So ancient Neanderthal even in the red hair and green eyes were unable to view UV light up until Blues migrated North. What this means is Reds and Blondes were Completely Independ and not related until they mixed in more recent times, which passed this gene on. A Real event where Neanderthal and Chromagnon cross breeded.<br>Neanderthal saw a Purple Sky.. We can see this separation of the Church in Purple Robed Talmud and the Baby Blue Robed of the Torah. These Blues were called Ghosts, Spirits, and Angels. They were deemed Oracles, Prophets with abilities to see future. To this day 1 in 12 people still cannot see the color blue Today.

The same garment had to be washed in the sea at nearby Phaliron. The duration normally was that of a week, as always there were games involved athletic and some of arts (theatre poetry etc), Thus as the word blue is a French originated one, in Greek there are at least three words cyanoon or (thalassi {thalassa = sea} or galano (depending of the era we are referring to), or referring to the colour of the greek flag, of the sky and the sea). The identification of the colour and the garment in question, according to your arguments it would be rather impossible, in conclusion any gentleman must be either, mistaken, paid, or illiterate, while believing that there is insufficient need to identify the colour of what is mentioned here above.

In my humble opinion you should research more before you release something that could form the opinion of people. And I will speak with facts in order to understand it. I am Greek, and although I am not an archeologist or something I love our tradition and Iliad and Odyssey are two of my favorite books, and I&#39;ve read them many times. Have you read any of the two? If you haven&#39;t, you can&#39;t have an opinion because you are based in someone else&#39;s opinion for this video. But if you have read them my friend it is even worse because it means you don&#39;t pay any attention. Homer was a poet, and it is normal to this day for poets to use metaphors. Of course the sea don&#39;t seem to look always blue depending on the hour of the day and the light. Homer just describes something from the poets point of view. And also, in numerous occasions, in both epic poems, when is referring to Athina (goddess of wisdom) he names her (\u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1 \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7) - glaukomata Athini - which means blue-eyed Athina. The key word here is glaukomata which comes from the words &quot;glaukos&quot; (\u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) - that means light blue (in modern Greek we say galazio that comes from this word to refer to light blue). The second word is &quot;oma&quot; that means eye (in modern Greek we say mati that comes from this word). Also in English you use the word cyan that comes directly from the ancient Greek word &quot;kianos&quot; (\u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2) which means dark blue, and we also use in modern Greek but not as dark blue now. (for dark blue we say now &quot;ble&quot; which comes from blue). So you see that your argument is totally wrong. I have already given you two words that were used then and also now. And even more unbelievable is that even you use the second one without knowing the etymology of it. And honestly, you don&#39;t have to know Greek to understand that it&#39;s not possible for a country with so much blue surrounding it with all the sea and sky, to not have a word to describe a color. The Greek language is the richest language in the world.

You are incorrect, sir. The color Blue is mentioned 50 times in the Hebrew (and Aramaic) Old Testament, primarily in Exodus, the 2nd book of the Hebrew Bible, but also in Numbers, 2nd Chronicles, Esther, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel. The color Blue is mentioned twice in the New Testament, in the book of Revelation. The book of the Exodus was written by Moses, between 1440-1400 BC. The book titled 2nd Chroniciles was written between 450-425 BC; 470-424 BC for Esther; 627-586 BC for Jeremiah; and 593-565 BC for Ezekiel. Not only Blue, but Purple, Scarlet, Violet, Crimson, Green, and Gold, as well as descriptions of 12 different precious stones. And though color-descriptions are not included, it&#39;s obvious that they are visibly different from one another for their inclusion as decorations for the Temple, and for the garments worn by priests. And before you try to say that my rebuttal is illegitimate because I mentioned &quot;2nd Chronicles&quot; and the prophets by name, when there is only a single book called &quot;Chronicles&quot; in the Hebrew original text.

Cause they rarely see something blue. After all most water is brown there and they don&#39;t have sea affairs. So this argument is pointless. Once Greece was a marine state.. They needed words for sea more than others (counter argument to yours <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1-WuBbVe2E&amp;t=2m32s\">2:32</a>). I don&#39;t know what type of research you done before this. But probably you just read a guardian article. Cause like.... &quot;only Egyptians had it&quot;.... Like dude..... Minoans had blue colours in their art in 5 to 7 thousand bce. The reason blue wasn&#39;t used often. Wasn&#39;t because they didn&#39;t know the colour it was because, like purple, it was extremely expensive to make.<br>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1-WuBbVe2E&amp;t=2m49s\">2:49</a> you said &quot;even the modern European word for blue is derives from black and green&quot;. Idk what Europeans do. But you better leave greece out of that. The only thing you came to prove is how poor the English and other languages are. Greece is quite possibly one of the wealthiest languages vocablury wise. Now let me tell you how Greeks called Blue. There is a plant named cornflower, (scientific name: centaurea CYANUS). Cyan (\u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc, kiano) is a Greek word for a type of blue. Also in middle ages  there was galazio (\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9\u03bf) from the ancient Greek word \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ca\u03c2 (kalais). And lastly. There was the colour thallasi which is the blue of the sea. Ancient greens had their own words for blue. So if you are searching for the word blue. You are not going to find anything. Other languages maybe didn&#39;t have blue back in the days. But Greeks most certainly did. Please when you make a video on something you don&#39;t know, do spend some time to ask a native speaker or someone with some knowledge. Or just research on it.

They seem to want to support this notion that universally all humans follow a linear progression of development that eventually leads to something like English.  Of course the fact that English is lacking in the degrees of hue that other languages developed naturally is of no consequence since that doesn&#39;t support the idea that all humans follow the same linear path of progress.

But he also used terms of comparison abundantly, that make perfect sense and are more to the point than modern names.  The colour of the sea he described as that of the darkness of wine : he really meant the colour of wine as it is pressed by feet in a vat, which is dark purplish blue.  The colour of the late afternoon sky he described as deep as a bronze dome : he really meant a dome covered with bronze tiles that are always light warm blue-green and that is exactly the typical colour of the mediterranean sky in summer with much sunlit haze making the colour greener than blue.  Blue pigments were always very popular in Greece since that civilization appeared, it was always the most indispensable colour for all statues, but each shade of them was given a special name following melas, often from a deity.  Blue grapes are still called black in modern French even though they are clearly blue.  As for the Himbas it must be noted that the sky of the African region they inhabit is never blue but golden and grey with dust and humidity on the horizon.

First, to me, anything between green and indigo is blue. The sky is sometimes blue. Water is clear, but in certain areas, especially near-tropical, &#39;where the water is&#39; looks blue (typically light blue). So when the Bible multiple times refers to something as (the color) t&#39;chelet, it&#39;s clearly using a word for blue. And when it says something is the color of a sapphire, it&#39;s clearly referring to blue. A few sapphires are other colors (basically any actual color except reds), but then there would need to be some explanation &quot;like some rare sapphires&quot; or equivalent.<br>The linguistics of color is clear that not all cultures divide the rainbow into ROYGBIV - after all, the colors are a continuum. You can divide those 7 colors into 1 color [so translate as &quot;colored&quot; as vs white which is all colors in one, or black which is the absence of any color], or 1 million names. Most English speakers today actually only recognize 6 colors in the rainbow - ROYGBV (leaving Indigo as shades of blue and violet). Fair enough. Some languages use the same word for most of the blue and green part of the spectrum. Did Greek? I wasn&#39;t alive back then, so won&#39;t try to give my opinion - it would be opinion, not fact. <br>Saying that the ancient Greeks - or the ancient Hebrews - didn&#39;t ever mention the word blue would be valid, since neither was English. Saying they never talked about something that was the color we call blue is just incorrect. The fact that we today don&#39;t know when they did is our incomplete knowledge. And yes, our knowledge is more incomplete that many ancient-Greek (classical or koine) or ancient-Hebrew experts are willing to admit.<br>What is not just my opinion, but actual fact, is that &quot;The Ancient Greeks Could[] See Blue.&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T04:11:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blubasnurk", "comment_text": "or maybe they didnt know what to call blue??", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T03:14:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "La Quan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1-WuBbVe2E&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a> dog: help my please", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T03:11:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drew M", "comment_text": "Pink and Brown are special colours that aren&#39;t really different colours... they&#39;re Red and orange but they have a special name now so they&#39;re special...", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T03:11:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UNDER RAPS MAGAZINE", "comment_text": "This video made me blue \ud83d\ude43", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T02:41:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lae Victus", "comment_text": "The sky is blue because God loves the infantry", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T02:40:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ramzes Empire", "comment_text": "so the Ancient Egyptians were more advanced than everyone else...got it", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T02:36:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spekky", "comment_text": "pretty awesome video !", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T02:28:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Seitter", "comment_text": "Didn\u2019t vox do a video on this 3 years ago?", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T02:27:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonah Cutter", "comment_text": "Duh, blue is an English word, they were speaking Greek", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T02:24:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glenn Young", "comment_text": "Stupidest YouTube I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.

Or at least, to be more precise, any other meanings are secondary to the the use of the term for the color and are derived from the color.  For example, &quot;red&quot; means that particular color first and foremost and any use of &quot;red&quot; to refer to something else is deriving that meaning from the use of the color for that concept.  But there are other ways of referring to color.  This video even gives an example of it while sliding right on by the significance:  &quot;Wine-dark.&quot;  That&#39;s a reference to color that isn&#39;t a pure color term.  &quot;Wine&quot; is primarily a reference to the alcoholic beverage, but it does have a color and if someone talks about &quot;wine&quot; as a color, it carries a meaning (though in this case, the linguistic distinctions of color apply which is why an Ancient Greek might call the sea &quot;wine-dark&quot; but a Modern Englishman probably wouldn&#39;t.)\r<br>\r<br>We do this in English.  As noted in the video (and again, they just slid right by this without paying attention to the significance), English makes a distinction between certain shades of red with lighter shades being called &quot;pink.&quot;  It doesn&#39;t do this with &quot;blue.&quot;  Light blue and dark blue are still called &quot;blue.&quot;  Russian, on the other hand, does make this distinction.  Just as English has distinct color terms for light shades of red as distinct from other shades, Russian makes a distinction between light and dark blue (\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439 and \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439, respectively)\r<br>\r<br>But that doesn&#39;t mean English has no words to describe light shades of blue.  Instead of a &quot;pure color term,&quot; English uses modifiers or other objects with the particular shade to refer to those colors:  &quot;sky&quot; blue, &quot;baby&quot; blue, &quot;light&quot; blue, &quot;turquoise,&quot; &quot;aquamarine.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>This means that &quot;orange&quot; is not a pure color term in English because it is named after the fruit that has that color.  And speaking of orange, &quot;brown&quot; is a pure color term...for dark orange (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU).\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU).\r</a><br>\r<br>So yes, the Greeks described blue objects all the time.  Speaking of Homer, the goddess Athena is routinely described as being blue-eyed.  He just didn&#39;t use the word &quot;blue&quot; and in most translations, she is called &quot;grey-eyed Athena&quot;...even though Ancient Greek doesn&#39;t have a pure color term for &quot;grey,&quot; either.

Another word \ud30c\ub797\ub2e4 (para-ta) usually means blue, but sometimes it also means green, as in \ud30c\ub780 \ubd88 (para-n bul, green light of a traffic light). There are Sino-Korean expressions that refer to green and blue. \ucd08\ub85d/\u8349\u7da0 (chorok adj./n.), \ucd08\ub85d\uc0c9/\u8349\u7da0\u8272 (choroksaek n. or for short, \ub179\uc0c9/\u7da0\u8272 noksaek n.) is used for green.&quot;...<br><br>&quot;The Japanese word ao (\u9752, n., aoi (\u9752\u3044, adj.)), the same kanji character as the Chinese q\u012bng, can refer to either blue or green depending on the situation. Modern Japanese has a word for green (\u7dd1, midori), but it is a relatively recent usage.[citation needed] Ancient Japanese did not have this distinction: the word midori came into use only in the Heian period, and at that time (and for a long time thereafter) midori was still considered a shade of ao.[citation needed] Educational materials distinguishing green and blue came into use only after World War II;[22] thus, even though most Japanese consider them to be green, the word ao is still used to describe certain vegetables, apples, and vegetation. Ao is also the word used to refer to the color on a traffic light that signals one to &quot;go&quot;.&quot;<br><br>there&#39;s more on the whole wikipedia article, it&#39;s fascinating. and extremely relevant to the vid lol", "comment_date": "2020-12-04T22:18:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Payo", "comment_text": "That was Peach!

Unlike tools, making fire clothing ext. which all came later, its why we have to be taught those things, but language, now that we&#39;ve evolved that ability, is one of the first things a baby will stride to learn. <br><br>They first learn to walk thus in the beginning, thats what we evolved into; walking man, then they learn to talk (which means we evolved speech after evolving walking on 2 feet), and its at no other time in our lives that learning a language is as easy as it is when you are a toddler, and its actually the most optimal time to teach your child multiple languages. <br><br>At no other time after that will it be as easy to learn, and thats due to the fact that it has become an evolutionary trait, thus its only natural that our language has become so closely tied to our conceptions of everything from the physical to the abstract, but especially the abstract, since the abstract has no physical representation of itself, other than the word used to describe itself. we can say an object is red, or a person is brown , but we wouldn&#39;t say that thing is a red, or that person is called a brown, thus since the abstract such as color has no physical representation of itself, the word we used to describe them becomes them itself, there is no other way of describing red other than saying that its red, we would never say that red looks like a chair, therefore the only way we can convey the conception of an abstract idea such as a color is to denote words as there representations, thus the words we use for that idea becomes the very foundation of that idea, in other words(no pun intended) the word reinforces the idea, and the idea reinforces the word, as he stated in the video. <br><br>Other ways this understanding can be looked at is how brand words have become synonymous with certain products as in being the product itself, a perfect example of this is Kleenex.

What do you think happens to someone after they die?<br>2. Do you think there is an afterlife? <br>3. If heaven exists, how do you get there? <br>4. Would you be good enough to get into heaven?<br> <br>Here are a few questions to see if you are a good person: <br> <br>1. How many lies have you told in your whole life? <br>2. Have you ever stolen? <br>3. Have you ever used God&#39;s name in vain?<br>4. Jesus said that &quot;whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart&quot; (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust? <br>5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day? <br>6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?<br> <br>The Bible says that &quot;all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone&quot; (Revelation 21:8) and &quot;Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people \u2014 none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God&quot; (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn&#39;t have to go to Hell? <br> <br>2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God&#39;s law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus\u2019 death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us. <br> <br>What you have to do is repent, or confess and forsake your sins, and trust alone in Jesus Christ. Don&#39;t trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, \u201cNo one is good \u2014 except God alone\u201d (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again.

Simply stated, language affects the way we think. That seems reasonable enough, until you start claiming that  (false),  (false), and ancient Greeks couldn\u2019t see blue (probably false).<br><br>The ancient Greeks had kyanos, which was probably a dark bluish purple, and glaucus which was a light greyish greenish blue. Like in any language, these colors covered a range of hues, and like in any language, they do not correspond exactly to the terms in that bastard child of Saxon and Norman that we call English. Probably what happened was that someone translated kyanos as purple, and glaucus as green, noticed there was a missing color, applied the Whorfian Hypothesis without caution, and came up with \u201cThe Greeks couldn\u2019t see Blue\u201d. And then the Internet happened, and it became some weird repeated factoid, like how  (false).<br><br>Some things that are true: different languages divide up what seem like distinct concepts differently. Spanish has a single word that covers both \u201cfinger\u201d and \u201ctoe\u201d, Vietnamese has a single word that covers both \u201cwindow\u201d and \u201cdoor\u201d. For that matter, English has a single word that covers the French words \u201csavoir\u201d and \u201cconnaitre\u201d.

Interestingly, languages seem to acquire these terms in the same order, and what we call blue is among the last colors to get its own term. Modern Vietnamese is in a similar position to Greek; it has a word xanh, used for a range of colors described in English as either green or blue.

As I recall, the Himba study was discredited and that&#39;s the only study you cited which confirms the central theory of the video. All of the examples usually given are linguistic, such as calling water black - something the Himba study is usually paired with. The sea isn&#39;t blue - not most of the time. Water, especially river water, isn&#39;t blue either. Rivers tend to be brown or otherwise dark. The only conclusion you can draw from people lacking a word for the colour &quot;blue&quot; is that they didn&#39;t have a word for the colour blue, or a use for describing it. Drawing any further conclusion - that people couldn&#39;t see it or describe it or differentiate it - is speculation at best.<br><br>A somewhat recent Technology Connections video ran into a similar problem talking about the colour brown, and how it&#39;s a weird colour. You can&#39;t have bright brown, because it starts to look orange - because it is orange. A very dark, usually desaturated orange. Many languages have a word for it because it&#39;s common and many people see the colour only within the context of that word so they have trouble perceiving it as the dark reddish yellow that it is, but that doesn&#39;t mean that people &quot;can&#39;t see&quot; dark orange.<br><br>I&#39;m not a native English speaker. You know what colour my language doesn&#39;t have a word for? Ultramarine. And yet, when I first saw 16-colour graphics back in the late 80s, I was fully capable of recognising that colour as distinct from the others. I just called it blue - and do to this day. To many people, the word &quot;blue&quot; tends to mean something closer to cyan, usually referred to as &quot;sky blue&quot; despite it not being at all. Or there&#39;s my favourite thought experiment. Grab your favourite image editor, grab a dead-centre yellow hue with maximum saturation, then crank the luminance down to 20-30%. The colour begins to &quot;appear&quot; green-ish, even though it&#39;s still just as yellow.<br><br>Having a word for a thing is proportionate to how important describing that thing is, not in the slightest how well people are able to actually perceive it.", "comment_date": "2020-12-02T04:11:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Reese Herrmann", "comment_text": "I FEEL LIKE THE CONCLUSION IS WRONG BUT DON\u2019T HAVE ANY DATA OR EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT MY FEELING", "comment_date": "2020-12-02T04:11:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "An Mo", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t place his accent....", "comment_date": "2020-12-02T04:10:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jmchez", "comment_text": "If we had mantis shrimp eyes, we would have to invent 10,000 new words for all the colors we could see.", "comment_date": "2020-12-02T04:08:36Z", "likes_count": 186}, {"comment_by": "jmchez", "comment_text": "Brown is just dark orange!

It was also a commandment for all Jewish men to tie 3 white woolen threads to each corner of any 4 cornered garments along with one of the threads in each corner also being techelet. The strings were to serve as a constant reminder to follow the Torah\u2019s  hundreds of commandments &amp; to keep away from sinning throughout the day.

This dye was derived from a certain type of rare snail that would sometimes wash up on the beaches of the  Mediterranean. The Romans prized this expensive &amp; rare dye so much that they eventually outlawed its use for anybody who was not royalty. So the Jews had to stop wearing it. After the Roman ban had been lifted, the detailed Mosaic tradition of which exact species of snail could qualify for fulfilling the biblical commandment had fallen out of use for so long that over time the knowledge got lost. Nowadays, scientific inquiries &amp; research has claimed to identify the correct critter but most Jews are unwilling to reinstate something that was lost without a reliable unbroken tradition while a minority decided they have nothing to lose &amp; started using the dye again. The point is that the Techelet was described in ancient sources &amp; compared to the color of the sea &amp; sky so I don\u2019t know what this guy means when he says that there is no mention of the color blue in the Bible.

Assyriologist Wayne Horowitz explains that the Sumerian word uqnu, the word for the gem lapis lazuli, was used for the color blue and its shades. The term was applied to the sky and to blue wool (uqnatu). When the foreign word takiltu, Hebrew tekhelet, was adopted into Akkadian, the same cuneiform signs as uqnatu were used. To the ancient Mesopotamians, therefore, the color of lapis lazuli and the sky were equivalent to the color of tekhelet.&quot; <a href=\"https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/what-color-was-tekhelet/\">https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/what-color-was-tekhelet/</a><br>  <br>Ancient artists often had to limit their use of blue because appropriate pigments (such as lapis lazuli) were expensive and hard to come by, so of course it doesn&#39;t show up in paleolithic cave paintings. The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants \u2013 woad in Europe, indigo in Asia and Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either lapis lazuli or azurite.

What does &quot;active part of creating it&quot; refer to? Our perception or the world?<br>Our brains do enable us to perceive, but neither our brains nor does our perception create the world. So, are brains can &quot;create&quot; perception, but they create the ability to perceive, along with our sense organs. Brains cannot create the world. For one thing, there is an improper separation of our brains and the world. Our brains are part of the world, they exist in the world. Something must exist before it can be perceived. The neuroscience studies must be unpackaged as well. The Himba people can tell the difference between the different greens because they have trained themselves to spot the differences between the greens. When neuroscientists analyze such information, the &quot;highlighting&quot; our brains do does not point to some feedback loop that is supposedly making different colors amplified. The &quot;highlighting&quot; is a lighting up of the brain when a certain concept is brought to the surface. So, we could see a similar lighting up of the brain if a cat was shown to us and we recall the concept &quot;cat.&quot; And the same would happen across other cultures that have words for the same concept &quot;cat.&quot; So, if you ask a Himba for the difference between the colors of the wheel with one blue dot, the reason their brains would not light up when seeing this blue dot is because they do not have a word for that particular color. The brain lights up for the different green dot because they have been specifically trained to identify this differently, whereas the blue one has no specific training. Now with pink a similar process happens. We still see the difference between the various reds, no matter if we have the word &quot;pink&quot; or not. A person knowing the word &quot;pink&quot; will have a lighting up event in their brain, while the person not having this word will not have a lighting up event. So, the person without the word might take a few seconds to think of something that is deeper, like referencing hues, which then the lighting up event would occur. <br><br>One of the fundamental problems that people overlook when referencing colors is that they do not properly understand colors and the activity of light. For instance, the Blue Morpho Butterfly. This butterfly is said to not be truly blue because it is a reflection between different branches of a Christmas tree-like pattern on its surface. The light bounces in between these branches and most of the light continues down the triangle shape between the branches while the blue light reflects back outwards, thus we see blue. One problem with calling this as not true blue is that people are not looking at how light is fundamentally absorbed or reflected. Whether from a flat surface or a Christmas tree-like surface, it is electrons that reflect light or allow it to continue further into the object. The same sort of reflection is happening on both the butterfly&#39;s surface and the surface of a blue object, its just that the blue surface does the action of reflection on a much smaller scale. It is not the action of reflection on the surface or the action of processing light on the surface that says something is true blue or not. It requires two things. The perceived thing (photons) and the perceiver, but the objectivity of this analysis lies in the perceived thing itself, the photons. Since they travel with their wavelength in the blue range, they are therefore blue. Of course the phenomenon of the blue color can&#39;t exist until a perceiver perceives it, but this is not a creation of the world or the proof of subjectivity. The phenomenon of blue in our brains is rooted in the objective (objective as in existing apart from human consciousness) existence of the thing and of the photons. <br><br>Another popular question that tries to root out the objective or subjective nature of conscious is this &quot;If a tree falls in the middle of the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?&quot; The sound has two aspects that people tend not to identify. They think of the sound as existing or not existing, but then run into confusion. Many rightly see that if one chooses either answer of no sound or yes sound, that something is off about this answer. Sound engineers and physicists that work with sound do not help with this question. Sound engineers and physicists think that the sound is the movement of the air around the falling tree, so they say yes, the falling tree with no one around makes a sound. Others believing that the sound only exists in the brain, say that no, a sound is not made, and make rationalizations to keep from taking note of the movement of air. Both are partially correct and both are partially wrong.  The basis of the sound still exists, no matter what. The phenomenon of the sound requires a perceiver for the sound to manifest, but it also requires the movement of air against the ear. Therefore, one aspect of the sound exists in the middle of the forest with no one around, but it cannot be heard. <br><br>In most discussions like these a false dichotomy is always set up. That there is a mind-body dichotomy or a dichotomy between the world as it is and human consciousness. The world exists, humans exist, humans are part of the world, and thus must be included in the world when we speak of it. Consciousness formed for animals to be able to move about the world and engage with it. The difference sense organs enable us to seek pleasure and sustenance and to avoid pain and death. In these discussions, the long history of the success of life is disregarded and that this supposedly illusory perception we have is just some weird disjointed phenomenon. From the first advents of life to today, you are the latest link in the chain of a long line of successful living. Imagine that for a moment. You are part of a chain that stretches back millions of years or billions of years to today and this is an incontestable fact of a chain of uninterrupted, successful life. And at this certain point in time of this long successful chain, you are existing and surviving and being successful because of the certain type of being you are, namely a human being, that possesses the type of consciousness that humans possess. Human beings are successful because of this type of consciousness. To equate our consciousness with illusion-factories is to make a mockery of human beings, as if we exist causelessly and with no engagement with the world. That we are separate from the world and exist because of some unintelligible process, because of lies or falsehood. Illusions occur because of a failing consciousness or a failing brain. Illusions result from an interference in the processes of a healthy brain. So, to equate regular everyday perception with failing perception is to build into your knowledge a fundamental problem with human consciousness and human life. It is to say that you cannot know anything and that life is unlivable. But remember, there are millennia upon millennia of evidence that proves life is lived and that we are successful living beings.", "comment_date": "2020-12-02T01:33:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zois Antonopoulos", "comment_text": "This video is inaccurate .

The reason he can say that, &quot;The bible doesn&#39;t have blue in it.&quot; is because like alot of things in the Torah. The direct meaning of the word was lost through years of exile in different lands. Tekhelet became used to describe Holy things such as Gods essence and his throne, including the sky.<br> All this History is really hard to write down here, but long story short. The Rabbis found out that, Tekhelet traditionally came from the Chilazon sea snail that lives in the Mediterranean sea. They where able to recreate the color the way it was said to have looked. The color was blue.<br> So, basically he&#39;s not being totaly honest here. The color Tekhelet is widley know to be blue. So, yes our Bibles do have the color blue in them, and they describe things that are usualy blue as such, but it could be argued that, since the word had such a confusing history no one can be 100% clear on its initial meaning.<br> Looking at the evidence though, it does seem very clear that this was the color blue.

Thus, black may have been early on not a color, but the description of the absence of color (which it is) at night.  Red would describe the color of blood and some plants.  Green would be the color on many plants, and brown, the color of the earth.  The color of white is almost completely absent in nature and there&#39;s little reason to have had a name for it.  The only white things (to us) in nature are clouds, snow, and some flowers.  Clouds are usually grey, snow very rarely occurs in the temperate zones where language started and is only seen as white when it accumulates, and white flowers and plants don&#39;t occur in enough abundance to require a separate named color.  <br><br>As far as assigning color to specific things, I once heard a linguist describe a researcher in contact with a remote tribe who was investigating what colors they called various things.  After pointing out a number of items and getting responses, he pointed to the blue sky and asked what color it is.  The person being questioned had no idea what the researcher meant since he was pointing at the empty sky.  There was nothing there and thus there was no color at all.<br><br>I can see blue as being one of the last-named colors, but I think white may be nearly last, too.", "comment_date": "2020-11-30T07:26:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Henry", "comment_text": "Not a great idea to draw evidence about describing colors of things from homer since the guy was blind", "comment_date": "2020-11-30T07:26:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "raheel saleem", "comment_text": "Its time to watch blue,s clue,s", "comment_date": "2020-11-30T07:26:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vintage Thrifter", "comment_text": "So what you are saying is that the ancient civilizations were like men.

The feedback loop galvanizing our vision of the world around us through language alone is quite interesting, as is the thought that only when we start actually seeing objects as an artifact of our fascination other than our superstition, we look for more precise words to describe them. And with colors I thought was the most convincing argument that naming them came on the back of our ability to recreate them (blue is indeed often a hue, or light fraction instead of a pigment, like with the butterfly) We will look for a word to specify the color once we have found a way to recreate them. And blue has been famously difficult to recreate as a real and pure pigment. Maybe that is why blue was mostly a royal color (blue blood), for that exact reason: rare, expensive and therefore it required the luxury of enough time and resources to develop the intellectual and emotional ability to enjoy it for what it is. A peasant couldn\u2019t care less if the pillow he rested his weary head on was grey yellow or pink.

Of course, the Japanese borrowed many words and characters from the Chinese, so any ideas of color were borrowed from them as well. The evolution of the character for \u201cgreen\u201d is interesting too, because it\u2019s a reference to the color of copper once it starts rusting. Also, the word q\u012bng (\u9752) in Chinese describes a number of, what we in English would describe as \u201cdifferent colors.\u201d It is supposed to describe the colors of a budding plant, and this can range from yellow, to light green, to deep green, to blue, to black. They began to use \u7dd1 to refer to green and \u85cd to refer to blue. In Japan, \u9752 still refers to \u201cblue,\u201d but it can be used to mean \u201cgreen\u201d in the literal and figurative sense still. Of course they have adopted \u7dd1, but no one says \u201cthe fruit is still \u7dd1,\u201d \u201cthe light turned \u7dd1,\u201d \u201cthe grass is \u7dd1,\u201d all of this is still \u201c\u9752.\u201d (blue, but actually green) Adding \u201csun\u201d (\u65e5) gives \u201cclear sky\u201d (\u6674), so obviously they had a concept of what color the sky was supposed to look like on a clear day when the sun can be seen.

If the star is not transmitting a certain color (electro-magnetic frequency) then that color can not be reflected off of objects that ARE that color. <b>In the case of a yellow or red star, a purely blue flower would appear black or dark and the present atmosphere would appear gray or dark.</b><br>Hint 2: A star&#39;s color is mostly determined by it&#39;s mass (not necessarily size) and temperature and what fuel it is using for fusion at the time. All these parameters change over time changing the color of the star. Occasionally, sometimes due to external events, these parameters can change abruptly.

It was a really really hark kyan generally used to substitute black. Egyptians used blue so bright because they had access to pigments of lapis lazuri from afganistan.

Plus Homer was also writing poetry so the &quot;wine-colored&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; basically was also serving the purpose of his metrical system plus the memorizing words (by the way there is no evidense that Homer actually existed as a person or if it was a team of people. There are theories about it)<br>Also I would like to point out that the Egyptians called the sea &quot;the great green one&quot; so even if they did use blue they didn&#39;t use it to determine some stuff that were clearly blue of color so sometimes it is a matter of choice at terminology too<br><br>EDIT: Also thanks to another commenter here: Athena is called &quot;glaukopthalme&quot; which both translates as &quot;the eyes of an owl&quot; or &quot;blue eyed&quot; so the term blue exists in greek as well as the color &quot;cyan&quot; which is used for blue color", "comment_date": "2020-11-28T16:04:58Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Clive Matthews", "comment_text": "Definitely very interesting", "comment_date": "2020-11-28T16:00:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steph Elisabeth", "comment_text": "This is not at all where I thought you were going with this.

Normally, the term is applied in phonology, but you can use the same logic to talk about word meaning as well. Simply put, the reason why a specific and unique word for blue takes longer to develop, is because blue is the colour in the environment that it least used to distinguish between things because blue was a pigment that took the longest to come under the control of humanity. Think about it this way. Imagine today but we never learned to create blue pigments, such that nothing the people produced was blue. The need to create a word for blue simply does not arise, because you&#39;re never in an instance of &quot;hand me the bowl, the blue one, not the red one&quot;. It doesn&#39;t matter that people could look to the skies or ocean and see blue all day everyday, because there was only 1 sky and 1 ocean. I.e., you never ran into the situation where you would need to distinguish between the brown sky or the blue sky. Furthermore, day and night doesn&#39;t factor into this, because human brains are hardwired to interpret colour based on apparent lighting level. So if your brain sees a colour that it thinks is well let, versus a colour that it thinks is not well let, your brain will see them as two different shades, even if they are the same shade (this is what created the dress illusion, some people were interpreting it as a well lit dress, others were interpreting it as a dress in shade, and your brain then tried to account for this and makes you see what it believes to be the neutral colour, independent of lighting conditions).<br><br>As for categorisation, and our ability to distinguish different colours, it is true that the functional load of words impacts on this. However, studies have found that this impact is only fairly shallow, and for the most part, regardless of specific words and distinctions, human brains categorise colours all on the same general framework, and where words come in to create splits in categorisation line up with this universal framework, with same small margin of error.

You flip the filter over and off the image so you can make blink comparisons. Then you get really good at it and can see these variations in the world without the filters and the blink comparing. The best real world test are walls of a room, sunlit parts are warmer, blue sky lit parts are bluer... I think anyone who is not color blind can quickly learn this. One quirk. When an image is bluer (not more cyan, but more blue) it can appear darker. The big trash cans used just about everywhere in the world are called by most people &#39;black&#39; I see them as &#39;brown&#39;. Okay, most people call them black - I accept that. But what I find curious is that a lot of people seem really annoyed that I call them brown. That I don&#39;t understand - it&#39;s not like this would cause any confusion, like if there was a tan colored container. This sort of dissonant disagreement can also happen with greenish turquoise. <br>And it does seem to be true that men only know 6 colors. Even though I&#39;ve worked in the arts, and have learned to tell very subtle color differences; I still have to look up some color names that I&#39;ve looked up in the past.  Also in Moon and Six Pence Somerset Maugham&#39;s novel about a &#39;Gauguin&#39; type painter, he points out early in the book that the color combinations first used by his fictional painter had been during the painter&#39;s life to be see as unacceptable and jarring, yet now, after the artist&#39;s death, and new fame are now universally thought of as beautiful. I think he ascribes this shift as being caused by fabric designers copying the artist and then saturating the world with them.  <br>And never make the philosopher&#39;s mistake of saying that we can&#39;t understand something until we have a name for it. Franz de Waals says that animal behaviorists find this hilariously foolish.  But your African example does make a great case that the philosophers may be wrong generally, but specifically &#39;words for...&#39; do seem to have great value.

I&#39;m just going to point out some of the observations I made and information I stumbled across while researching linguistic blue-green distinction.<br><br>Another possible reason for the lack of blue in certain older languages is things that are naturally blue never stay blue. The sky can be blue, but it changes significantly throughout the day. Same with the ocean. For this reason, there is never going to be a reason to distinguish blue from other colors. Also, a fascinating casual experiment was conducted where a child was raised normally but was never told the sky was blue explicitly by her parents. When asked to describe the sky, she ended up first saying it was colorless, then settling on blue only after careful contemplation, suggesting that thinking of the sky as significantly blue may be more of a social idea. <br><br>What is arguable more fascinating is how languages evolve to distinguish between blue and green. In fact, what got me into all this was after I finished my study of Chinese, and realized that like in Japanese, there was an interesting but peculiarly different way of distinguishing between green and blue. <br><br>Modern Chinese has three words of interest: \u9752 (qing), \u7eff (lu), and \u84dd (lan). \u9752 is the ancient word that meant BOTH green and blue. If you asked a Chinese speaker today, they would still likely not be able to tell you if \u9752 meant blue or green. This is because the existence of \u9752 in modern Chinese exists PURELY in word phrases related to nature OR to describe nature. If you were to describe grass, the sky, a frog, water, or anything natural that is either blue OR green, you would use \u9752. However, if you were to describe anything synthetic, like a car, a light, a pencil, you would use either \u7eff for green or \u84dd for blue. This is because the modern meaning of those two words emerged much later than \u9752, likely as a way of changing the language to distinguish between the two colors that caught on as the need to do so emerged. This all makes sense; because \u9752 is an older word, older word phrases likely include \u9752. And older word phrases described mainly nature, not technology. These word phrases never petered out, and thus shaped the modern usage of \u9752. <br><br>As most know, Japanese is heavily influenced by Chinese. However, as the two places became less and less connected, the languages spoken in each did so as well. This is, fascinatingly, reflected in the adaptation of two separate words for blue and green. Japanese handles it completely differently. In old Japanese, you would have the same character, \u9752 (ao), to mean either green or blue. HOWEVER, if you asked a modern Japanese speaker what \u9752 meant, they would tell you it means blue. Japanese evolved to distinguish by turning the old, doubly inclusive word (\u9752) to mean only blue, and repurposing another word \u7dd1 (midori) to mean only green. Though Japanese &amp; Chinese originally used the same character with the same definition, they evolved to distinguish between the two colors differently. Crazy stuff.<br><br>Lastly, I would like to quickly mention that the study mentioned in the video about Himba color perception may be a bit exaggerated. This video made the wonderful and accurate distinction that the study measured reaction time, not success vs failure, which is often omitted in order to to make the study&#39;s results seem more shocking and dramatic.

Let me make a shout out to our female human members. It is widely accepted that they have a much wider experience of color. I suspect it might have something to do with their larger vocabulary. They have more &quot;categories&quot; to put things into, color being one of them. Also, I do not know if this applies to all slavonic languages, but in my native tongue (Slovak), we have a different word for light blue and (regular) blue. Light blue = belas\u00e1, normal blue = modr\u00e1. Dark blue = tmav\u00e1 modr\u00e1 (literally dim blue). The belas\u00e1 is not cyan. Cyan is tyrkysov\u00e1, based on the Turquoise mineral. Also, the color brown does not exist. It is, technically speaking, a dim orange. But even english has a different word for orange and brown. Think of it that Slovak has a different word for light blue (belas\u00e1, like orange) and blue (modr\u00e1, like brown). The distinction is similar, regarding the lightness of the color, not its tone. Orange is lighter, so lighter blue is belas\u00e1, brown is darker, so darker blue is modr\u00e1 (modr\u00e1 being the equivalent of blue). Of course we have word for brown (hned\u00e1) and orange (oran\u017eov\u00e1) as well.", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T18:00:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Estrada", "comment_text": "Entonces no pueden distinguir entre el azul y el celeste?", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T18:00:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EchoL0C0", "comment_text": "Okay, but what about the violet sheep and the green honey?", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T17:59:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shilat's kalimba", "comment_text": "Wait no, thre&#39;s &#39;thchelet&#39; in the hebrew bible, which is light blue...", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T17:58:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "megabytee", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1-WuBbVe2E&amp;t=1m47s\">1:47</a> Always in our hearts", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T17:57:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bautista Ulloa", "comment_text": "OMG I just loved all this stuff and how You guys explain it", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T17:54:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Hilden", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve tried to explain this for the last ten years.

Despite Cameros existing for YEARS like the first Camero Bumblebee transforms into is from the 70&#39;s but I never noticed that this car existed till 2007 when that movie came out. The other way I recognize vehicles is because a friend or someone in my family happen to own that particular vehicle at some point. I&#39;ll start noticing and seeing the vehicle everywhere. I figured it was because I was actively looking for that particular vehicle in parking lots but the same is not true for cars like the Camero as no I know has ever owned one but I still see them everywhere. I also thought maybe it&#39;s because those vehicles become more popular around the time those movies came out but I&#39;ve found there are people who don&#39;t know about Transformers but still own a Camero with that exact color scheme like in the movie just by sheer coincidence.

The character has the radical \u201c\u8279\u201d, which stands for grass. The word blue came directly from the grass which leaves can be used to dye the color blue. <br>AT the time of XunZi. (313B.

On the Tianjin Central First Hospital\u2019s official website, Shen was introduced as \u201ca renowned organ transplant expert.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>According to the hospital\u2019s website, \u201cIn 1998, he established the first organ transplant institute and trained many organ transplant workers. He led the team to assist nearly 70 medical units in the country to perform liver transplantation. In 20 years, he and his team completed more than 10,000 liver transplants.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>On the website of China\u2019s United Front Work Department, it says that under Shen\u2019s leadership, the Central First Hospital performed 5,000 liver transplants by 2010.\r<br>\r<br>Another introduction about Shen on a Baidu Baike (Baidu Encyclopedia) page, it states that Shen completed almost 10,000 liver transplants by 2014, making up a quarter of the country\u2019s total liver transplant cases.\r<br>\r<br>Shen\u2019s involvement in such a high-volume of organ transplants reveals a dark, state-sanctioned crime in China\u2013\u2013the killing of Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience for their organs.\r<br>\r<br>The History of Organ Harvesting\r<br>Unlike many countries with established organ donation systems, China doesn\u2019t have one. Due to the influence of traditional culture, Chinese people prefer to keep their bodies intact after death and not many of them embrace the idea of organ donations introduced by Western medicine.\r<br>\r<br>It was known that the Chinese communist regime was using organs from death row prisoners for the transplants needed by high-ranking officials. But due to the limited number of prisoners and the health conditions of their organs, this was only done on a small scale.\r<br>\r<br>After the Chinese communist regime ordered the persecution of Falun Gong, a mind and body practice, since July 1999, the number of organ transplants skyrocketed. In April 2006, the ex-wife of a surgeon who was involved in removing organs from living Falun Gong practitioners came forward to expose the crimes to the world.\r<br>\r<br>Ongoing Investigation\r<br>Since then, human rights activists have been investigating this horrendous crime of organ harvesting from living individuals.\r<br>\r<br>In July 2006, David Kilgour, former Canadian Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific, and David Matas, Canadian human rights lawyer, released a 45-page report, concluding \u201c...the government of China and its agencies in numerous parts of the country, in particular hospitals but also detention centres and &#39;people&#39;s courts&#39;, since 1999, have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience. Their vital organs, including hearts, kidneys, livers and corneas, were virtually simultaneously seized for sale at high prices, sometimes to foreigners, who normally face long waits for voluntary donations of such organs in their home countries.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>In June 2016, together with Ethan Gutmann, a US investigative writer, the three of them released an updated investigative report on the forced organ harvesting in China. They looked into hundreds of hospitals in China and learned that they offered their patients transplants in a couple of weeks after they \u201cplaced the order.\u201d This could only be done when there was an enormous pool of organ supply.\r<br>\r<br>Their investigations also showed that the actual number of transplants performed each year by a few Chinese hospitals had exceeded the officially reported number of total transplants in the nation, which was between 10,000 to 15,000 each year. The shockingly high number of organs transplanted between 2006 to 2016 came mainly from Falun Gong practitioners arrested and incarcerated for refusing to give up their faith, according to the report.\r<br>\r<br>On June 13, 2016, the US House unanimously passed Resolution 343, which called on China to \u201cimmediately end the practice of organ harvesting from all prisoners of conscience.\u201d It asked China to end the 17-year persecution of Falun Gong and release all Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience. It also demanded the CCP to \u201callow a credible, transparent, and independent investigation into organ transplant abuses.\u201d Last but not least, it called on the US State Department to report annually to Congress on the implementation of barring provision of visas to Chinese and other nationals engaged in coerced organ or bodily tissue transplantation.\r<br>\r<br>Matas, Kilgour, and Gutmann were invited to a hearing at the European Parliament on June 29, 2016, and presented their updated report on China\u2019s systemic organ harvesting. They urged the EU to take action to stop the atrocity.\r<br>\r<br>According to Matas, the final conclusion drawn from the investigations was that the CCP had forced the entire country to take part in the large-scale murder. The victims were mainly Falun Gong practitioners, he said, as well as Uygurs, Tibetans, and house church members. The CCP\u2019s crackdown on them was a means to obtain organs for transplants, he said.\r<br>\r<br>As Matas pointed out, when there is a large-scale crime committed and tens of thousands were killed, the number of perpetrators was no less than that of the victims. He named a few: those who performed the tests on Falun Gong practitioners\u2019 blood and organs, the prison guards who brought in the practitioners, the doctors and nurses who performed the transplant surgeries, the agents of the 610 Office who were in charge of the persecution, and those who spread hatred against the practitioners.\r<br>\r<br>An independent people\u2019s tribunal, known as the China Tribunal, in its final judgment delivered in London on June 17, 2019, said that there was clear evidence that forced organ harvesting has taken place in China for years \u201con a significant scale.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>While the Chinese regime has maintained from 2015 that organ transplants have come from voluntary donors, the tribunal said it concluded the practice is still taking place. The panel said it was certain that the organs were sourced from imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners, who were \u201cprobably the principal source.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>\u201cThe conclusion shows that very many people have died indescribably hideous deaths for no reason, [and] that more may suffer in similar ways,\u201d tribunal chairman Sir Geoffrey Nice QC said in delivering the judgment on June 17.\r<br>\r<br>The international panel reached its conclusions after considering a variety of written and oral statements, including testimony from more than 50 witnesses given over the course of two public hearings.", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T00:04:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spencerian", "comment_text": "By the way, the theory that language explains away the existence of blue is crap.

Was<br>He really God&#39;s Son? Was Jesus the Messiah?<br>There are over 300 prophecies\u00a0 that point directly to the Messiah. Here is an example of just 8 :<br>The time of His birth (see the Daniel 8 &amp; 9 Timeline).<br>He would be born in Bethlehem. (Micah 5:2)<br>He would be born of a virgin. (Isaiah 7:14)<br>He would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver. (Zechariah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1-WuBbVe2E&amp;t=11m12s\">11:12</a>)<br>He would be mocked. (Psalm 22:7,8)<br>He would be crucified. (John 3:14)<br>He would be pierced. (Psalms 22:16)<br>He would die with the wicked, but He would be buried with the rich. (Isaiah 53:9) <br><br>Mathematics &amp; Astronomy Professor Peter W. Stoner has made the statement that the<br>chances of just 8 prophecies (like these) coming true by sheer chance is 1 in 10\u00b9\u2077(100,000,000,000,000,000). That would be equivalent to covering the whole state of Texas with silver dollars two feet deep and then expecting a blindfolded man to walk across the state and on the very first try find the ONE coin you marked (roughly equivalent to the Province of Ontario being 1.5 feet deep). <br>And if we were to add only 8 more similar prophecies, for a total of 16, the odds would be 1 x 10\u00b2\u2078 x 10\u00b9\u2077 or 1 in 10\u2074\u2075 (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) <br>Using the same type of illustration as above, if we were to press this many silver dollars(10\u2074\u2075) into a ball and place the center of this ball where the center of our Sun is, this silver ball&#39;s outer edge would be in approximately the same area as the orbit of Neptune (almost to Pluto.). One man fulfilling all 16 prophecies by sheer chance would be like sending a blind-folded person out to find one specific silver dollar that has been marked and has been mixed up somewhere in this huge ball and actually finding it the first time! (Keep in mind that this is a three-dimensional BALL, not a disk like our Solar System.) <br><br>Professor Stoner gives us yet another illustration, but this time, because a silver dollar, and even the atom, would be too large for this one he chose to use just the electron that orbits the nucleus of the atom.\u00a0 The electron is one of the smallest particles of matter known to man. It is so small that if you lined up 2.5 x 10\u00b9\u2075 (2,500,000,000,000,000) single file you would end up with a line that is only 1 inch long. (If we were going to count the electrons in this line one inch long, and counted 250 each minute, and if we counted day and night, it would take us 19,000,000 years to count just the one-inch line of electrons.)<br>Now back to Stoner&#39;s illustration. Using only 48 of the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled it was<br>calculated that the chances of one person fulfilling these by sheer chance would be 1 in 10\u00b9\u2075\u2077To help us understand how huge this number is he suggested taking 10\u00b9\u2075\u2077 electrons and pressing them into a solid ball. This ball, made entirely of electrons, would pretty much fill, not just our galaxy, but the entire known universe. (At the time Stoner&#39;s book was written the universe was known to be at least 6 billion light years in all directions. Stoner&#39;s known universe would need to be filled about 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times.) Once again we would mark just one electron, blindfold a man and send him out to find that one electron. Peter Stoner then states, &quot;To the extent, then, that we know this blindfolded man cannot pick out the marked electron, we know that the Bible is inspired. This is not merely evidence. It is proof of the Bible&#39;s inspiration by God--proof so definite that the universe is not large enough to hold the evidence.&quot; Professor Stoner then made the comment that, &quot;Any man who rejects Christ as the Son of God is rejecting a fact proved perhaps more absolutely than any other fact in the world.&quot; <br><br>This is the Catholic Church that has the Holy Sacrament of Holy Communion every Sunday Mass. Sometimes in history some of\u00a0 the Priests doubted that the Holy Communion waffer is really the The most Holy Flesh of Lord Jesus Christ. That&#39;s when miracles happened and the waffer was turned to actual bleeding Flesch-the tissue\u00a0that of a human heart, specifically the endocardium.Just Google Eucharistic miracle on Wikipedia or any other site. <br>Science also has proved it. This\u00a0 male AB blood and Flesch is still fresh to this day and one\u00a0 of the first miracles of this type happened during the 700s so we are talking about Blood that never even slightly decomposed during almost 1300 years! The male AB blood type has also\u00a0apparently\u00a0been found on the\u00a0 miracolous Shroud of Turin. The male AB blood type is also found on the Sudarium of Oviedo the Linen cloth thought to have been used to cover the head of Jesus immediately after the crucifixion. There are even\u00a0reports\u00a0that blood taken from some weeping statues of Mary are AB blood type. . The Holy Apostolic Catholic Church is full of miracles that happen on everyday basis and there are also many other Bible verses that confirm its claim as the true Church. And as always if someone doesn&#39;t want to do extensive research he should just ask directly the Head of the Church and that is our beloved Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth.", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T23:40:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abdullah Khan", "comment_text": "<b>Title</b> : Why Ancient Greeks Couldn&#39;t See Blue<br><b>Blind People</b> : Am I a joke to you?", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T23:37:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "South Georgia Storm", "comment_text": "Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br><br>John 14:6 Jesus told him, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life.

Another idea that has been put forth is the state of the Aegean Sea at the time because several species of algae, when blooming, can dramatically alter the color of the water ranging from sickly green, bright pink, or even dark red.  Also another belief behind the &quot;wine-dark sea&quot; description has to do with the color of wine.  Wine fermentation was not an expert level craft prior to understanding of the fermentation process and the reliable ability to control temperature over a long period of time.  Wine producing cultures often mixed wine with other substances to improve taste and to aid in preservation, like the Romans added a compound of lead to sweeten the flavor.  Changing the pH of wine can have a significant effect on it&#39;s color as in adding in hard water can make wine appear more bluish in color.  <br><br>Sadly this seems more of a retelling of the Business Insider piece from a few years ago than a real investigative approach to the subject.", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T18:41:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "pyra4eva", "comment_text": "This video reminds me of a similar video about why certain things that are orange are called red when they are clearly orange.

In stories and myths they always described the sea and the sky depending their own mood and the &quot;behaviour&quot; of the sea or sky.

But when I was seeing the WHOLE solar spectrum with dark lines, or a spectrum of a lightbulb, I would basically see the red part, and the green-blue part. Except for a very narrow area, all the warm yellows and oranges would kind of blend with red, and all the &quot;acid&quot; yellows and yellow-greens would blend at the green end of the continuous green-blue wash. I am not sure why, but it may have something to do with the fact that yellow is a very distinct shade for me, while cyan is just any old mix of green and blue. So yes, I agree with what was said.
