The female O can also be focused but more so on the abdomen and chest region and the closer one gets to the big O the more defuse and full body it becomes it also way more complex mentally and comes in waves if i get distracted or loose focus its over really fast and most of the time im no longer in the mood after that. Its also way harder to achieve. The quality of the big O depends very much on mental and emotional state and  is way way less dependent on visual cues if im in the right mental state its way way stronger than any male O i have ever experienced not even on the same plane of existence but its rare, in that case it also last way way longer the peak can last about 20 to 30 seconds and most of the time i experience aftershocks that can last between 10 to 15 minutes, although they are way less intense and very exhausting/relaxing in a good way. For me at least the female O is way better most of the time if im in the mood if not its way worse. Its never bad but if im really forcing it it doesn\u2019t even register and it\u2019s basically impossible to reach big O.", "comment_date": "2022-08-10T03:30:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sock", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t imagine a 10 - 20 second orgasm", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T13:15:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DMTdreamz", "comment_text": "On a certain level, we have orgasm in our brain, the neurochemicals that show up in flow: so dopamine, norepinephrine, anandamide, endorphins, and serotonin. If you were to try to cocktail the street drug version of that, right, you&#39;re trying to blend like heroin and speed and coke and acid and weed- and point is, you can&#39;t do it. It turns out the brain can cocktail all of &#39;em at once, which is why people will prefer flow to almost any experience on Earth. It&#39;s our favorite experience. It&#39;s the most addictive experience on Earth. Why? &#39;Cause it cocktails five or six of the largest pleasure drugs the brain can produce. We&#39;re all capable of so much more than we know. That is a commonality across the board. And one of the big reasons is we&#39;re all hardwired for flow, and flow is a massive amplification of what&#39;s possible for ourselves.", "comment_date": "2022-08-05T11:24:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "LeomationsYT", "comment_text": "In Dubai U don\u2019t get smex education so this is helpful", "comment_date": "2022-08-04T14:25:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prudence Kamara", "comment_text": "Pls do a video on cure for premature ejaculation", "comment_date": "2022-07-29T23:57:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Redoan Sharif", "comment_text": "69% of the time?", "comment_date": "2022-07-28T10:15:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "damn son", "comment_text": "women only orgasm in 69% of encounters?

Although, I have to say, this video appears to also present as heteronormative overall even though it includes some positive information about homosexuality overall, it could use some tweaking in wording. That was very telling of how heteronorms still play a role in oppressing additional sexual identities to heterosexuality. I am sure that may not have been the intention which is why I raise these points.<br><br>Thank you, sincerely, for a fascinating video! Some great stuff there!
