Im 5&#39;6&quot; and I went from 135 to 120 pounds in a few months and I notice that I&#39;m able to keep this weight by literally just making sure I&#39;m not mindlessly eating everything I see.

Atleast that&#39;s just the conclusion I&#39;ve come to. <br><br>I&#39;m going to a restaurant tomorrow and I looked at the menu ahead of time (as always) and one of their burgers was 1600 calories and I was so so so amazed.

Plus, it&#39;s pretty hard for mostly people to keep on a diet for more than 1-2 months without going insane! I workout 4-5 times per week (mostly weightlifting), and I feel hungry as a lion sometimes, the plan that was given to me, and was already adjusted... well, I still feel hungry if I only eat the amount of food it says there, and I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m getting enough energy to do such physical efforts nor through the rest of the day, even eating what&#39;s supposed for me to eat. It&#39;s just not enough! So I added a little bit more food to some of my meals recently and I feel with more energy while at the gym. Your body can still suffer good changes without having to be hungry...  I would just say that if you do some adjustments in what you eat daily (eat more of the good stuff and less of what&#39;s not that good, but really without having to deprive yourself to the limit - because deprivation may have bad consequences at short/long-term - eating disorders are pretty awful), and you&#39;ll start noticing a few differences on you through the time, and surely practising exercise will definitely help you on that and making you feeling healthier and younger as well. You can still make progress without dieting, even though it will be slower in some cases, but not impossible. But don&#39;t expect to have great results by working out alone and not changing your eating habits... That does not work well. Don&#39;t add sugar to your coffee or eat out everyday, and put some salad in that sandwich...  If you&#39;re aiming ONLY for weight loss, probably you need to be even more careful with your eating habits, nothing comes alone of course... But &quot;Diet&quot; is something I don&#39;t like to hear nor talk about, it&#39;s not good to keep at it for a long time. Stopping it will have worst consequences than stopping working out for a few weeks. Muscle takes longer to build, and takes longer to go away too, plus, helps burning more calories too. Diets can make you thinner at short term, but you can&#39;t expect not to gain fat once you stop dieting for some time. A nutrition plan is more effective than diets, though, can be a bit hard to follow sometimes, it gets boring, but, adjust it to your needs and that may become a natural routine.", "comment_date": "2017-12-18T19:49:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "The Power of Exercise Science", "comment_text": "Go watch our new video on exercise science with your favorite cartoon character!!!! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ns9Tdpvlw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ns9Tdpvlw</a>", "comment_date": "2017-11-25T03:58:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gen Adeline", "comment_text": "EatRightGuy stole your image for their thumbnail :/", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T16:22:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anmol Kaur", "comment_text": "If i try diet i will lose my energy if i try exercise will become stronger intelligent and fast", "comment_date": "2017-11-18T14:50:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SkyLineGamingTv", "comment_text": "I prefer both", "comment_date": "2017-11-06T11:24:09Z", "likes_count": 38}, {"comment_by": "Fanny Eng", "comment_text": "VERY HELPFULL VID, ANSERD MY EXACT QUESTION =) THANKS!", "comment_date": "2017-11-05T01:35:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Annette Gerber", "comment_text": "I actually tried this diet program myself having seen how my good friend benefited from that.

I lost 20 pounds (and am continuing to lose) with NO EXERCISE at all. No early morning jogs or long days at the gym. I realized that it&#39;s all about WATCHING WHAT YOU EAT. Before, I loved to eat greasy foods like from McDonalds and stuff or tons of pastries. I didn&#39;t give a second thought to what I was eating or how much of it. However, once I started to actually pay attention to the kinds of foods I ate and how much of it (by keeping a little journal), I realized that I was overeating waaaaaay to much. It really helps if you keep a little log of what you&#39;re eating every day. You don&#39;t even need to know how many calories are in each food; just making a mental note of what you have already ate already helps. The key to losing weight really is watching what you eat. There are really simple calculators online that can tell you how many calories you should eat a day. Then, all you do is eat less than that. Simple. Sure, it&#39;s waaay better to eat healthy foods but as long as you consume less calories than you need to maintain your weight every day, you&#39;re on the right track to losing weight. Just a helpful tip for you guys who are serious about wanting to lose some weight. Btw I&#39;ve been dieting for around two months now, so don&#39;t expect the weight to melt off, but if you make the right choices every day it will WORK.

Pretty straightforward. Plenty of workout nuts or former/current athletes could show you they can eat like shit and still be under 10% bodyfat and at a healthy weight.  They are shoveling down empty calories just so they don&#39;t lose muscle.  If you don&#39;t have muscle you are fat.  Weight loss isn&#39;t the same as fat loss.  Sustained habits that keep you healthy are different then short term calorie restrictions that provide number results, but aren&#39;t sustainable lifelong. The same amount of &quot;calories&quot; in one food plan vs. another also can have wildly different effects on how those calories are processed in the body.  The same time dedicated to exercise in one person vs another can also have wildly different effects on how that body is being built based on the type of exercise.<br><br>These are some of the many examples of why specific context is required anytime one of these &quot;studies&quot; makes a claim.  <br>If you do the right kind of physical activity, you can definitely out exercise a poor diet.

Calories do not indicate how much nutrition a food item has, so I do not believe they matter. Being healthy is more important than being slim and eating nutritious food is more important than counting calories.
