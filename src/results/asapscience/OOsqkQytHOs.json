I also found the &quot;too much of everything&quot; part to be extremely relevant to the elements presented in your video. I personally find that games tend to take the blame for issues that arise from misuse or abuse of gaming features or contents. Just like you stated, if someone dies from water toxicity, we would not start claiming that water is dangerous for health and yet quite a lot of people tend to place a lot of focus on the negative aspects of video games while simply overlooking the positive impacts that video games may have on social as well as mental health. I believe that for a lot of things we need to focus on the positive more than just berating anything simply for the sake of standing out or trying to seem like a special snowflake who does not follow current trends. All the positive aspects highlighted in your video would hopefully encourage a more welcoming perspective on video games.

First i love to game, it is amazing to spend my time and get my brain entertained. However, i also know the negatives of it very well. Gaming, especially addictive games, would hurts kids and teenagers real bad without moderation. Cauz the addiction is real, you could spend 12 hours on a game, keep playing non stop! At the process you could neglect eating, sleeping, doing your homework, hangout with other people,just focus on your life in general. This is bad because u can never get anything done in your life, you ignore what you should do for your top priority. You will dont know how to talk to people, shy introvert, and lazy at your work.

I stopped gaming about two years ago. Before 2 years, I used to play all types of games. And those days were amazing for my academics. My friends used to call me a computer because of my memory skills and the very high marks that I earn in a test. But after that, my Pc broke down and my ps2 started getting slow. Unfortunately, my parents didn&#39;t fix it for me. So I started to spend my days without games. The result was a drastic decrease in my memory and the speed of learning new concepts. I didn&#39;t become so bad. But I felt a little bit slow in everything. I could really feel it. I needed more time to focus and learn. However I still remained the best student of my class. But I wasn&#39;t satisfied within myself. It&#39;s like going to an i3 from an i7. But now I bought a ps4 and back into the action. Within just one week, I have experience a lot of improvements. I feel so much alive now. So, yeah, for my experience, gaming does a lot to your brain.

The most common complaint was that when students play video games in excess of an hour per day (7-10 hours a week) they may be sacrificing valuable study and homework time and academics would take the hit.  It&#39;s important to maintain a healthy balance of video gaming because there are some benefits and advantages to playing video games.  This is why there are new &quot;brain games&quot; that have been created, such as; Lumosity.

It seems that from their beginning, all sorts of video games have been improving from many innovations to their design. The first games were made with simple goals for the competitive motives of the game user. Those games were solely used for entertainment purposes, though they had other unintentional benefits as well. For example, some of the gamers who played even the most simple of the games would show heightened abilities in reflexes, as well as some cognitive functions. As these games have evolved, so have their effects, and purposes. With games evoking more change in people with their evolution, it becomes important to question the potential for games to be used for many purposes. In this video, video games are not looked at as only useful for entertainment. The concern here is the effect video games may have on the mind and improvement of cognition in certain areas. Video games used in this way will be more based upon principles of learning, while still maintaining the elements of entertainment characteristic of those games. Now looking at games in this way, we are equipped with a very flexible tool which has endless possibilities. If one is bored, they can use video games for their own entertainment for that moment. If someone is not efficient in memory, they can put video games to use by playing them and letting the games naturally improve their cognition in areas of the brain which may facilitate memory. Even if one is hoping to become more physically in shape, games can be a solution. In the generation of video game consoles like the Wii, and Kinect, people may once again use games as a tool to provide them with an intricate exercise machine which directs the user through the workout, while also giving distinct data and analysis of specific bodily functions fluctuating throughout the process.<br>With all these possibilities, it is important that more people take the initiative to look outside the box, and see games in a different light. Instead of believing games as being only suitable for entertainment, people should support a more well rounded view of these video games so that more imaginative ways of using them could be thought of. If more people are able to do this, more innovate creations are made, which gives society even more tools to use for different situations and issues for which video games have the potential for application.When this happens, the society as a whole receives an ever increasing advantage only limited to the imagination. Therefore, videos such as these need to be more supported throughout the world and taken more into consideration than they usually are. A change like this could have lasting effects on humanity, helping in ways never before thought possible. The advantages gamers have in brain power are only a portion of the potential for effectiveness video games currently have. This potential will continue to increase in the future. Whether this potential is put in to use effectively, is up to the people. This is why awareness in the wide variety of ways to utilize games should be more widespread than it is currently. Video games are currently items of high value for change in society, and will be for many generations to come. What do you think the future uses for video games may be in the future and how will it effect humanity overall?<br><br>-ASU Student for English 101 Steph", "comment_date": "2014-12-06T06:11:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Roach", "comment_text": "Yeah uh can you explain the science of making dabs?", "comment_date": "2014-12-05T23:54:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JTB Reptiles", "comment_text": "I read the &#39;this is really, really small writing.

I think that most video games are looked at in a certain way which amplifies their more negative, gruesome characteristic and tend to overshadow the benefits. The reactions to the video partially reflects this. Many of the comments for this video seem to express a bit of surprise at the fact that anything may be beneficial from video games. Since the view of video games has been so one sided for so long, it may make it harder to believe that there is another side of the story which is not being demonstrated as much as the other. In essence, I agree that video games has benefits and I have experienced some of the benefits for myself in my lifetime. One of the most powerful benefits I have received from gaming is the enhancement of my learning abilities and my ability to make clear connections between certain events and facts. These two fundamental abilities help me to solve many problems in the real world.

But this shows me something that was really extrodinary and scientific. It tells me that video games are actually good for you! Everything the guy said in the vid really inspired me. My mom always tell me that &quot;Games are bad for you!&quot;. But I didn&#39;t care about it. When I was in elementary school, my grades are the worst. My mom always hit me, my uncle keeps saying things I don&#39;t understand. But that didn&#39;t stop me from playing video games. Believe me, it helps alot. Some games are educational, some are puzzle and based on what strategy you use. When middle school came, I became the smartest in my class. My grades went higher and I was happy for myself. Even though I played more and more games, it made me smart. I solved a puzzle in just seconds, I can do many kinds of strategy which really helps me when it comes to strategy based video games. Educational games are really important. It help me by learning some history and facts that I don&#39;t even know. History classes are boresome and tiresome, but by playing some educational games was really easy to answer all the question about history this, history that. But the most greatest thing ever made in video game history are the RPG video games. It gives you life lessons that can be really sad, great, cool and you can get inspired by what the game has to say to you. There&#39;s always hope for us, gamers out there. Never stop playing games. Even our parents reject that, you still can play video games. We&#39;re gamers for life. Never forget that!<br><br>Life is too short to enjoy on everything you could do, in my opinion games are the best way to enjoy our life.<br>Life is too short to focus on thing you don&#39;t like. They can call me a nerd, an idiot, a stinkbrain, stupid, asshole or a lifeless guy. That won&#39;t stop me from playing more and more video games &#39;cause it&#39;s somehow the best way to earn money too! Like PewDiePie, he really loves playing video games and look what he got from it. Money, popularity, a girlfriend and loads of stuff. Make your mom watch this so she can understand what a life of a game is and why video game even existed in the first place.

There are so many products on the market and almost on the market that could change problems in places like 3rd world countries. An example of this: water filters. Most aren&#39;t up to US health and safety standards but are being used to help countries who don&#39;t have high standards because of the horrible conditions. The world of health and safety is expanding and I think people need to hear of this. I&#39;m in 8th grade and I am designing a water filter that uses carbon nanotubes to clean contaminants like arsenic and lead. My class obviously can&#39;t test for them so my dad, a scientist will be(so don&#39;t get worried)  Last month we used nano particles: TIO2 and fruits to create an alternative energy source.

You have a split second to swing, take a ball or fight off a pitch until you get yours with all the different speeds and breaks on the ball. But it is a video game. It must do something to the connections in your brain over time and make them faster. In real life, you cannot even see a fastball once you decide to swing where the ball would be 15&#39; from the plate at 95mph. You need to start swinging when you can&#39;t see the ball. But those are trained professionals and like a racecar driver, over time the ball probably seems slowed down enough to pick it up and then they get into these zones where they can actually see the threads on the ball and pick up the spin. That&#39;s amazing, they&#39;re above average and deserve what they get and work hard but they don&#39;t deserve the amount of money their agents demand. <br><br>Baseball ruined all pro sports, really the New York Yankees ruined all professional sports. I know that&#39;s off topic, I just wanted to put it out there.<br><br>So is a higher reaction time considered higher intelligence? Anyways video games do something to help the connections in our brains. It may help early onset Alzheimer&#39;s, Parkinson&#39;s, multiple sclerosis, etc. patients could strengthen neural pathways in their brains and help slow down their symptoms or prolong the movement of their bodies before they become &quot;stuck&quot;. I don&#39;t know if there have been studies done or even thought about, but if it&#39;s something that hasn&#39;t been looked into, it definitely should.<br><br>Also another thought, just moving your hands and arms around to play a video game causes muscle memory and could help a lot of people like amputees remember how to use lost limbs so prosthetics would be easier to use by activating those parts of the brain that won&#39;t nee active anymore.
