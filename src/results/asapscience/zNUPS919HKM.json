Qui Gon Jin describes Midichlorians as microscopic life forms that allow someone to communicate with the force. According to Star Wars lore, the average person/being in the Star Wars galaxy have around 1500-2000 midichlorians per cell. These numbers and Qui Gon\u2019s description perfectly match what Mitochondria do. The average human on earth has around 1500 mitochondria per cell. The world\u2019s fittest athletes have around 4000-5000 per cell. If Star Wars lore states that the average Jedi have around 20,000 midichlorians per cell then it\u2019s possible that if a human were to increase their mitochondria count to that height then Jedi powers would almost certainly be possible. Extreme athleticism and reflexes without getting exhausted is already achieved by our fittest athletes so it would only be magnified 10x compared to the average human. Telekinesis and telepathic abilities could also be possible through training as you can learn to make the mitochondria communicate with other cells outside of your physical body, which is exactly how the Jedi meditate. I haven\u2019t structured this comment very well but in conclusion:<br>Jedi have around 20000 mitochondria per cell<br>The average human has around 2000 per cell<br>Our top athletes, the closest thing we have to super heroes, only have around 4500 per cell, not too much more than the average human. <br>So if the potential of someone with only 4500 m p/c is admirable to everyone on earth, imagine the possibilities with 20000 per cell.", "comment_date": "2020-07-11T13:26:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shadow San", "comment_text": "Proof that clone wars is real <br><br>World war 1 Italians: clone troopers <br>World war 2 order66 when Italy betrays the allies in ww2", "comment_date": "2020-07-05T23:37:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik Seavey", "comment_text": "I can slap flies pretty easy honestly.

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic.
