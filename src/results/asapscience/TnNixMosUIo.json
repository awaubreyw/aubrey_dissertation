Resistance would be how wide the pipe is and/or how open the faucet is. The more you open the faucet (reduce the resistance), the more the current increases, which means more water coming out. If the water pressure (voltage) is low, then it doesn&#39;t come out very hard or fast, but if it&#39;s high, then it blasts out. Conversely, if the pressure is high, but the faucet isn&#39;t open very much, then the current is low and you don&#39;t get much water. But what you do get will be shooting out quite hard (hurts to put your finger in front of it).<br><br>So high voltage, low current is dangerous, if it&#39;s applied in the wrong place (your heart). But if it just shoots through your body without hitting your heart, then you&#39;d likely survive with minimal injury. It&#39;ll sting, though.<br>Low voltage, high current can be dangerous, depending on how low the voltage is. The danger with low voltage is that it travels slower (like low water pressure), so it will stay in your body for longer and can do more damage that way. If it hits your heart, you might be killed, unless the voltage is so low that it doesn&#39;t have the power to interrupt your heart beat. It&#39;s less painful too. Low voltage feels like a buzz, like when you lick a 9V battery. In that way, it can be more dangerous, because you won&#39;t have as much of an instinct to stop it.<br>High voltage, high current is the obviously the most deadly. A lot of voltage entering your body at high current will likely burn you to a crisp. Lightning is high voltage, high current, but the saving grace for lightning is that it&#39;s quick. You just get one quick burst of it. Contrary to if you put your hands on an open wire with high voltage and high current, then it&#39;ll just keep coming until you look like you shook hands with the Joker.<br><br>I&#39;m not an expert, but that&#39;s how I understand it.
