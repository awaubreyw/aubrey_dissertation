A healthy skin pH is 4 -5 and this is the same for hair. If there is a lot of limestone in your tap water, the high alkaline pH will dry out the skin also it does not help at dissolving bath products leaving a residue on the skin. What you can do is after using your usual shower products to get rid of the dirty sebum, rinse normally, then add a final rinse, VERY LITTLE white vinegar to a lot of water, and use this as a final rinse when you&#39;re done showering, the acidic pH allows proper dissolvement of residues and also close hair cuticules(hair scales, this make them shine more). Avoid AppleCiderVinegar or lemon trends, those will attract fruit flies. If you do this process for hair, do not use any conditioner, we replace it for next step Jojoba. Also conditioner oils make your hair dry super slow.\r<br>\r<br>When you&#39;re skin and hair are all dry (Vinegar odors actually disappear quick when it&#39;s all dry), apply VERY LITTLE(i insist, very little) jojoba oil (a secret from amerindians) DO NOT RINSE IT !!! it is actually a non comedogenic wax, the structure of jojoba is extremely close to human sebum, seriously it&#39;s night &amp; day, you literally get glowing skin that all these girls want(careful too much jojoba looks greasy) and if you use it on hair, that means you don&#39;t have to wait your scalp to build some sebum again, it&#39;s like instant sebum, it replaces conditioner and it does not feel greasy at all, hair softness and shine level 99999.\r<br>----------\r<br>Beyond chemicals, taking care of one&#39;s liver will improve the skin.

NOT sold in stores. This brand is by a 3rd generation greek estetician who ALSO has a SKIN RESEARCH LAB. <br>He makes products for many brands but he also has his own called SKINN and because he is a manufacturer he puts high amounts of skin changing ingredients in his products that actually work PLUS no harmful chemicals or animal testing. <br>No propylene glycol, mineral oil, parabens, etc. The highest amount of retinol, REAL shea butter,  many ORGANIC products. <br>A MANUKA HONEY ORGANIC AUSTRALIAN OIL LINE  that is AMAZING, MICRODERMABRASION SCRUB THAT CHANGES YOUR SKIN IN ONE USE CALLED DERMAPEEL.  FACE PADS EQUALLY AMAZING THAT ALSO CHANGE YOUR SKIN...Especially good for acne, but all skin types can use his products. Also note that any skincare directed at dry, oil, or combination skin are wrong in doing so. <br>SKINN cleansing line called NON NEGOTIABLES: Day and night cleanser (the night can also be used as a mask),  face pads, Dermapeel home microdermabrasion that replaces salon facial visits, &amp; softening moisture essence which allows your serums, oil, and creams to penetrate skin better, you apply this to your skin after cleansing or scrub.  The manuka honey oil has two types of oil that are not sticky, oily, or greasy...they melt into the skin and leave no residue, can be mixed in with serum, cream, foundation or wear by itself after cleansing. Also manuka lip oil, eye oil, body oil, and manuka cleansing oil, there is NOTHING ON THE MARKET LIKE THESE PRODUCTS. If you want a serum and cream to follow cleansing choose from the choices on website <a href=\"http://skinn.com/\">skinn.com</a> or Skinn on facebook, and contact customer service for the best one to get for your skin concerns. Collegenisis for anti age and wrinkles, pep40 has a huge amount of peptides in it, and Enlightened Radiance is for age spots and brightening.  <br> Available also is concentrated small bottles of pure retinol and other concentrations are avail.  Microdermabrasion products also sold for full body and feet scub. SKINN LINE IS FROM DIMITRI JAMES AND IS REASONABLEY PRICED WITH PAYMENT AND RETURN OPTIONS ON SHOPPING CHANNELS.<br>KORRES PRODUCTS: Greek organic pure olive oil and black pine products. Their olive face oils are also amazing and pure, they have regular one 100ml and the young blossom extract that is 30ml. Their bath gels and bar soap are wonderful. No bad ingredients and no animal testing. Also have creams, serums, olive oil lip oils, olive oil foundation.  Best prices are shopping channels with pmt options and refunded returns. If you don&#39;t care about prices in Canada some of their products are at Shopper&#39;s Drug mart and Sephora.  Doll 10 is also another brand on shopping channels that is clean make up (fantastic lip products, concealer, foundation)<br>Dimitri James taught me a lot about skincare, and I no longer buy off the shelf. <br>I am posting this, because my....and many other&#39;s skin was changed dramatically with these products. You get your skin better by  using clean good natural products so you can wear less make up, stop piling on pore clogging make-up because you have bad skin...or at the very least use a clean foundation with no chemicals.  <br>For SKINN showtimes check his website at <a href=\"http://skinn.com/\">skinn.com</a> and look under Inside Skinn or in the U.S only order directly.<br>For the two guys who posted this, watch a few shows of skinn and have Dimitri educate you on how skin works and its care. <br>Try his and Korres stuff and see for yourselves.

We wanted to share a little bit more about the science behind our patented antioxidant Methylene Blue, and its exciting application for skincare. \ud83d\ude00<br><br>Our team at Mblue Labs has launched the first commercially available Methylene Blue anti-aging cream, Bluelene <a href=\"http://www.bluelene.com/\">www.bluelene.com</a>. Our research team at the University of Maryland, led by Dr. Kan Cao, has measured the effectiveness of Methylene Blue for increased skin hydration, expanded thickness of the dermis, and improved skin texture when compared to products that have mitochondrial-targeting antioxidants. <br><br>Methylene Blue outperformed MitoQ, NAC and MTemp in this experiment, as a more effective way to enhance mitochondrial health and delay senescence of the cells. This promising research suggests that Methylene Blue has great potential for skin care for both women and men, the background for our patented antioxidant Methylene Blue.

Fortunatelly, in greece you don&#39;t need a perscription for this and a 0.5 cream costs 3 euros. As for vitamins some claim that although they do not penetrate the skin they may help with free radicals. Collagen also does not penetrate the skin, but it is a humectant, meaning that it absorbs moisture from the environment, thus helping with mousturization. Dimethicone is kind of the opposite of a humectant, instead of absorbing moisture it blocks it, thus maintaining the skins own moisture from transepidermal water loss.

Really cool. Buuut as someome who has been hardcore into skincare science for over a year I noticed some things that weren&#39;t true or misleading.<br><br>Topical collagen for example won&#39;t magically give your skin more collagen, that&#39;s true, but it&#39;s a great moisturizing ingredient actually. Not for anti-aging, but I guess it does &quot;help reduce fine lines&quot; and all that as moisturized skin is more plump. The claims at times are definitely ridiculous, but it&#39;s not useless if your goal is to moisturize your face. <br><br>Also, vitamin E and vitamin C are not the same thing, just because they&#39;re both antioxidants. 10% pure Ascorbic acid is a lot stronger and more effective (for various things, eg helping with hyperpigmentation) than Vitamin E. Equating them is misleading, and looking at where they are in the ingredients list is as well.<br><br>Which, btw, formulations are really, really important. Just because an ingredient is lower down the list in one product, doesn&#39;t mean that product is worse. It&#39;s not as simple as that, unfortunately \ud83d\ude05<br><br>And all retinols/derivates are not the same. It does make a difference what kind of derivate you put and how it activates in the skin (they all work differently, the skin has to &quot;convert&quot; them etc). Also, retinols don&#39;t thin the skin per se: they thin the upper layer of the skin (where dead skin cells lie) but they actually thicken the deeper layer (increased collagen production). So that&#39;s nothing to worry about, it&#39;s actually a positive thing.<br><br>Oh and because parabens were mentioned: they&#39;re fine. Lots of alternatives to them are actually worse. It&#39;s just a marketing scam (&quot;it&#39;s paraben-free!!&quot; And then people think oh ok that must mean parabens are bad, I should avoid them). I think in the EU they&#39;ll ban &quot;paraben-free&quot; claims starting next year because it&#39;s misleading consumers on purpose.<br><br>Again, loved this video, I don&#39;t mean this as negative criticism - just some things to look out for. Skin science is really, really interesting but more complicated than sometimes given credit for. Maybe due to so, so many overblown claims. But I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to equate skincare beauty trends with anti-aging only. There&#39;s more to it (moisturizing dry skin, fighting hyperpigmentation, acne, sensitivity issues, etc).<br><br>Either way: yes, don&#39;t forget the sunscreen. \ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T11:16:23Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "SingingGinge", "comment_text": "My dermatologist told me to wear sunscreen every day no matter how sunny it is.

We also need to remember in science is there is no black or white it&#39;s all nuance especially so in skincare. Just because you might be able to read the INCI list it won&#39;t tell you much unless you understand product formulation because a product is more than its individual ingredients. Not to poke holes but you forgot the Stratum Lucidium its the layer between the Stratum Granulosum and the Stratum Corneum. <br><br>Whilst collagen has absolutely no anti-ageing benefits as can&#39;t penetrate the epidermis because its such a massive molecule and even if it was hydrolysed there&#39;s no way to know if foreign collagen would actually do anything within the skin but!! it actually makes a pretty good moisturiser because surprisingly enough collagen makes a really good humectant.\r<br>\r<br>I&#39;m sorry but from a scientific perspective on the second round that&#39;s not entirely true the moisturiser methylene blue is the weaker product as its a moisturiser whereas Vitamin C in the form of Ascorbic Acid that&#39;s in the La Roche Posay Serum is an antioxidant which helps to protect against oxidative damage as well as helping to protect against damage caused by UVA and UVB from the sun. Vit C is often used in the morning before sunscreen for this reason. Vit C is also used because while not the best it has an effect on melanocytes in the skin. It basically inhibits an enzyme called Tyrosinase which causes hyperpigmentation. Dosage is also extremely important, a moisturiser is never going to have the impact that a dedicated serum is going to have. This specific serum has 10% ascorbic acid which won&#39;t even compare to Vitamin E.\r<br>\r<br>I&#39;m not going to go into parabens I did a whole post about it on my blog, literally, nothing to be afraid of they arent bad brands just love to fearmonger &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://www.theskincaresaviour.com/2019/03/parabens.html\">https://www.theskincaresaviour.com/2019/03/parabens.html\r</a><br>\r<br>Again Retinyl Palmitate is an ester of retinol and palmitic acid and it will not in any way shape or form give you the same effects as &quot;retinol&quot; Retinyl Palmitate will provide some smoothing effects to the skin but it&#39;s so weak as it has to undergo conversion 3 times from retinyl palmitate to retinol to retinaldehyde then it becomes retinoic acid and at each conversion, it loses a bit of itself so by the time it makes it all the way to retinoic acid to be used there&#39;s so little left that it only superficially smoothes the skin. I have another post here explaining all about retinol &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://www.theskincaresaviour.com/2019/01/beginners-guide-to-retinol.html\">https://www.theskincaresaviour.com/2019/01/beginners-guide-to-retinol.html\r</a><br>\r<br>We also need to talk about the claim &quot;Retinol thins the skin&quot; is an old misconception because retinol stimulates fibroblast cells to create more collagen retinol actually thickens the epidermis it doesn&#39;t thin it\r<br>\r<br>Another thing you need to be aware of the percentage isn&#39;t everything. Skinperspective, a cosmetic chemist on Instagram did a fantastic post about explaining this concept also retinol does not cause you to get sunburn. We apply retinol at night because UV rays degrade retinol so if you used it during the day you&#39;d get no use of it because by the time you&#39;d done anything id would have degraded already but there are retinoids out there that you can use during the day as they have been formulated with photo stabilisers.\r<br>\r<br>If you&#39;re interested I have a science-based skincare blog/Instagram where I talk about this kind of stuff on a daily basis. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theskincaresaviour/\">https://www.instagram.com/theskincaresaviour/</a>", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T03:16:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CHiTO", "comment_text": "So what\u2019s the best moisturizer that you guys can recommend for someone on their early 20\u2019s who doesn\u2019t need anti-aging cream yet??", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T03:15:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neil Tyson", "comment_text": "&quot;Anything with collagen, do not ever buy.&quot;   Does that includes collagen supplements?

Wish you would\u2019ve gone more in-depth with certain topics. I might be wrong, but anyone feel free to share your opinion/evidence on this.<br><br>In my opinion, I don&#39;t think your first statement is appropriate. To say that \u201dthis is the <b>only</b> anti-ageing and moisturizing cream that works according to scientists and has a scientific consensus.\u201d is a little misleading. People will assume that this is the only cream/treatment that works and no other topical cream out there regardless of them containing the same main ingredient works. The Skinceuticals retinol creams are definitely some of the best formulas out there, but there are also a handful of other retinol-based products out there that are formulated just as well if not better than this brand-specific one. What you should&#39;ve said was retinol is one of the only <b>skincare ingredients</b> that work and has the most research and backing. <br><br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIgnotoDWWk&amp;t=6m04s\">6:04</a>) not all antioxidants are the same, but we do know that L-Ascorbic acid is proven to treat and prevent certain concerns in the skin, including collagen biosynthesis. It&#39;s a little unfair to say that the Bluelene product is superior to the La Roche Posay one because it contains rice bran oil which contains two antioxidants (tocopherol), vs the one (L-AA) in the La Roche Posay. In actuality the La Roche Posay also contains Tocopherol. L-AA+toco vs two indirect forms of toco.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIgnotoDWWk&amp;t=4m47s\">4:47</a> it&#39;s a little vague to say that \u201dmoisturizers\u201d in it of itself does not have any scientific claims to actually be anti-ageing. Again most research is done on ingredients and not individual branded products. So therefore I also think you&#39;re giving people the wrong idea, and that the moisturizer they are currently using isn&#39;t doing anything when in reality it probably contains tocopherol, retinol, vitamin c, other antioxidants and derivatives of those. I just thought that was too much a broad statement to make about a category of products.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIgnotoDWWk&amp;t=8m48s\">8:48</a> dimethicone is shown to have a beneficial effect on the skin. It creates a permeable barrier that works to prevent moisture loss. This is great to have especially for people that have dry and/or dehydrated skin. You can put all the glycerine, and other humectants you want, but if you do not have occlusive ingredients in the formula, there isn&#39;t going to be much improvement in your skin when it comes to hydration and moisture levels. <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIgnotoDWWk&amp;t=9m30s\">9:30</a> parabens have been shown to be the best way of preserving, much like phenoxyethanol, a lot of people and brands are demonizing these ingredients when they haven&#39;t even read the research to begin with.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIgnotoDWWk&amp;t=10m40s\">10:40</a> wish you would&#39;ve gone more in-depth about retinoids as they do not all perform the same. Retinyl palmitate is an ester and the weakest of them all. Esters are often referred to as \u201dretinol\u201d when in reality they do not contain pure retinol, but a weaker ester.<br>The skin thinning (epidermis) is only temporary, that&#39;s why many people using pure retinol or a retinoic acid prescriptions often suffer from dryness and irritation at the beginning. The epidermis does eventually go back to its normal state, and in reality, over time retinoids help thicken the skin as it is shown to stimulate collagen synthesis.<br>Retinol is an antioxidant in itself, you can apply them during the day without negative effects.<br>Retinoids have been studied extensively and have shown that they do not increase sun sensitivity. Retinoids do break down when exposed to sun as they are more unstable and more likely to be less effective that&#39;s why a lot of companies are suggesting their products with retinoids for nighttime use only or because their formulas do contain other ingredients that contribute to an increase in sun sensitivity.", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T02:28:51Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Naiyelli Romero Ag\u00fcero", "comment_text": "I want Hyram to react to this!", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T02:28:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carla Molina", "comment_text": "What about the ordinary products?

Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis as a co-factor and organization of collagen fibers, it is quite clear that oral ascorbic acid administration increases collagen synthesis and there are some studies showing that topical vit c can increase the localized collagen synthesis. Vitamin C as an acid can help to disrupt the lipid matrix of the stratum corneum and allow transdermal transport, it is often used as an additive to topical drugs as a preservative of the compound as an adjunct to transdermal transport. Thus, Vit C can penetrate, to some degree, the protective structures of the skin and accumulate in the epidermis and reach the dermis, increasing the synthesis of collagen.\r<br>All of this is based on studies (I adite, cosmetic research is not the most reliable field of science and they have many bs). Not to say that the cream presented is a good option, just saying that there is some science behind and it is not just the anti-ox effect. You will live 2 studs just as a starting point, there is much more. (remembering, dermatological care is not my field of research, but in Brazil as a PT we have a working filed in dermatological treatment, and I work once if transdermal transport and research tendon and bone healing).<br><a href=\"https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=11896774\">https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=11896774</a><br><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12823436/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12823436/</a><br><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6345870/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6345870/</a>", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T17:41:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leah Kathleen", "comment_text": "The Inkey List has a really nice starter retinol that is SUPER affordable!!!
