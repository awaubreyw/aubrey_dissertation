Our biology can be sensitive, and it&#39;s hard to know what effects could be, what effects already are with current radio waves. They are probably sublte, small, unnoticeable, impossible to detect if they exist. But that doesnt&#39; mean they aren&#39;t there. The idea of &quot;toxic amount&quot; vs &quot;toxic substance&quot; was fundamentally flawed and use as an excuse to slowly poison a population with lead. In New Mexico where I live people are still suffering from uranium poisoning from all the nuclear bomb tests. <br><br>My degree is in chemistry, I&#39;m 100% pro science, 0% conspiracy. But there is a history of corporate consumer product design to fail to recognize what problems are way after the fact. It&#39;s not a conspiracy, but it shows the limits of what research is able to blindly detect in short term studies when we are only speculating on what to look for. <br><br>To put this in perspective, I think there&#39;s a million other things that are much more toxic than 5g ever will be. Plastic, teflon, bioaccumulated personal care products in water systems, alcohol, tobacco, sugar, coal, pollution, all have a drastically larger effect. <br><br>But the reality is there are too many people in power, from the coal industry to the cell phone industry, that wouldn&#39;t care if there WERE negative effects. They haven&#39;t historically cared, and people have been hurt. I love this channel, but the feedback I want to give you is there is NOTHING reassuring to people susceptible to believing in conspiracy theories that &quot;studies showed no health effects&quot; is a narrative that is pushed. It lacks honesty, it doesn&#39;t show that there&#39;s enough people don&#39;t know, the quality of these studies aren&#39;t ever talked about, and yes, history has shown that corporate science doesn&#39;t care.

Inductors interact with external electromagnetic waves, move and produce some extra waves within the cells. The shapes of these waves are similar to shapes of hexagonal and pentagonal bases of their DNA source. These waves produce some holes in liquids within the nucleus. To fill these holes, some extra hexagonal and pentagonal bases are produced. These bases could join to each other and form virus-like structures such as C V. To produce these viruses within a cell, it is necessary that the wavelength of external waves be shorter than the size of the cell. Thus Five G millimeter waves could be good candidates for applying in constructing virus-like structures such as C Ves (COVID-19) within cells.<br><br>Keywords: Five G technology; COVID-19; DNA; dermatologic antenna; inductor; millimetre wave.<br><br>We found out from NIH<br><br>Protection of the population health from electromagnetic hazards \u2013 challenges resulting from the implementation of the Five G network planned in Poland<br><br>Marek Zmy\u015blony 1, Pawe\u0142 Bie\u0144kowski 2, Alicja Bortkiewicz 3, Jolanta Karpowicz 4, Jaros\u0142aw Kieliszek 5, Piotr Polita\u0144ski 1, Konrad Rydzy\u0144ski 6<br><br>Affiliations<br><br>    1Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof.

Concerns about safety and health hazards resulting from the influence of the electromagnetic field (EMF) emitted by the designed Five G antennas have been raised. In Poland, the level of the population\u2019s exposure to EMF is limited to 7 V/m for frequencies above 300 MHz. This limitation results from taking into account the protective measures related not only to direct thermal hazards, but also to diversified indirect and long-term threats. Many countries have not established legal requirements in this frequency range, or they have introduced regulations based on recommendations regarding protection against direct thermal risks only (Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC). For such protection, the permissible levels of electric field intensity are 20-60 V/m (depending on the frequency). This work has been created through an interdisciplinary collaboration of engineers, biologists and doctors, who have been for many years professionally dealing with the protection of the biosphere against the negative effects of EMF. It presents the state of knowledge on the biological and health effects of the EMF emitted by mobile phone devices (including millimeter waves which are planned to be used in the Five G network). A comparison of the EU recommendations and the provisions on public protection being in force in Poland was made against this background. The results of research conducted to date on the biological effects of the EMF radiofrequency emitted by mobile telecommunication devices, operating with the frequencies up to 6 GHz, do not allow drawing any firm conclusions; however, the research evidence is strong enough for the World Health Organization to classify EMF as an environmental factor potentially carcinogenic to humans. At the moment, there is a shortage of adequate scientific data to assess the health effects of exposure to electromagnetic millimeter waves, which are planned to be used in the designed Five G devices. Nevertheless, due to the fact that there are data indicating the existence of biophysical mechanisms of the EMF influence that may lead to adverse health effects, it seems necessary to use the precautionary principle and the ALARA principle when creating environmental requirements for the construction and exploitation of the infrastructure of the planned Five G system.

Im not claiming to be a medical professional but these wet markets themselves could&#39;ve caused a lot of illnesses before the virus due to how exposed all the products were to different elements. when it comes to 5g, I&#39;ll leave that to the radiologist, but I firmly believe that it&#39;s just faster Wi-Fi, nothing more, nothing less. if I&#39;m wrong, then I apologize. please just make sure to inform yourselves on the virus before believing everything that comes from a theory with no scientific backing. if your theories do have scientific backing, please let me know where I can find the research material needed. thank you<br><br><br><br>here are some articles that could help to inform on how wet markets are operated if interested: <br><br><a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2020/04/whats-in-a-name-wet-markets-may-hide-true-culprits-for-covid-19/\">https://news.mongabay.com/2020/04/whats-in-a-name-wet-markets-may-hide-true-culprits-for-covid-19/</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/04/coronavirus-linked-to-chinese-wet-markets/\">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/04/coronavirus-linked-to-chinese-wet-markets/</a><br><br>please be safe<br><br>p.s: if this sounds out of context, this was meant for a comment thread instead of it being it&#39;s own individual comment.  on the off chance I may be wrong (even though this is a highly plausible reason behind the virus) this research isn&#39;t stating that this is the origin of the virus itself.", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T09:56:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Enzo Ocampo III", "comment_text": "I will dress as a 5g tower for halloween because idiots think its scary.", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T03:58:50Z", "likes_count": 56}, {"comment_by": "No Name", "comment_text": "Most of the conspiracy claims come from America.....because 5g is from china lol", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T19:22:19Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Drrck11", "comment_text": "The truth about 5g; unless you&#39;re a computer scientist,  most people won&#39;t notice the difference from 4g lte.", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T11:30:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jan pi Piet", "comment_text": "Don t trust t", "comment_date": "2020-10-11T15:33:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Lok783", "comment_text": "Yeah it&#39;s fast and exspensive but there are no more health risks then a 4 or 3 g phone I have slept with my phone no issues.", "comment_date": "2020-10-11T09:49:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sonya Clawson", "comment_text": "They truly want a person to believe all this when they say these 5G satellites can be used as weapons?

Although DOD uses certain MMW frequencies for high-profile military applications such as Advanced Extremely High-Frequency satellites that provide assured global communications for U.S. forces, it extensively uses sub-6 frequencies\u2014leaving less sub-6 availability in the United States than in other countries. The Defense Innovation Board (DIB) advised DOD to consider sharing sub-6 spectrum to facilitate the build-out of 5G networks and the development of 5G technologies used in the sub-6 band. While DOD has been moving toward greater spectrum sharing, it has expressed concern that sharing presents operational, interference, and security issues for DOD users. As an alternative to spectrum sharing, some analysts have argued that portions of the sub-6 spectrum should be reserved for commercial use. This would require DOD to relocate certain applications to other parts of the spectrum.

Russia is not very known to keep its people safe, but they know a great deal concerning radiation I must say.<br><br><br>Good luck on your one way path", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T00:16:42Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "david mccallum", "comment_text": "This can get kind of deep, so put your hip waders on readers.

The CTIA annually lobbies for the industry to the tune of millions of dollars, making them one of the most powerful telecom lobby groups.<br>\u2026\u2026 For example, at the time of the report\u2019s release, the Chairman of the FCC was Tom Wheeler, a man with deep ties to the wireless industry. In 2013, Wheeler was nominated as FCC chairman by former President Barack Obama after raising more than $700,000 for his presidential campaigns. Wheeler led the two most powerful industry lobbying groups: The National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association (NCTA) and the CTIA. In 20, Wheeler was also the head of the FCC during the debate around Net Neutrality.<br>Ajit Pai, current chairman of the FCC, is another example of this revolving door relationship. Pai is an attorney who served as Associate General Counsel at Verizon Communications Inc. between 2001 and 2003, where he handled competition and regulatory matters. Pai was appointed to the FCC by Barack Obama in 2012 and then made FCC Chairman by Donald Trump in January 2017. <br><br>In February, Pai admitted that the FCC failed to protect Americans\u2019 privacy after it was revealed that at least two companies were gaining access to Americans\u2019 private data and selling it to law enforcement. Pai called for a fine of over $200 million on AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint. \u201cThis FCC will not tolerate phone companies putting Americans\u2019 privacy at risk,\u201d Pai stated when announcing the fine. <br><br>FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr is yet another example of a government official working closely with industry and maintaining relationships which clearly present conflicts of interest. Carr is credited with accelerating the 5G build out. Prior to joining the FCC, Carr worked as an attorney at Wiley Rein where his clients were Verizon, AT&amp;T, Centurylink, and CTIA. <br><br>The Wiley Rein law firm is a hotbed of activity for former government officials and industry regulars. One of the founders of the law firm is Richard Wiley, himself a Former FCC Chairman. According to Open Secrets, in the first four months of 2020 the Wiley Rein law firm has been retained by several telecoms, including AT&amp;T for $80,000, the CTIA for $50,000, and Verizon for $30,000. For the last 15 years the law firm has spent at least $2 million dollars lobbying for their clients. Open Secrets also shows the CTIA has spent $3 million on their own lobbying efforts. <br><br>On September 30, 2019, Commissioner Carr and other FCC officials were in Houston to discuss the future of 5G. I interviewed Commissioner Carr about the concerns regarding his connections with the wireless industry, as well as the implications of the Captured Agency report released by Harvard\u2019s School of Ethics. Unfortunately, Mr Carr had no interest in addressing these questions and refused to answer my questions and only stated, \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the 5G build out and working with local leaders.\u201d <br><br>The silence from FCC officials on the charges of corrupted regulators and ignored studies is simply another facet of the relationship between industry and government. Again, the strongest influence over the U.S. regulatory agencies can be traced to the Cellular Telecommunications &amp; Internet Association.<br><a href=\"https://www.mintpressnews.com/big-wireless-lobbied-5g-data-collection-surveillance/267355/\">https://www.mintpressnews.com/big-wireless-lobbied-5g-data-collection-surveillance/267355/</a>", "comment_date": "2020-07-10T03:40:07Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Zombot", "comment_text": "Today I heard two women on the bus talking about how they have headache, nightmares, stomach pains, all because of the 5G towers they installed near their homes (and near where I live).<br>Guess they will have super headaches and nightmares when they actually install the first 5G tower in my city next year.", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T22:22:11Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Iso", "comment_text": "I thought this would be a video about how <br>&quot;5g causes corona&quot; lol", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T17:15:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Allen", "comment_text": "Dont worry guys, they&#39;ve done research on all of this and it&#39;s safe.

What have they have in common? <a href=\"https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-trends/data-cancer-frequency-country\">https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-trends/data-cancer-frequency-country</a> . Sorry moving off 5g a little, but it is conneceted. In Africa the food production is a little less &quot;processed&quot; and this shows  in the drop in first world diseases.Yet we are given the all clear by various governmental food departments that the food is fit to eat. I don&#39;t want to be a cynic, but that is how new facts are found out right? By further investigation. Rant over.

Just because 5g isnt a high enough frequency to melt our cells doesnt necessarily mean it is safe. Scientists did some math and some tests but shouldnt we wait more than two years before covering the entire Earth with 5G towers? It takes longer than two years for the Earth to react to this. I doubt it would destroy the planet but I wouldnt be surprised if the mental health crisis has something to do with electromagnetic radiation, or even if all these wildfires are connected to electromagnetic waves since 5G has been proven to heat up organic matter. Even tiny changes create massive effects, hence the &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot;. I doubt the placement of the towers will be in tune with Earth&#39;s electromagnetic field either; they might create a disturbance in the force. Anyway, 4g is fast enough, it only takes a second to google something and I really dont need it to take a tenth of a second. Then, if we go to 6G we get dangerously close to visible light which would definetly mess up Earth&#39;s systems; imagine thousands of towers emitting energy so high you could see it, we aren&#39;t sooo far from that. So by the law of scaling it down, 5g will definetly cause damage, just not as much as some people might think. But I will keep wearing my shungite necklace. In this video they even say that 5G waves were proven to increase brain tumors in rats so why the hell are they saying its okay just because the rats lived longer. Humans arent rats and two years is not enough time to test the effects of 5G. Things like this take centuries not years, I am a little scared of 5G. And that so many people watched this video and believed everything told to them. I&#39;m now thinking that the massive increase in wildfires could be connected to this.

When applied to the point of pain, the brain also releases endorphins, the body\u2019s own powerful pain relieving substances.<br>This biofeedback is what distinguishes it from TENS machines and other electrical therapies.<br>These treatments in low level electricity (TENS, SCENAR, COSMODIC, SCALAR) and low level lasers using frequencies has been around for a few decades now and demonstrates how the human body can react positively to extremely low levels and frequencies.  <br>Here is a link about the use of lasers to regrow teeth in rats. <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en79wtbytvk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en79wtbytvk</a><br>This field of electrical medicine has demonstrated to me how low and high frequencies have different biological effects both positive and negative.<br>In regards to emf radiation and the pulsed here is a link of over 500 &#39;Independent studies&#39; demonstrating the negative effectives:<br><a href=\"http://www.diagnose-funk.org/\">www.diagnose-funk.org</a> (If you click this link it will come up in German however if you search the name of the website and enter you will be given the option for the text to be translated into English). <br>Also are you aware that:<br>New York, NY, July 22, 2019. The Advisors to the International EMF Scientist Appeal, representing 248 scientists from 42 nations, have resubmitted The Appeal to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Executive Director, Inger Andersen, requesting the UNEP reassess the potential biological impacts of next generation 4G and 5G telecommunication technologies to plants, animals and humans.<br>There is particular urgency at this time as new antennas will be densely located throughout residential neighborhoods using much higher frequencies, with greater biologically disruptive pulsations, more dangerous signaling characteristics, plus transmitting equipment on, and inside, homes and buildings.

While on some level there are benefits, i always look at things dialectically.  i don&#39;t think this type of technology is safe for humanity in the long run, because all of this desire for quickness and convenience is only bringing distance from our humanity.  People are already not connecting with each other, because their heads are in their devices.  People can&#39;t even cross the street without looking at them.  People are sitting across from each other in cafes, just staring at laptops instead of talking to each other.  All of this technology does affect us on a cellular/spiritual level.  Everything i&#39;ve been seeing about 5G and A.I. (and i&#39;ve been seeing information and presentations from developers who advocate for it) is scary.  It&#39;s the desire for machines to take over (which i actually saw an A.I. developer say).  This addiction to convenience and quickness is killing us. <br><br>From what i read about 5g (and what Marques Brownlee stated here as well), it does not travel very far and can be blocked by &#39;obstacles&#39; such as trees, or perhaps a building...  So this most likely will mean that trees may be cut down to make room for 5G.  This also means that more and more areas will be &#39;wired&#39;.  And then of course, because of the smaller coverage there&#39;s the move to increase surveillance in smaller areas (which is already happening anyway- that&#39;s not a &#39;theory&#39; at all). A portion of the meteorology community has come out with concerns in relation to 5G as well, as the waves would be traveling so fast that it&#39;s going to alter how weather readings and patterns happen. <br><br>i know for myself, i cannot have anything with radio or microwave frequencies close to my body for long periods of time (cordless phones, MP3 players, cellular devices, etc.) because i do feel the heat emitting from the devices, and i end up feeling slight pain.  i also rarely, if ever, use microwave ovens.  i remember when i first got a cell phone (in 2005- it was a flip phone, before the ubiquitous headphone jack) i would get a massive headache within minutes of using it.  The spot i held the phone would also be really hot.  i learned not to have the phone to my head, and that was better.   Even if it&#39;s deemed &#39;safe&#39;, i still don&#39;t think the rate of dependency in which we use these devices is safe.  They&#39;re helpful for various reasons, but they should not be treated like a physical appendage.  There&#39;s a reason these phones are called &#39;android&#39; or &#39;iphone&#39;.  It&#39;s okay to slow down and just be with ourselves/without devices attached to our hips, and with each other.", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T01:41:20Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Allen Young", "comment_text": "the E in EHF stands for Extremely, not Extra.", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T00:17:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Salty-Sith-Lord", "comment_text": "I was taking you seriously until the soyboy simp popped up.", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T23:27:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bulldog", "comment_text": "Technology expert MKBHD measures download speed in GBps  and not Gbps smh", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T23:12:47Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Boymanmoo", "comment_text": "Dude my moms a fuckin nut, thanks for this she\u2019s now skeptical of 5g radiation", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T23:00:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suns hine", "comment_text": "please put Turkish subtitles", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T21:34:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Isi", "comment_text": "James charles grew a beard", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T19:42:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RyGuyK93", "comment_text": "I didn\u2019t know about this collab.

Unfortunately many of these types of educational 5G videos are created by engineers/techies trying to decipher a not well-understood subject of biophysics telling us 5G is safe because &quot;these&quot; people say so.  There is a section of wavelengths, within the 5G bandwidth they plan to use, that won&#39;t just pass harmlessly through us like 4G and &lt; uses nor bounce off us like daylight/UV light.  The concern is well beyond &quot;thermal thresholds&quot; which is typically 42C where proteins can begin to denature.  These millimeter waves can bounce around inside tissue, potentially causing cellular damage on the molecular level potentially affecting many cellular (signaling) pathways.  As a medical scientist with a terminal degree in microbiology and molecular genetics, more validated safety research would be required for myself and others before I am ok with them using these bandwidths safely on a mass level.\r  The study design of some of the publications they and the INCIRP reference are dated and flawed.

The cats: one neighbor had a pregnant cat that miscarried, 2 kittens dead upon birth, one developed with about 1/4 of it&#39;s cerebrum missing, the others had neurological and digestive too great to live, after they were born. All kittens died. Another neighbor next door to her had 7 cats: 2 of them committed suicide over the balcony rail, another became temperamental and would spontaneously become violent for no reason at all, another drowned itself in the toilet bowl, three others could not eat or hold food down for long. Those 3 died of malnutrition and had brain cancer. The one that was temperamental returned back to normal and became sociable again, AFTER AT&amp;T removed the cell phone dishes.

ICNIRP\u2019s guidelines are not fit for purpose as, among other things, they only recognise harm from heating of the body and are set for short term exposure \u2013 6 minutes in fact.  Many people suffer harm without any heating of their bodies.\r<br>\r<br>5G is the fifth generation of RFR technology used in the mobile telecoms industry and follows 1G \u2013 4G.  It dwarfs RFR from 1G \u2013 4G because millions more masts, antennae, small cells, picocells etc have to be placed at short distances apart all around the country in order to develop the infrastructure to deliver the data speed promised by 5G.\r<br>\r<br>The current electrosmog from 1G \u2013 4G will become significantly worse and it is likely to result in more harm to humans, animals, trees and pollinators.\r<br>\r<br>Many people have tried to engage with the government and its agencies, including Public Health England, over the last few years in an attempt to persuade them that their existing policies are harmful to human, animal and plant health.  The government rejects such approaches and insists on its adherence to ICNIRP\u2019s guidelines.  It has removed health concerns from the National Planning Policy Framework, thereby removing the ability of its citizens from raising such concerns at local council level.  Its Electronic Communications Code has limited the rights of its citizens to object to equipment being put on their land.  It has permitted the proliferation of RFR gadgets used by babies and children without constraint. \r<br>\r<br>These policies are likely to result in harm to UK residents.  There are likely to be many breaches of English law but a few may be breaches to duties to safeguard public health, breaches of the environmental legislation, breaches of human rights and breaches of the public sector equality duty.  The public sector equality duty is relevant because the government, in promoting these harmful policies, is likely to be doing so without considering people who are electrohypersensitive and who are, thereby, disabled under the terms of the Equality Act.\r<br>\r<br>What are we trying to achieve?\r<br>\r<br>I am trying:\r<br>\r<br>to obtain a change of government policy to stop the harm to UK residents, which would include:\r<br>an immediate halt to the roll out of 5G infrastructure until it is proven to be safe;\r<br>Direct all such businesses and persons to turn off all equipment which propagate wireless 5G signals including without limitation masts, antennae, wifi (including in schools), small cells;\r<br>Direct all products which use 5G wireless technology to be recalled as they are not safe;\r<br>Direct that the manufacture of all products using 5G wireless technology be halted.\r<br>Require the government to ensure that the industry lays cabling for the purposes of upgrades in technology rather than relying on wireless technology generating RFR and EMFs;\r<br>Require the government to examine all equipment and gadgets generating RFR and to take steps to ensure that such equipment does not cause harm to humans.\r<br>What&#39;s at stake?\r<br>\r<br>The government and media state that there is no harm to humans from 5G.  This is wrong.  The majority of scientific evidence show that there is harm.  The burden for illnesses which may result from 5G and other RFR will fall on the NHS and ultimately on the taxpayer.  This too is wrong.  The government are tasked with safeguarding the health of the nation and they are now being called to account for their failure to honour their duty to do so.\r<br>\r<br>Many people who are electrohypersensitive have a limited involvement in public life or are excluded from public life because RFR in public spaces is so prevalent that they feel ill in such environments.  Some are prisoners in their own homes, unable to go out and they struggle to live a normal life.  A change in policy will, at the very least, see safe corridors being formed for such persons so that they too can participate in public life by enjoying public spaces and public venues.\r<br>\r<br>UK residents are unaware of the harm that is being caused to themselves, their children and babies who are exposed to RFR to the extent that they are in today\u2019s world.  This case will, hopefully, change the government\u2019s stance and ensure that they are aware of the potential harm so that they can either agree to participate in an RFR environment or they can live in their homes and public spaces free from RFR.\r<br>\r<br>More about this important case:\r<br>\r<br>Who am I? \r<br>\r<br>I am a solicitor.  I became involved in understanding the harmful health impact of 5G when a member of my community alerted me to an application to put a mast on the building opposite her apartment.  She was electrohypersensitive. \r<br>\r<br>I started to investigate the nature of 5G including reading articles, scientific literature, the appeal by 240 scientists from around the world to pause the rollout of 5G pending proper health studies into its impact and discussed the position with various scientists, doctors and weapons experts.  I spoke to many others who have written to their MPs, local councils, government departments, the Prime Minister, telecoms and infrastructure companies, Ofcom and others about the harm to humans, animals, trees, pollinators etc with no success.\r<br>\r<br>I have come to the conclusion that taking legal action is the only way to bring this issue into a public forum and to examine the government and Public Health England\u2019s stance on this matter. \r<br>\r<br>I may be a claimant in this matter but if there are others who are more suited to be claimants in these claims, then they will proceed as claimants using the funds which I have raised on this page.\r<br>\r<br>What is the next step in the case?\r<br>\r<br>With the help of Tim Buley QC of Landmark Chambers, as a first step, the High Court will be asked to review the stance taken by the Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England.  The claim will be for judicial review of their policy of using ICNIRP\u2019s guidelines to set the limits of public exposure which I and many other scientists say is too high, thereby, causing harm to humans.\r<br>\r<br>I need Tim Buley QC to review the case, draft the application for judicial review, appear at any hearing relating to the application, prepare the case for a hearing and appear in court to present our case.  I will be the solicitor acting in the case through LCS Practice Ltd and will charge just less than half of my normal hourly rate for work done.  My normal hourly rate is \u00a3450 per hour plus VAT and I will charge \u00a3200 plus VAT per hour.\r<br>\r<br>How much are we raising and why?\r<br>\r<br>I am raising \u00a3150,000 to cover the legal and other costs and contingencies mentioned above including costs for the other side in the event of failure of the judicial review application - the Aarhus Convention cap of up to \u00a310,000 will be claimed.  I need your support: please contribute and share this page now.\r<br>\r<br>Under the terms of this fundraising platform, if you give over \u00a31,000, if there are unused funds after litigation, some of your pledge will be returned on a pro rata basis.

Talks about uses that are not something we all want self-driving cars fewer jobs, Robotic Surgent fewer jobs? <br>4. It&#39;s a strong frequency with short travel so we should blanket your city in nodes, personally, I just don&#39;t like the idea but there is no health department that reviews telecoms with government funding  <br>5.

Everything he said about radiofrequency is accurate.<br>7.  Says it goes over to the EMF of the frequency spectrum follows up to say EMF can potentially damage DNA.<br>8. The immune system relies on DNA, our cells use the protein cGAS to recognise virus DNA in the cytoplasm. cGAS then activates the immune adaptor STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes), which switches on an anti-viral immune response. <br>9.

I personally believe the lack of trust isn&#39;t in the scientist who are trying to provide a product, but the people that harbour it. as 50hz and 60hz was never brought up there are people who install the 5g towers have come out on youtube and have said they have the ability to crank it up to 90hz which is an Army deterrent that makes the perpetrator feel like their skin is on fire in the line of fire you can move out of it when fired but if it&#39;s blanketed around your city.?<br>12.

They say they have run a test but 5g hasn&#39;t been up and functioning, plus last time I checked every person is different how widespread is this test and has been tested with humans or just animals? <br>14.

One argument I&#39;ve heard pro-5G people use is that 5G antennas are directive (instead of isotropic), meaning that they don&#39;t just emit in all directions, but simply emit directly in the direction of the target antenna. So they said &quot;see, no need to be worried, you won&#39;t be constantly radiated as is the case with 4G, so it&#39;s ok if the we use higher-energy waves, because it&#39;s only directed in a very specific direction&quot;. Well, there&#39;s a 5G antenna 200m from where I leave. I spend easily 14-15 hours per day sitting in front of my computer. Let&#39;s suppose my neighbor is constantly using 5G and - bad luck - the beam between the antenna and his receptor goes directly through my head... 15 hours per day. So now the &quot;you won&#39;t be constantly radiated so it&#39;s ok if we use higher-energy radiations&quot; argument doesn&#39;t work anymore.

People want to call other people conspiracy theorist when they want to show them in a bad light or publicise them as being crazy and put into a class of nut jobs. It doesn&#39;t matter how these guys tell you their side of the story of what they know or deem safe. Anybody who has got a brain to think for themselves should always find their own version of the truth. Personally calling someone a conspiracy theorist is to say they are crazy for not following the consensus when the consensus can be distorted to fit a narrative or an agenda. I believe if you want the truth you must seek it out and dont let any one label you a wacko for doing so. These guys talk a good talk but the place where they are getting their information from are from official channels (that have connection with goverments and companies and can be bought) and that&#39;s the whole point of why people are not happy about 5g because they are being lied to by these goverments and companies  because there is information out there to say other wise, we all know what happens to whistle blowers. All these guys in the video, all they are doing is supporting the New World order agenda and the people who make comments against conspiracy theorist are those who are not prepared to research and find out the truth for themselves and would rather let guys like these confirm what they suspect to be the truth. However credit to them debunking the \u00a320 note conspiracy that there makes sense, however things are not always what they seem when it comes to the dark people within power who control our governments. So keep thinking this is safe if it makes you sleep better at night. Just remember there is good people in high places in goverment and there are bad people and what do you think the bad people who worship Satan are doing with their time? It certainly ain&#39;t about them helping the good ones out, that&#39;s for sure. It&#39;s about them pushing their agenda.

The extremely high frequencies in 5G are where the biggest danger lies. While 4G frequencies go as high as 6 GHz, 5G exposes biological life to pulsed signals in the 30 GHz to 100 GHz range. The general public has never before been exposed to such high frequencies for long periods of time......<br>......The \u201cmedical people\u201d have conducted over 2,000 international evidence-based studies that link health impacts with pulsed radiowave radiation from cell towers, routers, cell phones, tablets, and other wireless devices. These studies tell us that RF radiation is harmful at even low and short exposures, and that it impacts children and fetuses more rapidly than adults. Among the findings are that RF radiation is carcinogenic, causes DNA damage, affects fertility and the endocrine system, and has neurological impacts. Pulsed electromagnetic frequencies have also been shown to cause neurological symptoms: depression, anxiety, headaches, muscle pain, attention deficits, insomnia, dizziness, tinnitus, skin tingling, loss of appetite, and nausea.[3]<br><br>The U.S. Government has known of these risks since at least 1971, when the Naval Medical Research and Development Command published a bibliography containing 3,700 references reporting 100 biological and clinical effects attributed to microwave and radio-frequency radiation.<br><br>Recent findings, such as the $30 million 2018 U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) Study, have corroborated the findings of all well-designed heart and brain cancer studies of people with 10 or more years\u2019 exposure to cellular radiation from cell towers and cell phones. They all agree: RF radiation causes cancer.[4]<br><br>What has been the response to these findings?<br>Scientists are urging the World Health Organization (WHO) to update its classification of RF from a Group 2B Carcinogen to a Class 1 carcinogen \u2013 making RF and 5G comparable to arsenic and asbestos. Annie Sasco, former Chief of WHO\u2019s Research Unit of Epidemiology for Cancer Prevention, says, \u201cEnough is enough, how many more deaths would be needed before serious action is taken? Evidence just continues to accumulate.\u201d<br>Ronald Melnick, the designer of the NTP study, says that the study \u201cshows clear evidence of a causal link between cancer and exposure to wireless cell phone signals.\u201d He adds that \u201cAn important lesson that should be learned from the NTP studies is that we can no longer assume that any current or future wireless technology, including 5G, is safe without adequate testing.\u201d[5] Meanwhile, 231 scientists from 42 nations have signed the 5G Appeal, which urgently calls for a moratorium on the technology. Steps are being taken to slow the deployment of 5G in Italy, Belgium, Israel, Switzerland, and The Netherlands....", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T16:39:29Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Aelite", "comment_text": "Humanity is a lie, your reality is a lie.", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T16:32:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jim Flauntt", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t listen to the man who depends on supporting 5g in order to pay his bills.

It is a human virtue to trust. It&#39;s natural and spontaneous. To distrust, however, is learned. <br><br>But all these people (parents too), behind all the government regulations and all areas of society, is a confused idea of what is the truth and what should be done. Generally the confusion is not noticed, but the disagreements always are. Especially governments and schools. Unfortunately -- and this applies to the majority of the population; we all have some growing up to do with regards to understanding what constitutes as genuine authority. The government, media and educational institutions are not always honest where they really should be. In general, I&#39;d think the opposite is true of whatever the government says. If they say it&#39;ll cost one billion, it will cost ten to one hundred billion. If they say it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s probably good. If they say it&#39;s good (say 5G) it&#39;s probably harmful. This view takes a long time to see and isn&#39;t easy to readily accept distilled down the way I&#39;m saying it. <br><br>In time some of the population finally realizes that the government and the educators of the people are not as interested truth and helping people as much as they are interested in economic development. Many people say that they have &quot;awakened&quot; once they seen the cheating ways. Government is always cheating. Always. And mostly they cheat. But this understanding often comes long after the education was taken and paid for, at which point most people are apathetic, unable to help to make change. <br><br>If the government actually cared then cigarettes would be illegal. If educational institutions cared then they would be honest that there is actually no interest in curing cancer, which is illegal (no doctor is allowed to claim they&#39;ve found a cure...its only &quot;treatment protocols&quot; that are allowed, and this is big business), they are interested in developing the cancer industry. Young people, generally, are naive, not knowing that schools are a business and government is all but corrupt, with the president being the most tremendous twitterer that there ever was...

In the draft of the Monograph a large bulk of peer-reviewed scientific publications on non-thermal effects are dismissed, c.f. as also by ICNIRP (19). Most remarkable is that WHO has no intention to replace the Core Group of experts affiliated with ICNIRP. Thereby ICNIRP is given full access to and exclusive possibilities to influence the Monograph. In view of the huge economic interests built into the ICNIRP guidelines, and several of its expert members&#39; ties to industry, no doubt this is a large conflict of interest that will seriously undermine not only the credibility of the Monograph on RF radiation but also the credibility of WHO as a protector of world health.

All types of man-made EMFs/EMR - in contrast to natural EMFs/EMR - are polarized. Polarized EMFs/EMR can have increased biological activity, due to: 1) Ability to produce constructive interference effects and amplify their intensities at many locations. 2) Ability to force all charged/polar molecules and especially free ions within and around all living cells to oscillate on parallel planes and in phase with the applied polarized field. Such ionic forced-oscillations exert additive electrostatic forces on the sensors of cell membrane electro-sensitive ion channels, resulting in their irregular gating and consequent disruption of the cell\u2019s electrochemical balance. These features render man-made EMFs/EMR more bioactive than natural non-ionizing EMFs/EMR. This explains the increasing number of biological effects discovered during the past few decades to be induced by man-made EMFs, in contrast to natural EMFs in the terrestrial environment which have always been present throughout evolution, although human exposure to the latter ones is normally of significantly higher intensities/energy and longer durations. Thus, polarization seems to be a trigger that significantly increases the probability for the initiation of biological/health effects.<br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14914\">https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14914</a>", "comment_date": "2020-05-17T11:29:15Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "Austin Ward", "comment_text": "<b>hello</b><br><br>Read More", "comment_date": "2020-05-17T11:06:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Fisher", "comment_text": "I shaved off my beard and the coronavirus struck.

One of the key points being used for preaching that 5G is safe is just because it lies below high frequency spectrum. Then answer me, why aren&#39;t microwaves which lie below the super high frequency safe for humans? Mind you, I&#39;m talking about Microwaves and not the Microwave ovens(which produce the waves). Microwaves cause the heating of water molecules which is what humans are primarily made up of. If your theory of lower frequency means lower harm is utterly wrong. <br><br>There were studies and scientists in the 20th century preaching how cigarettes aren&#39;t harmful. Just think about that, the same &quot;scientists&quot; are the one who used to preach about the use of cigarettes and which kind to use too. Think about everything in our history. Light was said to be a &quot;wave&quot; by scientists. People like you just believed them and defended them. Then next came a batch of scientists proving light was a &quot;particle&quot; and you believed them and defended since they&#39;re &quot;scientists&quot; and they&#39;re the <b>God&#39;s</b> that can never be &quot;wrong&quot;. I don&#39;t say that 5G definitely causes cancer or other such harmful things. Just like how you&#39;re trying to prove that electromagnetic radiations aren&#39;t harmful, there are studies out there proving exactly the opposite which you easily dismiss and don&#39;t want to actually take the time and effort to test it out. <br><br>It&#39;s a consistent fact that the derm count of men are reducing year by year. One of the studies which the video itself quotes talk about how heating up of tissues can happen over time when exposed. Just imagine, we&#39;re being exposed to all kinds of EM waves like Wi-Fi, cellphone towers, maybe could be one of the reasons we&#39;re less manlier(in terms of sperm count) than our ancestors since these waves MAY heat up our testes(the balls require a lower temperature than our body for sperm production).<br><br>Just think about how many studies of the modern generation contradicts the ones conducted before saying one reason or another? Maybe after half a century our future generation may publish an article saying that &quot;5G is the cause of numerous diseases(weakened immune system)and studies of the past conducted by scientists of 2020 are absolutely under-researched&quot;. Just think about it. One more thing I&#39;d like to say, maybe 5G doesn&#39;t seem to have any noticeable short term effects, but what if it has long term effects which nobody OBVIOUSLY hasn&#39;t researched since this technology is new? Also testing on rats maybe ineffective in this case since because the life span of rats are low compared to humans and maybe the effects aren&#39;t displayed on them properly. <br><br>Don&#39;t just dismiss this as just another comment of a conspiracy theorist, think about it.

RF-EMF has been proven to be harmful for humans and the environment. <br><br><br>As of May 8, 2020, 372 scientists and medical doctors have signed the appeal. <br>The appeal was initially submitted in September 2017 to the European Commission. <br>The 5G Appeal note that with \u201dthe ever more extensive use of wireless technologies,\u201d nobody can avoid to be exposed. Because on top of the increased number of 5G-transmitters (even within housing, shops and in hospitals) according to estimates, \u201d10 to 20 billion connections\u201d (to refrigerators, washing machines, surveillance cameras, self-driving cars and buses, etc.) will be parts of the Internet of Things.<br><br><br><br>All these together can cause a substantial increase in the total, long term RF-EMF exposure to all EU citizens.During the recent years over 240 scientists from more than 40 countries have expressed their \u201cserious concerns\u201d, via EMF Scientists Appeal, regarding the ubiquitous and increasing exposure to EMF generated by electric and wireless devices \u2013 already before the additional 5G roll-out. The over 240 scientists refer to the fact that \u201dnumerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines\u201d. <br><br><br>Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plants and animals. <br><br><br>The Appeal primarily urge the EU to<br>1) to take all reasonable measures to halt the 5G RF-EMF expansion until independent scientists can assure that 5G and the total radiation levels caused by RF-EMF (5G together with 2G, 3G, 4G, and WiFi) will not be harmful for EU-citizens, especially infants, children and pregnant women, as well as the environment.<br><br><br><br>Signatories to Scientists\u2019 5G Appeal<br>Signatories by May 8, 2020: 372<br><a href=\"https://www.5gappeal.eu/signatories-to-scientists-5g-appeal/\">https://www.5gappeal.eu/signatories-to-scientists-5g-appeal/</a>", "comment_date": "2020-05-15T00:42:17Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Dommy521", "comment_text": "Is it just me or dude with the glasses i extra fruity these days?", "comment_date": "2020-05-15T00:30:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lesedi Manyike", "comment_text": "this doesn&#39;t concern the video BUT<br><br>I remember trying to have an open minded conversation with a student that was studying science. <br>our chat weirdly moved to black holes, he gave me the science behind black holes (it is a force that destroys anything that comes near it etc.) so because I&#39;m such an open minded person I asked him &quot;what if a black hole is an entrance to another universe as we know that there are many other universes.

This has something to do with the fact that 36 seconds into the video the guy in white shirt was already hinting with weird face gestures about the opposing theory, and name calling ( calling it \u201c pretty wild\u201d and made faces in conjunction with it), BEFORE even providing any scientific evidence to the contrary. By doing so, he signified his stance on the topic as if it is absolute, then he switches his stance at the  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw0A9FUTEKE&amp;t=12m40s\">12:40</a> mark stating \u201c that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be skeptical of technological advances\u201d. Why should anyone be skeptical if the available science is one hundred percent clear about its safety?  Because it appears to me that it is not. If the opposing side\u2019s theory is \u201cpretty wild\u201d there shouldn\u2019t be any reason why anyone would be skeptical. Why? Because their stance is PRETTY WILD ( \ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffe that\u2019s a big accusation). Then he attempts to reel the viewer back in by stating they were skeptical too, THEN, name drops a Harvard professor to create a halo effect to give the notion of not to worry, Harvard professors are trustworthy and intelligent, when a Harvard professor was just recently arrested for having illegal ties to China. Yeah, Harvard is not so trust worthy. So Harvard\u2019s name drop has no bearing on swaying me, and it isn\u2019t the beacon of truth and light right now.<br><br>My philosophy professor in college who was teaching my class how to debate taught us if name calling starts, especially in the beginning, it is a sign, (or tactic) that the opposing side is attempting to condition people to their ideology, it also can be a sign of fear of the opposing side. It can also indicate frustration or defeat, and lastly, it can also indicate the side that\u2019s name calling is either being coerced, or paid to promote a specific agenda, or ideology\ud83e\udd14. When in reality, the truth and facts require no conditioning or name calling, it can speak for itself, CLEARLY, in a FAIR and OPEN market. Major red flag for me. He should\u2019ve been impartial and unbiased, and let the TRUTHFUL science speak for itself, instead of attempting to shame the other side, ESPECIALLY in the beginning. <br><br>After reading the Scientific American article <br>\u201c We have no reason to believe 5G is safe, and going through the ninety five page PDF of studies, I would be extremely wary about this 5G, and it\u2019s safety. The choice is yours.  Also, I notice at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw0A9FUTEKE&amp;t=11m51s\">11:51</a> mark the guy in the Black shirt stated if you\u2019re \u201cinterested in conspiracy theories and the science on why they work so well, we actually have a video all about that. \u201d giving the notion that conspiracy theories are false, and completely made up. If you are unbiased, impartial, TRULY scientific, AND just, how come you don\u2019t have a video about conspiracy theories that actually came to fruition then\ud83e\udd14? To give people a balanced and fair opinion. VERY interesting, I\u2019m just saying\ud83d\ude0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I did not name call or mud sling any side of this topic, and I didn\u2019t make any attempts to condition anyone.

That voltage runs through an anode and cathode that\u2019s surrounded by a cavity magnetron. The physics of how it works is too complicated for this reply, but what it does is generates HIGH ENERGY electro magnetic energy in the microwave range which in turn bounces back and forth inside the oven to heat your food.
