Not only does this bead help the pearl to be spherical (because not all pearls are evenly shaped), its structure looks much different when X-rayed. Specifically, natural pearls show concentric growth rings, while cultured show a solid centre (because of the bead)", "comment_date": "2012-08-31T14:51:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nils Wahlstr\u00f6m", "comment_text": "oh my god i actually knew this ;)", "comment_date": "2012-08-31T14:49:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jayne Sally", "comment_text": "Please do a video on orgasms and what the body goes through and differences between male and females.
