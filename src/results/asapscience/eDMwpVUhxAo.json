So there&#39;s this girl I really care about. We have known each other for 2 years now, and she just broke up with her boyfriend who did not treat hef well, and she was losing her confidence. After her breakup, she is now so happy, and so am I. She innvited me yo her house twice, once while she was with him, and the other time after she broke  up. We didn&#39;t kiss or anything, but we hit it off. We watched a movie together, had great conversation, and she even gave me a haircut. On the second  trip to her house, she baked cinnamon rolls, and I was amazed at how good they were. Now both times when if was tome to say goodbye, she didn&#39;d want me to leave. At the door, we talked for half an hour, and on that time, we had shared 3 hugs. For the past week, my heart has been beating faster, appetite is less, and my stomach hurts, and I am more happier than usual. This must be what love feels like, and it is a totally new experience for me. I am taking it slowly, as I don&#39;t want to mess anything up, and I also do avoid contact with her at times to make her miss me, and hopefully next time I can tell her I love her.

CONTAINS MILK AND SOY.<br><br>Do these ingredients sounds like they are good for you? The major reason why Nutra-Curb will not work is because it does not stay as weight, density and volume for very long and will not sustain the &quot;trigger effect&quot; of fullness and satiation. The main ingredient is &quot;CALCIUM CASEINATE&quot; or MSG (monosodium glutamate), \u00a0followed by &quot;Fructrose&quot; or sugar, then Maltodextrin a &quot;thickener&quot; which \u00a0breaks down and passes to quickly into the gastro intestinal tract to work effectively. The diet programs that promote selling foods are only interested in you buying more of their foods for as long as possible. Keeping you addicted to eating and never solving the true root cause which is over expressed food addiction. \u00a0Notice the ingredients are based on sugars and salts our most addictive products that has driven the obesity pandemic to record levels. \u00a0<br><br>Macro Loading is a new and unique &quot;FEEL FULL AND LOSE WEIGHT ANTI-DIET, DIET&quot; that addresses the root cause of obesity\u2026 \u00a0which is overexpressed food addiction! Macro Loading sustains the &quot;fullness trigger effect&quot; so you can be satiated on a minimal &quot;survival diet&quot; while never feeling hungry. Macro Loading will effectively override the need to eat, thus saving up to &quot;ninety percent&quot; of your food consumption budget (not in the best interest of a company that sells food). It is typical for people Macro Loading to lose over twenty to thirty pounds a month (depending on start weight) as they stage down and maintain a healthy BMI &quot;body mass index&quot;. I personally lost over fifty pounds Macro Loading in three months and maintain five pounds over and under my ideal BMI without doing any excessive exercise. The Macro Loading protocol is so effective because it is extremely simple and very inexpensive to do. It will even work if you are failing with a gastric bypass like Chris Christie.<br><br>Originally developed as &quot;THE NASA DEEP SPACE DIET&quot; with over 4 years of proof of concept. My Macro Loading protocol has proved to safely reduce food intake while easily maintaining a satiated &quot;stomach&quot;, \u00a0a feeling of wellness and a healthy BMI. Macro Loading satisfies the restrictions of extended deep space missions where exercise and food storage space is limited and can not be resupplied. On earth, holistic and homeopath doctors are starting to use Macro Loading for the more natural elimination of toxins and to promote\u2026 easy, natural and regular bowel movements so important to excellent health.\u00a0<br><br>Macro Loading has the benefit of helping and curing over 500 million people worldwide with an unhealthy body mass index. I have decided to give away my protocol for Macro Loading FREE (no strings attached, no credit cards) for a limited time\u2026 (outside pressures :)<br><br>\u00a0All I ask is for a &quot;BEFORE PICTURE&quot; (to prove personal need) and I will TRUST you will send me that amazing &quot;AFTER PICTURE&quot; when you succeed at reaching your goal weight. Please do not contact me if you want to use Macro Loading to exploit and make money I am not interested ever! My lifestyle is not about quantity, but quality! Fame and fortune is not my goal in life, but doing what I can to help humanity and evolution in a positive manner with any profits.\u00a0<br><br>Jayson T", "comment_date": "2015-08-15T17:41:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kimberly Schooley-Szabo", "comment_text": "Why do we say crush when we like someone", "comment_date": "2015-08-12T20:08:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BellicaTV", "comment_text": "what if you&#39;re forever alone?", "comment_date": "2015-08-09T14:39:43Z", "likes_count": 305}, {"comment_by": "RUOWEI", "comment_text": "lol so if ur in love its almost equivalent to consuming cocaine OKAY", "comment_date": "2015-07-31T09:24:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Angel Teran", "comment_text": "why do we become depressed? or why do we, why does it fell like?", "comment_date": "2015-07-31T03:26:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "e0257550", "comment_text": "I have a question (I hope it&#39;s not too late), how do I know if I&#39;m in love?", "comment_date": "2015-07-31T00:52:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ethan Hittle", "comment_text": "oh no!!!!!!!!!<br>does this mean that im in love?", "comment_date": "2015-07-28T02:31:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mafia1997", "comment_text": "I guess the power of boners is really stronger.

Relationships, boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, its all mimcry. Its a mimic to fill in the void of the fact that our parents can no longer help us when we are down. That we have no shoulder to cry on. So we look for things to fill the void, a relationship. A relationship is just a mimic that covers up the emotional fact that you no longer need your parents.

This is more specifically for sexual relationships as friend and family love is of course less sexually based.<br><br>Simply put<br>Obsession/crush: Sexual attraction, initial desire and interest in the other, mostly sexual based at least at first. If it is extreme, people often interpret this as being in-love, but often it doesn&#39;t have oxytocin and vasopressin levels required to be called in-love.<br><br>In-love: Looking into each others eyes, often having a us against the world ideals and feelings. Can last 6 months to 3 years.Given that this stage doesn&#39;t allow you to see faults very well in the other, it can be difficult if when one falls out of love, suddenly reality comes crashing down. This also explains why one night stands or casual relationships are not for everyone as some people have a quicker ability to fall in love, particularly during orgasm or other intimate relations with the person. (And yes, this explains why your friend might be boyfriend/girlfriend or even married to someone who clearly is not a good influence, being in-love is pretty blind for many people.)<br><br>Long-term love: Looking in the same direction, facing things and growing together. This stage is one many relationships do not reach.
