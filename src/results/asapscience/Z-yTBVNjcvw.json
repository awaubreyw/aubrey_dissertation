So i was just wondering if there was a scientific reason. Also because of this, it takes my body around 3 weeks to get over a common cold so if i got covid, i would be seriously ill. My dad says that if i got covid, my body would stop fighting the cancer cells and fight the covid cells. But wouldnt that mean i have cancer. Its so confusing and nobody will tell me anything.
