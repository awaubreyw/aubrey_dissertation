Only winnings are taxed, not the turnover.

Atomic energy is not a reusable energy. Theoretically you can process the waste and filter the usable Plutonium from Uran waste to be used in another atomic power plant, but still, after that you have another kind of radioactive waste with a necessary storage time of millions of years. With the help of reprocessing and transmutation, an attempt could be made to reduce the necessary storage time to hundreds of years, but the processes required for this are also under criticism and are not yet ready for application.<br><br>Another thing you don&#39;t say is that mining rare earth like Lithium is damaging the environment. Most of the Lithium comes from south america and the mining destroys the local flora  and fauna. Indigene people that live there have their basis of existence removed, because the ground water level is lowered and the water is contaminated with waste from the mining process. To produce one metric ton of lithium salt you need two million liter water. One lithium mining area in Bolivia is the home of the andean flamingo, a species threatened with extinction.  Electric cars are not environment friendly. There were other methods in development like hydrogen powered cars like the BMW Hydrogen 7 - a system that uses hydrogen like we use gas and diesel, with only a few changes in the normal engine without the need for fuel cells. Only steam as the exhaust gas.  But that development was stopped for electric cars because of lies about electric cars...... Just remember - one electric car need the same power wattage a whole family home needs. Where will the infrastructure will come from, not to forget that big electric power plants have transport losses until the power reaches your home  - on average 6%. Just think about New York with over 11 million cars. For fast loading each car needs a wallbox with 22kW. These are 242million kW or 24200 MW more power needed for New York if everyone who has a car gets an electric car. An average atom power plant produces 1400 MW. That means NY alone would need more than 10 additional average atom powerplants for electric cars........", "comment_date": "2022-08-31T06:52:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Bartley", "comment_text": "Nuclear is clean and safe.

Although this might in some ways agree with the fundamental message, is based on real facts rather than the loose and careless unsupported arguments floating around in social media.<br><br>1. The electrical grid will be expensive and can be paid for by soaking the rich. The new super grid which will be more efficient, reliable and transport electricity over longer distances can be and more likely will be paid for by MMT (Modern MMonetary Theory) practices such as borrowing from teh future. When infrastructre like a new Grid is considered, the benefits will be very long term, probably over 100 years including projected maintenance and management costs. It should also be recognized that the US grid is comprised of numerous private operators that will make individual decisions. The point is, funds will need to be made available on extremely long payment schedules, likely over 50 years. Although taxing the rich can and possibly should be discussed, it&#39;s not the way such things as financing a new electrical grid on a national scale should be financed.<br><br>2. There is no theoretical shortage of Green electricity to power the transition from fossil fuels to Green. The main problem for most states in the USA (and the rest of the world) is a lack of commitment to just do the transition. In the US, the entire West Coast is already positioned and is on schedule in its transition. Texas is largely powered by wind most of the time. The problem states are in the Southeast which still burn coal and have nuclear plants (which I don&#39;t consider Green, nuclear is a highly dangerous and posisonous solution that sells itself as being able to contain its poisons and isolate from the greater environment). California likely already has the capacity to support every local citizen owning his own EV car today if that magically happened. Already approx 30% of all its energy is sourced from Green and that&#39;s including at least about 4 hours of every day wasted generating electricity in the morning when businesses aren&#39;t open and people aren&#39;t fully awake. When and should California decides not to waste that energy and store it for use later that day, California will instancely add about another 30% Green electricity to being used. Other states can look at the California template and decide what can be used locally, California has all the facts and figures anyone would need to create a solution from practically any Green source and when a new supergrid is installed will meant that wherever energy is produced can be transported more efficiently to wherever it&#39;s used.<br><br>3. Yes, we are living through a kind of Industrial Resolution if you want to call it that. But, it has little to do with the Internet although the Internet has a lot to do with managing resources more efficiently due to this also being a revolutionary Information Age. We are also living in a unique age of human discovery and new understanding of everything around us including basic sciences. If anyone who went to college and graduated 60 years ago were to take another test today, I would guarantee that person would fail a basic test for today&#39;s version of those courses. Chemistry has changed. Physics has changed. Social Sciences has changed. Everything is radically changed more in the past 60 years than maybe the prior 120 or 200 years combined. This has everything to do with how we govern ourselves and make decisions because so many people rely on their personal and life experiences without considering that is all obsolete when making the best possible decisions today.<br><br>4. the Transition to Green has nothing to do with the cost of Green decades ago vs the cost of Green today. The capability of Green decades ago was also ridiculously poor so it wasn&#39;t usable no matter the cost. Similarly the technology we had then like energy storage (batteries) was so poor, we wouldn&#39;t eenn have mobile phones. There is a lot more to what makes today&#39;s evolutiona and revolution possible than the simple things described in this video.<br><br>This crutucusn  just touches on, and does not rectify every problem in this video.", "comment_date": "2022-08-30T23:54:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pause lab", "comment_text": "the biggest lie: they don&#39;t exist", "comment_date": "2022-08-30T23:42:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "silvereagle404", "comment_text": "ooooh wow... finally more people see what i saw like 10 years ago. i saw big oil companies buying new ideas and just throw them in the binn", "comment_date": "2022-08-30T23:09:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Nielsen", "comment_text": "Speaking of lies, someone CLEARLY doesn&#39;t know how corporate taxes work differently than personal taxes.", "comment_date": "2022-08-30T22:46:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fuzzy Brick", "comment_text": "I did not finish watching...

It&#39;s great that they can generate so much electricity, but they devastate the local ecosystem.  From the front of my house, I can see the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.  During late March and early August, those foothills would turn a beautiful orange, as the wild poppies would bloom.  Now, It&#39;s a sea of black solar panels.  A large portion of the wild life that used to live there is gone.  People think &quot;Oh it&#39;s a desert. Nothing lives there&quot; but that is totally wrong.  There is a large variety of wildlife, from coyotes, deer, bobcats &amp; desert tortoises to a large variety of ground squirrels, quail, burrowing owls and hundreds of cold blooded species.  The majority of these creatures are displaced with these large, fenced off solar farms that can cover hundreds of acres.  The same goes for the wind farms that, while not as bad, still devastate the local ecosystem with all the access roads, buildings and cement pads that are needed for the thousands of wind turbines that dot the Tehachapi Pass.

Now to go to the video, new jobs in renewables actually go to China, and as for costs, we are seeing inflation souring because governments poured too much into renewables which are not efficient enough. Just look at Texas which had power failures in winter where the solar panels were covered in snow, and the wind farms froze. As to CO2, the current levels are about 400ppm. The greenest the world was in history was during the dinosaur era when it was 2400ppm, so 400ppm is not that serious. Another point to make is at 250ppm, ALL plant life on earth dies, and we are just 150ppm away. One final point, 97% of CO2 comes from the sea due to natural sea ecology and undersea volcanos, where one eruption is the same amount of CO2 that mankind produces in a year. Mankind produces 1% of 1% of the CO2, so cutting it to 0.5%, which is almost impossible, makes such a small difference it cannot be measured. Renewables are great, but not right now, the current technologies are not yet at a point where they are efficient or economically viable enough. By the way, for every coal power plant the EU and USA close, China opens 3. So while the Chinese economy grows stronger, the EU, Britain, and America grow weaker.

So rich people will dictate laws as long as they can and as long as enough regular voting people do not stand up to that notion, reject capitalism as a system, and demand a just transition to a better system. <br><br>So, here is the error you made about &quot;How to Pay For It?&quot; A common misconception on how the federal government pays for things is that they need taxes to pay for it. Well, that&#39;s not true. They federal government spends first, taxes second. This could be known as MMT, originated by Warren Mosler and his first paper on this in the early 1990s. None of what he wrote has been disputed. It&#39;s 100% fact that the federal government does not use taxpayer money to pay for things. They also cannot go broke and the deficit is not a problem, nor is the debt. It will not burden future generations. They federal government issues the currency, they can&#39;t run out of it. The constraints on spending is actual physical resources to do the things that we want to do. So a &quot;Green New Deal&quot; is paid for by the federal government passing the bill and crediting the appropriate accounts to give them the funding in the states and communities to do the work. Inflation can be a problem, but if the funds are going towards green renewable energy which anyone with a brain knows we need to do, there won&#39;t likely be inflation as those are necessary jobs and if we allow fossil fuel industry people a just transition towards those jobs, all the better. <br><br>That said, YES, do tax the super rich. That is really important to reduce their extreme wealth that is allowing them to dictate how policy is made. That&#39;s been going on for decades now. It&#39;s going to take a motivated, educated group of citizens to know the facts, know the problem and know the solutions.", "comment_date": "2022-08-23T00:04:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Vision", "comment_text": "Fun fact!

So, his scientists were told to go to a organics conference in the late 1800s to get it changed in the books that the oil was a fossil fuel, which means it is scarce, in order to drive up the price because every barrel you take out of the ground might be the last barrel you have. but Rockefeller knew that oil was much closer to the surface then thought and it was easily obtained by drilling just a militar two in most cases.

To either optimize their processes, improve the services provided, create new services and processes, employ more workers, and increase employee pay. This 11 billion dollars isn\u2019t just going into greedy peoples pockets and disappearing from then economy because if it was we wouldn\u2019t have suck booming growth since 2018. So maybe if the government actually spent money effectively and efficiently and then passed infrastructure bills. Then maybe you could justify increasing taxes a little or at least pass some tax bill to include businesses at least paying something. But the government shows time and time again they don\u2019t actually care about any of that. They\u2019d rather spend trillions of $ doing frivolous ineffective social spending that ends up hurting more than it helped. The inflation created by spending and printing trillions of dollars trying to help people during COVID ended up costing those same people more money a year later through over 9% average inflation. And that inflation number isn\u2019t even accurate because that number comes from very focused and selective consumer indexes. If the government for their hands on 70% of the private industry growth in this country we\u2019d only see further inflation as they attempt to pass some of that onto the consumer with even higher price increases.

It is July 2022. I\u2019m watching the news. Elon musk has asked his customers in California to not charge Tesla cars during peak hours. The grid cannot supply enough power for the relatively low number of Teslas and other electric vehicles that require recharging from the electric grid. Which brings us to the point<br>  if every source of power generation in California currently available, solar, wind, Hydro, nuclear, natural gas, oil, coal, if every power generator was online and producing at the maximum, with none of them off-line for maintenance.. they could not possibly supply enough power to charge every car in California if every car in California at this moment was an electric vehicle. I am including home rooftop solar panels tied into the grid. If all of that power generation was dedicated to just charging electric vehicles. It\u2019s still not enough.<br>  let me restate that.<br>  that means, no power for hospitals, schools, stores, water sewage and supply plants, police stations, malls, homes, home air-conditioning, traffic lights, none of them using power from the grid, all the power going to just charging electric vehicles if every car in California right now I was electric.. they can\u2019t possibly meet the demand. And today, July 15, 2022 on the news, the LA Times, and, Elon musk are reporting that the grid cannot handle people with electric vehicles charging their cars today because they are going through a heat wave, and the power grid can\u2019t handle it..<br>  look what happened in Texas just a couple years ago during a snowstorm. They were heavily invested in solar and wind power generation. I don\u2019t know the exact number but it was many millions of people went without power during that deep freeze storm for days and days..<br>  I believe there is a future for electric vehicles. But..<br>60 Minutes did a report a few months ago about the Volvo making heavy equipment for mining those big trucks with those enormous wheels on mining sites, they made an electric one. Volvo now will not make that vehicle and here is why<br>  The battery itself weighs 20 tons and only puts out power for 6 1/2 hours. Those companies need those machines to run 24/7 to pay for themselves. The recharge time on that battery is 36 hours..<br>  Volvo has given up on the battery powered mining trucks and similar equipment. They are going to hydrogen. The future is hydrogen in Europe for power generation and for vehicles.<br>  it\u2019s nice to imagine self driving Tesla tractor trailers powered by electric. But their range is very limited, and the recharge time is very long..<br>  there are literally tens of millions of mechanics in the world that are able to work on hydrogen internal combustion equipment because it is the same as internal combustion that runs on gasoline and diesel. Just a different fuel.<br> on the other hand, there are probably not even 100,000 mechanics around the world able to repair electric vehicles. It\u2019s going to take generations to train enough mechanics to work on electric vehicles.<br>  people right now that on Nissan leafs, many of them need batteries. The problem is, to have the battery replaced, cost more than the NADA or Kelley blue book value of the car. Why would you put a $6000 battery in a car that\u2019s only worth $4000. Batteries are not getting cheaper. They need cobalt, they need lithium, they need copper to make these batteries, those minerals are not getting less expensive to buy, or less expensive to mine, and they are a finite quantity..<br>  I think it\u2019s a good idea to put solar panels on your roof and tie into the electric grid. You can go on the Internet and buy a 5KW battery backed up system for under $10,000, hire a registered electrician that will do the install correctly by going through the procedure of getting the proper permits and inspection and getting the permission and permits from the electric company. You can hire a registered electrician that will do it correctly, and a helper, for probably under $3000 to install that system..<br>for less than $15 you could be pretty independent of the electric grid.. it makes me cringe when I see people spending over $50,000 for solar rooftop systems, or having them installed \u201cfree \u201conly to pay your regular electric bill to the company that installed it for free when you could have it installed for a fraction of that cost and it would pay for itself at least here in Pennsylvania where there is a law that the local utility must pay you $.12 per kilowatt of power you put back into the grid..<br>  I am retired from an electric company. I did field investigations checking for tampering ECT. When I would pull up to a house that had solar panels, I knew instantly why we had been paying them instead of them paying us. It\u2019s not a lot, one customer was paid a little under $600 for the total power that customer put back into the grid and paid us zero dollars that included certain charges that the customer must pay to the utility and to the state and taxes. The customer still made a profit of $600 with a 5KW rooftop system..<br>  another customer had two separate 2 ton air conditioner systems, and a swimming pool with a pump that ran 24 seven for four months of the year. That customer was paid $50 by the utility and paid zero dollars for that year to the company for power. So that was a break even for that customer..<br>  It would not be that expensive to add a few extra powergenerating solar panels and up your system to do something like 7KW. This would put additional power available for recharging your electric vehicle if you have one or intend to get one.. but keep in mind, those vehicles are worth less than a cost of a replacement battery after six or eight years..", "comment_date": "2022-07-15T15:13:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blizzy", "comment_text": "Lol I&#39;m not rich but it&#39;s funny how everyone favorite idea is to tax the rich even though they already pay more than more than 100 people", "comment_date": "2022-07-15T13:59:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darryl Maclean", "comment_text": "Taxing the rich is the easy answer.....the truth is the rich will just shift their money in ways that they dont have to pay the taxes....... that how the rich get richer they dont pay tax and they invest.... wind farms are the bigest lie and do more harm than good and solar tech isnt good enough yet...", "comment_date": "2022-07-15T13:56:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James J.", "comment_text": "But renewables seem inefficient because you need twice as much infrastructure.

That&#39;s business. Taxes are a cost of business, thus it&#39;s figured into the cost of doing business.<br><br>Climate change. So many lies.<br>When all the sea ice melts, it will raise sea level by x number of feet.<br><br> There&#39;s that simply little sciencey thing called displacement. Fact. If all the sea ice melts, it will have zero effect on sea level.<br><br>If CO2 increased from 400ppm to 800ppm, it will only increase the average temperature by 1\u00b0. Not 2.5\u00b0 to 3\u00b0.<br>To increase the average temperature 2\u00b0, the CO2 levels would need to increase to 1600ppm. That&#39;s not going to happen.<br><br>Geological history shows CO2 levels between 4000ppm and 6000ppm and the average temperature being about 10\u00b0 higher then today. The dinosaurs did just fine. It&#39;s those rocks falling out of the sky you need to watch out for. Or super volcanoes like the 1 in Yellowstone.<br><br>During the mini ice age which ended at about the time of the industrial revolution, the average temperature was about 1\u00b0 cooler then today. Obviously when a mini ice age ends, the temperature will increase.<br><br>Geological history also shows the average temperature has been higher a couple times in the last 2000 years and a few more times since the end of the last glacial period 12,000 years ago. We&#39;re currently in an interglacial period where the climate warms, but a 1000 years from now, we&#39;ll be going back into a glacial period. That&#39;s when half the world will be covered in 1000&#39;s of feet of ice again.<br><br>Working to have cleaner air is fine and transitioning to non fossil energy is great as it will eventually run out in an economic sense. But it needs to be done in an intelligent way. Which I don&#39;t see happening. I see a lot of poverty in the future and all that entails like sickness and death.<br><br>Of course the idiots would have you believe we need to hurry because of a growing population that may reach 13 to 15 billion.<br><br>I suggest everyone do some research. We will likely peek at 9 billion by 2050 before the population implodes. By 2100, there&#39;s a good possibility that there will be 25% fewer people in the world than there is today.<br><br>Note all but about 3 or 4 nations out of a 195 have a fertility rate below the replacement factor of 2.1... many nations population are already in decline. Japan&#39;s is dropping by half million a year. China&#39;s will start declining by 2025.

Then to a distributor warehouse... The main reason Green energy is being pushed is because of Geopolitical energy concern&#39;s example: The EU get 25% of it&#39;s oil/ 35% of it&#39;s natural gas from the Russian Federation from pipelines made in the Soviet Union which accounted for 60% of the Soviets Economy was Gas/Oil exports mostly to Europe because they were at one point the largest producer/exporter of oil \ud83d\udee2\ufe0f they had some the largest oil reserves in the world: Caucuses, Caspian sea, Central Asia, West Siberia, volga Urals, and the far east but during the cold war most of there ports/exports could be blocked by Western nations through the following:<br>The strait of Dover, The Danish Straits, The Turkish Straits, And the Japanese Archipelago and these same principles apply to this with Kazakhstans, Turkmenistan, Usebekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan oil Pre existing pipelines from the Soviet union run through the Russian Federation so the Kremlin yeilds a vast Strategic energy advantage over Europe... Now yes has Europe tried to diversie it&#39;s energy yes but it&#39;s not easy they made a pipeline from Azerbaijan through Georgia which got invade by Russia for trying to join NATO and goes through Turkey, Greece, Albania, and Italy and Europe has the North sea reserves but that is not enough to balance energy with causing social unrest among civilians...

We also need to look at the availability of some of the resources which are required. If we want to push out renewables on the type of scale that is suggested, do we even have enough of all of the resources to manufacture enough devices to power the world? <br><br>The silicon used in the manufacturing of solar panels isn&#39;t just any kind of sand you find on the beach. It is a specific type of sand that must be used and the quantity is much lower than most people realize. It has to do with purity and shape. <br><br> In addition to that tons of CO2 are also released into the atmosphere by the equipment which is used for mining the resources (Silicon, Boron, Gallium, Phosphorus, Indium, Cadmium, Lithium for batteries, Copper, Lead, Aluminum, and many other necessary materials depending on the type of panel) and the transport of both raw materials and components. The shipping industry is responsible for a massive amount of pollution annually especially cargo vessels. <br><br>Then, the manufacturing process for solar panels requires coal, wood charcoal, and other resources as part of the process of creating silicon ingots. The temperatures that must be reached to purify the silicon require a huge amount of energy usually provided by coal power plants. The purification process releases CO2 into the atmosphere as carbon is removed from the silicon. More energy is needed to cut the ingots into wafers and dope them with the appropriate chemicals to turn them into semiconductors. <br><br>Then once they are created, shipped, and installed, if something like a hurricane, tornado, or other natural disaster destroys them before they reach that 30 year mark people always point at, you can&#39;t even recycle them. They can&#39;t even go in a landfill because they are considered hazardous waste. <br><br>I&#39;m more concerned about the environment than the economical perspective, but a lot of people who think some of these things are going to save the environment are disconnected from the actual environmental impact of most renewables. Instead of concentrating the pollution to one or two locations (mining and power generation), we are spreading it out globally in the process of creating things we think will reduce the pollution because they don&#39;t generate CO2 while attached to your roof. <br><br>Nuclear on the other hand, is extremely efficient and has less of an overall environmental impact as long as it is managed appropriately. I&#39;m very interested in the research associated with SMRs (Small Modular Reactors) because they have a smaller overall footprint, can be scaled for appropriate power demands, and use far less resources than all of the renewables currently on the market.<br><br> People act like billions of tons of nuclear waste are generated from the power plants, but that simply isn&#39;t the truth. The waste is far less than most people realize and if the US would update their regulations to match current technology, we could get more use out of the materials that are currently sitting right next to power plants that were stored as waste in the past. That significantly reduces the amount of mining that would be necessary to collect more material because we already have it. <br><br>Another technology that I think seems quite promising are the LNG collection plants that are using fumes released naturally in landfills as waste decomposes. That seems like a good use of something that is going to get released into the atmosphere whether we put good use to it or not. Might as well get something good out of the terrible mess we have already made by having landfills in the first place.", "comment_date": "2022-05-25T12:51:37Z", "likes_count": 29}, {"comment_by": "Ciaran McCormack", "comment_text": "Left wing propaganda", "comment_date": "2022-05-25T04:06:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffrey Langford", "comment_text": "More info dude, WTF cost of solar panel $76 and now $0.50 in reference to what?? <br>and OHHH Germany going green !!BULLSHIT!! they shut down their nuclear power plants.

It has even been proven to be 10 times stronger than steel and 30% lighter stronger and lighter than concrete, stronger and lighter than brick. Far more versatile making the design possibilities practically limitless, at the same time being easier to work with on-site&#39;  equally as amazing 1 acre of hemp! Can produce enough bio fossil fuel to fuel 10,000 vehicles for a year at about a dollar per gallon.  One of the major differences is hemp bio fossil fuel only releases the same amount of carbon dioxide  unoxygenated air per mile as a person does when the exhale versus coal, oil, and gas. Which release tens of millions of years worth of petrified death per mile. The real winning sales pitch&quot;  is 1 acre of hemp! Produces 3 to 4 times the amount of oxygen as a acre of trees at the same time sucks in 3 to 4 times the amount of carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases, deadly unoxygenated air as a acre of trees plus it rejuvenates and replenishes the soil back to Garden of paradise type of quality after every harvest even if the landscape has been previously stripped, robbed, and depleted from overharvesting things such as cotton and corn that has been marinating in petroleum-based fertilizer.  Not to mention it has the same nutritional value as rice, corn, wheat, barley, and milk combined is one so we can easily deal with people being over fed and undernourished   In layman&#39;s terms                                          we can rebuild faster much more efficiently at a fraction of the cost in half the time of what we are doing today without leaving any excess poison is toxic waste behind.  \tIn other words we can manufacture, mass-produce, distribute products that every country, city, and continent is going to be happy to spend top dollar.  Example, hemp clothing  distributes moisture across the body more efficiently than any other material leaving a person feeling, smelling, and smiling their best even under the most extreme circumstances don&#39;t forget about the limitless design possibility plus it promotes good respiratory function so if a person has asthma, allergies or other breathing complications just by wearing its clothing you will alleviate those symptoms with the potential of diminishing them all together. Hemp  has even  been successfully grown on radiative soil.  So in theory if we grow hemp along the shores of our rivers and lakes we will greatly improve upon the quality of that water shoreline.  Nonetheless we definitely will improve upon and maintain the quality of our air, water, foods, landscapes, working/ living environment, habitat, and every day home products to the highest degree that is humanly possible by producing 3 to 4 times more oxygen per acre than we do currently.  At the same time sucking in 3 to 4 times the amount of carbon monoxide greenhouse gases  un oxygenated air per acre as we do currently,   as a added bonus everywhere we grow it we will be rejuvenating and replenishing the soil back to Garden of paradise type quality even if the landscape has been previously stripped, robbed, and depleted of all its value from overharvesting things such as cotton and corn Keep in mind America has about 800,000 acres of available farming land.  \tSo again we have the manpower, woman influence, technology, resources, substances, capability, and technology to create clean high-paying jobs from coast to coast that will improve upon and maintain the quality of life in such a way.That will gradually consistently, constantly, systematically almost effortlessly and naturally thus allowing each person&#39;s generation to become stronger, smarter, healthier, happier, better off physically, mentally, financially, possibly spiritually then the previous generation. With that type of leadership, loyalty, and devotion to one&#39;s self and country People may start finally having jobs, products, power sources that will allow them to be healthy and wealthy enough to live enjoy their life all the way through out retirement.  You can&#39;t do that would dirty low-paying jobs.  That come from outdated power sources, inferior materials, poisonous, toxic substances, pesticides, and chemicals that never change their killing composition which means whether it&#39;s solid, liquid, or burnt off in to our airways atmosphere as a vapor is always going to be poisonous, debilitating, deadly to the body at the same time polluting, corrupting, and devastating to mother Earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world. \t\t The bottom line you cannot promote life by doing business with materials, resources, and substances that have been scientifically classified, religiously verified as petrified death or worse. Think about this because it&#39;s a simple logic basic concept if life is not free why the hell would death be any cheaper. I guarantee it&#39;s not so would you like to know how souls and spirits have paid out are picking up the tab on the end results of dirty low-paying jobs.  Would you like to know how souls and spirits have paid out are picking up the tab on a diminished quality of life? A better question what do you think the spiritual cost is to one&#39;s own soul and spirit living dying to the lowest standards of quality opposed to the alternative which is the highest standards of quality?  Case closed. Mercy, forgiveness, and spiritual welfare are not changing these facts. Protecting, carrying, and compensating any whimpering, whining, crying souls and spirits that are freely connected to a life that is not living up to the pleasure, potential, responsibility of femininity and masculinity. You&#39;re either part of the world solutions or you are exacerbating the world&#39;s problems either way there is no playing it safe in the middle  every one of us is being held spiritually accountable for each and every moment.I Laugh, smile, grin, chuckle with confidence I say now a wish and pray for my soul and spirit to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim to the way I&#39;m living personally professionally.\t I guarantee you never see hear another body, man, woman in power, persons of legal, religious authority, leaders ever freely validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty. One reason could be the don&#39;t have the best interest of the majority of the population&#39;s needs at heart. Another reason could be they cum from a bloodline of cowards! One is genetic  hereditary the other is A simpl  generic synthetic learned behavior either way it is physically, mentally, financially and spiritually useless to freely live and die in such a low quality manner especially if that stupidity, ignorance, and desperation stems from being soft, lazy, out of shape, over fed, undernourished, overworked, underpaid with dirty low-paying jobs.

to the world\r<br>By Simon Bowman\r<br>Australia \r<br>Since the beginning the growth of hydro science has been slow and we have made very little forward movement in the past 40 years. \r<br>The ideas that might make it leap forward with more efficient use of the water are stifled by education being thought of as immovable . \r<br>What was wrong yesterday will be wrong forever and new tech can&#39;t get around a problem. \r<br>This is not a problem solving mind set\r<br>Australia has forced many an idea to leave this country to grow \r<br>just because we have an issue with new ideas \r<br>A classic example was Metal Storm a new type of fire arm that had no magazine and no brass cartridges to hold the propellent. \r<br>all the bullets are held in the barrel and with this configuration the barrels can be stacked this gives it a rate of fire unmatched anywhere \r<br>It had to leave Australia to become a product or stay and die.\r<br>This I fear is the same story about to happen with the hydroelectric field \r<br>For the past two years RDP Marine Australia has been working on a system that can be retro fitted to all dams with tailraces longer than the turbine hall needs so it has to deal with a backpressure higher than is ideal creating a loss that can now be recovered\r<br>At this point it should also be noted that the inventor asks where is it written that water storage dams can\u2019t make hydro power to ?\r<br>So is this inventor saying \u201cThis is the answer to all ur power needs?\u201d \r<br>No of course not but like all good things it is a part of a solution it will fill the gap for base load green power\r<br>Lets not forget at the location where these units will be fitted has most of the infrastructure already in place to build the system\r<br>NOW TO THE ISSUES\r<br>There are three main issues right of the top that are the most commonly raised as why it will not happen\r<br>So lets stomp on them straight off\r<br>1, fit an item into the tailrace and backpressure will rise in the turbines \r<br>No this is not true as a this system if done right it can be fitted to be like a tuned exhaust for a car \r<br>2, There will be to little back pressure so RPM will not be constant \r<br>Again No if the system is correctly fitted this to is a dead issue \r<br>3, Dissolved gasses that are held in suspension \r<br>This is a minor issue and most chief engineers are well capable to work with this \r<br>4, NOW this one can be a deal-breaker it is to do with a what if question. \r<br>So what if the new set of turbines go down or just one ?\r<br>Well if one or all freeze up the main turbine hall will be unaffected and no issues flowing up hill \r<br>These four issues are the most common reasons I am told No \r<br>It is this closed thinking (knee jerk response) to a new idea from the same family of being blinded by their education that stifles the industry moving forward \r<br>The one question I have no answer to is time \r<br>How long to install?\r<br>How long to service the new turbines?\r<br>To service time i still don&#39;t know but the system is set to allow a swap out setup so actual down time for that turbine slot is less than two hours and the rest of the system remains running during the swap\r<br>How much will it cost?\r<br>I can guess only the price but the price is not so high as to be to costly \r<br>Whats its life span?\r<br>Well with servicing I can see it giving service for the life of the dam\r<br>NOW the big question Money!!\r<br>this is a fluid issue shall we say the rate changes and i have stated previously money values but the income is in two parts the improved tailrace efficiency and the second bank of turbines should be close to 10% extra income  \r<br>The one main issue I find so wrong is the time line needed from this point to the world seeing a working unit. \r<br>The tech is there to make it \r<br>The skills are available to hire \r<br>The market is in need of this item\r<br>But the price will rise with demand as the population is getting bigger but the book keepers are happy to see it remain as a rare item with a limited output that pushes up the price \r<br>The first adopters have always been the biggest winners I wonder in this area if it will be the big four or will a player from left field run on and wipe the floor with the rest standing with their hands in their pockets confused as to what just happened\r<br>Well, I hope this has given you food for thought and made you pause your thinking and look into what I have said I do not expect you to just except what I have stated as fact nor do I know it all so I can learn a new thing to.\r<br>Please pass this around let the open minded look it over and pass judgment after all the driver in the end is the need and the ability to see what is needed down the road is the saving grace of the human species to plan ahead\r<br>If you think i have missed a point or you have questions please

Otherwise, it is a well known fact that, CO2 producing vehicles is much more environmentally friendly, if, you start to increase forests. Because, CO2 is converted to O2 by the green plants,. All you have to do is to stop pumping CO2 into the higher atmosphere, where no green plants could convert to any CO2 into O2 for about a 500 years.  \r<br>\r<br>Guess what? Since, the other product is the glucose (or some kind of carbohydrate like starch - AKA Potato) along with O2, we may solve the hunger problem of the world, if we stop polluting the upper atmosphere with CO2, and increase the forests and agriculture based on converting the CO2 into the O2. \r<br>\r<br>The Question is; do our leaders really want to solve anything at that end, at all?

That gave solar a bad name,to the fury of reputable providers and probably delayed the take-up as much as waiting for the price to come down. In the early summer 2005,while I was away for a month in the Far East,a wheelchair-bound chap I was a carer for was doorstepped by one of these people and sold a system with a single roof-mounted panel that turned out to be at least twice the recognised industry-wide price for such a system. It worked for about a year,then broke down. Upon contacting the company who sold it to him it turned out that they&#39;d gone into receivership with a barrage of complaints about their activities.

That renewables can replace what we are using today with our current technology. The key issue is that they are intermittent. And thus they can only supplement the existing methods reducing the frequency of their use. We still must have them and must pay for their creation and operation. Until the storage problem is fixed, this line of thinking is dreaming. Utilities are starting to get enough users supplying power that they can no longer absorb the cost of operating as the renewables battery (by ramping production of mostly natural gas plants up and down). They are now forcing the solar users to pay for their grid use. Guess what, that &quot;battery&quot;  is expensive and nearly equalling what they would have just paid for the power in the first place.<br><br>All these statements about converting to electric cars by some date are grossly optimistic. There isn&#39;t enough lithium available to accomplish it. It only takes some basic searches to verify it. Figure out how much a typical car uses (Tesla publishes this), find how many cars are sold per year globally. Multiply to get the total lithium need (just for transportation) and then compare that to the global lithium production rates. The number far exceeds what we currently mine. Now look at mining projections to see if we might catch up by the stated EV conversion dates. They still fall far short. And mining gets harder and more energy intensive the longer you do it because they mine the easiest stuff first. <br>There are some technologies that might relieve us from this problem, but are all experimental and may never plan out.<br><br>Stating that solar is $0.50(missing the units of per watt) is a lie. Yes the panels can be obtained at that cost, but a real installation is about 3x that much if you do the labor yourself and 6-10x that if you pay a solar company. As long as the power companies keep absorbing the cost for allowing you to connect you might have a reasonable return on your investment. However too many people are now supplying the grid and during peak solar hours are shutting down power plants. The companies still have to pay for those plants whether they are producing or not. That cost will be passed on to the solar producers eventually.<br><br>Our best option with current technology is nuclear (probably thorium based).

Firstly, the way you cite tax figures isn&#39;t really correct. Firstly, Amazon the corporation in the US actaully didn&#39;t make 11.2 billion dollars in profit. They paid 11.2 billion dollars to pay of debts and leases, which are not considered expenses when the debt or lease is obtained in the form of capital investment, which it almost exclusively is. This is where it gets tricky, the capital asset that Amazon leases annually is the intellectual property for Amazon and its various subsidiaries. A corporation outside the US owns all the non physical assets, and Amazon in America leases them from this sister company, which owes no taxes because it is somewhere else.<br><br>Interestingly though, this money isn&#39;t really used for anything. For other more complicated tax reasons, this pot of money parked off-shore is largely inaccessible. In many ways, its analogous to a Roth IRA, more than a tax cheat, in that while yes it does in fact reduce the total tax obligations of massively profitable corporation like Amazon, its also is both completely legal, important, and does still end up getting taxed, its just taxed differently.<br><br>The money in the offshore company can not be used to pay any of the corporate executives, otherwise it would be taxed as their income. If it was being taxed as their income, and Amazon had just paid it to them directly, it would still not have been taxed as part of Amazon&#39;s corporate profits, because paying your employees, including your executives is considered a business expense. The tax contribution would have been split, however, requiring Amazon to pay half out of its end of the nominal salary. From an off shore company paying a salary to an American citizen, it has no such obligation, and as such the executive in question is obligated to pay the full amount. This does not however change the amount of money that ends up in the executive&#39;s pocket, just how the accounting is done. Technically, it is feasible for an itemized deduction to include this fact that they were paid on a basis that required them to make the full income tax contribution (just like contractors, content creator, self employed and entrepreneurs) but ostensibly this just accounts for the fact that the nominal salary is just different from what it would be if the tax split was different. The valuable of the underlying goods and services is unaltered.<br><br>Instead, the offshore money remains in the tax haven until such time as Amazon has a use for it. Remember when I said that part of what Amazon is expensing includes the repayments of debts from capital investors? The largest capital investor in Amazon is ... Amazon. An incredible quantity of the money that Amazon scurries away at the end of every fiscal year is gradually amortized back to Amazon in the form of physical assets, expansion, subsidy, and investment from its sister company. What does Amazon pay in exchange for all this captial and intellectual property being dumped into it every year? Why their complete annual profits of course, minus whatever was scraped off the top to pay the employees, executives, loans, leases, maintenance, acquisitions, supply, distribution, and other tax obligations.<br><br>When Amazon &quot;avoids&quot; taxation by shuffling money around through various complex financial apparatuses, and disperses it into assets it has need or want of at a later date is a key component of its ability to maintain growth. There is no retroactive tax credit on profits if you eventually use that money to participate in a subsidized activity, or to expand your business. If your reinvestment occurs outside the current fiscal year for example, tough cookies. You either have to park those liquid assets in contracts or assets immediately, a process of &quot;clearing&quot; their books, or bite the bullet on a massive loss to taxes in which you will no longer be able to expand. This process of clearing books and parking assets is disruptive to underlying markets, creates room for corruption and fraud (it is precisely this process that is the basis of a great many embezzeling schemes) and exposes the company to all manner of liability and risk when its contracts fall through. Also, because these contracts represent guarantees on the exchange of goods or services yet to be provided, they technically are futures. This makes them subject to regulation by the SEC, further taxation anyways, and vulnerable to all kinds of market chicanery that ultimately erode or undermine the value of these investments in the long term, again crippling total capacity for growth.<br><br>While you may feel indifferent about the capacity for total annual growth or the effect asset circulation has in underlying markets, that&#39;s likely because you don&#39;t realize that every cent the government taxes from Amazons capital investment, dollars of tax revenue are lost in the subsequent years. Not to mention, dozens more dollars in income and commercial sales taxes, real estate. Then consider indirect contribution to national economic growth, the local consumer economies that power them, and the global economy that supplies cheap raw goods to our production.

Had Texas stayed with natural gas power plants or even not shut some older ones down Texas would of had no power supply problem during the freeze  Also Nat Gas power plants are very efficient as you actually referenced in your vid about fossil fuels.  <br>You have not even touched what the up and coming problem will be when everyone wants to charge there electric car.  when they get home at night when the power usages are already high.  You should be more balanced in your approach,  Let technology catch up through research and in the mean time have Nat Gas power systems which are safer than nuclear and cheaper to build and relatively low cost to run hold the power need of society until solar efficiency and power storage can be developed in a manner that will keep up with civilizations needs without causing hardship on the population.  I am of the opinion your video is misleading people .  I am not arguing against renewables.  I am saying that they will need more time to mature into a reliable power source that we can utilize without fear of it not being there or not being enough causing rolling brown outs and prices to skyrocket.", "comment_date": "2022-03-12T01:18:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Wright", "comment_text": "The video should be titled in my opinion.

This unlocks a new oil resources never thought possible increasing the lifetime of oil by several decades. The US is the largest consumer of oil and production has been increasing since mid 2000s and has surpassed the previous peak in the 1970s... and will continue to increase.<br><br>This is why Europe, Russia, the Middle East and China are all shitting their pants.

You&#39;re not talking about the &#39;effective&#39; tax rate.  True we had economic growth in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s with higher tax rates.  But you were also able to deduct almost everything on your tax return from your country club fee&#39;s to your credit card interest (and a host of other expenses).  So the effective tax rate people paid (and the subsequent tax tax receipts) was actually much lower than the stated rates of the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s.  Historical data shows the actual tax rate PAID by the richest 1% of Americans in the 1950&#39;s was 42%.  And that was for everything - all taxes levied including state &amp; local, which means their actual federal rate was much lower.  <br><br>AOC uses the same argument, and the same logic is used to frame the tax cuts in 2017 as being for &quot;the rich&quot;.

It would be a gas motor close to achieving the instant torque profile of an electric motor, for like 1/4 of the cost! and 1/4 of the current waste.<br>You could go one step further and perfect the CVT Transmissions, that allow a gradient of gearing, as opposed to the locked 5 or 6 speeds most manual transmissions have (or even the 8-10 speeds the most advanced regular Transmissions have). <br><br>All of that would continue to allow fossil fuels to blow ANY renewable out of the water, but it seems the industry doesn&#39;t want to bother, and would rather mine the shit out of African countries for their cobalt and nickel.", "comment_date": "2022-01-16T01:02:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uncle Brick\u2019s Garage", "comment_text": "Green energy freaks should practice what they preach.

In today&#39;s market you get solar based on your normal use and when the sun goes down you switch back over to your local power grid, So now your paying for the Solar you had installed (% based on your normal usage) and then you are paying for your local energy usage after the sun goes down. So is it really feasible to buy solar considering the pay back time is 10 to 20 years. The industry rule of thumb is if you use more than 20 KW hours per billing cycle then it is worth it, but if you do not it is not worth it. For me personally I would never buy solar unless I could use solar 24/7 with lithium ion batteries as a storage platform to be used during off hours like when the sun went down. Also one more piece of advice stay away from LP gas or just plain natural gas these two markets are non regulated and bill can vary by state a lot for example on month you could have a gas bill of $35.00 and the next you could have a bill of $95.00 this will all depend on the national demand for the product. But in other good news Electricity is regulated by each states local public utilities commission which over sees and regulates rates increases.

Second is the the high price in electricity, which is around 0.29 ct/kWh and the highest of all nations. This has effectively weakend the economy and threatens work places. And if you still think we just have to push a little and be there, I want to remind you here what I said in the first sentence: energy is not equal to electric energy. Green energy in Germany just makes up 0.8 to 1.5 % of the total energy consumtion since most of the energy demand is in mobility (oil) and heat (gas).<br><br>Renewable Energy is the future, it is true. But the costs are much higher, the grid needs to expand and we need far better and scalable as well as cheaper storage technologies, which hopefully will be in the form of efficient and recycleable lithium ion batteries in all sizes.<br>A way to put the real price of energy is the CO2 pricing. If you count in the future costs of enviromental damage, green energy becomes highly competitve, but for this we will need a global price on CO2, in every nation. The green house effect needs to be acknowledged by every nation and taken seriously. Otherwise we will use up every single drop of oil, gas and coal, until the supply makes it too expensive.

Wind and solar. I&#39;m not some paid fossil fuel shill that hate on wind and solar but to believe that these two things are the absolute way forward is naive and purely ideological. The biggest problem with wind and solar is their footprint. Both of these technologies require massive amounts of land to deploy, huge amounts of fossil fuels in order to mine, transport, produce, transport, deploy and maintain. Most estimates don&#39;t take this fact into consideration. This video also doesn&#39;t take into consideration the fact that these technologies are inconsistent. The wind doesn&#39;t always blow, the sun doesn&#39;t always shine. Fossil Fuels have lasted so long because they are cheap to deploy and they are consistent. Store it in batteries you say? This is also a less efficient way of doing things. Batteries produce heat when charging and discharging which is wasted energy on just that. Not to mention the large inverters that are needed to convert a battery&#39;s DC charge back to AC before being pushed to the electrical grid. Another huge inefficiency with more power lost to heat.<br><br>Wind and solar have their place and can make a huge difference in the future but if you&#39;re in the camp that we need to run our entire society off wind and solar then you need to do a bit more research because it aint gonna work brother.<br><br>Second. Nuclear power. I&#39;m glad that nuclear at least got a mention in this video but it would&#39;ve been better if they had gone into more detail with nuclear as nuclear is our current best option. <br><br>Currently not much energy is produced with nuclear energy in the US and that is just sad because nuclear, unlike wind and solar, actually has a small footprint, a fraction of the land use of wind and solar, and produces more energy more efficiently and consistently. Most of the nuclear reactors in the US are old and are really showing their age and our government through fear mongering and bureaucratic regulation have made it prohibitively expensive to deploy new nuclear power plants to the point that they are not even an option or economically feasible. Meanwhile the government spends money it doesn&#39;t have on subsidies for energy production that is less efficient and more destructive to the natural environment in wind and solar. If you aren&#39;t that read up on nuclear, consider looking up some videos on different types of reactors especially Thorium and other molten salt reactors. If you&#39;re worried about safety or terrorism, just know that more people are killed every year in fossil fuels and the deployment and maintenance of wind and solar than have been killed in the entire history of nuclear power including chernobyl, Fukushima and three mile island. Nuclear energy when deployed in smart, safe reactors is the safest energy production method in the world.<br><br>Three. Germany. While its true that Germany  is reducing the amount of coal power plants this video skips over the inconvenient fact that the Germans are just buying coal produced energy from Poland and nuclear power from France while shutting down its own nuclear reactors. The video also fails to mention how much natural gas is being bought by Germany from the Russians. Oops.<br><br>Four. Tax the Rich. While the claim that Amazon doesn&#39;t pay any income tax is true, that is only because the video producer doesn&#39;t explain how these taxes work. Businesses are taxed on the profit they make but Amazon doesn&#39;t make any profit. They reinvest every penny they earn back into the business thus there is no profit to tax. This is how they do it. To suggest though that Amazon doesn&#39;t pay any tax is pretty misleading. Amazon has thousands of employees that all pay tax directly through the money that Amazon makes not to mention the shear amount of tax money generated through sales tax on the products that Amazon sells. Amazon is actually a huge producer of tax revenue for the government but I guess none of that matters if the money doesn&#39;t come from the top of the company to our stary-eyed progressive presenters. This video also mentioned how in the 1950s the top marginal tax rate was as high as 90%. This is also misleading. While its true the top marginal rate was that high, the top effective rate wasn&#39;t. Nobody paid those tax rates in the 1950s. If you made enough money to qualify for those rates, you just paid to have the tax code changed in your favor. I don&#39;t have the numbers off the top of my head but the effective tax rate was closer to what we have today anyway. This video is also misleading as to why there was such a boom in the 1950s where so much money was made. That has to do with the US being the only industrialized nation that wasn&#39;t bombed to shit in WW2. We exported millions of dollars of goods to Europe, Japan and other places that needed our goods to rebuild. There was also a huge labor shortage because of the thousands of men that died in WW2 that caused wages to sky rocket so bad that the government had to come in to cap wages so businesses wouldn&#39;t go out of business trying to over pay their work force. Those two things are why we had such tremendous growth. Not because of high taxes on the rich.<br><br> I&#39;m probably going to get the most amount of flak for my last points. Sadly people in the US have been brainwashed into believing that the economy is a zero sum game, that the economy is finite and that all the people who sit on the top got that money, not because they earned it, but through exploitation and theft from the middle and working class. Oh well. They will probably reply about the evils of capitalism to me from their $1200 iPhone Pro Max that they paid extra for the better camera to kick start their photography blog. They will probably be proud of their che Guevara t-shirt that was manufactured by some wealthy wall street capitalist while sipping on their $4 starbucks coffee to tell me about the evils of capitalism.", "comment_date": "2022-01-03T06:04:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Masron Ahmad", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve wasted 13 minutes.

A year or 2 ago, the upper Midwest in the US had below zero temperatures for 2 weeks while it was cloudy. Without doing the math, I would guess it would be impossible to store enough solar energy for the demand they had during that time. Natural gas is clean and can heat a home quickly. How large of battery storage facility would be required to store enough energy for that very possible scenario? I&#39;m all for all types of energy and think the world&#39;s energy demands are met best with as many alternative sources of energy as possible. Why would you want to limit energy sources to wind, solar, and nuclear? There is a modern, clean, coal-fired power plant in Craig, Colorado that primarily emits STEAM into the atmosphere. It can provide electricity 24 hours a day, 7 days a week regardless of the weather. It is stupid to close a power plant like that just because someone is pushing solar and wind. It took a lot of energy to build that power plant. How many acres of solar panels would you need to replace that power plant?<br>My favorite of all, which is renewable, is nuclear power. Nuclear power can meet extreme energy demands and it has the smallest footprint of most energy sources. Despite the hype about nuclear power plant accidents, there have been few deaths from them. Chernobyl will never happen again. The nuclear energy program in the US is highly advanced and regulated. A lot of money was spent creating safe places to store nuclear waste. The accident at three-mile island in the Eastern US was sensationalized by the media even though nobody died from the partial meltdown.  That was in 1979. Technology has advanced a lot since then. Studies showed that cancer rates didn&#39;t increase in the years following the accident.<br>My least favorite of the most popular power sources is wind energy. They require a lot of land area. They ruin the scenery in a large area; huge eye sore. They kill thousands of birds. They require a lot of maintenance. When Texas had freezing temperatures the blades froze and were damaged. In a beautiful, non-mountainous part of NE Colorado, the Pawnee Buttes (picture Dances with Wolves movie), a huge wind power plant ruins the view. <br>I definitely want the cleanest, most pristine environment that is practical to obtain. Anyone who knows me knows how much I love the mountains, forests, open spaces, and wilderness areas. I cringe at the site of Denver&#39;s &quot;brown cloud&quot; when I look east toward the horizon while hiking in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. I&#39;m not an advocate for shutting down the country, but during the big shutdown for the pandemic, the brown cloud was gone. I had never seen the sky around Denver so clear. I also enjoyed hiking without hearing commercial planes flying overhead. <br>My bottom line is that we should use every clean source of energy to have plenty of redundancy so we don&#39;t have blackouts where people freeze to death or die of heat exposure. Modern coal and natural gas fired power plants are clean and efficient. Every source of power has pros and cons. I also realize there could be advances in any power source that makes it more attractive and viable.

The trillions of $s thrown by governments to confound , not to aid, the scientific process have been documented (by numerous scientists) but muted (by governments). Central plans that involve renewable energy are nothing short of shortsighted. The EU right now faces an energy crisis exactly because of this brainless push for renewables at all costs (where \u201call costs\u201d means the decommissioning of nuclear and fossil fuel power plants). But the wind and sun aren\u2019t always available and energy becomes scarcer and more expensive. Moreover renewables have horrendous EROEI figures. EROEI is an acronym for \u201cenergy returned on energy invested\u201d and for renewables that is 1 unit of energy invested to get back 4 units. That\u2019s just terrible! To give you a perspective a natural gas plant has an EROEI figure of 30 (!!) - 1 energy unit invested returns 30 units! Nuclear plants are even higher at 100. So renewables are wasting energy to be built, they have intermittent power producing properties and need to be backed by conventional power plants that are most polluting when they work intermittently themselves. A lignite power plant emits the most when in the warm-up phase not during its normal operation. With renewables not producing energy, literally half of the day, lignite plants ned to be cycled on and off and that\u2019s exactly what you DON\u2019T want to do with them. This is how Germany, the most aggressive country for the push of renewables, with 40% penetration, has managed to \u2026worsen its air by adhering to solar and wind!

YOU are lying to the people who watch this channel, pretending you know something about science. I work in the power industry and know far too well that it doesn&#39;t work like that. First of all, ever heard of balancing? It is a whole science on its own which, unfortunately, doesn&#39;t favor renewable energy. Because you can&#39;t regulate how much energy is produced by a wind power plant, or solar, or water turbine, or just about anything that is renewable. You have to balance it with other sources which can be regulated. Germany is in fact making a lot of problems with its renewable policies because its power grid is hard to regulate, so they have to import and they also cause frequent outages inside the country and in the borderland regions. IoT is the answer to total regulation, perhpas, but not to switching to green energy. And even so, it will never work 100%. There need to be backup solutions as well. Why do you think we have three types of balancing energy reserves? You should do your homework.<br><br>Another thing is that even the so-called renewable solutions create waste. A lot of waste, in fact, and that waste is not very well recyclable. You mentioned Texas. Well, do you know the material from which those blades on the wind power plants are made? Do you know how long it lasts until it needs to be replaced? And do you know how much of it gets recycled?<br>The same goes for solar - you should do a calculation of how much oil and plastic goes into making a single solar panel vs. how much green energy it makes until, again, it creates that problematic waste.<br><br>Giving special taxes to the rich just because they&#39;re rich is also seriously sick (the fact that they don&#39;t pay is kinda pointing to a flaw in the system, but not because they&#39;re rich, but because the system obviously doesn&#39;t have limits on tax optimization, which is, frankly, not their fault and it should be addressed differently).<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, but I really dislike when people spread false information, claiming it is science.

I think these guys incorrectly tossed nuclear into the 3rd revolution because they know wind and solar alone are untenable. <br><br>Solar and wind are renewable in name only. Fact is, both require the use of resources in finite supply. Acquiring those resources is often devastating for the environment. Disposing of those resources after they&#39;re spent is equally if not more so (yes, solar cells and wind turbines have a limited lifespan). <br><br>Solar and wind are not reliable. Until we develop the battery technology to store energy en masse, e.g. enough to power half of CA for a week, solar and wind are nonstarters. It&#39;s crazy that we&#39;d start to dismantle a system of power generation that works well to replace it with one we know is riddled with functionality issues, and all in the name of the environment which we&#39;re just destroying in new ways.", "comment_date": "2021-11-09T20:19:09Z", "likes_count": 23}, {"comment_by": "aozgolo", "comment_text": "Rule #1: Don&#39;t take any advice about clean energy from those who omit discussing Nuclear.", "comment_date": "2021-11-09T18:24:13Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "William Wood", "comment_text": "What happens when you tax the rich and then run ouy 9f money \ud83d\udcb0 \ud83e\udd11.

But 70% is just robbing (although it was just an example), as if it is too high, theres incentive for the company to move factories, headquarter and other operations outside of the country, which leads to less jobs and less cash flow in the domestic economy. The growth of a giant multinational corporation helps the parent nation not only economically through more jobs and cashflow but also through improving image of the nation, (think of made in china vs made in germany, due to image, regardless of the quality of the product, made in germany gives more trust in the product) which is a massive economical benefit. Yes, there is embezzlement, corruption, under the table deals that anger the public but the reality is that these entities (corporations) often bring more benefit than harm as a whole to the economy of the nation in the long run.

Nuclear no one wants to live next to, wind farms kill birds, and solar and wind requires batteries to be viable, as well as heat from solar panels killing insects and even bird from heat.

Can somebody &quot;debunk&quot; it thoroughly PLEASE! I&#39;m seek&amp;tired having to time and again throw obvious numbers and logic for every lie or exaggeration I hear in such &quot;green&quot; agitprops.<br>The maximum ground level solar insolation power, zenith sun + no clouds, is just right around 1kW/m^2. Photovoltaic panels extract usually less than 20% of that. Also, medium annual efficiency of photovoltaic energy extraction is no more than 15%! Production of photovoltaic panels costs terrible amounts of energy, rare earth minerals and other mined resources. Production of windmills not much less, including lots of high-grade, non-decomposing coating materials. Medium annual efficiency of wind energy extraction is less than 20%. Both sunlight and wind energy require CONSTANT backup and adjustment by gas turbine plants, to be of any use for any power grid!<br>These facts AREN&#39;T sponsored by fossil fuel barons, you morons! - they&#39;re just facts!<br>You give a price for a photovoltaic panel(s?) (which panels?, what size?, what tech?), but no example of any kind of fossil energy tech equivalent. Instead you say, that fossil fuel energies &quot;reached their peak efficiency&quot;. Energies have no efficiency! - a fuel can be USED with certain efficiency. What has price of a panel to do with an efficiency of fuel usage??<br>Then you say that engineers and scientists agree, that fossil fuels matured - yeeah! we know that song ... which engineers? BTW, &quot;matured&quot; actually means GOOD! It means that a tech approaches optimal or maximal development and efficiency. E.g. diesel engines have on average just about 50% efficiency, and one late US invention of a small engine reaches 55% ! Gas turbines crossed 60% mark just recently! So, before you state, that fossils are OLD (sure, at least 300 mln. years since the end of Carboniferous) and write that wind &amp; solar are &quot;more efficient&quot; (while verbally adding &quot;become each year&quot;) , maybe wait &#39;till they actually catch up, OK?<br>And then THE BEST - you accuse fossil fuel companies of &quot;sponsoring&quot; fossil fuels (?!) and also of being subsidized, but you simply get along conveying, that Germany alone is going to spend $40 bln. in &quot;coal cities&quot; (only?) to retire fossil fuels!!<br>WTF MAN ?!!<br>This real sponsoring is actually robbing us through taxation and energy prices. Fossil companies at least produce something by their own and with own tech. Where do you see the economical gain or even balance here? Where&#39;s the money coming from originally - PRINTING? IMF? SDRs?<br>Why efficiency going up and tech price going down cause energy prices skyrocketing? Wouldn&#39;t you actually expect something completely opposite??<br>Apparent prices of car accus and solar installations go down, JUST BECAUSE they are subsidized! If you tried solar home installation outside a gov program, it would be a certain total loss!<br>You don&#39;t mention that gov subsidizing of fossils is actually going to fuel resellers, to stimulate prices and economy (I&#39;m not a fan), and you also don&#39;t mention the enormous excise taxation (not a fan either), which is a big part of fuel prices. Which means, we&#39;re paying for it TWICE: we buy the fuel and the subsidy, and that subsidizing is just a socialist stimulation technique - who&#39;d guess?\r<br>And of course that genial social program - &quot;retrain workers and keep local economy strong&quot;.

How do we keep these changes simple enough for them to actually work? For instance California has a large wealthy taxable population, but many are fleeing to avoid the idea of a wealth tax.

I have little faith in some lawmakers who have made claims but have no life experiences that would make them truly amenable to the promises they have made.

Our grid is not set up to handle such a huge influx of renewables yet.  The grid was set up in the past to accommodate large generation sources (coal plants, natural gas plants, etc.) producing on the order of 600 to over 1000 MWs of power in few specific locations.  New wind and solar farms have a lot more land requirements, and therefore are usually limited in capacity to 300-500 MW (a 200 MW solar farm is considered a LARGE solar farm - probably requiring about 1000-1200 acres of land).  This means that a lot more solar and wind farms will will need to be built in different, distributed regions of the country to more efficiently deliver the power they produce to the end users. <br><br>The problem is that oftentimes these new solar and wind projects get placed in regions where the grid was not set up to adequately handle this additional generation capacity.  Adding 200 MW to the grid is no joke, it can require tens of millions of dollars in transmission line and substation upgrades.  Usually solar/wind project developers end up paying these costs to upgrade the transmission system when they apply to interconnect their new solar/wind farm. <br><br>I think a more probable solution is to have some federal authority/regulatory body take ownership of the national grid and regulate some of the processes related to generation, system planning, and network upgrades so they are at the same standard across the country.  The federal government should really be the one paying these network and substation upgrade costs when new solar and wind projects are interconnecting to the grid.

Natural gas prices, too, are going through the roof, and energy demand seems to outpace supply in every country and in every form of energy.

Companies had no problem with that because they could still burn just as much coal and make the same or better (due to not having to pay as many workers) profits.

Singapore even spends a higher percentage of its GDP on defense than America and can still pull this off, easy. Many people are confusing welfare state benefits with &quot;socialism&quot;, which are not the same thing. Socialism has to do with the socialized ownership of the means and resources of production, whereas capitalist welfare states rely on capitalist modes of ownership and production, with socialized welfare benefits subsidized through tax revenue. Totally different paradigms. Heck, even the Scandinavian welfare states are not only completely capitalist, they actually get higher rankings every year in their accommodation of entrepreneurship than does America. Ultimately where welfare capitalists and democratic socialists get things wrong is in their ignorance of what economist and money manager Nathan Lewis calls &quot;the Magic Formula&quot;, namely: Low Taxes and Stable Money. Throughout history and up to our present hour and minute, the societies that achieved the greatest economic gains and including healthy government revenues for ample social spending were those that adhere closest to this Magic Formula.<br><br>PS: even a Libertarian luminary such as Ron Paul has gone on record making peace with the idea of the welfare capitalist state, in his case on condition that the US cease its overseas imperial adventures. That&#39;s a fair bargain in my opinion.<br><br>PPS: one reason why recent US tax cuts haven&#39;t benefited lower earners to the same extent as high earners is because of the US oligopolistic system and monetary chicanery. Inflation and loss of spending power of the dollar cause &quot;tax bracket creep&quot;, where nominal incomes rise towards higher marginal tax brackets, but real spending power is declining or stagnant. Then, on top of that, many of the tax benefits are only able to be exploited by those having armies of tax accountants and attorneys using obscure loopholes and deductions (i.e. instead of cuts being easily accessible to tax payers across the board, including low earners, either through lowering marginal rates or significantly raising the brackets where higher rates apply). Finally, some tax benefits only apply to corporations and not individuals. For example US nationals and residents are taxed on global income in the year on which it is earned, with tax due being payable that same year. But corporations can defer tax on global income indefinitely, and only need to pay the tax due in the year that the income is repatriated to the US. Since corporations don&#39;t have a natural human lifespan and can last for generations, this effectively means that they can defer paying US tax on extra-territorial income practically forever if they so choose. This is a loophole in the law that is easily fixed, and doesn&#39;t require a high marginal tax rate to generate enormous tax revenue while still preserving a &quot;business-friendly&quot; tax environment (the low rate would be enough in itself to accomplish both goals).", "comment_date": "2021-08-28T09:09:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "samy701", "comment_text": "Electric cars are a huge scam.

This video wonders around never getting serious.  It uses a common, but obsolete term such as green energy.  Pollution in the form of water pollution has been responsible for killing plants, which are green, in the past.  A lot of water pollution came from air pollution that would be washed into the rivers form rain.  Acid rain from high sulfur coal burning was found to be responsible for killing much of the life in some lakes.  Atmospheric CO2 is not in that category.<br><br> The fossil record indicates that during high levels of atmospheric CO2, as much as ten times todays atmospheric CO2 levels, there was likely higher levels of green plants around the world than today.  Stating something is green when it it only reduces CO2 is not green.  How plant growth in the oceans was effected is not addressed, but since a great deal atmospheric oxygen is produced from plant life in the oceans converting CO2 to oxygen and there are not signs of lower atmospheric oxygen, plant life in the oceans was likely different from today, but thriving.<br><br>Just because there is a large percentage of electrical power being produced by wind and solar doesn&#39;t mean these sources of electricity are eliminating the use of fossil fuel plants.  In order to give base load electricity those sources of electricity are backed up typically with natural gas fired peaking plants.  Since electrical demand has to be instant these peaking plants have to running even when they are not contributing electricity to the grid.  They are burning fossil fuel even though they are providing no electricity. \u00a0The cost of solar and wind power is frequently stated as if a KW from these is same is the same as a KW produced as a base load plant and they are not.  The cost of electrical power is dependent on the need to be able to produce electrical power immediately.  When the real cost per year of solar and wind is calculated it is not competitive with fossil fuel plants.  <br><br>Having to provide base load electrical demand from wind and solar is not possible without peaking plants or more recently the use of grid power storage batteries.  Clean electrical energy means it is a smooth and constant voltage source which wind and photovoltaic panels can&#39;t provide by themselves.  The use of expensive storage batteries for profitableBeyondcompetitivebiggerelectrical power storage batteries is that there can be little to no useful sunlight for weeks on end due to the smoke from forest fires and other photovoltaic panels disturbances.  These may only happen once in a generation, but base load electrical power needs to be able to provide electrical power during these periods.<br><br><br>The chart showing a large leveling off of CO2 emissions stating this is due to renewables is wrong.  It was the switch from coal to natural gas for electric power generation.  In the USA during that period natural gas became cost competitive with older coal fired fuel plants around the mid 2000s for combined cycle gas turbine electric steam turbine electric plants.  Even though the cost per energy unit was more for natural gas than coal, because the gas plants had efficiencies approaching 50% compared to older coal plants of around 25% they became basically same cost to run, but natural gas plants are much cheaper and faster to build. \u00a0<br><br>Then around 2010 natural gas got even cheaper.  Only the most efficient coal plants were cheaper to run than gas turbine combined cycle plants.  In 2016 or so natural gas had gotten so cheap it can be cheaper to use it instead of coal for creating steam for retrofitted older coal plants.  Only the most compared<br><br>efficiency low emissions coal plants.  They can also be placed in the middle of cities where the electrical demand is. .  They require much less cooling water for their steam cycle than traditional coal fired plants because the majority of the power comes from the gas turbine.  This drastically reduces the foot print of the plant without the need for large cooling towers.  This makes them very attractive as long as natural gas cost remains low.  By 2030 conditions may have changed where natural gas is no longer so cheap and due to its versatility in allowing combined cycle gas turbine plants near the center of electrical load there is no way to convert the electoral grid over to lower cost fuels.  One source of electrical power that does address both emissions and base load requirements is nuclear electric power.  It is currently not cost competitive with natural gas to build nuclear power plants and if they were built one of the new ideas such as thorium salt fission has claims of a much safer form of failsafe shutdown due to cooling system failure than the current nuclear electric power plants and less toxic nuclear waist.  <br><br>Taxing the rich:  Yes we need money to run are governments and services; however, private investors are more efficient at creating wealth.   If the money is taken from the rich that means the way it was being used before is now starved.  Doing this change suddenly would likely lead to whole industries going bankrupted.  <br><br>Income tax of corporations:  The primary tax on individuals is income tax and some capital gains (most stock investments).

Solar panels are not recyclable and are made with actual toxic materials, which means the disposal of defective solar panels will destroy the environment somewhere. The proposed solar farms also destroy ecosystems with the shear size of these installations. When we have a way to recycle solar panels, the best place for solar farms are on the roof tops of every building not in a field. Atleast with wind, you can still use the land surrounding the wind turbines but come with their own unrecyclable dilemma. Their massive blade made of fiberglass. Wind turbines have a severe negative impact on migratory birds as well. The true solution for wind is to only erect wind farms in agricultural land away from migration routes. We also have to invest in possible turbine refurbishment rather than just repair or replace. Another thing we can do to help the problem at hand is reduce our energy demand. We have been steadily increasing our energy demand over the years, our global connections is a big reason for that. With every antenna that goes up there is also  an increase of energy need to make the antenna operational. Most see this as progress, I see it as an ever growing problem. How come we don&#39;t see a statistic for the energy required to stay globally connected at our current rate?? I bet that figure would be astronomical.<br><br>I also agree that our tax system needs to change, but not the way you do. If you impart a 70% tax on the rich like you said in theory it would work but there is on problem, nothing is keeping them here to pay that 70% tax bill. If I was making $10million I would just take a portion of the $7million I would be paying in tax and move to a place like Dubai. The best course of action is to make a flat tax rate like 20% that everyone and every corporation pays with a standard deduction system for your families.

We drill a hole about 20m below the surface and feed water into the tower. The water falls down a pipe for about 200m where it powers a turbine that is connected to an electricity generator. We collect the water and drop it down a pipe for another 200m to another turbine. We do this twice more until we are getting electricity from four generators.<br>We then drop the water another 200m to power a turbine which drives a cog that is geared to turn a disc at the base of the tower. The waste water from the last turbine starts to collect at the bottom of the tower creating a shallow reservoir that we need to pump out.<br>The rotating disc at the base of the tower has cams along its edge. These cams are used to push pistons outwards. These pistons are in cylinders built into the wall in a circular formation. The cylinders are sealed at the interior side apart from where a piston rod enters to push the piston outward. The outside of the piston head is exposed to the deep sea water. <br>The cam will push the piston outward against the high pressure deep sea water. An inlet pipe will take water from our shallow reservoir which will be pulled into the space created in the cylinder, behind the piston head. When the cam releases the piston, the low pressure water inside the cylinder will be the only thing pushing the piston out against the high pressure deep sea water.<br>This is when the system acts as a ram pump.<br>The piston will be forced inward and will force the low pressure water back out through the inlet pipe toward the reservoir. The inlet pipe will now act the same as a waste pipe in a ram pump and the flowing water will shut a waste valve. The remaining water in the cylinder will be forced through a check valve into a pipe and upwards to the surface.<br>The larger the diameter of the tower, the more cylinders that can be built into the wall at the base of the tower.<br>I realise that the ram pump cylinder will pump more of its water back into the reservoir than it sends to the surface but we can always add more cylinders to the system. We can even put another layer of cylinders above the original ones as ram pumps still work underneath shallow water.<br>I think we should be able to pump water upwards at the same rate that it falls into the bottom of the tower and so keep the reservoir nice and shallow.<br>Now, if I understand the maths correctly, we might only be able to pump the water near to the surface. In that case, we can pump the water into a reservoir tank (inside the tower) and use the electricity generated by the first turbine to pump out the tank.<br>This will leave us with 3 generators worth of electricity for every tower built.<br>Would this work?

Yes, it&#39;s true.  Solar panels have a reflective index around .02 to .04, about the same as water or black asphalt.  That means that only 2 to 4% of the sunlight that falls on them is reflected back into space, and thus lost to the earth&#39;s energy accumulation from the sun.  The rest is either converted directly to heat, or electricity that will be converted to heat when it is used.  So, if a solar panel is placed on a surface that has a reflective index greater than .04, it is warming the earth more than the original surface.  According to Berkeley Laboratories, the average roof in LA has .17 reflectance.  Concrete ranges from .35 to .50.  All those people with solar panels on their roof in LA are actually heating the earth, and contributing to the urban heat island effect.  Contrast that with a reflective roof coating that has a reflective index of between .8 and .9.  If the area that was covered with a solar panel is instead coated with such a reflective coat, it will decrease the solar heat accumulation by over 70%.<br>Now that&#39;s green, unlike solar panels.", "comment_date": "2021-07-13T20:17:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chapter 4 Travels", "comment_text": "&quot;Oil companies lied to you about nuclear energy and it&#39;s time to fix it!&quot; There, I fixed it for you.", "comment_date": "2021-07-13T18:20:28Z", "likes_count": 216}, {"comment_by": "Adam Bud\u00edn", "comment_text": "more people need to see this asap", "comment_date": "2021-07-13T15:47:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fanamatakecick", "comment_text": "Nuclear energy isn\u2019t a thing?

If we pass bills for the rich to pay more, this bill would be very intricate and with thousand ways to breach. So the rich will just hire more accountants and lawyers, and still pay less taxes. Therefore, I think the first step is to remove the breaches and equalize the system. If I pay 25% taxes, so the richest also pay 25%, no matter how many accountants they can hire.

But besides of the subvention by tax money paying for installations also the price for energy increased dramatically, since the mix of private produced solar energy makes managing the grid more expensive and everyone who uses energy pays for that as well as for the subvention of installing solar panels in the first place. So everything has become much more expensive on behalf of everyone, but the percentage of energy produced increase only by a tiny amount in fact. This is why politicians over here in Germany now try to focus more on wind turbines. But there is sadly also an issue with that, since building them is also very expensive, tax payers pay for the energy they produce extra and tax on that &#39;extra&#39; (both by law for both wind and solar). At the same time we import more energy than ever before, since wind and solar can not produce the increasing demand caused by mass expansion of &#39;internet of things&#39;, electro-mobility and the growth in mobil energy for computing devices like even ever more mobile phones, tablets and so on.

Yes, in the past there have been &quot;taxes&quot; for the rich of even 90+%, and the left now uses that as a reason to say &quot;you see, it works&quot;. What they conveniently forget is, that there were SO many loopholes and exemptions in it, that the vast majority of rich people didn&#39;t actually need to pay it. In reality, they payed between 18-25\u00a8%, what, historically, is about the same as they always ever paid during the whole history of the USA.<br><br>As president Hollande has proven with his &quot;tax for the superrich&quot;; if you close everything off completely and make it so they really <b>have</b> to pay for 70% (let alone 90%), they DO simply move - to another state, or another country. And understandably so. I mean; who wouldn&#39;t? The only reason snowflake hipsters like the guy in the vid think it&#39;s ok for people &quot;earning 10 million or more&quot; is because he himself isn&#39;t in that bracket. I mean, think about it: is there any <b>objective</b> reason to put a cap on that specific amount? Why not, say, lower it to the amount these rich hipsters are dwelling in, say the 40000-100000 bracket, and let THEM also pay a 70% tax? Let&#39;s say everything above 25000 gets taxed that way; wouldn&#39;t that be even more fair to the poor, and give even far more money to the daddy-state? And  equalize more, reduce the economic inequality more, and make the gap and wealth disparity even far less than with their proposal?<br><br>So...why aren&#39;t they advocating that? Why don&#39;t THEY pay up 70% of it?<br><br>The reason is very simple: they don&#39;t want to. Just like people richer don&#39;t want to, and we don&#39;t want to.<br><br>All this self-righteous talk about making the rich pay were more convincing if the people claiming and promoting it would actually do it with their own. But they don&#39;t. And hey, fair enough if you don&#39;t want to - but quit being a hypocrite about it, then. Don&#39;t look at millionaires to pay more taxes or charity; if you&#39;re such a strong believer in it, start paying 70% on your OWN money. But just like Bernie Sanders and many others of the left who <b>advocate</b> these things, they don&#39;t do it themselves; they only pay lipservice. That&#39;s why this self-proclaimed leftist who wants &quot;redistribution of wealth&quot; somehow has 3 houses and 2,5 million dollars, and yet doesn&#39;t feel inclined to distribute THAT wealth. Yet, it would seem he doesn&#39;t see his own hypocrisy? So, what&#39;s keeping him from distributing his own wealth, if he feels so strongly about it? Let me guess: he doesn&#39;t feel like he&#39;s rich enough to have to do it?<br><br>And so it goes with all leftist bloaters: it&#39;s always &quot;the one that is richer than themselves&quot; that need to pay extra taxes, not <b>they</b> themselves. You can live on 25000 dollars a year; many people do so and thus prove it, so why not pay 70% on everything that&#39;s above THAT? Why wait on others? If one is so convinced about it, why don&#39;t you start paying more taxes or charity at a 70% rate on your OWN money? No-one is keeping you from doing exactly that already now, does one?<br><br>I&#39;m so f- tired of this BS.", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T12:39:29Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "anton brum", "comment_text": "So, is renewable energy the way to go?

For one thing, in 2018 the top 10% of earners in the US ie the richest 10%, paid 71% of all income tax. Is that a fair share? As for big companies like Amazon, what they actually pay in Federal income taxes is a lot more complicated than simply saying 0%. A company as big as Amazon follows the income tax laws that have been on the books for years. Seriously Google it, let me know if you understand it. Between State Taxes, Payroll Taxes and the Sales Tax that they collect they pay or collect for the government in sales taxes a few Billions. The current corporate tax rate in the US rose to 28% under Biden from 21% under Trump. All in all Amazons income tax rate after whatever (legal) reductions they took advantage of was 1.3% which is pretty low to say the least. But not 0%. Anyway, I just get annoyed by misinformation. As for the ridiculous tax rate of the 1950\u2019s being like 90% for the top earners I still have to research that but I have a feeling that to implement the same thing in today\u2019s economy would not have the same effect of huge growth since the world was a totally different place then. For one thing the US was pretty much the biggest in terms of industry since we weren\u2019t bombed to hell during WW2 unlike nearly every other industrialized country. How do we stay competitive with say China when we tax our industry at 90%? Maybe we can, I\u2019d like to know how that would work. <br><br>Finally the point of tax incentives in the tax law is to increase growth and innovation. So, we want to stimulate the growth of Green Energy, will we be taxing those industries at 1950\u2019s rates too? Why not, what\u2019s good for Exxon and Amazon ought to be good for Green Tech too right? How are they supposed to grow at the rate that will reach our goals for America\u2019s energy future if we don\u2019t offer tax incentives that will effectively lower their income tax rates? I\u2019m not saying that taxes are bad but there has to be a balance between what allows growth and what stymies innovation, or worse pushes companies to take their money elsewhere. That\u2019s what ruined the US industry in the first place and why it went to China. When it\u2019s more profitable to set up shop in Malaysia because US tax laws are too harsh, then, bye bye big industry. Big Corporations have to pay their Fair Share of taxes, the operative word being \u201cFair\u201d that\u2019s what is under debate.", "comment_date": "2021-06-05T01:44:02Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Glen E", "comment_text": "I couldn&#39;t make it to the end of this video.

Solar may be the future but before we can move fully focused on that direction we also need to think about the batteries, there is new technology coming in this and i feel batteries are a very old technology that needs just as much investment in development (if not more) than the solar technology.<br>If we can crack the storage issues waste and  have longer lasting renewables with no fossil fuels to produce then we may still be in with a chance to survive. Seems the technology is there but the biggest challenge is as always change.

You cannot control when you get the best supply (sunny or windy days) and Nuclear cannot scale up or back fast enough to compensate for higher or lower production times from the other two. You would need to essentially build large reservoirs to pump water up hill during high energy days and then release it over a turbine to recoup some percentage during low production days. This is economically infeasible for a host of reasons. And while the problem with energy shortages is apparent, the problem with more than needed is not always so obvious. Long story short, it damages the grid and is highly costly. The interesting thing is that energy demand usually peaks at night as people return home from work and begin to use their AC/Heat...while Solar is producing 0%. GG.  Lastly, please review Sweden and what happened with they taxed Volvo, IKEA and SAAB like this. They left. This is the same thing happening to big tech in California right now, as they move to Texas for the 0% income taxes. It&#39;s also really disingenuous to say they pay no taxes, as they do this by utilizing deductions that anyone can do -- and they still pay more in payroll taxes in one year than one can conceive conceptually. On an individual level, it will cost you about 9,000USD but you can forgo your American citizenship and move abroad. Switzerland will happily allow you to negotiate into the 15% tax range. Other Billionaires like Peter Schiff have already moved to Puerto Rico to maintain their citizenship while paying 0% Federal Income Taxes (USA Territories). <br><br>I&#39;m not in the industry myself; however, several family members are. They will happily tell you that energy companies want to supply you with cheap and reliable energy. They want your business and at a good profit margin. If these things were cheaper, more efficient and more profitable -- they wouldn&#39;t lie to you about it. They would change their business model. Oil and Natural Gas have had tumultuous gains and losses over the years - and energy companies would like to have a more stable priced item if they would. As far as the post tax benefits you discussed,. they are largely based on losses, which any business can do.<br><br>Lastly, Texas is something I am intimately familiar with. I live here obviously, hence the screen name. We build wind farms not because they are economically profitable but because they are politically profitable. We only get back about 85c for every $1 our citizens pay the Federal Government, so when Washington says &quot;we will give you more money for wind farms&quot; we say yes. And sure, they generate electricity - which we get keep because we have our own grid - but we have had to build a shit ton of Natural Gas power plants to ramp up during cloudy days or during less windy nights.

I mean come on, if you were to stand in some sunshine, nothing would happen other than maybe a little sunburn after multiple hours, but try and sit in a pile of burning coals inside a coal powered generator, you would die in seconds and burn to ashes. as you can tell, coal power is much more, well, powerful. and that is literally the point of making a power generator, you want it to be as powerful as possible, powerful-power, you understand right? anyway, the same stupid problem applies with wind farms, there is no way to make that many damn farms! it would take up all remaining space on the planet that we aren&#39;t directly living on, INCLUDING FORESTS, which really defeats the purpose of trying to make it &quot;green&quot;. listen, you wont have anything green left if you make that many farms, or even anywhere NEAR that many farms.<br>besides, HOW THE F*** DO YOU PLAN TO PUT SOLAR PANELS OR WIND FARMS ON THE OCEAN?

The real truth behind it all begins with a matter of physics, which has been twisted into a false truth. The complete explanation is very long, but to give a hint, (you can further research if you want to be true) there are only two places that we humans on earth can get its energy from, deep beneath the surface of the earth as heat, or radiation from the sun. ALL of our capability to extract energy in any form can only come from those two places. The energy in ANY petroleum, nuclear, or electric system starts there. Period. The reason that oil or gas can provide the necessary amount of energy to accomplish what it does in our entire world, no matter what,  is because it is energy which has been aggregated from MILLIONS of years of either internal heating from I.E. volcanic or chemical means, or the suns&#39; energy that is ( basically) supplied by photosynthesis and decay matter and stored as energy. Shining the sun on one square meter, or whatever unit you want to pick, per (day or unit time) you want to pick, will never be able to compare to the energy density of (a gallon or whatever unit of petroleum fuel.) The only possible way of reaching a goal of getting rid of a petroleum based system would be to nearly stop almost any human activity.

These are mostly produced in China in factories that have no pollution control standards whatsoever, and are powered by coal-fired plants that have no carbon-scrubbers. So in effect, you are not any more green for having bought so-called green power technology from a country that hides how much dirty energy they had to use to create it to sell it to you.<br>2. They&#39;re not green in operation. Due to their extremely low energy density (meaning ratio of land necessary to operate them compared to amount of energy produced), they require hundreds of acres in large farms to produce electricity. This is not eco-friendly to local wildlife, forests, or prairies that have to be cleared away to make room for them. Likewise birds have been hit by turbine blades and roasted out of the sky by mirrors that collect sunlight to focus it on solar cells in a central tower, and neither of these technologies discriminate in favor of endangered birds.<br>3. They tend to fail when they are most needed. During winter storms, the sun doesn&#39;t shine, and the turbines often either freeze or break down due to frost damage.

To quote Joe Biden: &quot;C&#39;mon, man!&quot; The super rich will simply move to another country that gives them tax breaks and those countries will welcome them with open arms, in fact other countries may well deliberately adjust their tax rates to attract the rich to their borders. It may well have been that in the 50s and 60s the rich were willing to tolerate that kind of a tax structure but Europe and Britain were still in shambles after WWII, Australia was a poor country.

Let us go through the numbers. Many French reactors have a power level higher like 1.6Gw = 1600 mega watts. We\u2019ll use 1Gw = 1000Mw to keep our arithmetic easy. <br>A 1 Gw nuclear Plant has a capacity factor or 95% some are higher some lower.<br>Wind Power has a capacity factor of 33% this can very as low as 25% or a bit higher.<br>For the layperson this may not seem so important so please bear with me. Because we wish to replace a nuclear plant with a wind farm<br>To build a wind farm you will need 1Gw/ 33% = 3Gw of power because of the capacity factor. The wind blows 33% of the time. That means 3Gw of power is needed to be produced power so to replace 1Gw of Nuclear. How this is done is wind supplied 1Gw of power to the grid while the remaining 2Gw of power goes to storage. So lets say we have very very predictable power where every third day the wind is blowing and at sufficient speed &gt;20km/hr. So Monday it blows Tuesday and Wednesday the wind doesn\u2019t blow. So on the Monday 1Gw goes to the grid 2Gw goes to storage to be used on Tuesday and Wednesday. Then by some miracle the wind blows on Thursday and the cycle continues\u2026 For EVER. If there is no wind power on the third day your out of luck. Now let\u2019s calculate the size of the battery. Energy is power times a unit of time.<br>1 Joule of energy = 1 watt for one second. Therefore 2,000,000,000 watts (2Gw) needed to be stored in one day or 24x60x60 seconds= 86\u2019400 seconds. So the storage that\u2019s needed is 2,000,000,000x 86,400= <br>172,800Gj of energy storage. But the kicker here is assuming 100% storage capacity efficiency. Now let\u2019s calculate the cost of 3Gw Wind plus 172,800GJ of energy storage. <br>Wind\u2019s cost is about $1000 per Kw or $1 per watt (a low value). So 3Gw of wind will be $3 billion.<br>Batteries are about $500 / Kwh or (1Kwh = 1000w/K\u00d760 min/hr x60 sec/min)<br>So that\u2019s $500 / 3.6 million joules. Or .0001388889 $/J<br>Therefore 172,800 Gj x .00013888$/J= $24 billion <br>So that\u2019s 24 plus 3 = $27 billion to replace 1 nuclear plant. So the cost of storage is the kicker.<br>But for how long?? A nuclear plant can go for 40 to 60 years.<br>For a wind farm its life could be 20years. So look to spend 3 $billion times 60/20  (or  $9 billion) to cover replacement over 60 years. For batteries lithium ion type they can take 300 to 500 charges. For calculation lets use the generous 500 charges. If the batteries will be charged once every 3 days that\u2019s 1500 days of life.<br>1500/365=  4.2 years Therefore over 60 years the replacement is 60/4.2= 14 times<br>So the total cost over 60 years is $24 billion x 14 for batteries plus $9 billion for wind turbines equaling a grand total over 60 years to be 24\u00d714+9=<br><br> $345 billion. Over 60 years.<br><br>A cost that is not calculated is not just the cost per Kwhr or replacement costs over 60 years. <br>But the cost of a power failer.<br>The cost of a power failer is extremely difficult to calculate. A good example is that of a bakery or other industries that are highly dependent on reliable power. Bread that does not rise or a process that\u2019s time dependent like the refrigeration of food or vaccines. A patient on an operating table. A person stuck in an elevator etc etc. <br>Now do the same for solar but it has a capacity factor of 20% less in Germany.<br>1/20% =5Gw  etc etc. Create your own spread sheet and adjust some numbers if you like.<br>For nuclear it is 95% Do the math for it as well. You will need 0.05Gw of storage but this could be made up with natural gas. A lot of nuclear power plants have 2 reactors.  Darlington 4 Pickering 8. As you can see by the back of napkine calculation it\u2019s the cost of storage. There is a line in the PDF that your can down load from <a href=\"http://www.roadmaptonowhere.com/\">www.roadmaptonowhere.com</a> that I will always remember.<br><br> \u201cFuel is Storage\u201d Wind and Solar are fuel free systems. <br><br>But lets look on the bright side Elon Musk can sell us the battery storage for 172,800 Billion Joules of energy at 100% efficiency. Wow time to buy Tesla stock. The largest battery installed by Tesla is in Australia at 129Mwhr that is only 464.4 GJ.

So, money is a represent of people that help you and give you things, so you have money you can build a house, or you have people but no money the people can build a house for you. So, people is more primary than money. So, a grace period phase when you have money until it is all set up, so you are working and earn the money but during grace period phase you have no money or no job, but you were in a job that was coal and other stuff, but the reason is negative which is not your fault but others but can go to another job that is non-coal or anything for free since the other part is old fashion and the new part is new fashion so can give you money for basic things but other things is extra on your part, so thru training or anything, until it is all set up then you work for money and earn it. The basic things and extra to satisfy you. <br><br>So, there is no problem with transfer to new job like children has no problem to transfer to new school since it is free. So, I guess they hold themselves to coal job because there is no information to let them know it is free and you will be comfortable in basic way that is necessary but any exceed is your extra.

The government jumped in and gave tax breaks, etc. for just about anything with the word &quot;solar&quot; in it. The upshot was a lot of junk. I still occasionally see houses with non-functional tracking solar arrays on their roofs, arrays dating from that dismal experiment. And then there are those &quot;walk in solar collectors&quot; that people tacked onto their houses. They generally didn&#39;t even make decent &quot;sun rooms.&quot; We still have some residual silliness in the form of the &quot;energy star&quot; rebates. Others have taken on the absurdities of that program (just about anything can virtually automatically get the rating with little actual effort to substantiate claims. That star seems to be more of a &quot;participation trophy&quot;), so I only mention it here. The bad actors are still popping up. A retired neighbor made a major investment in solar a few years ago. Three years later she had to have all the panels replaced at her cost. The system had already failed and the supplier had magically shed any responsibility by exploiting incorporation laws.<br><br>Upshot:<br>1. I like the concept of &quot;alternatives.&quot;<br><br>2. Having the government magically create money to fund alternative energy is a major mistake. The charlatans will pillage, the people are  fleeced, and the energy goals are not truly met.  Don&#39;t believe me about pillaging charlatans? just look at what is happening with Covid-19 aid: The enhanced unemployment payment fraud, the PPP fraud, etc. Nearsighted greed is always ready and able to exploit anything that sounds worthy. Plan for it.<br><br>3.  If alternative energy solutions are going to work, they must be economically viable. Do not push money at alternative energy products. Instead, make alternative energy products that attract money. They must stand on their own economic feet. This requirement will weed out most of the junk.<br><br>4. Want government intervention? How about fixing things like incorporation laws to prevent repeated &quot;duck and run&quot; tactics. If the provider knows they cannot duck responsibility they might be more careful about providing robust, reliable products. And while the legislators are at it, please plug the money transfer policies that allow moving profits (often in the name of &quot;business expense&quot;) to more favorably taxed entities.<br><br>5. Want more tax money? Well, the USA is so far in debt (on a per-capita basis) that there is no chance of paying it off. Asking for more government money amounts to &quot;add another shift for the printing presses&quot; and &quot;sell more bonds to foreign nations&quot; to further undermine our self-determination (Carl Marx was right: A capitalist will sell you the rope that will be used to hang him). As for &quot;tax the rich,&quot; your words betray your economic ignorance. They don&#39;t have money sitting around in bags waiting to be handed out. The majority of the money is working in investments.  I do agree that the tax situation is absurd. That is something that the government can and should fix (and probably will not, in fact, correct because of the impact it would have on all the one-percenters that would have to vote it into law). However, instead of the &quot;we&#39;re going to punish you for being rich&quot; taxes that you propose, I&#39;d be satisfied if the rich and the corporations honestly did pay at the same rate as the average middle class wage earner.

Do your research and stop believing these popular myths. <br><br><a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high/\">https://taxfoundation.org/taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high/</a><br><br>There is a common misconception that high-income Americans are not paying much in taxes compared to what they used to. Proponents of this view often point to the 1950s, when the top federal income tax rate was 91 percent\u00a0for most of the decade.[1]\u00a0However, despite these high marginal rates, the top 1 percent of taxpayers in the 1950s only paid about 42 percent of their income in taxes. As a result, the tax burden on high-income households today is only slightly lower than what these households faced in the 1950s.", "comment_date": "2021-01-16T18:10:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tnert Nesor", "comment_text": "History shows the \u201csuper rich\u201d will hide their money in tax havens.

Well maybe they can get like receipts or something or a certificate.

The question that I don&#39;t know the answer to that I think we need to ask ourselves is: Do Solar Panels help the environment more than they hurt it? Well, some of you might be thinking &quot;How do Solar Panels Hurt the Environment?&quot; Well like I already mentioned you have to clear out vast amounts of land to have solar panels which already hurts the environment. Then Solar Panels have that lifespan like I said which doesn&#39;t bode so well in landfills. You can replace dead Solar Panels with new ones which will reduce the impact that they have on the environment when clearing out the land, but then you have the fact that Solar Panels are just as bad as plastic when it comes to dissolving in the landfills that begs the question that I just mentioned: &quot;Do Solar Panels help the environment more than they hurt it?&quot; Again I don&#39;t know the answer to this. The same thing goes for Wind Turbines as well with the added on of killing birds, which I don&#39;t think is that much of a problem. I don&#39;t know the average lifespan of a Wind Turbine, but the average lifespan of Solar Panels is around 20 years.<br><br>Nuclear is probably the best way to go for clean and cheap energy. It&#39;s space-efficient when it comes to making energy and there&#39;s an element called Thorium which is a great substitute for Uranium. Thorium has a 0% chance for a meltdown. People have known about Thorium and it&#39;s properties since the conception of Nuclear Reactors. So why don&#39;t they use Thorium instead? Well, Thorium is a lot rarer than Uranium and you can get more Energy out of Uranium than Thorium. Also, at the time of people making Nuclear Reactors, there was another Nuclear invention that only used Uranium at the time, known as the Nuke. So using Uranium Nuclear Reactors not only could get more Energy, It was easier to find, and when mining to were knocking out 2 birds with one stone which was making Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Weapons. So the downsides of Thorium is that it is rarer so it&#39;s going to cost more money to acquire and it doesn&#39;t produce as much as Uranium does, but it will NEVER have a Nuclear Meltdown. Thorium will also make more energy per Square Foot than Solar or Wind.<br><br>I&#39;m just going to copy and paste this question I repeated several times in the first paragraph so that it&#39;s easier to read instead of it being hidden in a wall of text: &quot;Do Solar Panels help the environment more than they hurt it?&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T00:13:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TrueLoveGuard", "comment_text": "You know the politics in America is a farce.

In reality, not a single person back then paid anywhere near that much. Why? Those same decades were also the golden age of tax write-offs, a time when everything could be written off your taxes. So in actuality at the time, few people even paid 50% tax and absolutely no one at all paid more than that. In fact, it could actually be argued that the strength of the economy at the time was a direct result of the tax deductions, not the tax rates. At that time, the government gave huge incentives for wealthy to write off everything possible, from lavish dinners &amp; vacations &amp; flights to extra cars, boats, needless construction projects. Basically, if you could imagine something to write off your taxes, during that era, you could write it off. So companies &amp; wealthy individuals had a huge incentive to spend far more than they do today. And it worked. The point I\u2019m making is that there actually isn\u2019t a need to tax the rich at a higher rate. Rather, all we need to do is get them to spend more or get them to actually pay the taxes at their current levels.

For any problem which needs a policy response from the government (we can all agree than low-carbon green energy transition requires govt action), we NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY FOR THE POLICY WILL COME FROM. We need to consider where the govt is spending its current resources (is, whether it is unnecessarily subsidizing coal). We need to think of newer techniques to raise funds. YES, TAXATION IS NOT THE ONLY WAY. We can build financial instruments which attract private investments in solar or wind energy. But, talking about the financing aspect is very important. Because a lot of times the governments give excuses that a climate transition would low the economy and that we can&#39;t afford it. But when we explore the different options to fund the transition, we can actually understand whether it&#39;s economically feasible and whether it is worth it. And the type of government is important too. A government which doesn&#39;t follow science and tries to worsen the social disparities is anti-climate.

I just have a few questions/statements that weren&#39;t covered that I would like to point out.  <br><br>Let&#39;s start with energy storage. Though solar and wind are decent sources of power, they are terrible at storing energy. Example, you only get power from solar when the sun is shining, and turbines when the wind is blowing. (I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;d like to have power on calm nights). Batteries you say. Well, unfortunately, batters are pretty terrible storage devices compared to fossil fuels. For example, let&#39;s compare the energy density of one (1) gallon of gasoline (which weighs about 6.3 lb.) to Lithium Ion batteries (same technology as tesla batteries). After some quick googling, I found that one (1) gallon of gasoline can produce approximately 33kwh of electricity (this means that it can provide 33,000 watts of energy for 1 hour). 33kwh of energy in a little 6.3 pound package. Lets compare that to Lithium Ion batteries. A Li-Ion (short for Lithium ion) battery that contained the same 33kwh of energy would weigh an astonishing 291 pounds. <br><br>Lets put this example in a easier to comprehend package. The tesla model s has a 85kwh battery in it. This battery weighs an incredible 1,200 pounds. However, this is only equivalent to about 2.58 gallons of gasoline. This means that, 2.58 gallons of gas (weighing in at a mere 16.26 pounds) stores the same amount of energy as the 1,200 pound tesla battery. <br><br>Now. Let&#39;s talk about taxing the super rich. First off. Lets make a distinction between super rich people and super rich corporations. The video mainly talked about rich corporations so I&#39;ll talk about them here. Let&#39;s take a quick look at what is happening to New York and California (which are both heavily taxing big corporations). THE BIG CORPORATIONS ARE LEAVING!!!! Let me ask you a question. If you lived in a town where you, only, were taxed 90% of your income, but the next town over only charged you 30%, would you stay or leave? <br>Let&#39;s talk about the after affects of companies leaving for a bit. First off, they take all the jobs with them. This means that, not only are you getting more people depending on unemployment (which steals taxe payer dollars from renewables) but instead of getting the &quot;little&quot; tax money from those companies, you&#39;re now getting zero. <br>So, by heavily taxing the super rich, you are not only, not getting more tax money. You&#39;re gonna be losing a lot of your current tax revenue. <br><br>If you made it this far in my comment then I want to thank you for reading it. Please reply with your own thoughts and of/where you think I am wrong. Or if you have solutions to these problems I&#39;d love to hear them. <br><br>Thanks.", "comment_date": "2020-12-03T06:25:44Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Dakota Rose", "comment_text": "Hmm.

Government cannot magically overcome scientific and engineering limitations.

The rich do get most of their money from business income. But most business income is earned by pass-through entities like partnerships and LLCs, not by corporations, and most pass-through entity income accrues to the rich.<a href=\"https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/never-mind-1-percent-lets-talk-about-001-percent\">https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/never-mind-1-percent-lets-talk-about-001-percent</a>   <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/9-facts-about-pass-through-businesses/#fact4\">https://www.brookings.edu/research/9-facts-about-pass-through-businesses/#fact4</a> So looking at taxes paid by the richest corporations only gives you part of the story of how the rich pay or don&#39;t pay taxes. The American tax system is all ready more progressive than that of most other rich countries.  The U.S. levies an average effective corporate tax rate of 24%. The average rate is 20% (calcualted in excell from OECD data). So yes, we do tax our corporations. Just not the ones that you mentioned. We do tax the rich, just not by taxing the richest corporations, because taxes paid by the richest corporations are an ingredient in taxing corporations, and the rich, but not the only ingredient in either of those things. Progressive taxation tends to hurt economic growth generally.  <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2017/11/23/american-taxes-are-unusually-progressive-government-spending-is-not\">https://www.economist.com/united-states/2017/11/23/american-taxes-are-unusually-progressive-government-spending-is-not</a> <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CTS_ETR\">https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CTS_ETR</a> (average calculated in excel). <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/mena/competitiveness/41997578.pdf\">https://www.oecd.org/mena/competitiveness/41997578.pdf</a>. That period of strong growth you mentioned was after the rest of the world was destroyed in the 2nd world war. So they had to buy all new stuff from America. So your case for taxing the rich is not as strong as it sounds. <br>So then how do we pay for it? simple, &quot;We&quot; don&#39;t. The people who are causing the problem pay for it. 100 companies are responsible 71% of C02 emissions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change\">https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change</a><br>So we make them pay for it through carbon taxes. <br>tl;dr.

Speak to engineers and they will do the math for you. Let me also remind you guys that even if we stop CO2 emissions tomorrow, we WILL go over the +2\u00b0C sought by the Paris Agreement. If it was to be met, we would have to cumulatively decrease the global economy&#39;s GDP by 4% annually from 2020 onwards. And since our GDP is directly correlated with the machines we use, thus the fossil fuels we burn to make them function, we would need another economic crisis such as this one with COVID, every year (!) for the next 30 years (!!) to stay under the 2\u00b0C prescribed by Paris....

So easy to shut everything down and raise havoc.  And they gloss over the costs.  This silliness of taxing the &quot;super rich&quot; is a prime example.  If someone is taxed 70% of anything over a given amount, why would they even attempt to exceed that amount?  It destroys initiative.  As for the whining about corporations paying zero taxes, they are following tax laws that are available to all.  When you invest in research, you get to offset your taxes.  They do it and I&#39;ve done it.  YOU can do it too.  And guess what?  Research increases productivity!  Me, I&#39;m into biomass.  We can put unemployables to work in harvesting brush and forests that burn up periodically.  That saves lives and property because there is less to burn.  Naturally, we can&#39;t do &quot;clear cutting&quot; so we would employ biologists, engineers, managers, etc.  Why is this a GREAT idea?  Feature this:  During the recent wildfires (some that were from arson) here in California, people were screaming about the 2 million acres that were lost.  Uh-huh.  What about the wildfires in Chile recently?  They lost 14 million acres.  And then there were the Australian wildfires a couple of years ago.  That was about 46 million acres, as I remember.  Add that up and calculate the energy equivalent as gasoline, for example.  There was enough energy to power ALL of the vehicles on this planet for 73 days!  Think about THAT, you millenial freaks!  By the way, the energy released into the atmosphere raised the mean temperature by at least 3 thousandths of a degree.  Yes, eventually some radiated back into space.  But it also released MASSIVE amounts of CO2 which increases the Greenhouse effect.  While some radicals run around proclaiming that global warming is causing the fires and hurricanes, I wonder if the big fires cause enough localized warming to contribute to atmospheric imbalance and  hurricane severity.   Solar, hydro, wind and nuclear are ALL worthwhile participants in the energy race.  But biomass conversion will employ LOTS of marginal skill people, is renewable, will save money that now goes to fight massive wildfires and will allow hydrocarbons to be diverted to higher value products than just combustion.", "comment_date": "2020-11-07T17:20:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a\u0646\u0627", "comment_text": "Thsnks", "comment_date": "2020-11-07T11:53:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Watchman", "comment_text": "Carbon taxes are a total scam.", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T22:15:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Watchman", "comment_text": "Classic liberals want to tax the rich for everything......", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T22:14:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Juan Samper", "comment_text": "Why do you promote voting as the ONLY political engagement people can make?", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T11:22:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Willys-Wagon ", "comment_text": "Started off like any discussion on renewable, ended up being mostly pipe dreams based with no viable execution pathway.", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T00:22:27Z", "likes_count": 35}, {"comment_by": "Tony", "comment_text": "Yay telling people how to vote.", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T16:46:37Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "D Jaquith", "comment_text": "The difference between the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s and &quot;now&quot; is it&#39;s a Global Economy and the Super Wealthy will tell the US to F-Off and simply move their business to a different lower taxed country.", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T13:04:15Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "kalamata games", "comment_text": "you live in the stone age bitcoin farm need 70% additional power from grid the  problem is  biger  now", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T08:58:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leanflare", "comment_text": "This went from being an informative video about renewable energy to \u201crich people bad\u201d faster than the collapse of the Soviet Union.", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T00:34:27Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Vulgare20", "comment_text": "Or we just use thorium reactors.", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T00:34:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PhazonBlaxor", "comment_text": "Source for the claim that battery energy densities grow by &quot;5%-7%&quot; every year?

We could get way more money from taxing everyone and not only a small group of people, especially when these people are the most important to our country. The rich already pay high income taxes on their personal income. Their wealth is mostly in stocks, if they want to get some of that wealth they need to sell the stocks and pay a 20% capital gains tax. <br>Let&#39;s take Jeff Bezos for example:<br>His net worth is 202 billion but his annual salary is only 81,840(which he pays income and self employment tax on like everyone else). his wealth is in stocks, if he wants to spend it, he needs to sell some of the stocks. Whenever he sells these stocks he does it mainly for donations and for funding his space company, he also pays a 20% capital gains tax for the government when doing this. If we taxed his wealth and capital gains more, he wouldn&#39;t have the money to donate and invest in his space company. A 70% income tax above <br>10,000,000 won&#39;t do anything to him because his income is only 81,840 per year. It is true that amazon paid 0 corporate income taxes but corporate income taxes don&#39;t only hurt the owner of the company, it hurts the whole company. Even scandinavians know that which is why corporate taxes there are about the same as in the US(without all the tax loopholes though). Corporate taxes are taxes on companies, not on company owners. <br>It is true that taxes were high in the 1950&#39;s to 1960&#39;s but the rich weren&#39;t the ones paying those taxes. The top 1% in that time paid an average tax of only 42% which is not much higher than what they pay now. The main reason for that was extremely generous tax deductions. Another reason is that a lot of people just stopped paying taxes, illegally. <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high/\">https://taxfoundation.org/taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high/</a><br>The economy is not a zero sum game. Rich people are the ones who produce our wealth and make it that way. If we tax them, we will grow our economy less. <br>I believe that there should be low corporate taxes, low taxes for investors(the lower tax on investors the more we can tax them, do the math), low taxes on rental income and less tax deductions and loopholes.<br>The income tax should be 40% above $50000. People who have a business and get income from another source and not their own business will pay less tax on that income( that will encourage people to start businesses). I also believe in ending social security and forcing business owners to save money for their worker&#39;s retirement (the money the businesses save for their employees will not be taxed). My plan would not only bring us enough money for college school and healthcare vouchers but will also speed economic growth. Countries make most of their money from income taxes which is why raising income taxes and making them more flat will bring in more money.<br><br>I believe in taxing the money that the rich spend on themselves (normal income) but I don&#39;t believe in taxing the companies or real estate that the rich own because they need that money to invest it back.", "comment_date": "2020-10-26T18:05:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shankhari Swaminathan", "comment_text": "Amazing video.

A nuclear reactor in its most basic form is no different than a coal boiler or natural gas plant. All the reactor is doing is creating heat so the heat can boil water to create steam and the steam can turn a turbine which can create electricity. For example, a reactor and its generating plant; a coal plant or natural gas plant are all about the same when it comes to operational efficiency. They all waste about 65% of all of the BTU&#39;s of heat energy they create either from the lost of that heat in the generation process or in operational thermodynamic inefficiencies.  So only about 35% of the heat created actually does the real work of creating electricity.  It is not the inefficiency of the reactor or boilers but rather all of the other equipment that is needed to create electricity like the water pumps, electric motors, heat exchangers and turbine generators. So the using nuclear fuel or ANY other form of fossil fuel is not the complete solution we need.  \r<br>\r<br>Now we come to what is called Waste Heat.  You know the heat lost in the process of generating electricity.  The heat we loose in the piping, the reactor or boiler or turbine or even the water we use to cool the power plant.  Sixty-Five (65%) of that heat goes to waste.  So where does that excess or waste heat go?  Well it goes directly into our environment which in some cases is our air or stream or river or if the power plant is located near the ocean it is dumped into the ocean.  And during this whole generation process we are using billions upon billions of gallons of fresh water to cool the power plant and it doesn&#39;t make any difference what type it is.  So certainly waste heat rejection and water use are all going to have to change IF we ever become serious about cleaning up the air we breathe and the water we drink.\r<br>\r<br>But solar, wind and water systems do not have these same waste heat or thermodynamic principles to overcome. Lets take solar for example.  When the sun comes up in the morning the solar panels start creating electrical power and when the sun goes down they shut themselves off.  No power plant operators are even needed.  Utility workers at a central dispatching office turn the system off and on as needed by the electrical grid.  Now lets consider the difference between that solar plant and a nuclear plant.  There are usually about 200-400 people who work 24/7/365 at a nuclear power plant and some of those workers need to be licensed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission [USNRC] which is a very expensive process.  So lets consider the difference between 200-400 operators, maintenance workers, engineers, safety officers and licensed personnel vs a workforce of 1-3 unlicensed workers at a solar power plant.  Try multiplying the number of workers by about $30-$60/hour and then compare the difference.  And of course you might need to replace a solar panel from time to time but as a utility executive, which would you prefer? \r<br>\r<br>Now of course the sun doesn&#39;t shine at night but solar can be used to charge batteries during the day or to pump water up a hill for later generation or it can create hydrogen which can be burned at night to create power.  About the same can be said for wind turbines.  Now I am not saying that ALL nuclear is unnecessary since certainly some nuclear will be needed under certain conditions.  But certainly 75% of our energy needs could be supplied by solar, wind and water systems.  When I retired from the nuclear power industry in way back in 1995 which is now some 25 years ago, we were already considering Small Modular Reactors [SMR], Molten Salt Reactors [MSR], High Temperature Gas Cooled [HTGR] reactors. So here we are some 25 years later with only one approved design and we haven&#39;t even completed the construction of the first prototype power plant yet.  Now if you happen to be the type of individual who is concerned about global warming, do you really want to wait for another 10 or 15 years to do something about the warming of our planet?  I certainly don&#39;t. I want a massive build out of solar, wind and water systems along with more geothermal, biomass and other renewable systems.  I want more Electric Vehicles [EV] now and not 10 years from now.  I want a national electrical grid that spans more than just a few states.  And certainly we need to stop wasting 65% of all of the heat energy we create if we are going to survive with 8-10 billion people on this planet.  As a society we can not continue to waste energy the way we have been going forward.

Yet here we are, two decades into the 21st century, looking back at how primitive our ancestors were then. <br>Fossil fuels are still with us and still have one great advantage over everything else except, maybe, nuclear. It&#39;s cost! <br>Fossil fuels produce more energy less expensively than any other source, except ,again, maybe nuclear. <br>I&#39;ve read that we&#39;re expected to start running out of fossil fuels by 2030.

No more power grid and everything that entails. Power, when produced, will be produced much closer to where it is consumed, and almost certainly, in much smaller quantities. Some may see that as an plus. Transportation will become slower, think horse and buggy, bicycle, or on foot. Of course that will go a long way towards solving our obesity problems.

Taxing the rich. Thats not a long term plan. Also most of the people if not all of the people you displayed are that rich due to their stocks and other assets. They dont have that much money on hand. For example Jeff Bezos, he only makes 1 million a year, so according to your limit he wouldnt even be included. Also, if the rich were getting taxed why would they stay here? That makes no sense. They would move their corporations as well as themselves out of America leaving us with less jobs and a devastating hit to our economy. <br><br>2. There is way too much emphasis on solar and wind. Dont get me wrong they are decent however theyre not reliable. Look at california for example, they have gone all green for their power grid and you can see the effects of that, recurrent blackouts and fires due to unmaintained power polls (idk whats the correct word) just to name a few. The problem is the batteries, although the cost has gone down and the capacity has gone up, it isnt enough to support a state let alone a whole country. I believe nuclear is the way to go, there is much more promise with that and it is much better than solar or wind due to not having to store all that energy when the wind isnt blowing or the sun isnt shining. <br><br><br>3. There is too much reliance on government to propel us into a green country. Even if we leave politics and the oil companies out of the discussion there is still a big problem. If we look at NASA, when they were a private entity they were able to advance much quicker and had a bigger budget, that all changed when it became a government entity. If you compare spacex to NASA you can see that the private sector is much better at breaking the boundaries and advancing past the current standards. The best way to go about this is the private sector. If enough people are pushing towards these things than companies will realize that it is a better investment since they are making a considerable amount from that. <br><br>4. The internet of things.

Taxing the rich may sound like a good idea but most wealth of rich people are in financial assets such as shares of stock and not cash.  Yes, tax rates were high in the U.S. in the past but that was income tax, which is the wrong tax to raise if you want the rich to pay more in taxes.  You would need a living wealth tax, meaning they rich would pay a wealth tax every year.  Considering that the wealthy fund campaigns for both Republicans and Democrats, I find a living wealth tax unlikely.  Do you find it a bit odd that Democrats keep pushing for higher income taxes when most wealthy don&#39;t have much active income?  So if you want to tax rich, at least do it the right way.  Let&#39;s be real, the new green deal will cost the middle class more than it would for the rich.  The other thing is that large oil companies want a carbon tax.  The reason is to push all the small competitors out of business and thus restrict the supply of oil, which would push oil prices higher.  The cost of renewable production is cheaper, but the cost of electric storage is still very high.  Utilities are still building natural gas plants to meet base load.  Why would they do that if renewables are supposedly cheaper?  It is because battery storage is still too expensive.

There are MANY ways to store renewable energy and several more ways to procure it in the first place. They have not become mainstream YET, but they have been in development for years and are about to come online. For instance, Makani Kites can tap winds far above where birds and bats fly, use much less material per unit of power produced, can almost always find wind at some altitude, and do not need ANY wind in order to launch. New perovskite photovoltaic cells are being made with no toxic or rare elements in them, designed from the start for easy recycling, and showing good efficiency already. Then for storage, there is compressed air in caves and tanks, Liquid Air for both short term storage and long term, hydrogen from electrolysis of water, methane and methanol synthesis from CO2/CO+hydrogen (from electrolysis), and the very simplest energy storage is thermal. \r<br>Resistance heat can get hotter than any common fuel, mere sand and rocks can store it almost anywhere in huge quantities, thermal-insulated storage has excellent economies of scale, and the heat can be added/extracted by any number of working fluids, to suit the attached equipment. Concentrated sunlight also works well with thermal storage, as do molten salts for the storage medium. \rThen to use the stored heat... <br>Why don&#39;t fossil fuel power plants install high temperature thermal storage, integrate it into their Heat Engine cycles, draw from it for peaking and when the renewables have a lull, then replenish the storage when renewables are peaking, AND when the baseload plants have excess power themselves? Nuclear plants in particular would benefit hugely from using hotter steam, which would boost the conversion efficiency of their reactor heat, while also letting them follow the load demand AND keep the reactor running at peak all the time. Most thermal power systems use reheat too, so they don&#39;t even have to store heat at their peak temperature.\r<br>New options and beneficial combinations of technologies are so abundant, I can&#39;t even count them all.

At a cost of 2250 kJ of solar energy per kg of water (that&#39;s per litre) or indeed 2250 MJ per cubic metre, sea water is evaporated and the winds blow it over the land, where it rains or better yet becomes snow -- releasing most of that energy to the upper atmosphere or outer space, which is a Good Thing.<br>Now, the gravitational energy of a tonne of water (1000 kg) at a height of 102 metres (about twice the height of Niagara Falls) is 1000 x 9.8 x 102 is one megajoule, 1 MJ, so the solar efficiency of hydropower for a 102 metre &quot;head&quot;is one in 2250. But the collection area for that power is hundreds or even thousands of miles of ocean. It is even stored energy, to the extent that it&#39;s the winter snows.<br><br>Wind power was king of the seas in 1776 and even in the days of Napoleon and Admiral Nelson. It was swept away by coal and oil. Yet sail drives a ship far more effectively than wind responds to megawatts per minute rise in demand on the grid. <br>There are two reactions by which the supply of fissile nuclear resources are indeed renewable. Neutron capture by thorium 232 produces protactinium 233 which decays to fissile uranium 233, and uranium 238, through neptunium 239, to plutonium 239. In 2019, 10% of Virginia&#39;s electric power came from such plutonium, because even a PWR gets 1/3 of its power from plutonium generated in the reactor, and EIA figures for MWh of energy in 2019 show that 30% of Virginia&#39;s was nuclear, and other trustworthy figures show that the &quot;capacity Factor&quot; was over 95%. That of course is because it can serve a steady demand, and the fuel cost is the least of its expenses.<br>But it is also by far the lowest emissions alternative, even although deliberate breeding from Th-232 or U-238 might be a hundred times better.<br><br>The fact is that three kilograms of thorium or uranium contains as much available energy as the biggest pumped storage unit in the world, one gigawatt.day&#39;s worth. Capriciously weather dependent renewables demand three or four times their average MW production power, of storage.

The issue of relying on government intervention in the United States specifically is how it goes both ways. The U.S. has a long lasting problem with its relationship between corporations and public policy. The reason U.S. was 30 years behind its international partners in outlawing lead paint is because corporate lobbies have huge influences on elections and, by extension, who controls policy. Until the problem of current corporations protecting their short term interests through government policy that harms our ability to transition to new, more efficient economic states, we should instead invest as private citizens in what we want. Buy electric cars, purchase power from renewable power companies. If you want something, someone will sell it to you and if enough people want it, it will become more efficient and competitive.

The biggest advantage to nuclear power is that it doesn&#39;t have the same reliability problems as renewables, and thus doesn&#39;t need to wait on the development of new energy storage technologies before it can get going.", "comment_date": "2020-09-23T09:27:24Z", "likes_count": 181}, {"comment_by": "ElBarrio97", "comment_text": "if the super rich would have to pay 70% taxes they would find a way to deduct or leave the country, this is very politically charged", "comment_date": "2020-09-23T09:19:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nikos Foutakis", "comment_text": "The problem with energy sources and the stability of the grid is not only a problem of quantity , but also a problem of quality. Different energy sources are used in different time periods in a day to respond to the load demands, the peak and base demands. PV and wind energy are a clean energy source , but at the same time many times unreliable. Ofcourse there are patterns of how the weather acts, but the problem is that many times there are things that we are not able to forsee, like the demand side. So to amend this problem we have power sources like Hydro or natural gas stations that can react quickly to changes of demand. Also the sudden changes in load , without the inertia that rotating machines provide, a change in demand can easily result in an offsetting of the network&#39;s frequency (50hz or 60hz ). So to sums things up, renewables yes, green energy yes ( not nuclear, it is not green) ,hydro YES(i wonder why no one mentions it), but it need better planning.", "comment_date": "2020-09-23T08:50:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nat McC", "comment_text": "&quot;I&#39;ve read a lot of books and listened to experts&quot; definitely nothing economical related if he&#39;s actually suggesting 70s level of taxes are a good thing.", "comment_date": "2020-09-23T07:39:32Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Florin Del Alba", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC-BYhuFUtY&amp;t=7m50s\">7:50</a> Although the tax rate was extremely high during that period the government only brought in about 17% worth of tax revenue of the total US GDP.

That is the biggest lie of all.  &quot;Fossil fuel is only viable because it is subsidized by the government&quot;.  This is, essentially, projection.  What&#39;s being called &quot;subsidized&quot; is actually tax breaks and the like.  You see, when you have a company wanting to set up shop, they can choose between country A, B, or C.  Therefore, A, B, and C all must compete with each other.  A tax break is an incentive offered to the company.  AOC learned this lesson the hard way in NY with Amazon.  Amazon was willing to set up shop in NY provided they got a tax break.  Now, a tax break doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t pay taxes, it means they just pay less tax.  AOC refused and now NY gets full taxation on exactly $0.  Way to go AOC &lt;slow clap&gt;.<br><br>This is different than an actual subsidy that the renewable industry gets in grants and other sources.  This is where you have a competing industry that is unable to actually compete and so it gets subsidized so that it doesn&#39;t have to turn as much of an actual profit to remain competitive.  We have a few examples of such up here in Canada, Bombardier being a big one who not only gets subsidized by the government to be able to manufacture aircraft for the world market, but has even received bailouts to prevent it from going bankrupt.<br><br>Next lie, fossil fuels have reached peak efficiency.

This is also incentivized by having a very high tax rate and the reason the 90% tax rate was done away with is because the companies weren&#39;t paying taxes ANYWAY. A few other tricks are having companies located out of the US, creating a company that owns the main company and making its headquarters in a nation with more favorable taxes. Point is there is a variety of ways of getting out of taxes and having higher taxes on these companies simply disincentivizes them from actually paying taxes in their county. That&#39;s one. <br>Two: the price and reliability of renewables are very... poor at best logistically. Yes photovoltaic cells have dropped in price dramatically, however that doesn&#39;t take into account how often they need to be replaced, how much time they&#39;re actually producing energy. These things are incredibly location dependent, have an effect on the local population, and are almost never producing the exact energy a population needs at any one time with no real way to store the excess as the batteries we currently have to hold them are incredibly expensive and inefficient for that purpose. This means that there is tons of wasted energy throughout the day and tons of energy getting powered by those dang coal plants anyway and thus negating their benefit much like the point of the electric cars. They also end up as extremely hard to clean up technological waste in a dump somewhere with a new shipment from a farm on the average of every five years. Honestly the only reliable one here ends up being hydro which has the ultimate problem of location dependency, issues with transmission (the least of our worries), and also a damage to ecosystems (which wind and solar do too) as these are very extensive ways of energy that require a lot of room and land. The energy source with precisely 0 of these issues is nuclear. And comparatively the safest power source because somehow solar and wind farms are killing people. You can&#39;t make this stuff up. <br>Third and finally: how vehicles end up affecting this. So electric cars are a neat idea however they do end up with some significant drawbacks in that they require much longer to charge than pumping gas, draw upon the energy grid directly, and run on those batteries that need to be put in throughout the car. I think the best two solutions to this are bio-fuels and hydrogen cell cars. Bio-fuels are completely renewable in the fact that they are grown and harvested from crops and as a result can be ready made, basically never run out, and will continue to be made as long as you can produce it. The drawback to this is that it is still technically burning carbon, however you&#39;re also planting more plants that thus take up more carbon from the atmosphere and thus depending on the ratio about even out but can lean in one direction or another. The other one is fuel cell cars which I personally appreciate as they are technically batteries, however they aren&#39;t limited by the size of the battery and instead use oxidized hydrogen to create the electricity to run the engine. So as long as you have hydrogen you can effectively create electricity. It&#39;s also made by the electrolosis of water meaning that although it does come from the grid it&#39;s only a limited amount of electricity going into water to make hydrogen and oxygen which means more oxygen released and then more water released from the ambient oxygen when its combined with the hydrogen in the car evening out the whole process. <br>I think the people who are educated on these topics know very well about why some of the things in this video do and don&#39;t work and why it&#39;s not just the lobbying of these companies especially since some of them are actually working on biofuels! I think it&#39;s extremely uneducated and naive to promote these things as some sort of miracle solution to everything and I suggest you check out the channel &quot;Real Engineering&quot; to see them discuss some of these issues which asap science has so callously glossed over in a bid for brownie points by supporting the renewables which don&#39;t work as well as they should.", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T04:00:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roedy Green", "comment_text": "This guy is unbearably camp.", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T03:08:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "drewspee", "comment_text": "ASAP Political", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T03:01:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K J", "comment_text": "What was the lie", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T02:56:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "freakboynv2000", "comment_text": "Slanted garbage.", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T02:31:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jay", "comment_text": "I like the science and statistics, but as you  seemed to be aware when you made the video, I don&#39;t agree with the politics.

In 2017, Amazon paid close to $1 billion in income tax. In 2018, the amount jumped to $1.18 billion, accounting for local, state, and international taxes. <br><br>    Amazon pays plenty in terms of payroll taxes and also state and local taxes. Nor should you forget the taxes paid by Amazon\u2019s employees on their wages. Not only is that direct revenue to various levels of government, but the incidence of those taxes falls somewhat on Amazon, which now must pay higher wages to offset the tax burden faced by their employees,&quot; Cowen adds.<br><br>It is true that in the last two years, Amazon did not pay federal taxes. (It&#39;s odd to think I paid more federal tax last year than Amazon did.) But before yelling partiality, it is worth understanding why. A more thorough examination of the underlying economics demonstrates that only looking at Amazon&#39;s profits versus corporate taxes is too simplistic of a model. <br><br>Instead, a good place to start is understanding economic incentives. Incentives, in laymen&#39;s terms, sound like free money. Incentives, to an economist, operate as a lever to generate a better result which offset the cost. Taxes are one such lever. But taxes are too often interpreted only by their first-order effect of generating revenue, rather than the second-order effect of stimulating economic activity. <br><br>If you look at the Internal Revenue Code, as one CPA cites, less than 1% of it is dedicated to revenue generation. The majority, in fact, is on tax deductions. \u201cThere are only about 30 pages in the Code that actually raise revenue...[T]here are about 6,000 pages that tell you how to reduce taxes through tax deductions, tax credits and other incentives.\u201d<br><br>Tax deductions can be incorrectly categorized as \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d But tax deductions, tax credits, and other incentives act as an important driver for organizations to then stimulate economic activity, job creation, and innovation.<br><br>Amazon&#39;s Tax Breaks And The Underlying Incentives<br><br>There are three main drivers of Amazon&#39;s tax breaks:<br><br>    Investment in Research &amp; Development. Amazon invests heavily in research and development and therefore benefits from the tax credit. In 2017, as Recode stated, Amazon topped the list of U.S. companies in R&amp;D spend, at $22.6 billion. The next closest was Alphabet at $16.6 billion. Many of Amazon&#39;s innovations have been birthed from this investment.<br>    Investment in Property, Plant, and Equipment. Amazon\u2019s investment in property, plant, and equipment also makes it eligible for tax credits. Cities can benefit from Amazon&#39;s investment in real estate and job creation (benefits New York City could have enjoyed). Amazon&#39;s PPE expenditure has steadily increased over the last five years, netting to approximately $60 billion as of the end of last year.<br>    Employee Stock Compensation. A move away from cash compensation to stock-based compensation for employees is the third driver of its tax breaks. Tax deductions increase as the stock increases. While this can certainly create adverse incentives, it is important to assess the benefits it creates relative to the cost. While such a tax policy can introduce misaligned management incentives, it also generates incentives for management to drive the best possible return for investors.  <br><br>Amazon largely pays no corporate tax precisely because it reinvests those profits into its operations. Under a scenario where Amazon had no corporate tax breaks, it would disincentive the company from reinvesting and thus creating greater opportunity for the businesses and cities in which it operates. <br><br>Raising a pitchfork to fight Amazon&#39;s corporate tax breaks is fine if the argument is rooted in strong economic reasoning. The risk is that too often the data is pulled out of context, and inaccurate storylines circling that data gain momentum and undeservedly accelerate. <br><br>The building impetus to tear down existing economic structures without a strong grounding in why the structures even exist could land us in a worse position. The question to address is not why Amazon pays no taxes, but under what tax structure could we be better off?", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T15:17:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GunDoctorHTown", "comment_text": "What I got out of this is if I earned a bunch of money because of hard work or innovation then others should be able to come along and steal my money and spend it how they want.

I am Divit Maheshwari. Age-14 years. Speaking from bhopal, India. I have a very complicated question for you. I request you to please clear my question.<br>My question is that <del>--&gt; Everyone know that the first living cell was produced when an electrical bolt(electrical energy) passed through the water molecules. I have few questions that require all the three subjects(physics, biology and chemistry and maybe maths). The questions are:</del><br>1. How was the electrical energy produced by the bolt was so massive that it resulted in the formation of a very complex and complicated and diverse LIVING stucture.<br>2. What was the chemical/biological/physical reaction that took place to creative a complex living structure just through water molecules and ions and minerals.<br>3. Why did such an odd and tiny event and reaction lead the first living cell.<br>4. We all know that living cells can do anything on their own just like computers. But computers were designed and programmed to perform some tasks and they can&#39;t do anything without programming by themselves. So why does sung a complex structure produced and knew many things like how to survive and live and reproduce without any assistance or coding. And all that stuff.<br><br>With these questions I have also thought of a kind of a theory that, we all know that there are infinite planets in the whole universe but we haven&#39;t found life in any of the planets. So there could be an explanation of this. We couldn&#39;t have found any life because there might not be any except us. Like imagine the factors that lead to the formation of life. First presence of water, then favourable climate, them perfect timing, then weather like earth&#39;s, then passing of the energy through water such that the matter present at that stage is reassembled and programmed (type of) to form this type of perticular system and then finally development of the life.

People tend to automatically think of renewables as good. Their operation doesn&#39;t directly lead to air pollution or carbon emmisions and they are &quot;natural&quot;. For a start this is an appeal to nature fallacy(look it up). The other thing is you can&#39;t just look at a renewable energy technology in a vacuum. They keep claiming that renewables now produce energy cheaper than fossil fuels. While directly that is true, it isn&#39;t true when you look at the grid those renewables exist in. Because wind are solar are intermittent, largely uncontrollable sources you must have technologies in your grid that can compensate for sudden changes in output and the complete loss of energy production from those sources. So for every solar or wind farm that gets built, guess what? A natural gas plant gets built too to deal with this problem. You might be tempted to say &quot;oh, well that natural gas plant only has to work when the renewables aren&#39;t so it&#39;s still a net positive&quot;. But again, things aren&#39;t so simple. Not only did you have to build 2 sources of power to do the job that one could do on it&#39;s own, driving up cost. It also increases emmisions because the &quot;simple cycle&quot; natural gas plants that can react quickly enough to sudden changes in the output of renewables don&#39;t have very high efficiency and their emmisions spike every time they have to quickly ramp up power. I&#39;d argue that if the output of the renewables vary too much it would be better for the environment to just use a more efficient &quot;combined cycle&quot; natural gas plant and just forgo the renewables entirely. Look at Germany and other countries that are determined to add lots of renewables. Their electricity prices are double that of their neighbors and their emmisions are still significantly higher. Compare nuclear powered France to renewables-heavy Germany.<br><br>If you wanted to use batteries to get around the intermittent nature of wind and solar you run into a different problem. Not only are storage systems expensive but even if they were cheap they don&#39;t produce electricity, only store it at the cost of a drop in efficiency. The problem then is the amount of energy used to create, install, and maintain the renewable source plus it&#39;s storage systems leaves you with a tiny amount of energy surplus left over to do anything with. Researchers estimated that a modern society needs an energy source that produces 15x more energy than it consumes. Most fossil fuels get a score of about 30, nuclear 75-100, wind 15-20, solar 6-15, but if you take wind and solar and add even the best energy storage and that number drops well into single digits thereby making them useless to a modern nation. <br><br>The next problem with wind and solar is their massive use of resources. It&#39;s estimated the amount of material waste(including highly toxic waste) from solar per unit of electricity produced over it&#39;s life is 300x higher than than of nuclear power. Wind isn&#39;t much better. And most of these materials either aren&#39;t recyclable or it is prohibitively expensive.<br><br>Lastly is land use and interaction with the habitats or native species. Wind and solar take up huge land areas due to their low energy densities relative to fossil fuels or nuclear. Go ask the German people how they feel about the expansion of wind farms in their country. Wind power and solar thermal plants kill an enormous amount of birds and bats. And we aren&#39;t just taking about small common birds but large and rare bird species that have populations that can&#39;t adapt quickly to these changes in environment. <br><br>Renewables have their place but that place isn&#39;t in large quantities on a national or international grid. They make electricity more expensive, don&#39;t significantly drive down carbon emmisions, use too much land/resources, and in large numbers THEY SIMPLY WON&#39;T WORK. <br><br>What we need to do is work to make nuclear power cheaper and rid the general public of the numerous lies and misinformation they have been fed by malthusian so-called &quot;environment groups&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-09-15T15:18:29Z", "likes_count": 33}, {"comment_by": "YanDrak", "comment_text": "What a well explained video.

Excuse me?!?! li&#39;ion batteries are now the same they were 10 years ago, if you go to the market for samsung, lg, sony, panasonic li-ion batteries, they have the same energy density they had 10 years ago, a 16850 has between 2ah to 3ah, depends on the discharge rate, higher discharge rate, less energy stored. Lithium takes from 1 to 3 years after extraction to become a battery, more likely close to the 3 years (evaporation, sodium separation with chemicals, etc), and lithium isn&#39;t recoverable from batteries (a single 16850 takes around 3 grams of pure lithium), and ends up in acidic landfills, cool heh.

First of all,  solar and wind are impractical when blown into proportion. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC-BYhuFUtY&amp;t=2m27s\">2:27</a>, it is mentioned that 1/100 of the sun\u2019s energy that reaches Earth can power the global economy 6 times over. So, the global economy requires 1/600th of the energy we can harvest from the sun. The surface area of the Earth is 197 million square miles, meaning we would have to build solar panels over an area of 326,000 square miles to meet the world\u2019s energy demands. I understand that the density of solar energy changes with the curvature of the Earth, and building solar panels closer to the equator will be more effective, but this is still the equivalent of filling an area the size of Texas with solar panels. How about the wind alternative. Well, 20% of the wind on Earth powers the world\u2019s yearly energy demands 8 times over. Meaning that we would need to harness 2.5% of all wind power in the world.  If you have 40 cubic feet of air, you would need to harness 100% of the wind from 1 cubic foot. Now instead of 40 cubic feet, you are now required to harness that same 2.5% but from every point on the surface of the Earth. I\u2019m all for optimistic thinking, but this project seems nearly impossible. It should also be mentioned that we have not found reliable methods for storing solar and wind energy. Recently, a 120 degree heat wave swept through Southern California, causing a spike in energy demands to keep houses cool, and the Los Angeles mayor released a statement to not use air conditioning because there was an energy shortage. This is because Southern California is heavily reliant on solar and wind energy, and to fix the problem, energy was needed from neighboring states. <br>Next, I\u2019m surprised that the reasoning for leaving fossil fuels was not mentioned in great extent. Not surprisingly, climate change is the most cited reason for leaving fossil fuels. However, the US was the number one reducer in carbon emissions last year, <a href=\"https://www.intelligentliving.co/amp/usa-greatest-co2-reduction-2019/\">https://www.intelligentliving.co/amp/usa-greatest-co2-reduction-2019/</a> The real problem with the increase in  world carbon emissions is going to come from developing third world countries, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, which are experiencing their own form of an industrial revolution, and as mentioned in the video, requires substantial amounts of energy. Currently, fossil fuels are significantly more abundant and practical in these areas, and an attempt to reduce carbon emissions in these developing nations will not occur without the eminent halt on their advancement.  <br>It\u2019s also unfortunate that nuclear energy was never mentioned. In terms of efficiency, nothing even comes close to it. Power plants are up to 2 times more reliable than fossil fuels, and up to 3.5 times more reliable than wind and solar. <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nuclear-power-most-reliable-energy-source-and-its-not-even-close\">https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nuclear-power-most-reliable-energy-source-and-its-not-even-close</a>. Nuclear energy receives a bad reputation for events such as Chernobyl, but when properly maintained, it is actually safer than other forms of energy. In the 50+ years that nuclear energy has been used in the US, not a single person in the US has died from them, whether catastrophic or long term exposure. <br>Lastly, the top 1% of income earners pay roughly 40% of the federal budget as it is. That is more than the bottom 90% of income earners. Despite being incredibly immoral, raising their taxes even more to pay for 100% renewable energy would only solve the carbon emissions in the US, and not address other countries which will continue to operate under more practical means to obtain energy. You will single-handedly obliterate a generation of investors who provide money for the exact renewable energy research that you praise, hollow out the US economy, destroy the free market, and cause an economic recession that our grandkids will still feel.

Also, electricity makes up 20% of the energy we use and renewables make for 1 tenth of one percent of that. If we increased renewables by 100 times they would still make only 10% of electricity alone. The fossil fuels needed to do just this is enormous not to mention retooling our entire energy system to be electric and replacing coal and gas.

We&#39;ve got it, so we might as well use it, but, as soon as we can replace nuclear with sustainable generation, it should be shut down.

Let&#39;s address taxes first. When we look at the 91% tax rate in the 1950&#39;s it resulted in the rich averaging a 42% tax which is higher than today, but not much. More important than this idea of taxing the rich at higher rates, is to look at how to create the highest amount of tax revenue. Under Obama, the highest tax revenue year was 2016 at 3.27 trillion, and after the tax cuts, revenues continued to grow to 3.71 trillion  in 2019. So obviously higher taxes do not always equal higher revenue. Next, little attention was given to the environmental and human cost of battery technology, which is not where it needs to be. Beyond the problems that are being caused in the Congo and Argentina for our current battery technology, the waste of disposing of those batteries is going to lead to it&#39;s own technological disaster. Then we need to look at why people drive electric cars today, because they are cool. Until Tesla came around, most electric cars were just not cool enough or fun to drive. Now they are and people want them. That brings up the next point, all of this tech is becoming more affordable due to the free market and due to the early adopters which are the rich who are willing to overpay for a product that will be far more affordable in the years to come. Trust in customers, and the free market will take care of everything without government involvement.

The cost of power from windmills and solar is 2x to 3x that from fossil fuel. In addition back up power is needed for lack of wind and nighttime. This is either grid size batteries with days, not hrs worth of storage, or fossil fuel plants. This is more capital and higher cost. The higher cost of energy will be a huge drag on the economy, meaning fewer rich people to tax, and a much lower standard of living for all of us. The huge amounts of capital required will earn a negative rate of return, destroying wealth. Capital that is diverted from rich people or whomever is less capital invested in the economy at rates of return from 6% to 10% annually. Warren Buffett is reach because he understood the time value of money. You plan to run the time value of money in reverse with solar and wind. Are we better off at the end of the day? No, because right now we have low cost reliable power. Under your plans we will have high cost unreliable power. Our reduction in co2 will be overwhelmed by the increase from China and India, for very little benefit in temps, on the order of .1 degree C as our contribution. In addition, we are self sufficient in fossil fuels today. We no longer need to worry about the ME.

Renewable energy sources are great and have tons of advantages! BUT there is also many disadvantages! If we are to have an honest discussion about renewable energy we need to highlight both the pros and cons and explain why it would be impossible to only use solar and wind to power everything.\r<br>\r<br>One of the biggest issues with wind and solar is that it&#39;s not always sunny and it&#39;s not always windy. Electricity on this scale is extremely difficult to store! Wind and solar work great for a supplementary power source but cannot be relied about entirely, they must be supplemented but another constant power source capable of ramping up and down as the demand requires. Peak electricity demand is in the early morning and late afternoon whereas solar produces the least amount of electricity in the early morning and late afternoon.  \r<br>\r<br>Hydro power, Nuclear and natural gas being the best options to compliment wind and solar but even if the steady power source is coal implementing solar and wind are great options to reduce emissions.\r<br>\r<br>PS I mentioned that electricity on this scale was extremely difficult to store but I have seen it done before! In the pacific northwest the majority of our power comes from Hydroelectric dams and during the day there is tons of demand but at night there is hardly and demand but the hydroelectric dam can still run at fill capacity. So at night when there is little demand they pump water up to the top of a hill then during the day they let it down from the hill and run in through a turbine to feed the grid. The process is not very efficient but its utilizing what would be wasted energy.\r<br>\r<br>Another problem I have with this video is the political agenda that I feel has really no place in this video. Talking about the redistribution of wealth doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with the environment, other that it costs money, Well everything costs money?  Sure the government could spend more on green energy but they could also spend more money on the underprivileged and tons more places? How I believe we are going to mainstream green energy is by making it better and cheaper than the alternative making it a no brainer for governments to use without costing them anything extra. Again bringing up the redistribution of wealth here just isn&#39;t the place. AsapSCIENCE is absolutely entitled to have their opinion and are free to share it but it&#39;s deceptive when its placed in a video just talking about renewable energy, if you want to bring up these points put it in another video. \r<br>\r<br>AsapSCIENCE just stick to just the Science, represent both the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of these renewable energy sources, if you don&#39;t do this you are just as bad as these oil companies but in the opposite direction.", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T23:54:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "joe humphrey", "comment_text": "Crap.

The fact that lithium-ion batteries are still not financially feasible to support grid operations for greater than 4-8 hours (and not incentivized to do so, literally anywhere) causing the increased penetration of solar to imbalance the grid such that natural gas plants are more and more dominant because of their ability to quickly turn on and off with large power outputs (we have moved past oil into an age of natural gas, not renewables). The fact that if we could use energy storage as a reliability/resiliency measure, we would do so many incredible things by replacing diesel gen-sets and distribute the grid at the same time. The fact that there is, and this is big, NO infrastructure or policy basis for a smart grid, making it more of a pipe dream than a real solution. There are huge institutions (ISO) running the transmission grid and you would need to create equivalent, but more highly funded and more technologically advanced institutions across the country in order to manage a smart grid. That is a down the road solution, do not treat it like it can happen right now. A more realistic policy change is pushing for reliability (meeting grid power) and resiliency (working in case of emergency) credits to be given to energy storage for longer durations. THAT is what we should be pushing for. In addition, pushing for retirement replacement projects is HUGE. These replacement projects are one of the only ways that we can actually credit the cost of a carbon tax in a financial prediction of what the best solution is (solar/liion must compete with natural gas plants, and it will lose if you can\u2019t credit carbon tax). Look up how California replaced SONGS as an example. This story also leaves out ANY mention of international balance of power when it comes to oil price, which is a huge lever when it comes to competing with communist governments that control their countries oil and benefit directly from the oil profits. Our continued competition in that arena is one of the only real things (other than nuclear) allowing us to negotiate with our enemies. I have so much more to say in terms of what technology can solve these problems and what financial policies allow us to do it while competing on an international stage, but first, I must demand that YouTube channels like this research it themselves.

Britain left the EU and took away HALF of Europe&#39;s total wind and tidal energy potential, Britain is also going to go carbon neutral much sooner than the rest of the EU without the same price tag. Doesn&#39;t matter of Germany already invested more than a \u20ac trillions in renewable because the early wind turbines and solar panels had lower capacity and were more expensive, off shore wind was doubly so. Britain on the other hand has reliable(working at 33% Vs 20% capacity year round) enough and fast wind right on it&#39;s door step close to ground elevation and also close it&#39;s population centres thus not needing a large over capacity, taller wind turbines or the laying down of as many mileage of thick copper cables to transport the electricity to the population centres. Distance increases the need for thicker cables to due the electrical resistance and requires more voltage for the same power output, the high the voltage and resistance the more maintenance required for the cables, which china ain&#39;t particularly good at maintenance. Large over capacity also increase the potential electrical fluxes, which can blow the substations if there are sudden surges, German manufacturing plants are have obtain their own power generators to provide extra redundancies against black outs. The large wind farms in China over in inner Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang province are a vanity project for propaganda purposes, China overproduce copper, concrete, steel and when they can&#39;t dump it on the world market they need to use it up and it boost their GDP figures with infrastructure projects such as ghost cities, one belt one roads project. These winds farms are located in high altitudes, hundreds of miles inland, which makes transport very expensive especially considering the size of the wind turbines, in remote and sparsely populated areas hundreds of miles away from the coastal population centres that make up 80%+ of the Chinese population. In America, California has huge solar power generation with Tesla energy storage facilities to help fill the supply and demand peak, Texas has both solar and wind which can compete in price with oil which is also produced in large amounts. BP is active in the US and pursuing in solar energy generation, Shell is pursuing Wind energy generation both are British and will potentially end up being the world&#39;s largest wind and solar companies in the future, both produce alot of natural gas that can be fired up even out the energy flux and fullfil the energy demand no matter the weather.

Charge your batteries (including for your electric vehicle) during the day. There are so many examples. Much of the transition can be habitualised even before we think about needing to install huge amounts of storage on the grid. We don&#39;t have to be perfect at it, we just need to be mindful about when we&#39;re using power, because that will largely determine where it comes from. Create demand for renewables. Be mindful that if you&#39;re using power at night when there&#39;s no wind that it&#39;s coming from fossil fuels, so try to minimise that use where convenient enough. Going further into the meal prep example, cook during the day when you don&#39;t have work to freeze for reheating during the week.

Let me use my country, Australia, as an example. with subsidies power prices in the State of South Australia can be anywhere from -ve a couple of $ per MWh to A$2500 per MWh dependent on wind etc (or just plain blackouts as were the case in 2016 when the wind turbines killed the grid, at least they hadn&#39;t blown up their coal fired power station at that point).<br><br>So why does this situation come about? Well firstly there is no real competition between the technologies. The government regulated different prices for the producers depending on source as well as providing subsidies... not only that it mandates that the first drawing of power has to come from renewable sources, but in times of a glut the power has to go somewhere and the voltage has to be managed. The system that regulates the voltage itself had to go through about a thousand fold increase in the amount of money needed to be spent just trying to keep the voltage within spec and this value continues to increase as more pathetic systems are &#39;tacked on&#39; to a grid with little forethought. Also through this the fossil fuel providers still have to pick up the slack even though production gives no return with the sun shines and the winds blow so effective coal fired power stations that are unable to close down since they are needed to pick up the slack that these renewables will DEFINITELY bring later has to be picked up.<br><br>There are generally 4 types of coal fired power stations, subcritical with about 38% efficiency up to ultra super critical with 44% efficiency, but it does no end there with further efficiencies planned with designs reaching 47% in the works. Not really a &#39;dead end&#39;. btw they have said that on batteries too and that is a place for much change over the last couple of years so I do not discount potential of either side. Just the outright lies of what seem to be quite ideologically left wing propaganda rather than anything really &#39;sciency&#39; . <br><br>Tacking the word science and scientists does not add weight to anything said since there are plenty on both sides of this argument. An example of this is climate change the basis for this silly jaunt into wasting money for supposed climate change. Reports come out claiming 97% climate scientists support the global warming theory, the first such joke came out around 2006 when some 10k scientists received an email survey... from the long list of questions asked those that responded they then determined after getting the data which 3 questions they would use and then looked through the groups to work out which scientists fitted what they wanted to claim to be climate scientists. The end result were three fairly weird questions being answered by about 78 &#39;scientists&#39; of their picking. Now that might sound pretty horrendous but it was better than the next one by &#39;cook the books&#39; that upon revision of using his own criteria found that 0.3% supported that in the peer reviewed papers not 97% as he claimed but we know what the media reported. <br><br>Then what about actual number of scientists? Do we include atmospheric physicists? what about geologists? what about computer modellers? Well the IPCC automatically added every scientist involved in the IPCC reports regardless if they supported the notion or not. From this they reached about 8000 &#39;signatories&#39; some of whom challenged to be removed from the list by the owners of the &#39;signatures&#39; themselves. Counter to that there is the Oregon Petition which in effect claims there is no concensus and holds 30000+ signatures of scientists, several thousand of which are PHDs asking not to act on the bogus science of the climate change scam. Now you could go to snopes to see a refutation of this except they actually offer zero evidence for their claims, the fields the scientists were qualified for were clearly identified. If a person was shown up as fake or not qualified or had their name added falsely there were removed as soon as possible unlike a 11000 &#39;scientist&#39; petition last year demanding immediate action on climate change only to find such great minds as Mickey Mouse from the Mickey Mouse School of the Blind and Zoology professor Araminta Aardvark from the University of Neasden.

Because you pay a lot to invest, you pay a lot for what you get back, and when you spend the money inside the country, buying anything, the taxes are absurd. Plus, you have a lot of other problems like they paying less for the employees because of the amount of taxes they have to pay, they hire less people, and believe, it&#39;s worse than you could think. <br><br>My opinion is you should tax everybody in a way that you get enough money to do all the things, but specially, voting for who spend less money in what&#39;s not necessary, like in my country, we&#39;re trying to make the politicians earn less for their jobs, spend less with what&#39;s not necessary, like having big old government buildings that are not used for anything, privatizing some companies the government owns that just make the country poor with a lot of losses and so on.", "comment_date": "2020-09-12T15:26:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "frosted1030", "comment_text": "Nothing about geothermal (although boring, it works, and costs much less than you think.)<br>There&#39;s also a lot that can be said for infrastructure causing the issues.

Government or private business?<br><br>Choose wisely.<br><br>It does sound interesting to create a load balancing system with all our devices with batteries.

A lot of the power that these devices can&#39;t be held onto when it may be needed more like on a cool night with no breeze.<br><br>That is where nuclear is indeed a potential answer to this. We have alternative technologies of nuclear that is not nearly as dangerous as the light water reactors we have today but things like molten salt reactors that operate much more safely and can&#39;t really cause a nuclear disaster.<br><br>So the talk should be able building more nuke plants and supplementing it with renewables like solar and wind.

First, those rich companies are able to pay 0 in taxes because they are following rules the American government wants them to.

There are deductions for companies if they do certain things and if they have had years with losses, they can use those years to counteract the profitable years. To simply say to tax the rich is a falsehood, because the rich do pay a large chunk of the federal budget already. And in the 1950s when the rich had those high tax rates, there were more deductions and loopholes the rich could use. The reason for that is because it was more beneficial then to hire lobbyists to get an exemption from the high tax rate. In fact unions hated the tax code, because the rich could hide their money. Then since the rich were hiding their money by following the rules laid out, they weren&#39;t investing into the economy as much.  In fact there were 4 recessions in the post war era.

However, I feel this video argues its point in a sensationalized and frankly dishonest way.<br><br>The &quot;energy from the sun hitting the earth&quot;  statistic is technically accurate, but irrelevant. We don&#39;t have anywhere near the technology or infrastructure to harvest even a fraction of that energy. The video acts as if doing so is trivial and the only reason we haven&#39;t done it already is due to Big Oil Propaganda.<br><br>There is a lot of talk about countries setting goals and announcing their intentions for everything from renewable energy to electric cars. The video treats these goals and intentions as fait accompli, despite decades of nations failing to meet their carbon emission targets or straight-up ignoring them. It would make a lot more sense to look at already accomplished projects to get a real sense of the cost and scale, rather than look at what countries &quot;intend&quot; to do and what they expect it to cost. The China data in particular is <b>extremely</b> suspect, given that they have consistently and provably lied about their pollution levels for decades. As a side note, Germany recently had a significant <b>increase</b> in its carbon emissions due to a strong anti-nuclear movement forcing them to rely more heavily on coal. Political &quot;intentions&quot; are far too fragile to be relied upon.<br><br>The IMF subsidy study makes two major mistakes. First, it has an extremely broad definition of &quot;subsidy&quot; for the specific purpose of inflating the figure to something more impressive. Second, it includes natural gas subsidies, which are a <b>good</b> thing from a climate change perspective. Related note, 80% of fossil fuel subsidies in the USA are for natural gas. That&#39;s the sort of thing we should encourage, not disparage.<br><br>The &quot;internet of things&quot; talk specifically mentions that such a system will be expensive and complex. The video then answers the question of cost and complexity with... a public opinion poll? How is that even relevant? I think having a &quot;smarter&quot; power grid is an excellent idea, but I&#39;m not comfortable with the misleading way the issue of cost has been sidestepped.<br><br>The &quot;renewable energy jobs outnumber fossil fuel jobs 3 to 1&quot; statistic is a straight-up lie. There are millions of jobs in the USA that depend on fossil fuels, and this is arguably <b>the</b> biggest obstacle to transitioning to renewable energy. The video talks about transitioning fossil fuel jobs into renewable energy jobs, but glosses over just how extreme that transition is. The political importance of this cannot be understated. Any politician who ignores this is going to have severe trouble making any kind of progress, assuming they can even get elected at all.<br><br>The discussion on taxation and wealth is both bizarrely off-topic and severely misleading. Yes, we could pass an anti-rich-guy tax. All that&#39;s going to do is get them to move their assets to overseas tax shelters, assuming they haven&#39;t done so already. The whole thing comes across as an attempt to convince the viewer that somebody <b>else</b> will foot the bill for renewable energy.<br><br>Besides that, my major complaint is that the video completely neglects Natural Gas and Nuclear Power. Renewable energy is <b>already</b> very popular. The problem is that two of our best oil and coal alternatives have been stigmatized. Natural Gas is constantly lumped in with other fossil fuels despite drastically lower carbon emissions, and Nuclear Power probably deserves its own video on just how far people&#39;s fears and perceptions are from the reality. This is particularly important because these two technologies are critical for transitioning jobs away from coal and oil.

You at least understand that if you covered every possible place in the country with wind and Solar we would still not have enough power to cope with the USA&#39;s consumption which is why you suggest Nuclear power to take up the slack.  I just wonder what that will do to the earth and how we will manage the waste?  I live in Texas where we are leading the charge with wind power.  The one main reason we are able to lead so greatly is the shear amount of low vegetation zone in the western half of the state.  Doesn&#39;t hurt that most of that area is as flat as a pancake and vastly unpopulated.   The facts are that most states don&#39;t have the perfect setup for the massive scale of wind farms that we have which is already larger than Road Island yet only produce a max of 20GW of the 27GW theoretical max it is rated for.  We still have tons more untapped space but this isn&#39;t going to work for all states as you can see why.  BTW we are adding more wind everyday and even with the massive roll-out so far we have not been able to produce 20% of our states power needs.  To compound the issue the growth of our state is matching our current expansion of wind power so the number may never go over 20%, i do hope that part is incorrect.  Moving on to Solar commercial panels.  Currently Solar panels are around 20ish percent efficient as you know and only work for around 6 hours at that efficiency.  Even if you covered every square inch of roof and ground in some states you would never generate more than 50 of the power needs in the 6 hour window of the solar generation.  So between the 2 power generation techniques you can understand that we are at a major short fall and will still need power generation of another type which is good that you understand that.  I have no problem running running natural gas powered \rgeneration as it&#39;s fairly clean and allows quick scaling to account for drop offs in generation of wind and solar.  If you are familiar with Texas power generation you will see that my state agrees with me on that.<br><br>Now lets talk about where you are misleading.  Wind power has always been more efficient than coal, oil, nuclear, etc. the problem being that we can&#39;t control the consistency.  Solar is still  less efficient than just about any other form of energy production and again only produces at most 6 hours of power at that efficiency.  Then their is the cost of solar cells which has come down but no one uses cells that small to generate power for the grid.  Larger cells are used and when i say cells it generally takes around 32 to 96 cells in each solar panel.  Yes the cost has come down in even in the past 8 years but efficiency has only improved in the single digits.  In fact there are panels still made that are roughly the equivalent of 1970&#39;s panels in efficiency.  I&#39;m not even going to touch your break down of solar energy and capturing 1/100th of the energy provided to the earth cause it&#39;s beyond far fetched to think at our current state that is even remotely possible.  Solar should be a great source of energy in the future..it&#39;s just not there yet and i hope that changes.  You can&#39;t break the world if you have no way to currently fix it and we can&#39;t Thanos&#39; snap half the people away to stop the influence of humans on our planet.  I.O.T. is great but it&#39;s just going to use more power that some states are still struggling to make.  Even in places where the power usage is know year on year places are taking power plants off line and under powering areas.  This only causes more issues cause then people start buying generators in the millions and if you think centralized power generation is inefficient then you don&#39;t even want to know how bad the efficiency is on gas or propane generators.<br><br>So how do we fix the power generation?  Well i would argue the problem is more in consumption then in power generation and if we can get that in check we would reduce the power needs by 30 to 40 percent which would make renewables more effective.  Looking at the biggest power users in our own homes and why they use so much power.  So those things are generally home air conditioning, food refrigeration and cook top/ovens.  Not alot you can do about cook tops and ovens since the devices are just about efficient as you can get already and you are not getting away from not eating.  I&#39;m sure we still have some more improvement to food refrigeration although i think home air conditioning is the biggest power hog.  This i believe would make the biggest dent in our homes power usage.  I think people should truly understand how their home power usage would change dramatically given some upgrades in this area.  I truly believe we should be building to a much higher standard in this day and age then we are.  Simple changes in home construction could reduce your homes power footprint by around half while only slightly increasing the cost of the home.  The big thing i think will help with power usage is to decentralize energy production/storage.  I think more people need to get skin in the game on generating and storing their own power, this is already happening and want to continue to see it.  There are much better methods for power storage in the form of mechanical batteries that have very few moving parts and are not toxic, although i still think there is a necessity for batteries for a buffer.<br><br>Thanks for the video and the chance to hopefully more inform you into the actual science of things.  Theory of science is that only theory, only actual science is actual and you need to understand where that line lies.  I urge you to get your boots on the ground and visit the power generation areas and take in the vastness of the the areas and i think you will understand what challenges face us.

For example, taxing gas to the point of it costing 1.6\u20ac/liter (8.5$/gallon) is not going to make people switch to an electric vehicle if they can&#39;t afford to buy it, and it&#39;s definetly not going to make them &quot;drive less&quot; if driving is their only option of getting where they need.

You should really look from WWII rate of taxation and the amount actually taken in and through that up against GDP. You will see that nothing changes on collection and GDP decrease with the country when taxes increase. You also have to look at the political dynamics during those times and the U.S. was the safest place to start or keep a company. Where to start-up a company China during MAO Great Leap Forward or U.S.S.R., or Vietnam or unstable Europe. No one had a choice but to go to the U.S. if you had money.

It is able to build quick and cheap solar panels because of the lack of environmental laws and the slave labour it has. Most of the rare earth metals that are needed for creating solar plants come from China and they basically dig a giant hole in the Earth, spray chemicals on the rocks to get out the metal they want and then dump the remainder into a nearby lake or stream.

When done, they leave the giant hole in the Earth and if you happen to live nearby you are out of luck because they will not try and fill it back in.<br><br>Then there is this fantasy that all our electrical needs can be met by current solar on wind energy. This would be true if solar panels were much more efficient but they are not. We would have to jam solar panels over every inch of this planet to get close to the power needed for our energy consumption and that consumption does not include the up and coming need for more electricity because of the growing electric car market.

Even the \u2018Green New Deal\u2019 proposed by AOC and Bernie in the US was rejected at congress because it was too unrealistic and costly. <br>Try make your owe life emissions free and you\u2019ll notice how tremendously hard it is - now imagine politicians doing the same but for the whole country \ud83e\udd2f<br><br>- The top emitters of CO2 are the 1st world nations. They are the leaders in battling CO2 emissions because they have the money, time and privilege to. The rest of the world doesn\u2019t because, for example, 3rd world countries haven\u2019t developed themselves enough to adequately \u2018care\u2019 about their air/environment YET and it\u2019s very unrealistic to hold these countries to the same emissions standards are the 1st world countries (any targets they propose would be superficial at best). The best China, EU and US could do is to continue to optimise and streamline their current energy supplies and while reducing their consumption (incl. food, water and waste). Even if China, the US and EU alone meet their emissions targets that will NOT guarantee a decrease in global temperatures - that\u2019s how much a multivariable this climate change problem is.<br><br>Unfortunately, India, Africa and S America will gradually become more developed, populations will increase as well as their needs and consumption (eg transport, agriculture, infrastructure etc) which will drive emissions at rates similar to that of China, the EU and US today! \ud83d\ude41", "comment_date": "2020-09-11T00:10:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "We The People", "comment_text": "Make a video when you grow up.

And the dammed IOT is not the lynch pin in a renewable energy grid, storage capacity is, figuring out how not to waste excess energy when supply is greater than demand. And JOBS, worldwide the fossil fuels industry employs at least 10x more workers than all the alternative energy industries combined. It is the single biggest industry in the world. The chart you showed is for projected job growth in Texas of renewable vs fossil energy with different renewable energy standards. And we have to figure out how to make renewable energy SUSTAINABLE. Trading oil for mountains of toxic waste and huge environmental damage from the mining and processing of rare metals and HUGE amounts of worn out and toxic unrecyclable batteries, solar panels and wind turbine parts is not a win. It&#39;s just shifting the environmental damage from one industry to another. Honestly, more advanced nuclear is likely the long term most environmentally friendly option.

Transportation, especially for long distance and heavy weight vehicles, can not be powered by electric batteries. Fueling vehicles with hydrogen is a great solution for this.

And are thrown away which poison the water supply of the countries where they are dumped. Like Kenya. Also the batteries are not yet efficient enough to store energy for a long term. Yes the iOT model does make it better but for that you need to invest in many different sources of energy which all might be unreliable. I think nuclear energy is where we should focus, because we are already very adept in that field and it can power whole countries. And with the new more efficient traveling wave reactor which bill gates company has been working with, it would use low power depleted uranium. Which could put a stop to uranium mining and the threats of nuclear warheads. CO2 is more harmful than nuclear radiation anyways. Also most of the nuclear power plants which exists around the world are so old and some are even analogue. Digitization would allow it to be more reliable. Also as nuclear energy already exists, we already have the wireframe of how it is supposed to work. It is easier to invest in something which already works. Also there is no need to completely phase out coal just yet, there are really good inventions called carbon capture, which can make the energy we get from coal 0% emissions or even negative if the energy is used to run the plant itself.

There was a study that showed that if even a small percentage of the Sahara was covered in solar, it would power all the energy needs of the entire world, though transportation of this energy is challenging, obviously. I do have a question, why is government required to do this? As you stated in the beginning, there have been 2 previous industrial revolutions. These leaps forward were not mandated by government bureaucrats or autocrats. They were due to the ingenuity of individuals and companies. I fear that, although renewable energy is clearly getting more affordable, too drastic of a push, mandated by law could, and likely would have a deleterious impact on the poorest in this country and others around the world. I agree with you that the tax system in the US and in many other places is inefficient, however, I believe that the cause is more related to the complexity of the system and the sheer number of loopholes than to a lack of incentive to tax the rich. I would argue that the better option would be to allow the market to determine the course for introducing and accelerating the use of renewable or clean energy. Even among environmentalists, there are disagreements on these types of energy generation technologies. Some are harmful to wildlife (wind and certain types of solar) or to the land itself (all of the above, but particularly hydroelectric, as the construction of a dam is generally required). Even wave energy conversion technology has been shown to be potentially dangerous. As Thomas Sowell has said, there are no solutions, merely trade-offs. What are we willing to sacrifice? Where do we place our value? The concern that exists to me is a select few in positions of government determining those values for the masses at a cost that is, as of yet, unknown. We may not be willing to pay the long-term costs (not necessarily monetary costs). California has one of the strongest road maps to renewable energy. It has diverted valuable resources of PG&amp;E to renewable and away from updating and upgrading their infrastructure (power lines). These lines are decades old and have been the cause of over 1,500 California wildfires from 2012-2019 according to an article from the Business Insider last November. These types of resource mismanagement is what I fear will result from more government intervention. Suffice it to say, I hope we find a way to move towards a more efficient source of energy that is clean and safe, but voting for politicians to manage and mandate that move is short-sighted at best and extremely dangerous at worst, not only for the people impacted by it, but for the wildlife and the planet as a whole.

This is true, however the Government still made just about the same amount of revenue that they make today. In the 1950s and 60s, the government made 17% of the country\u2019s GDP off of taxes. Today the government makes guess how much? 17%. Still 17%. Between when the 90% marginal rate was abandoned to now, where there is a ~35% marginal tax rate, the government still made about 17% of the GDP in taxes. <br><br>The reason we make the same amount is because the government fixed the loopholes that many large business owners used to evade taxes in the 1950s and 60s.

Since those loopholes don\u2019t exist anymore, it is almost certain that large business owners would move out of the US and conduct their business elsewhere.

They offshore all of their wealth to Ireland. Andrew Yang had already explained this in detail during his campaign while Elizabeth Warren pushed this idea of taxing the rich. So, I&#39;m assuming that you both were gonna vote for her. The right answer to this is to look at what other 1st world country have done already. And that is to have a VAT tax system. This would be an ingenious way and the big corporations won&#39;t be able to cheat their way out of it even if they offshore all of their wealth to Ireland. They get taxed every step of the way regardless. This alone generates 3 billion every year. Just with a 10% VAT which is half of what European countries do which is 22%. This new VAT money can then be distributed to citizens in the form of Universal Basic Income (UBI). And this will stimulate the economy very well since none of this money disappears. It just keeps circulating all through out. Just follow the working examples from European countries that&#39;s been doing this for a while. It works. Don&#39;t follow Elizabeth Warren&#39;s proposal, please. That idea is old and it&#39;s been done before and it never works. China also sells fossil fuel energy to countries in Africa for very cheap and this is obviously something you and Greta Thunberg has failed to mention. Actually, she&#39;s never mentioned China at all in any of her speeches even though China is the number one country in the world that pollutes the most to the environment. This also leads to another thing that the US must do and that is to go to these African countries and tell them, instead of China&#39;s fossil fuel, by this solar panel instead and we&#39;ll subsidize it and make it even cheaper for you. This is the playbook.

Research into higher efficiency energy models with minimized potential for human error and accidents are fantastic, but like, that doesn&#39;t remove the issue of waste, or very justified public concern over safety. <br><br>The biggest problem with nuclear is the waste. It&#39;s highly radioactive, with few places that are geologically stable enough to store it for millions of years, and no one wants it near them. Part of that is from a place of environmental justice, where the history of nuclearism is very deeply tied to nuclear weapons, but also that uranium mining and waste storage has pretty much always negatively impacted marginalized groups (RECA is still inadequate and doesn&#39;t cover all people affected, I highly recommend looking into the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Association). <br><br>Like, in the USA the Navajo Nation has well over 500 abandoned uranium mines, with large swathes of land contaminated. As a result, surrounding states have zero interest in waste storage. Yucca Mountain had massive issues, both politically and also simply with the plan being pushed through without a full review of its scientific legitimacy. The same thing is happening in New Mexico with WIPP and the proposed Holtec site. In the USA as well as basically every country with nuclear energy, waste is hoisted onto rural, low-income, often indigenous peoples.<br><br>Nuclear has enormous potential, but imo currently the issues with it are insurmountable as few people actually want to constructively discuss them.

In my opinion, the best is to have a balance of everything.

That said, I&#39;d encourage some deeper thought and analysis in how to best pay for it. <br><br>In particular, I&#39;d encourage @asapscience to dig into the familiar refrain of, &quot;Amazon doesn&#39;t pay any taxes!!!&quot; I think it&#39;d be a valuable thing for you and your audience to understand. It&#39;s not some love affair with Amazon (I&#39;m pretty sure there is no love between Donald Trump and Jeff Besos. <br><br>For one, a huge part of what offsets Amazon&#39;s tax bill is a thing called carryforward losses.

After they&#39;re incurred, these losses can be used to offset future tax bills. <br><br>Why is this good? Well, it encourages businesses to make bigger, longer term bets, and not just playing things year-to-year. And, in the end, that ends up benefiting the company, the additional employees it&#39;s able to employ and governments ability to pay for stuff with it&#39;s larger tax base. <br><br>There&#39;s more, like allowing companies to make deductions for R&amp;D, which Amazon does too.

A lot of ground is bought to put solar on because the dutch dont want wind. It is just damn ugly. And in this damn dense country there is just no support for wind. With the land that was used for growing food now getting converted to solar energy this is a very bad movement. The food that gets produced is not sudently not needed anymore. It gets grown somewhere else because the people in the world is not shrinking but growing. Those places are Brazil in the rain forest on ground that is useless for growing food on. We should invest in massive solar farms in Africa and other places where a lot of sun is. We should convert that energy into something storable for instance Hydrogen. Use that hydrogen to make electricity where the energy gathering is not suitable like here in the Netherlands where we can much better grow food.

You also say that building renewables is cheap today. That is certainly true, but I think you forget the fact that it is cheap only thanks to the energy fossil fuels give us in order to build those renewables. It will another story when you&#39;ll have to build (extracting metals, assembling, transporting, etc) wind turbines just from the energy of wind turbines... And let&#39;s not forget that building renewables is itself far from being environmental friendly at the moment...<br><br>One last thing is that, although the internet of things certainly can be more energy efficient, let&#39;s not forget about the rebound effect which tells us that an increase in a technology&#39;s efficiency often comes with a greater use of this technology, negating the benefits we thought we had by it becoming more efficient. In other words, although more efficient, the IoTs will use exponentially more connected devices interacting with one another, which could increase the total system&#39;s energy use instead of decreasing it. For the moment (because fossil fuels give us most of our energy), more energy used = more CO2 emissions.<br><br>Conclusion: not sure putting all our effort in renewables and IoT is best for the planet.

With over $1M per day in generation, the company would have invested in any option that improved the bottom line and constancy of generation.  There are no more significant hydro opportunities.  Solar (even with land already owned) was not economically viable.  Wind was only viable under heavy subsidy and was terminated after one installation as not economically viable.  The wind farm model has been proven much more expensive and with bigger impacts than what was suggested just a few years ago.  Many sit idle due to curtailment or have been built under subsidies only to sit idle because they are not connected to the grid.
