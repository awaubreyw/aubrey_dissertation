It&#39;s not surprising to see a congregation of about ten thousand members with only two hundred born-again believers. In today&#39;s church, a majority of the ministers of the gospel are not even born-again not to talk of their followers. Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3vfHZI8VoI&amp;t=7m21s\">7:21</a>-23 KJV <br><br>Most Christians today are only Christians just for the name or for the fun of it. Some people only go to church on Sundays just to catch fun, hear stories from their storytelling pastor, listen to comedians, eat, drink and make business friends. Only a few actually have the safety of their souls at heart. It might even surprise you that many Christians don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s anything called Soul. Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3vfHZI8VoI&amp;t=16m24s\">16:24</a> KJV <br><br>Lots of souls in hellfire only knew there is a place called hellfire when they got there. Some pastors would not mention sin, judgment, and hellfire for a whole year in their messages. Some only mention heaven in hypocrisy, telling their members that they would all go to heaven regardless of the life they are living. Child of God, you must be genuinely born again. Avoid all manner of sins and strive daily to enter into the kingdom of God. Colossians 3:1-3 KJV<br><br>Prayer: O Lord my God, have mercy on this generation of Christians and deliver your children from the spirit of laziness, foolishness, and lukewarmness. Let there be revival awareness in your church in Jesus Christ mighty name. Amen. <br><br>Reflection:  And Jesus answered and said to them, \u201cDo you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.

Oxygen move from air to blood vessels in the lung due to difference in concentration. Since the concentration of oxygen is higher in the atmosphere than in blood vessels, it move from air to blood. But if oxygen in the blood is higher than in atmosphere, the oxygen move from the blood to the atmosphere resulting in almost no oxygen in the blood. I think a completely oxygen deprived blood is very dangerous especially to our brain even for 5 seconds. The reasons you could hold your breath for 5 seconds is there are still oxygen in the blood since the air inside your lung contain oxygen eventhough at lower concentration. Even our exhale still contain a lot of oxygen.", "comment_date": "2018-09-16T16:49:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Milkywegian", "comment_text": "Normie channel.", "comment_date":
