Think how often a linebacker hits their head in a game, or a regular punch to the head in boxing. Those repeated hits are what is believed to cause CTE, not repeated concussions.

BASE Jumping: 219 Deaths<br>via: <a href=\"http://directorzcut.com/\">directorzcut.com</a><br>via: <a href=\"http://directorzcut.com/\">directorzcut.com</a><br>Jumping off a building isn\u2019t for the faint of heart, neither is jumping out of a plane or off a mountain . That\u2019s probably why it\u2019s a trope in many action movies, xXx, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, Die Another Day etc.<br><br>But there are athletes who practice this extreme sport IRL. BASE jumpers climb to the top of tall buildings, jump off, free fall and float to the ground with a parachute. It goes without saying that to become a BASE jumper, one must complete a full course of skydiver training. No school will agree to teach you, if you haven\u2019t completed at least 500 skydives first. BASE jumping is considered more dangerous than skydiving, as there\u2019s less time to impact. Plus jumps are done off cliffs, in built up areas and near power lines.<br><br>As extreme as BASE jumping may sound, it\u2019s still not the most extreme. That honor goes to wingsuit flying; where you hurl yourself out of a plane and basically \u2018fly\u2019. Swooping across rugged mountain terrain at speeds of up to 200mph requires some hefty cojones, and a very high level of proficiency. Despite having those requirements, 210 people have died BASE jumping, and another 28 while wingsuit flying.<br><br>Most of these deaths occur when parachutes fail to deploy, skydivers crash into obstacles like powerlines or mountains.<br><br>Ouch.&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:56:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pingu 42", "comment_text": "Whose idea was it to do face-punching for fun anyway?", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:55:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis H Steuer", "comment_text": "Probably equestrian polo.", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:54:38Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Brooke Allen", "comment_text": "What about cheerleading", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:54:27Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Axie Tips Flystewie", "comment_text": "Sports definitely safer than war", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:53:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stooie", "comment_text": "...<br>f1 nascar gt3 wot", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:53:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michelle Evans", "comment_text": "Hurling, especially during the time before helmets were mandatory", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:51:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Katie McCavit", "comment_text": "Should have mentioned roller derby", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:51:33Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Ella B", "comment_text": "I love this channel but you only use American data which both makes the title a lie and the data is inaccurate please use internal data and if you can&#39;t because of problems and it takes ages can you at least represent the data with the right name", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:51:17Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Javier Barajas", "comment_text": "Boxing is my favorite sport", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:50:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tuberculosis", "comment_text": "Hockey", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:49:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheMineA7", "comment_text": "wtf is pounds or kg of force??

GYMNASTICS.<br>Warning essay coming up...<br><br><br><br><br>So, I am a gymnast right and I have recently experianced a really bad indury. One of my fellow gymnasts was doing giant and pinged off the bar. She rotated about 1.5 times, and as you may have guessed, landed on her head. Seen as the bar is arount 2.5 meters high, falling on your head is definitely more force than a humnan could ever inflict on another human,  she is falling at around 20 mph, as she pinged up quite a bit. This is also plus her body weight and because she is very muscular, she is pretty heavy. She had to quit gymnastics after reaching a national level and she broke her neck. So boxing is still the most dangerous sport?<br><br>Yep there is more...<br>There has also been loads of cases of olympic gymnasts being left quadroteptic. And some even later dying of complications.
