I thought I had FFI (Fatal Familial Insomnia), or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.  I did do something about it, took me years to achieve. Now I do sleep, but still it isn\u2019t in the normal range. It was something out of the Twighlight Zone, something I could not relate to others, it was not real to them as something like that could not be easily fathomed.

And I&#39;ve started noticing that. <br><br>What happened first, is that I got irr- (I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to spell it. I genuienly can&#39;t. Loss of memory was supposed to be number two on the list. Either way, you know what I mean. Cranky)<br>I genuienly noticed I was s\u00f3 close to punching people several times. I would&#39;ve never done it, ofcourse. But there was a rage I&#39;ve never felt before. I originally work with kids, I&#39;m the most tolerant person that I know in my friends-group.<br>But no matter friendly people in the aisle of the shop that whistle songs, no matter cuddling pigeons on a tree-branch, no matter toddlers that ask their moms for a toy, for the last 14 days, I just wanted to bite their faces off. Or scream loudly at them.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the loss of memory, beautifully demonstrated above, when I tried writing irr- and I still can&#39;t write it. <br>I&#39;ve noticed I genuienly started switching words around.<br>&#39;I have heared the child punching the wall again&#39;, became; &#39;I have hared the hild cunching the hall ahan.&quot; <br>&quot;I am so tired, I need to sleep&quot;, became &#39;I mam so nired, I seen to sleep.&#39; <br>The back babbit. (black rabbit) Creen Gristmastrees. The by is skue. ...And so on. <br>I&#39;ve been calling Cynthia &#39;Chelsea&#39; for days now and often just stop mid-sentence and forget what I was doing. Or I just &#39;wake up&#39; while my head is hanging above the table, in mid-sleep (but sadly never a full sleep.)<br><br>Then, there&#39;s the fact that I&#39;m hyper-alert. Each tiny noise is like a blasting gun next to my head. Like Swuidward (I kept writing it wrong, I know it&#39;s with a q, I just can&#39;t do this now, my brain doesn&#39;t do what I want..) I have my eyes wide-open after \u00e9\u00e1ch little noise that I hear. <br>I start shaking when I hear a car going by, I dig my nails into my hands with each midnight-cough that usually indicates the screaming will follow again... <br><br>Then there&#39;s hallucinating. I haven&#39;t gotten that far yet, but I have endless thoughts running through my mind, about bullshit that nobody cares about. Like a bull that needs a birthdaycake. Or a bird made of knifes, with fork-like-legs. Or cake with marbles. Cake with feathers. And so on. Pictures and/or ideas, like a gambling-machine, turning and turning in my head.<br>Which is very creative, but it&#39;s like torture when you want to sleep. <br><br>Then there&#39;s numbness. Apart from feeling exhausted and tense, I feel nothing. Or at least, I can&#39;t really feel it. <br>I went to a group and was told that everyone got a Christmas-present, except for me. Because I had been there for 2,8 months and not 3. That was too short. Everyone talked about what was in their present. They showed it and complained that it wasn&#39;t enough. And I just sat there. Later, other friends and people told me about their presents too. <br>I was sad, but I couldn&#39;t feel anything but a plain &#39;sad.&#39; No real emotions. <br>One time, on thursday, it came out and I cried loudly. For 3 minutes. For a moment I felt great. Then the crying began on the other side of the wall and I was back to numb.<br><br>So many things have happened in the last days...people accidently breaking my items or handing me wonderfull christmas-gifts. Shocking things, like someone fainting or falling on the ice, with a bike. <br>I helped, sure. But thoughtlessly, no feelings. All I worry about is whether the kid starts crying or hitting the wall again. OR whether the mom starts screaming at him again. The neighbour two-apartments-down also hears it at night. And another woman has complaints, on the other side of the street. She&#39;s bothered by the smoking (just as I am, she smokes next to my window. But the noise is worse.)<br><br>Yesterday, 2 days after handing her a Christmascard, I went over to her and said; &#39;I&#39;m sorry, I am bothered by your sounds. I can literally hear every word you say to your mom on the phone, to your (I didn&#39;t say it, but loudly barking) dog and to your (I didn&#39;t say it, but loudly screaming) child. Things to your mom about the couch, you telling the dog to come to you or you telling the child to put his shoes on. Could you try keeping it down?&#39;<br>She then blew her smoke in my face (she was smoking) and said; &#39;Sure.&#39; <br><br>Then I woke up this morning, to the most loud assortiment of noises I&#39;d heard so far. Running, screaming, punching the wall, kicking the wall, jumping, dancing, singing, crying, screaming again. The child was going absolutely nuts and it sounded like she was cheering him on. <br>I think it&#39;s not a co\u00efncidence and that this was on purpose. I re-arranged my room today, so that I can sleep in the other corner of the room.

I went 7 days without sleep and the night after that I did, I only got 2-4 hours. The beginning was fine mostly. Then I began seeing things like a ghostly image of my dog whom was alive and odd floating color things ( one being small Elmo heads with purple spirals for eyes). At this point I felt miserable. I believe I sorta passed out from exhaustion because I had no memory of going to sleep. My last awake memory was standing on my bed. I woke up and it seemed as if I had collapsed into a sitting position and the sun was a light somebody had just abruptly turned on. Throughout my time as an insomniac I had always straight A&#39;s and a low immune system. After the insomnia began to go away was when I acquired multiple medical conditions atop what I already had, which includes the general depression mentioned in this video and maintaining the low immune system.

Insomnia + the daily stresses we encounter in a capitalist economy (and the competition/inattention it creates) could very well work together to precipitate disease in the body.<br><br>My record is 21 days with no sleep. Although, unlike the way its discussed in this video, the experience was utterly traumatizing. Would not recommend it. I lost 15 pounds, suffered intense anxiety, incessant paranoia, complete loss of appetite, compulsive urination, intermittent breaks in awareness, electric shocks in the brain (which is subjectively felt in that way) and a growing sense of it getting worse and worse until - a complete discombubulation of the psyche - the conscious mind vacating its position as director so the body can return itself to a state of physiological homeostasis. The mind that you find in such a dilemma - what we call psychosis - is essentially a medley of disparate self-states: the parts which made up &quot;us&quot; when we had the inner flashlight guiding the door to awareness.<br><br>Usually people would describe such an experience as a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;, and I guess it was.

I can realize I&#39;m being an ass, but I have no control over it. I also tend to act positive and social later in the day. The complete opposite. If I get a good rest, it&#39;s a happy balance, depending on where I am. At school, I am silent and sharp, and generally unhappy. But I am still polite. On vast community games, (Minecraft multiplayer, Wizards 101, ROBLOX) I tend to be happy, focused, and a bit more social. Another thing that I am going to talk about while I&#39;m on the topic of online social games is why they are extremely important in my life. &#39;Cuz it&#39;s rly fun so I play it alo-- NO! Before I played these games and I was a sad child that played Gamecube for a while and wasn&#39;t allowed to play Goldeneye most of the time... I was pretty shut off from the world. No, I hated people. Because my whole life was ripped away from me when I moved. I hate playing with bots or plainly by myself. I experimented with these new games and got to notice that I like to talk a lot, if it&#39;s not face to face. In real life, I was still unsocial and my loneliness and bad friend making was DEVASTATING to my life. I had extreme depression, even thoughts of suicide, and that is why I consider these multiplayer communities to have been things that saved lives that were shoved in a corner and unable to escape. I will admit that I&#39;m not that much of a social butterfly, but to those of you who are like me and cannot escape the darkness of being alone, but cannot make a real-life best bud, please try out this method of bringing up your life. Play these games a little if you feel lonely, you&#39;ll find that you can start an interesting conversation by just so much as a, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s pretty cool! Do you like that sort of stuff? &#39;Cuz I do too!&quot; For those of you thinking, &quot;Wow. This LOSER can only talk online. Geez, get a LIFE dude! I mean, seriously. Maybe THAT&#39;S why people turn away from you! BECAUSE ALL YOU DO IS PLAY GAMES! HAW HAW HAW <b>Long nose</b>&quot; Stop. Just, stop. I already told you before, I couldn&#39;t make friends BEFORE I played. And people are just natural jerks. Even me. A peaceful human is a dead one shipped to the golden gates and accepted by Jesus Christ PERSONALLY and have him tweet it on his twitter. Get a life? My social life is on games. My other life? I&#39;ll stop you right there, stalker. And don&#39;t call me a &quot;gamer&quot; just because I&#39;m trying to have fun. If I were to ask a lot of people, &quot;Do you play games?&quot; and they replied &quot;No&quot;, most of the time they would have had a LOOOONG period surfing the channels on their HDTV plasma flatscreen 2020 model or some crap. No one is innocent from the advancement of Earth&#39;s tech swag. No one. Unless you are dedicated to\u00a0the opposite... I don&#39;t wanna say &quot;Amish&quot; or something like that because I&#39;ll probs get something like &quot;Racist&quot; or &quot;Like you&#39;re not a fat guy.&quot; If you think it&#39;s sad that I admit that\u00a0I get more social joy from online games... Two things. FIRST! (Not self-pride or praise, this is praise to ALL like me.) If I were you, I&#39;d consider him VERY brave. Most people rant on others because they play games a lot, or just that they can&#39;t make real life social contact and that everyone who is a loser in their prospective is DEAD because they need to &quot;get a life&quot;. If the person is that brave to admit that they aren&#39;t as good as a flesh-to-flesh talker than a cyber chat magnet means that they don&#39;t give two piles of shit about your nasty comments. And the SECOND reason that your statement is a pile of donkeyshit : If I didn&#39;t do this, don&#39;t you think I&#39;d be on a rope right now? You&#39;ve payed no attention to my CRUSHING depression I went through. I kept it secret because I didn&#39;t want to be drugged to &quot;bug off&quot; the sadness. Are you still reading? Good. My games I play can get reputation that crushes like a supernova. But if I didn&#39;t play these games, it would be game ova. Wow, something so simple turned into such a big thing. Please like the comment if you agree that people shouldn&#39;t be left in the dust and that they should get friendly attention no matter how they do it.

They were kept in a sealed environment to carefully monitor their oxygen intake so the gas didn&#39;t kill them, since it was toxic in high concentrations. This was before closed circuit cameras so they had only microphones and 5 inch thick glass porthole sized windows into the chamber to monitor them. The chamber was stocked with books, cots to sleep on but no bedding, running water and toilet, and enough dried food to last all five for over a month.<br><br>The test subjects were political prisoners deemed enemies of the state during World War II.<br><br>Everything was fine for the first five days; the subjects hardly complained having been promised (falsely) that they would be freed if they submitted to the test and did not sleep for 30 days. Their conversations and activities were monitored and it was noted that they continued to talk about increasingly traumatic incidents in their past, and the general tone of their conversations took on a darker aspect after the 4 day mark.<br><br>After five days they started to complain about the circumstances and events that lead them to where they were and started to demonstrate severe paranoia. They stopped talking to each other and began alternately whispering to the microphones and one way mirrored portholes. Oddly they all seemed to think they could win the trust of the experimenters by turning over their comrades, the other subjects in captivity with them. At first the researchers suspected this was an effect of the gas itself...<br><br>After nine days the first of them started screaming. He ran the length of the chamber repeatedly yelling at the top of his lungs for 3 hours straight, he continued attempting to scream but was only able to produce occasional squeaks. The researchers postulated that he had physically torn his vocal cords. The most surprising thing about this behavior is how the other captives reacted to it... or rather didn&#39;t react to it. They continued whispering to the microphones until the second of the captives started to scream. The 2 non-screaming captives took the books apart, smeared page after page with their own feces and pasted them calmly over the glass portholes. The screaming promptly stopped.<br><br>So did the whispering to the microphones.<br><br>After 3 more days passed. The researchers checked the microphones hourly to make sure they were working, since they thought it impossible that no sound could be coming with 5 people inside. The oxygen consumption in the chamber indicated that all 5 must still be alive. In fact it was the amount of oxygen 5 people would consume at a very heavy level of strenuous exercise. On the morning of the 14th day the researchers did something they said they would not do to get a reaction from the captives, they used the intercom inside the chamber, hoping to provoke any response from the captives they were afraid were either dead or vegetables.<br><br>They announced: &quot;We are opening the chamber to test the microphones; step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom.&quot;<br><br>To their surprise they heard a single phrase in a calm voice response: &quot;We no longer want to be freed.&quot;<br><br>Debate broke out among the researchers and the military forces funding the research. Unable to provoke any more response using the intercom it was finally decided to open the chamber at midnight on the fifteenth day.<br><br>The chamber was flushed of the stimulant gas and filled with fresh air and immediately voices from the microphones began to object. 3 different voices began begging, as if pleading for the life of loved ones to turn the gas back on. The chamber was opened and soldiers sent in to retrieve the test subjects. They began to scream louder than ever, and so did the soldiers when they saw what was inside. Four of the five subjects were still alive, although no one could rightly call the state that any of them in &#39;life.&#39;<br><br>The food rations past day 5 had not been so much as touched. There were chunks of meat from the dead test subject&#39;s thighs and chest stuffed into the drain in the center of the chamber, blocking the drain and allowing 4 inches of water to accumulate on the floor. Precisely how much of the water on the floor was actually blood was never determined. All four &#39;surviving&#39; test subjects also had large portions of muscle and skin torn away from their bodies. The destruction of flesh and exposed bone on their finger tips indicated that the wounds were inflicted by hand, not with teeth as the researchers initially thought. Closer examination of the position and angles of the wounds indicated that most if not all of them were self-inflicted.<br><br>The abdominal organs below the ribcage of all four test subjects had been removed. While the heart, lungs and diaphragm remained in place, the skin and most of the muscles attached to the ribs had been ripped off, exposing the lungs through the ribcage. All the blood vessels and organs remained intact, they had just been taken out and laid on the floor, fanning out around the eviscerated but still living bodies of the subjects. The digestive tract of all four could be seen to be working, digesting food. It quickly became apparent that what they were digesting was their own flesh that they had ripped off and eaten over the course of days.<br><br>Most of the soldiers were Russian special operatives at the facility, but still many refused to return to the chamber to remove the test subjects. They continued to scream to be left in the chamber and alternately begged and demanded that the gas be turned back on, lest they fall asleep...<br><br>To everyone&#39;s surprise the test subjects put up a fierce fight in the process of being removed from the chamber. One of the Russian soldiers died from having his throat ripped out, another was gravely injured by having his testicles ripped off and an artery in his leg severed by one of the subject&#39;s teeth. Another 5 of the soldiers lost their lives if you count ones that committed suicide in the weeks following the incident.<br><br>In the struggle one of the four living subjects had his spleen ruptured and he bled out almost immediately. The medical researchers attempted to sedate him but this proved impossible. He was injected with more than ten times the human dose of a morphine derivative and still fought like a cornered animal, breaking the ribs and arm of one doctor. When heart was seen to beat for a full two minutes after he had bled out to the point there was more air in his vascular system than blood. Even after it stopped he continued to scream and flail for another 3 minutes, struggling to attack anyone in reach and just repeating the word &quot;MORE&quot; over and over, weaker and weaker, until he finally fell silent.<br><br>The surviving three test subjects were heavily restrained and moved to a medical facility, the two with intact vocal cords continuously begging for the gas demanding to be kept awake...<br><br>The most injured of the three was taken to the only surgical operating room that the facility had. In the process of preparing the subject to have his organs placed back within his body it was found that he was effectively immune to the sedative they had given him to prepare him for the surgery. He fought furiously against his restraints when the anesthetic gas was brought out to put him under. He managed to tear most of the way through a 4 inch wide leather strap on one wrist, even through the weight of a 200 pound soldier holding that wrist as well. It took only a little more anesthetic than normal to put him under, and the instant his eyelids fluttered and closed, his heart stopped. In the autopsy of the test subject that died on the operating table it was found that his blood had triple the normal level of oxygen. His muscles that were still attached to his skeleton were badly torn and he had broken 9 bones in his struggle to not be subdued. Most of them were from the force his own muscles had exerted on them.<br><br>The second survivor had been the first of the group of five to start screaming. His vocal cords destroyed he was unable to beg or object to surgery, and he only reacted by shaking his head violently in disapproval when the anesthetic gas was brought near him. He shook his head yes when someone suggested, reluctantly, they try the surgery without anesthetic, and did not react for the entire 6 hour procedure of replacing his abdominal organs and attempting to cover them with what remained of his skin. The surgeon presiding stated repeatedly that it should be medically possible for the patient to still be alive. One terrified nurse assisting the surgery stated that she had seen the patients mouth curl into a smile several times, whenever his eyes met hers.<br><br>When the surgery ended the subject looked at the surgeon and began to wheeze loudly, attempting to talk while struggling. Assuming this must be something of drastic importance the surgeon had a pen and pad fetched so the patient could write his message. It was simple. &quot;Keep cutting.&quot;<br><br>The other two test subjects were given the same surgery, both without anesthetic as well. Although they had to be injected with a paralytic for the duration of the operation. The surgeon found it impossible to perform the operation while the patients laughed continuously. Once paralyzed the subjects could only follow the attending researchers with their eyes. The paralytic cleared their system in an abnormally short period of time and they were soon trying to escape their bonds. The moment they could speak they were again asking for the stimulant gas. The researchers tried asking why they had injured themselves, why they had ripped out their own guts and why they wanted to be given the gas again.<br><br>Only one response was given: &quot;I must remain awake.&quot;<br><br>All three subject&#39;s restraints were reinforced and they were placed back into the chamber awaiting determination as to what should be done with them. The researchers, facing the wrath of their military &#39;benefactors&#39; for having failed the stated goals of their project considered euthanizing the surviving subjects. The commanding officer, an ex-KGB instead saw potential, and wanted to see what would happen if they were put back on the gas. The researchers strongly objected, but were overruled.<br><br>In preparation for being sealed in the chamber again the subjects were connected to an EEG monitor and had their restraints padded for long term confinement. To everyone&#39;s surprise all three stopped struggling the moment it was let slip that they were going back on the gas. It was obvious that at this point all three were putting up a great struggle to stay awake. One of subjects that could speak was humming loudly and continuously; the mute subject was straining his legs against the leather bonds with all his might, first left, then right, then left again for something to focus on. The remaining subject was holding his head off his pillow and blinking rapidly. Having been the first to be wired for EEG most of the researchers were monitoring his brain waves in surprise. They were normal most of the time but sometimes flat lined inexplicably. It looked as if he were repeatedly suffering brain death, before returning to normal. As they focused on paper scrolling out of the brainwave monitor only one nurse saw his eyes slip shut at the same moment his head hit the pillow. His brainwaves immediately changed to that of deep sleep, then flatlined for the last time as his heart simultaneously stopped.<br><br>The only remaining subject that could speak started screaming to be sealed in now. His brainwaves showed the same flatlines as one who had just died from falling asleep. The commander gave the order to seal the chamber with both subjects inside, as well as 3 researchers. One of the named three immediately drew his gun and shot the commander point blank between the eyes, then turned the gun on the mute subject and blew his brains out as well.<br><br>He pointed his gun at the remaining subject, still restrained to a bed as the remaining members of the medical and research team fled the room. &quot;I won&#39;t be locked in here with these things! Not with you!&quot; he screamed at the man strapped to the table. &quot;WHAT ARE YOU?&quot; he demanded. &quot;I must know!&quot;<br><br>The subject smiled.<br><br>&quot;Have you forgotten so easily?&quot; The subject asked. &quot;We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night. We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread.&quot;<br><br>The researcher paused. Then aimed at the subject&#39;s heart and fired. The EEG flatlined as the subject weakly choked out, &quot;So... nearly... free...&quot;", "comment_date": "2014-02-22T20:02:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aristocatgirl", "comment_text": "I actually cant sleep though it started 2 days ago.
