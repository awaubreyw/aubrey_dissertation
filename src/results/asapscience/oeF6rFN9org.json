Not the same. What a joke weed does indeed do more harm than good to the average person. I am not talking about those who seriously use it for real health issues. I am talking about the majority not the minority of users! The majority of everyday users smoke weed to feel a sense of joy and happiness. They become dependent on that &quot;wake n bake&quot; to start their day out right. If they cant bake right away that person will become moody, irritated, and not at all pleasant to be around!Eventually when their high goes away they are left feeling empty and cannot wait to smoke again.<br><br>     The positive health benefits for the majority of smokers is a mental thing. They feel a sense of satisfaction that they cannot get enough of. It calms their anxiety and nerves. Blah,blah,blah. Well here is the absolute truth. I use to smoke and even made excuses well, it helps my back pain. Well, thanks to my faith in Christ Jesus I don&#39;t need weed to feel satisfied. I don&#39;t need weed to bring me joy and happiness. I don&#39;t need weed to calm my anxiety. I dont need weed for my back pain which is indeed painful on certain days but the strength I have from Jesus helps me get through it.<br><br>      My faith in Christ Jesus is so much better than any drug. When you repent of your sins and truly believe in Jesus Christ and live your life for God. You will have love, peace, and joy like you never felt:)! You want to know the best part those feelings nevet go away;)! Jesus never leaves you. His Holy Spirit comes into you and gives you strength to live a life of holiness, godliness, and righteousness;). Jesus Christ is the only way to God and the only source of everlasting life in Heaven:)!<br><br>     Since my faith in Christ Jesus I am no longer a slave to sin. Jesus gives me the strength to please our Heavenly Father more than my fleshly desires (which are sinful). Do I still sin even though I am a Christian? Yes, lol we all do. Jesus was the only one who was ever without sin He came to earth to destroy the works of the devil. Thats why He was God made flesh. God loved the world so much that He His only begotten son that whosoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life:)! God loves us. Your spouse may not truly love you. Your friends may not always love you. Your mom and dad may not show you love. Your brothers or sisters may not love you. You may feel the world does not love you.<br><br>     I am proof and telling you that there is someone who loves you unconditionally. He says in His Word that He is your brother and friend. His name is Jesus and the Bible says Jesus sticks to those who believe in Him closer than a brother:)! We can&#39;t live righteous and holy lives without Jesus. He says if we repent of our sins. He will forgive us of our sins. He says he will give us the strength to live or lives for God. His Holy Spirit that he gives us power to live righteous and holy and to do right. He gives us love so we can show the same love toward all people that God has shown us. He gives us self control through His Holy Spirit to be able to do whats right and be set free from slavery of sin;)!<br><br>      In the midst of a crazy time. I have never had so much love, joy, and peace. It&#39;s not from drugs, alcohol, entertainment, technology, materials, money, my job, my wife or anything else this broken world has to offer. No my love, joy, and peace comes from faith in my Lord Jesus Christ and He is the only one who brings me happiness:)! You can take everything away from me but no one can separate me from my Lord and Saviour Jesus. God&#39;s Word promises so much for the believer. His Word is truth and it is powerful and living.<br><br>       Anyone can have what I have its free:)! A person is saved by grace through faith in Christ Jesus. The grace of God our Creator saved us only when a person repents and believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Its totally surrendering to Jesus giving Him everything. Give Him your hurt, your shame, your fears, your anxieties, your addictions, your sinful lifestyle, your heart, your soul, and your mind. Give it to Jesus and what you get in return is unspeakable joy, love that is beyond anything of this world, and peace that surpasses all understanding :)!<br><br>      You become a new person when you put God first in your life:)! You won&#39;t want to live as a slave to sin! You won&#39;t want to please your fleshly desires more than your spiritual desires. You will want to please God more than the world. You may not be popular but you have a family of brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus and we are here for eacother to encourage and love one another. God gives us a choice we have free will. Just as in the beginning in the garden of Eden. Adam and Eve had a choice to to obey the only commandment God gave them. That was they could not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. If they did they would surely die. <br><br>       Well, the devil tempted Even and she gave in and gave the forbidden fruit to Adam and then sin entered the world l. We now have another choice God gived us. We can repent and believe in Jesus and receive forgiveness and eternal life or we can deny God and His son Jesus and be lost and a slave to sin. Which sadly results in eternal separation from God and eternal damnation. I chose Jesus and because of my faith in Christ Jesus I have a restored relationship with our Creator and Heavenly Father:)!<br><br>       Jesus is awesome. Read the new testament start with the gospel of John and read till the end:)! Ask God to help you to understand! If you believe with all your heart He will give you wisdom and understanding for the scriptures:). The only way to learn about God is through His Word. After reading John. You will want to keep reading through the end. Read the whole Bible there is so much and its exciting:)! It is indeed the greatest love story:). Read God&#39;s Word everyday, pray to Him everyday, and praise Him everyday. After you have put your faith in Christ Jesus find a church that teaches and preaches the true gospel of Christ Jesus and the Word of God. There are alot of churches that are teaching and preaching falsely. That&#39;s why we need to stay in the Word.", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T15:26:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Syed Qamber Ali", "comment_text": "Make a video on ecstasy", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T12:05:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carla Rachel Bor\u00e9", "comment_text": "Hey, i was just hearing your podcast on marijuana and what happens when you quit?

I was wrong for years having that mindset, realizing the more I got used to it over the years the worse my depression thoughts and paranoia got. Also realizing how much brain cells I&#39;ve actually lost over the years and how it keeps you at a certain mindset. I was a stoner big time but there came a time where I&#39;ve realized how dependent I got on it and how it controlled me and my thoughts for a very long time. Quitting it was SO HARD but come to realize it was the BEST decision I&#39;ve pushed myself to make, realizing how my thoughts actually became more positive then when I was on it and for years couldn&#39;t get rid of my depression &amp; how being sober and actually dealing with your shit without using anything makes you so much more powerful in life.

I&#39;m in my late 50s and when I was younger I smoked pot once in a while maybe about 20 times in my life. And I noticed that a lot of my friends were doing it more often and they were getting addicted and they use the excuse that alcohol is worse. They said it&#39;s natural they said that God gave it to us and we should smoke it etc etc I&#39;ve heard every story out there and I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s okay to grow your own put it in the oven and dry it and do all that stuff. However over the years after I quit smoking that stuff in my twenties I have noticed enormous changes in my friends from the past and they are either bipolar schizophrenic diagnosed with these diseases all of them cannot hold down a job a lot of them are on welfare some have committed suicide after smoking pot a lot of them got killed in an auto accident after smoking pot so I did some research and I said there has to be something bad about marijuana. And everybody should look at the fact it does destroy the brain cells.<br>Now I understand that young people want to try it but it is so addicting after while and people will say I can quit when I want you know it&#39;s almost impossible if they don&#39;t put a lot of effort into it and determination to get off of it. And some say there&#39;s no reason to and they don&#39;t want to well that&#39;s their prerogative. But the worst time to ever smoke marijuana is while you&#39;re young when your brain is developing from youth until your 20 or 21 because it interferes with the hormones it interferes with the firing system of the brain. I feel really sorry for a lot of people who started smoking it at an early age at 10-12 years old and who are now in their 20s and 30s because you definitely can see the difference. But you can&#39;t tell anybody that&#39;s because when you&#39;re young you know it all you&#39;re not as intelligent as somebody he&#39;s been there and done it and seen the terrible results of it I&#39;m sorry to say that please think twice and I&#39;m a mother and I love my kids when my one son smoked it I didn&#39;t go crazy and Reema mode I didn&#39;t yell at him I didn&#39;t swear at him I just said I understand why you&#39;re doing it been there done that. But I told him the dangers of it and him and I had a good relationship between each other you can&#39;t get down on your kids because they&#39;re experimenting everybody&#39;s curious however you don&#39;t have to burn your hand to know what it feels like. Be wise and think about the consequences Watch what it does to other people. Have enough sense and if you&#39;re having a bad time with your parents you can&#39;t communicate with the parents because your parents are jerks then go to a counselor a good counselor not somebody your own age because they may think they know what&#39;s best for you but they don&#39;t live your life with your parents. Take care of yourself everybody who smokes this stuff but I would strongly suggest you do some research. I&#39;ve known guys who can never have children again. And that&#39;s not because it&#39;s a DNA problem it&#39;s because they smoked marijuana too long. And you know you don&#39;t notice this change in yourself until it rears its ugly head 20 years down the road. It&#39;s like putting a frog in hot water the Frog will immediately jump out.

I felt like all the lights where going out and I no longer had control of my thoughts, they seemed to wiz on past me before I could give consent. It wasn&#39;t terrible or even bad... It was just so completely foreign that I was absolutely panicking. Once I came to my senses again, I tried to talk to the people around me, and even though I was screaming they all told me they could barely hear my voice. Or at least, my voice echoing in my brain seemed like screams. Turns out I had taken HUGE DEEP BREATHS of it instead of little puffs for my first time. It only took 3 to do the job, and the weird thing was, I don&#39;t remember how I was reacting to it outside of my thoughts and attempts to communicate with people, but they all said they&#39;d never seen anyone react to the drug in that way. So I kinda overdosed, even though with a drug like pot, it technically isn&#39;t possible to overdose. You cannot harm youself by doing too much pot, but you can do it so much to a point where it is so extreme it isn&#39;t enjoyable. I might consider doing it again, maybe next time I&#39;ll know what the heck is going on instead of thinking it was the end of the world, but we&#39;ll see.

I was a heavy user for 6 years and am speaking from experience when I say I was coughing up black chunks in my flem from it settling in my chest. I suffered from extreme anxiety, depression, and paranoia. I suffered from memory loss. And my mental health was shit, because I was never coping with the true issues at hand. Which usually is the same thing most of us have gone through.. toxicity. Weed makes us unable to work through our emotions and situations appropriately. And it leads us down long wiggled roads at neck breaking paces. This shit is also why so many people believe in government conspiracies, aliens, big foot, and so many mythical or illogical things. They\u2019re looking for something else that isn\u2019t there because they fear the complexity of themselves. It\u2019s a sad reality. I don\u2019t know why so many people keep dancing around the facts of what weed is REALLY doing to our people. So many support it, belittle those that don\u2019t.

LSD while a far more psychedelic and mind-altering drug, does not pose significant dangers in terms of addiction, physiological harm or social degradation. In fact it, along with other classical psychedelics, has an inherent tolerance building effer which generally prevents frequent trips. Whilst certainly capable of aiding a euphoric experienc, LSD does not make you comfortable in a way that is easily craved. People have taken 30-1,000 times the normal dosage (according to some accounts) and had little to speak of in the way of long term harm. For a large number of people, it is an elucidating, beautiful experience which allows reality to be understood in ways that it seems almost unbelieveable to have been without for so long. It is heinous to see LSD lumped in with the most dangerous drugs when I see it as being a potential springboard for positive, nootropic drug use.<br><br>For others, it may be a horrifying experience, but the important thing to remember is that it simply modifies an existing mental environment. Negative experiences can only stem from internal negativity.

Something that happens to me when I am on it is things that normally induce fear no longer induce fear. Like being in the woods at night, going up high, spiders, stuff like that. None of it bothers me when I am high. When high, I lose seconds. Not minutes or huge amounts of time, at maximum a few seconds. It isn&#39;t scary though, it gives you an odd feeling and makes you think deeper. Closing my eyes....well, let&#39;s just say I get some crazy imagery going on when I do that, but everything is always pleasant and enjoyable. I get an incredible feeling of euphoria, this is the absolute best part during my highs. The euphoria comes as feeling overall very happy and comfortable, and waves of extremely pleasant tickling sensations all over my body that make me smile largely or even twitch and laugh. <br><br>If you are looking for a great experience, try some. Though everyone feels different when high. One of my friends tried it and got extremely paranoid and scared, he said he will never do it again, which is totally fine. I wouldn&#39;t if it did that to me. But I am lucky enough to have an amazingly pleasant high, one that gives me the best feeling in the world.

I presume that people curious and yet to try Cannabis are reading the comments. I want to explain why :37 to :54 is so great but it&#39;s so hard until you have tried it.<br>For me, i was listening to music on my music player while stoned for the first time. Closed my eyes and went on a water slide of colour where i had everything i ever wanted given to me within a period of consecutive moments. Possessions, outcomes and anything else. Pure bliss. My first three or so experiences with cannabis were like that and are to this day my most positive memories ever. It&#39;s no surprise i kept doing it. Cannabis is a drug and of course my body soon built up a tolerance. I had to take more and more to achieve even a remotely similar experience to my first few times. Eventually i took an absurd dose to get an unreal feeling like one of my first times and instead i experienced the paranoia properties of cannabis. I was so out of this world that i thought i was going to be murdered. It&#39;s been three years since then and to this day while sober i still have strange deja vu like feelings that freak me out and make me feel like my life is a dream and i&#39;m about to be murdered. I&#39;ll be at work and have a panic attack and have to go on break to hide it. (I do mild doses of pot about once a month but i don&#39;t don&#39;t do any other drugs other than alcohol fyi)<br>Cannabis is a beautiful drug, but don&#39;t continue chasing after it&#39;s beauty or you&#39;ll ruin it like i did. Just be careful. It&#39;s cool and all but not to be abused. I abused it and now i can&#39;t enjoy it to its maximum potential.", "comment_date": "2017-06-16T15:58:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rian indra jaya", "comment_text": "&quot;marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substances known to man.&quot; Judge Francis Young (DEA).", "comment_date": "2017-06-16T11:57:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cian Healy", "comment_text": "Who else watched this high", "comment_date": "2017-06-16T01:57:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blixks & dums Ptbm", "comment_text": "i love weed its my Soulmate cuz im a flourist :D", "comment_date": "2017-06-14T15:34:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YokiPoki", "comment_text": "So basically there&#39;s nothing unhealthy or dangerous effects done to your brain, sor go ahead and smoke your face off.", "comment_date": "2017-06-13T13:28:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jon Snow knows nothing", "comment_text": "* Puff puff * <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Pass.", "comment_date": "2017-06-11T12:07:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NoBot617", "comment_text": "Ima go take a fat bong rip now", "comment_date": "2017-06-10T17:57:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richi Kolbe", "comment_text": "Weed cures cancer.", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T23:22:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tomas", "comment_text": "bruh, I feel like you just throwing difficult words in my ears to make it sound like you know what you&#39;re talking about. its good tho", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T16:16:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dj Farr", "comment_text": "What effects does marijuana have on yourself", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T01:35:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jose Kishingszz", "comment_text": "Question?

I suffered from anxiety and depression and one night, my sister and her boyfriend decided I should hit the bong just once. Well this hit was something fierce, as I had gone into a paralysis after a few minutes and thinking I was about to die, of course that was very unlikely. I could not speak nor open my eyes I could only hear. I remember being in this confined open space; Like I was inside my mind. I was feeling utter terror and I could hear my sister freaking out, that was no help lol. Her boyfriend however was calm. I remember him saying that everything is going to be okay, just enjoy it. Then all of a sudden my playlist from Spotify was playing. I couldn&#39;t do anything but enjoy every little detail about the songs. I was feeling happy. Like happy beyond comprehension.<br><br>Eventually I was standing up and I saw myself there on the couch sleeping. I still could hear the music though. I was weightless and could do whatever I wanted, even fly. I went into the air and observed the city from high above the land. Just then, I hear Flower Duet by Lakme and began to see these majestic fractal butterflies gracefully fluttering all around as this deep dark blue sky was illuminated with so many stars. This world was amazing and I never wanted to leave. I flew over the city and eventually saw my childhood neighborhood. While I was flying I encountered this person who I have not seen before but their presence felt very familiar. Like we&#39;ve known each other since birth. They said, &quot;It&#39;s so good to see you again! Having fun?&quot; Soon enough though I found myself back in the room I was sleeping in, feeling heavy and then my memory fades there. I woke up, still listening to music. I was still trying to recuperate from the knock out. But that dream, it felt pretty real and it felt really nice.<br><br>Since that day, I&#39;ve a better understanding of who I am need am no longer depressed. I wish I could visit that dream again though. It truly was beautiful and I want to know who that person was.

I&#39;m talking about stress (seeds, sticks, and leaves) if it&#39;s a dense, nice smelling, bright bud it&#39;s most likely good, just be careful for pesticides, mold, and over dryness. but don&#39;t be to quick to judge some may not look the part but will be just as strong as others. at the end of the day no one can tell you what strain is best for you except yourself, but from personal experience (my anxiety was debilitating couldn&#39;t leave my house or even relax in my own bed without feeling like I&#39;m having a heart attack) I&#39;d go for the og&#39;s. H.A OG, Tahoe, Tahoe OG, Skywalker etc (a lot more info on the leafly app). Also don&#39;t give up if the first kind you try makes your anxiety worse, try a few others, even try a sativa it just may work for you it affects everyone differently. Just don&#39;t fight it and tell yourself it will work and let the weed do its thing. also i&#39;ve noticed that if I&#39;m already having anxiety the weed doesn&#39;t take it away, it puts me in a state of mind where I can more easily stop thinking the bad thoughts and start thinking positive ones , stopping my anxiety. good luck with your journey I wish you all happiness and health.

My name is Kenneth. And this is my story. I try to make it simple. When i finished my 9 classes i came out of school. My meaning was to search myself and try to understand myself better. So i was like 6 months home, doing basically nothing. Playing computer cames, searching who i am and so. So i found myself from the knowledge i gathered and i was ready to go to school agen to 10 class.  But that 6 months had a dark side too. I became unsocial and had bad thoughts and i was unhappy too.  It was like spiritually bad because i was unsocial. And then i smoked marijuana and it was like a bad trip. And i got really bad anxiety and paranoia. I had death thoughts suicide thoughts. I fell asleep and the next morning i felt normal. But something else happened. I got the next day when i was recovered from the bad trip anxiety and heart pumpin and bad thoughts and i felt weird. And it didnt go off and i felt very paranoid about it. It was very very bad. So it didnt go off so i went to the hospital and they basically figured out that i have depression  and that and put me on anti depressants. I didnt have any other choice because of the very big anxiety, bad thoughts, heart pumpin. And now i havve been on anti depressants for 6 months - half a year. So what did marijuana actually driggered in my mind. What did it do to my mind. And what do you guys think of it. Note that i am sure that anti depressants are not the right way at all. They are only managind the symptoms. But whats the ultimate true healing for my soul and spirit. What kind of psychedelics will heal my mind. Because i feel its the only way. I think that maybe cannabis was a way of healing ? Mushrooms, dmt, ayahuasca, lsd, thc, mescaline, I think that somewhere there lies the true answer. To heal my from the roots and make me free spirit agen. Because every problem is in our soul. Spirit and heart are the mirrors of the soul. Soul is our root. And psychedelics heal the soul.  So i shared my healing thoughts too. So my question to you the people is what that marijuana truly made with my mind. And what is the right and true healing for me. Whats the true cure for todays so called &#39;&#39;depression&#39;&#39;. I hope that someone who is experienced on psychedelics will read this share his/her knowledge on this subject.

I kept thinking about trying these stuffs because I want to experience it myself. So one day while in college I asked one of my friend, who smokes marijuana if I can join him. He said yes we we went to his house.<br><br>He took out crumbled marijuana and rolled a joint and gave it to me. He told me to inhale it. So the first time in my whole damn fking 18 years of my life I inhaled. I didn&#39;t get high, and he told me I did it wrong. So I tried the 2-3 times, I didn&#39;t get high. But the substance started to kick in after my 4-5th tries. I felt dizzy, relaxed but only by a bit. Btw he smoked too. But he&#39;s like totally lost it. His eyes were fking red, his face muscles are all relaxed. He&#39;s like a fking sloth, too tired to do anything. I got high only by a bit, so it is still bare able. About half and hour later he called McD and we ordered some burgers and fries and I went home.\u00a0<br><br>I \u00a0was not satisfied, so I told him I wanted to try it again. But this time we did it in a &quot;hotbox&quot;, or his car. We walked to the parking lot and went into his car and for christ sake it smells like drugs as soon as you enter in it. So he blasted some EDM music and took out marijunana and once again rolled it into a joint. This time I was ready and I learned my techniques and I inhaled the smoke. 7-8th inhalation was all it took to make me high.\u00a0<br><br>My legs and arms went numb as I just sat on shotgun. My eyes went red, my face got tired, everything was just soo relaxed. I didn&#39;t think about anything at all, as I just sat there trying to fall asleep. He got it bad too, just like a fking sloth. Then after some time we got out of his car and I went straight to the nearest sofa to sleep. Jesus christ I tell you every thought was racing through my mind. Some crazy conversations I had ever. I saw like spinning elephants and doge. Overall I just got fking tired on the outside, but fking crazy on the inside.\u00a0<br><br>Back in the train, I got scared because I don&#39;t want anybody to suspect me from taking drugs because my eyes were still fking red, so I closed my eyes and slept. I slept all the way throughout the commute until I reached my home.\u00a0<br><br>-----<br><br>My advise, if you wanna try it. Go somewhere secluded or quiet. I did it in public and it fking sucks!!!! I had to take so many precautions to avoid getting arrested. It is not addictive as that is my 2nd and last time I will gonna smoke it.

It should be prescribed by doctors either for illness of stress issues. So many people state &#39;&#39;weed is harmless&quot; when that&#39;s not the reality. Weed can effect people differently, some it can help relax and inspire but if your mental state is not in good condition you can end up super paranoid and depressed. I had that happen to me, when I initially used it it would relax me but the last time I ended up a mess due to feeling depressed before smoking it. I was super paranoid and felt out of control and suicidal, it was one of the scariest things I&#39;ve ever had happen. People shouldn&#39;t be promoting it in a way of saying everyone should do it, because they shouldn&#39;t.

So all of those cancer surveys you guys are floating around to tote weed is like me sending out aspirin articles and telling people that it&#39;s good to eat the willow bark it comes from.

Keep in mind that cardiovascular health problems kill more US citizens than any other cause of death.\u00a0<br>- A lot of people seem to think that marijuana only negatively affects your brain in large quantities. This is totally false. The key heuristic in examining the detriments of marijuana is not the size of the dose, but rather the frequency.

Just by doing 5 minutes of research you will see\u00a0physiologically what occurs to the brain when you smoke, and if you have an IQ higher than that of a Gerbil you will notice that the Axon&#39;s are not depleted or strained (unlike most drug&#39;s out there). The video gave a very basic context to what occur&#39;s when THC is introduced into our blood stream, and yet I still read comment&#39;s saying &quot;this video made no sense&quot;, &quot;pot head&#39;s smell&quot;.\u00a0<br>I&#39;m sure these are the same people who consume alcohol (make&#39;s you act like Luiz Suarez and make&#39;s your breath smell like Guantanamo Bay floor&#39;s) or over consume incredible amounts of food (not even going to get into that topic from what I&#39;ve seen during clinical placements in hospitals).<br>My teen life sucked, I was depressed and never found a valid reason to get out of bed in the morning, I always felt like the dumber person in the room, my family was beyond broke, I went to school hungry most days. And surprise surprise I tried weed (If you felt how I felt, you would swallow rock&#39;s if someone told you it would make you feel better.) Nothing was instantaneous, HOWEVER, I for the first time in my life felt interested in life, friends, science, hell...I even got curious as to how the stock market works.<br>Long story short, I&#39;ve been smoking for eight year&#39;s now. I went from a loner and being depressed to having friends and even making into the School of Medicine in University of Otago (not before finishing my nursing degree). Now this is the internet and anyone can claim to be whom ever they wish, so I don&#39;t expect anyone to believe (I would do the same in most cases). That however is not my point, my point is that each person is different, and to judge a mass of people due to two or perhaps three run in&#39;s you have had with an &#39;pot head&#39; is down right mind boggling.<br>If this is how we people treat each other these day&#39;s, then I have no doubt in my mind the world will spiral to a endless pit of anger and resentment, one that is somehow stronger than the evil that exists today.

Even infrequent pot smokers were more than twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as non-smokers.

Go to the official MIT collegiate website and you&#39;ll find that a common myth/propaganda about weed is that it kills brain cells and government officials are finally starting to admit it. The ONLY study where weed killed any brain cells was the experiment decades ago when researches strapped masks to monkeys and fed them the equivalent to 30 joints in smoke with no oxygen going to the brain. It was the lack of oxygen killing brain cells not the weed. I will admit there is one harmful effect of cannibis and that&#39;s smoking it. Smoke in your body is not healthy in any form. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re smoking weed/tobacco/ or dried carrots, any type of inhaling smoke is unhealthy.

While the first time I Smoked very little that it helped me relax a bit, I felt no change in my brain, or rather my body because I smoked sucha low dosage.<br><br>Let&#39;s fast forward, my fourth usage I smoked a lot more than I had before since my friend I was smoking with had persuaded me to smoke more by saying smoking more will make me less depressed which was a big PLUS for me. So I kept at it.\u00a0<br><br>The effects of this were unlike anything I have ever had in my entire life, the other 3 times I had smoked weed it was just my body feeling heavy, and I was laughing more than usual. But this time, I was not able to process time properly, I would look at my phone and what should have been a 40 minute walk only took 2 minutes to me, it was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeF6rFN9org&amp;t=9m38s\">9:38</a> when I looked at my phone, and suddenly I appeared at my destination at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeF6rFN9org&amp;t=9m40s\">9:40</a>. But when I looked away from my phone and back suddenly time jumped a whole lot from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeF6rFN9org&amp;t=9m40s\">9:40</a> to the proper time of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeF6rFN9org&amp;t=10m14s\">10:14</a> or some random time I have already forgotten. Everything my friend said, I would only process around 10 minutes later and reply to that comment, confusing my friend.\u00a0<br><br>I would have constant black outs, one I had when we arrived at A&amp;W. I was standing at the counter for a large portion of time apparently, and suddenly i was sitting down eating what I apparently ordered. I couldn&#39;t figure out what was happening to me. I wasn&#39;t able to recount for those black outs. Suddenly I blacked out again and had an outer body experience watching myself walk to tree and urinate, I finally came back to my mind frame and to my surprise I was an elementary school parking lot, apparently my friend told me we were just silently walking there after he suggested it.\u00a0<br><br>After I went home(Somehow can;t even puzzle that together either.) I fell asleep, woke up and apparently the effects never left, I still had moments where i would phase in and out of conscious thought, and would arrive at a destination that used to seem longer but thanks to my random black outs have been less lengthy.<br><br>I smoked it again another few times because of my anxiety and further increasing depression on this matter, and now I actually don&#39;t feel the same. I can&#39;t structure a proper sentence, my mind has a hard time learning new things, and recalling past memories has become a daunting and much harder task than it used to be, I feel like my memory has been affected and altered, and my perception of time has been horribly changed as well. I feel.. in a sense dumber than before and I can&#39;t properly describe things. This post itself took me a large amount of time just to write. I cannot perceive things the same anymore.<br><br>Am I actually dumber because of Weed smoking? Will I ever get back to normal? Will the toxins provided by weed that are now in my brain ever leave? Or am I like this until I die?\u00a0<br><br>Please if you actually read this PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE respond :( I am actually wanting to know as I am actually really terrified at my mental health and feel regret for my weak decision to smoke weed as a means to escape what I thought was depression.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-05-08T09:20:17Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "FloGrownDipper", "comment_text": "Can weed take harsh effects on 14 year olds?

I am 17.  The first time i smoked weed was when i was 15.  During this time, i lost all drive and my grades fell to a SHOCKINGLY LOW 3.45 gpa.  At this moment, my parents who found out said there was probably no hope for me.  At this point i cleaned up my act and lived a sobre summer.  School started again and my grades fell even more when i didn&#39;t smoke.  I lost my purpose in life and didn&#39;t have drive.  I was being drug tested so i didn&#39;t use weed.  Instead, i took LSD.  I took 1 tab, and while tripping i stupidly took the other 11 tabs, freaked out, thought i was paralized, and went to the hospitle.  It took almost a full week to get better, but when i did, I WAS REBORN!!!  I shot my current gpa up to a 4.0 and became an outgoing and loving being who realized my true loving soul!!  I have wonderful drive and found my way through LSD.  I can&#39;t describe most of my lessons learned, for most things learned were emotions of insanity, love, and raw fear.  I stared straight into my inner soul and it chewed me up and spit me out.  I was literally reborn.  Afterwards, i eventually gained trust back and havn&#39;t been drug tested in a while.  I had a 23 ACT score.  Average and nothing to be proud of.  I started losing my motivation again after about 5 months since the LSD trip.  I went on to pick back up weed, shrooms, and DMT, and now my ACT is a wonderful 32!! I have truely found myself and the wonders of the universe through psychedelics.  Many people who use them completely abuse them and don&#39;t use them for purposes i do.  I use them to fine all the wonder in the world and as a way to help me find my true spiritual consciousness.  I learn and grow from them.  Sure, i have some of the greatest times of my life on them, but i don&#39;t use them for the high.  I use them to give me a greater appreciation of life, nature, and people all around me.  I use them not to escape this world, but to connect with it and think for myself.  I have never been more alive and currently smoke weed every day while i continue my journey and accomplish far more than the majority of others my age.  I have greatly surpassed my fellow young adults and it is truely thanks to psychedelics.  Not that they MADE me this way, but that i was and have been able to use them as tools to appreciate and grow in life.  I love you all.  These drugs are definitly not for everyone, and are abused, but they have truely been something special and positive in my wonderful life.  For those of you like me, i have one word of advise.  Don&#39;t let others control you.  Be your own man and be your own original self.  The only thing holding you back is yourself and others, and for the most part, you have control over both of those.

I have recently learned a little bit about decarboxylation. Could the higher psychoactive content be the trigger? Could it be my own thoughts, my environment, or a chemistry issue? I am 36yo now, in my 20&#39;s I had smoked A LOT of phx ditch weed(sativa dominant). I loved every bit of it aside from the perfume, mold, ammonia, and urine smell usually accompanied with our mexi flower from the south. That said, my weed only recently started triggering massive anxiety attacks after the onset of anxiety itself. Up until about 2009 I had never dealt with an anxiety issue. Time went on, I started to blame weed in general. Then we in Arizona voted in the MMJ program, I joined NORML, and started learning more about all the other compounds in this stuff. I noticed the higher the CBD count, I was less likely to have anxiety from smoking. I am curious, in the act of eating it, is there an omission of the psychoactive compound &quot;THC&quot;? Is it science or consciousness? Side note: I was recently diagnosed with PTSD, the anxiety has been debilitating. Eating it seems to work better for me than the benzodiazepines. But through state access, pharms are free. As for my weed intake, I get it far and few between through donation. Let me tell you, most would rather make a dollar than concern themselves.

Therefore in order to reach liberty, we should be allowed to smoke marijuana, given that it is in our own private homes/property. However you should not be allowed to smoke anything in public. This is where the justice system comes in, the effects of these drugs, both through the individual&#39;s actions and the physical second hand smoke, cannot be allowed. Yes, you may think u can drive &quot;fine&quot; while high. But the reality is that your motor skills are slowed down, somewhat significantly. If we are allowed to drink in our own home, which is certainly more dangerous to ourselves than marijuana, then we should be able to smoke marijuana whenever we want, but in our own time. <br><br><br>One more note to the people who say marijuana is not addictive, although it may not be physically addictive, it is mentally addictive. Most heavy users will agree and if u don&#39;t then try to quit and tell me how it goes, it won&#39;t be easy. You become become addicted to the feeling of being high, same as<br>Being drunk. To say that marijuana isn&#39;t addictive is like saying that dogs don&#39;t like food. It is natural to like the feeling of marijuana, and you want more of that feeling.

I disagree with this video only in that I think people can keep those accelerated experiences - it&#39;s responsible for a lot of creativity in the world I think. Really big with music people - I think something about the physical process of playing music works well with it.\u00a0<br><br>Smoking anything can clog the lungs but the amount of weed one smokes is nothing compared to the amount of work a cigarette addiction puts your lungs through - anyone without asthma will probably be fine, so beyond that, THC is very powerful antioxidant and acts as a neuroprotectant for this reason - it may even prevent brain cancer to a degree, but that&#39;s incredibly hard to study.<br><br>Nothing has been discovered with weed that is harmful, it appears to be an associative toxin - the purpose of these chemicals in nature is probably to discourage hebivory. Most herbivores are prey animals and become very distressed by a chemical that makes them sleepy and confused because it makes them likely to be eaten, anything that makes them unable to flee is upsetting and to be avoided - after this first exposure they avoid the very distinct smell of marijuana blossoms, which otherwise would have made a sap-rich energy-packed meal for it. So the key is actually the smoking part - the fire changes it, it burns up some of the lighter cannabinoids that would be involved in making you the sort of paralyzed-stoned one can get when he eats two extra pot brownies because he didn&#39;t think the first one was doing anything. Happy, but unable to move much or speak and giggles at everything for four hours. I imagine this is the response the plant evolved to produce and the &quot;high&quot; part is mostly due to our special way of getting to the cannabinoids.<br><br>There&#39;s also two other things to consider, horticulture and tolerance. Whatever the hundreds and thousands of bred and cross-bred strains of weed are now is highly different than their genetic source - not unlike the way all dogs descended from the wolf, yet, clearly have become tons of other things. Weed has been bred for bud size and cannabinoid content for so long that the weed we raise is probably 50 times as potent as what you&#39;d find if you really cared to go search the Hindu Kush mountains for a wild kush bush, and like dogs, people&#39;s opinions and techniques have pushed it in all kinds of directions. I have had weed I swear to god did nothing but make me feel like I was insane (Jack Herer, ick!) , but this is rare I think just the result of a few breeder&#39;s bad taste - massive THC content with nothing else going on. On the other hand I&#39;ve had crossbreeds I swear to god were high art, most of them ending in &quot;Kush&quot;. Here&#39;s the thing - THC is far from the only cannabinoid and I think ideally a good strain is one that&#39;s expressing a strong amount of other cannabinoids too, especially CBD. I&#39;ve had a strain (Harlequin) that was raised for pressing to make CBD rich pain-killing oil, I mean smoked them, you really don&#39;t get a big high - until you realize you can mix it with kush and it&#39;s the best thing ever. So when scientists and whatnot talk only about THC and it&#39;s effects when talking about weed it&#39;s like - like we&#39;re not even talking about the same thing. There&#39;s probably 50-100+ substances yet to be described by anyone floating around in your average bowl and they&#39;ve barely studied the ones they&#39;ve already discovered.\u00a0<br><br>And then for tolerance, well, what this video describes is more like smoking the first couple of times - before your body produces metabolites from the cannabinoids and circulates them (this is what they detect with drug tests). They mediate the high and make it much less intense and racing, you&#39;re able to hold onto those cool thoughts if you choose. It&#39;s important for non-stoners to remember that stoners are not getting NEARLY as high as said non-stoner got the one time they tried weed, not even a tenth that high.", "comment_date": "2014-03-22T22:30:07Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "airikitascave", "comment_text": "LMAO, Double Rainbow reference.", "comment_date": "2014-03-22T19:25:27Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Zombie Slayer", "comment_text": "Yeah, science bitch\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-03-22T17:10:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MarkS", "comment_text": "im so high", "comment_date": "2014-03-22T09:45:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jimmy Zheng", "comment_text": "<b>After the video</b> Pot heads: GOTTA SMOKE SOME MORE", "comment_date": "2014-03-22T08:14:12Z", "likes_count": 18}, {"comment_by": "Kyle Matheson", "comment_text": "Marijuana makes me a better person.", "comment_date": "2014-03-22T05:05:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jinyu Gui", "comment_text": "how do i get my brother to stop smoking for good? i dont like smoking especialy because it can harm my brother", "comment_date": "2014-03-22T01:21:26Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "kurt", "comment_text": "why did u highlight the base of the brain in red??", "comment_date": "2014-03-21T21:32:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Canned", "comment_text": "The only huge negative effect of weed is your motor skills because it can last for about month when you take weed\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-03-21T19:44:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BZA Arthur", "comment_text": "Calm and have anxiety on the same blunt??

Now, while getting high a couple times actually does have more benefits than cons, it is in no way beneficial to smoke on a regular daily basis. I used to smoke every single day, for a couple of months actually I smoked multiple times a day. I suffered from issues such as: depression, social anxiety, insomnia, and even schizophrenia. So, weed itself isn&#39;t bad, but the overuse of it is. Much like anything else in the world. If you eat too much broccoli, you get a kidney stone. If you drink too much water, you could scientifically drown. Moderation with marijuana is key to using it.<br><br>If you don&#39;t want to read any facts on the effect on the brain, then stop reading this comment now.\u00a0<br><br>Our brains all have this thing called the &quot;Endocannabinoid System.&quot; It is responsible for various functions we use in our day-to-day lives, such as: sleeping, appetite, depression control (let&#39;s call it that), brain development, stress response, and many others. What happens when you smoke cannabis is you introduce your brain to the plant&#39;s &quot;Phytocannabinoids.&quot; These extra cannabinoids are seen as so similar to the brain&#39;s that they are used in the same way. The more you use cannabis, the more external cannabinoids your brain is receiving; allowing for less production of it&#39;s own &quot;Endos.&quot; This only happens after a prolonged time of constant cannabis smoking, so it&#39;s not as serious as smoking crack or meth, but it will kind of, &quot;dull&quot; your life - so to speak.\u00a0<br><br>Conclusion: Getting high 2-3 times a week is going to do you no more harm than just a little weakening to your lungs (that doesn&#39;t even make that much of a noticeable difference honestly). But the overuse of it will have effects that seem like they are &quot;running you down.&quot; So, weed is indeed a good thing, just know how to maintain your usage.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-02-18T17:12:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rosa Aguilar", "comment_text": "~.~", "comment_date": "2014-02-18T02:54:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Barton", "comment_text": "I have a burning question: What is the science of why men talk with an effeminate voice?
