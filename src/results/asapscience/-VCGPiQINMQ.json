I&#39;m also finding it fascinating how big a role language/word use in the puzzles has impacted people differently, with words like &quot;switching&quot; having a different connotation to some people - I hadn&#39;t totally thought of that before!

But ironically, removing that piece was my first thought, the second was, oh shit no we can&#39;t, the Lego man wouldn&#39;t fit. So my solution to the problem was putting a block on top of the roof, right above the red piece, so the roof was between the one you were supposed to move and the new one. That would help in real life if you should even out the weight. If you put too much weight at the edge, it would tip. But, putting weight on top of the place where its most stable, will make it possible to put more weight on the edges too. Think of a table top thats not attached to anything, it just balances on one block underneath. To make it more stable, the solution is to put more weight where it&#39;s already stable. Of course, you could just remove the piece under the table and just put the table top on the floor, but it wouldn&#39;t be a table then, would it?  <br><br>Also.. Being a person who&#39;s been bullied  for years, and learned that I&#39;m never good enough for anyone, I&#39;ve always wondered what I could do with myself to be more perfect. What should I add? Perfect clothes, better makeup, etc. Nah, I should just remove that toxic thought process and remove those toxic people in my life. Problem solved. I&#39;ve already done that, that&#39;s not what I figured out from this video. But it&#39;s interesting that many of us automatically think the solution is to add something. <br>Based on my upbringing, taking away something to make it better never made any sense (of what I was told by adults). Because that meant I ruined it. I took something important away that was supposed to be there, I just didn&#39;t know the importance of it.

But before I get into them I want to make it clear that I am a huge fan of this channel and have been for MANY years. The first and most obvious was already addressed in your pinned comment, was the language used in the prompt of the first problems asking the viewer if they could &quot;switch&quot; the blocks, how would they make them symmetrical. Also, the height of the doll, but I get that you were working with what you had. I think this is ironic considering the point is that how the choice of language determines how participants solve problems.<br>\r<br>Second is to say that, regarding subtracting as a solution, people in the neurodiversity and disability communities have been trying to make the point about removing barriers, both literal and metaphorical, for decades. Its the needlessly complex systems that often hamper the those of us that are the the most disadvantaged in society. It feels very similar to the way that quarantine taught us that many of the accommodations that these two groups were asking for such as working from home and curbside delivery were not needed until the rest of society decided it was. <br>Lastly, you make that point that its often the case that subtracting from a situation can be a valuable way to solve problems, decrease financial burden, reduce stress, and not play into the capitalist mindset. Then you go on to promote a subscription service. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Skill Share seems like a really neat thing. As someone who loves learning as a hobby I&#39;ve often thought about getting a subscription. However, I feel like it made the message of simplifying very disingenuous and the sponsorship seem very counterintuitive. <br>I hope that these points will be heard and taken in good faith as they were written. Again, I love your channel and I can&#39;t tell you how much I&#39;ve learned from you over the years. Keep doin what you guys do.

That means that you need to use addition to solve the puzzle.<br>How much did you earn with your solution? $1.10? That would mean you earn more than what you just said that you could. Which invalidates that solution.<br>You also primed people to think about adding blocks, when you spelled it out where you could put them.<br>You also didn&#39;t mention that it was possible to remove the support block, it is more logical to think that you try to keep the roof from collapsing by adding more support to it.<br>Since removing the only support it has, will definitely make it collapse. Unless you would support the roof while doing so, but then you would have solved the puzzle by adding while trying to solve the puzzle by subtracting. There is simply no way that you can solve the puzzle by subtracting without solving the puzzle by adding. (unless blowing up the support and hoping for the roof to fall down in a nice manner, is something you see as a solution.)<br>The reason why people didn&#39;t think about removing stuff, is because it is simply not a solution in real life.<br>(also, the Lego man is too tall for your solution, so your solution didn&#39;t work from the getgo.)<br><br>In the second puzzle, you said the word switch, which a lot of people will have interpreted as switching a green block with a white block. (since the previous puzzle was also about blocks, it is normal to see the white spaces as blocks and not as empty spaces.)<br><br>For the third puzzle, it is normal to add to an existing structure. Nobody is willing to destroy something while trying to make things better. What if they are wrong? If they added something, they can just remove it. If they broke something while removing something, now they can&#39;t add it again. (What if that corner bar is glued to the sides. If you remove it and have no glue, then you can&#39;t put it back.)<br>It builds on the premise that you don&#39;t know what made it work in the first place, but you are willing to trust that the original was good, to begin with, and you are just there to add something to it. Adding to it will also give you the ability to dodge complete failure, since you are only responsible for what you added, and nothing of the base structure was changed by you. Changing something about the base structure will magically make you completely responsible for it, and all the failures it had that you didn&#39;t change, suddenly become your mistakes.<br><br>You will not think about removing things when cleaning for multiple reasons. If you clean someone else&#39;s room, you are practically forbidden to remove things, unless explicitly asked for permission. (You only make that mistakes once. Unless you are an idiot or the person that lets you clean its room is an idiot) If you clean your own room, then you are busy with the cleaning aspect and don&#39;t want to deal with the questions, if you are going to use, or find a use for all that stuff. That is why many people just put those things aside. They have the illusion that they will figure it out later.<br><br>So the reason why people can solve problems with subtracting is simple. It makes far more problems than solve problems. The best way to remove something is by replacing it with something better. And when nobody is still using the old thing, then you remove it. The richest cultures are the cultures that tried to change a lot, but didn&#39;t manage to switch over everybody from the old to the new. And ended up making things worse. And the new people came around and try to remove the old again, and again, made it worse. So look at your culture and see how many new things there are with respect to old things. If your history dates back 1000 of years like the Japanse culture, then you know that nobody is removing anything. If it&#39;s like North Korea, then you know that adding is pointless as it will be removed when your back is turned. You can hear it in the language people use. There are people who talk about improving and making things better. And there are people that talk about changing things for the better or optimize their performance. (or worse: make it fit in their standard, adapt it to their way of living)<br><br>So this puzzle doesn&#39;t test your capabilities in problem serving, it just tests your culture.
