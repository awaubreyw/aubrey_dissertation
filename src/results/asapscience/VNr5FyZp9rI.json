This is, however, completely untrue. For example, bulldogs (which have the worst problems with inbreeding, even more than pugs), have a hard time breathing, and even tend to have underbites which make eating very difficult for them. One example of why inbreeding is bad for plants is the potato. When they were first discovered in Peru by Europeans, the Europeans brought two potato plants back to Europe. Up until the Irish Potato Famine, every potato in Europe was a descendent of those two potatoes. What was the cause of the Irish Potato Famine? A rare genetic disease. What can make such diseases more common? As he already said, inbreeding can.

Bhrama realised the beauty of sound and he wanted to Express himself through her.<br><br> (So according to Hinduism, the universe is said to be created with an &quot;OM&quot; or &quot;AUM&quot; sound with a  Big bang according to Shiva&#39;s Natraja statue)<br> <br> So Bhrama asked her to marry him. But she said since he created her, she is like his daughter and refused him . but he kept on insisting. Lord Shiva got so angry that he cut off Bhrama&#39;s head , thus warning mankind of Incest. Incest is not to be practised at any cost.<br> Since then we never worship Lord Bhrama ever in idol form. We just consider ourselves as a part of Him,the Cosmos.<br>This was of father and daughter.<br><br>About Brother and sister I suggest anyone interested to read about the amazing story of Devyani and Kacha. They weren&#39;t even real siblings yet just by considering someone as a sister or a brother , one should also avoid any sexual relationship with them. <br>Also, Hindus celebrate a festival called Raksha Bandhan where every girl ties a Rakhi to her brothers(cousins included) . This applies to every man she considers as her brother. <br>So men usually avoid the girls they have a crush on, on that day, cuz you never know if she comes with a Rakhi towards him he&#39;ll have to accept it and treat her as a sister.

Their children have blue eyes. So the blue alleles gene just didn&#39;t happen by accident, it didn&#39;t happen just once, but it was passed on to 3 of their offspring. So this means that the blue alleles gene can hide in someone who has brown eyes, which means that both of your parents do not have to have blue eyes for you to obtain blue eye color. So does this mean that some black people have the blue alleles gene hidden? In that case what causes black people to have blue eyes, i have seen two black parents with brown eyes having a child with blue eyes. What causes this gene to come out on non-Caucasian people?", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T20:03:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daisy Squidge", "comment_text": "<b>I have an extra toe!</b>", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T17:51:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheKnowledgeEgg", "comment_text": "I had an ad longer than the video itself lmao", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T10:23:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "awebite", "comment_text": "Well...

Heart disease, stroke, cancer, depression, asthma, gout, peptic ulcers, cereal palsy increase over time of frequent inbreeding amongst humans. Inbreeding is highly prevalent globally and its effects may explain some of the observed differences in disease prevalence among different populations.

Inbreeding gradually removes heterozygotes, and natural selection can then work on the resulting pure individuals (recessive purebreeds die), resulting in more fit individuals. Sounds great... except that removing genetic variation in the population is not favourable if conditions are changing, as it reduces the chance that some individual is able to thrive in the new environment (natural selection can&#39;t act on no variation). <br><br>Bottom line: inbreeding is best in steady environments, while outcrossing is better in changing environments, at least in the grand scheme of things.", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T23:55:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MissingNo0001", "comment_text": "Why is this on my recommended", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T23:55:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kisho", "comment_text": "I was just learning about dominant alleles and recessive alleles in my Bio class", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T23:54:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bas Hamers", "comment_text": "Well know we know where libtards come from", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T23:54:11Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Frozen Hispanic", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know how I feel about incest.

Also, inbreeding is only an issue if close line breeding is done for multiple generations. Mutts are NOT healthier than breeds. That&#39;s a misconception. A first generation mutt may be fine, but all generations after that are just as likely to have issues as the parents were. Think about mixed kids. They may only inherit race specific disease traits from each parent (white and black), but who will they marry? Likely someone mixed, white, or black carrying the same recessive genes..... So, this sort of fear mongering about inbreeding in humans is more than a big misleading and uneducated. This video was better than some, but ti still missed hitting the nail on the head. Our ancestors bred for thousands of years. We carry those same inbred genes today, and most of us are fine.

There is a portion of your genetic code that is randomized every time offspring are created. This is how mutations in the code come about as well as the interaction between the parents&#39; respective chromosomes. Also, while you are correct that inbreeding does not directly cause new mutations, the less genetic diversity that is available for randomization, the statistical probability for dangerous mutations (rather than harmless ones, like red hair) to occur does go up. It&#39;s like drawing from a random assortment of 100 different colored beads and the bad mutations are represented by drawing two of the same color family (like sky blue and turquoise); now imagine that there is more of the same colors in the bag you are drawing from, so that there are only 75 or further down the line, 50 different colors. Now the odds of drawing 2 similar colored beads (representative of the dangerous mutation) are much higher. So, preexisting harmful mutations aren&#39;t the only danger of inbreeding.

However if you have an offspriger with your sibling, the chance that  you share alleles from multiple diseases is much higher  (0.000000000289. I know it&#39;s a small number but relatively it&#39;s much higher than 1/20,000,000^50*), so the 1/4 question might be asked multiple times.

So in principle, if two related people had no detrimental genes whatsoever, it would be possible for them to have viable offspring.

The brown eye genes are dominant? So...why, then, do I have blue eye? Why does ANYONE still have blue eyes? Or green, for that matter? My father has brown eyes and dark brown hair. My mother has blue eyes, and dirty blonde hair. If brown eyes and brown hair are dominant, why am I the rarest of rare combinations of blue eyes and RED hair?<br><br>It&#39;s something I hear EVERYWHERE. That a certain gene is the dominant or recessive. But I never hear anyone talking about the actual probability of someone not inheriting the dominant genes and instead getting only the recessive ones. And especially for someone like me, my sister and one of our cousins. Out of eight grandchildren, we three are the only redheads.<br><br>Which is even more bizarre when you realize that the closest redhead in our family is our grand uncle (our mother&#39;s father&#39;s brother). And as far as I know, no one of the same generation had red hair. Nor did anyone of the previous generation, either, but I could be wrong about that. I didn&#39;t get to even meet either of my great-grandfathers on my mother&#39;s side.<br><br>And my dad&#39;s side is just as weird. My father, being the oldest, has a lighter complexion but almost black hair and dark brown eyes, as does the youngest of the five brothers. The second oldest and second youngest bother have a medium complexion and darker (not dark) brown hair (skin darker and hair lighter than my father), and a lighter brown color of eyes. They&#39;re also both the only two to have a receding hair line, as well. And the middle brother has a darker (olive) complexion, but has the lightest hair color of the five brothers, and his eyes are green.  He&#39;s also the tallest of them as well, if memory serves me right.<br><br>Genetics aren&#39;t ruled by what is dominant. If they were, EVERYONE would still have darker hair and darker eyes. I would LOVE to see SOMEONE make a video explaining how the PROBABILITY of genetics works, not just the fact that some genes are dominant.
