WRONG. Visible light is radiation. Infrared Heat is radiation. Everything on the electromagnetic spectrum is radiation.<br>The bad stuff, or ionizing radiation, is all on one side of the spectrum. Gamma Rays, X-Rays, and UV are the harmful high-energy stuff (usually on the right hand side of the chart) that we have to be careful with. They can knock electrons off of molecules and cause damage.<br>Radio waves, VHF, UHF, EHF, and infrared (which are all lower energy levels than visible light) are harmless. They lack the energy levels required to free electrons from molecules. And none of these spectra are proven to cause any demonstrable harm to humans. The most they tend to do at close range and high concentrations is warm the surface of the skin a bit. Painful if taken to an extreme, but only temporary.<br>It&#39;s a bit like the difference between using a cue ball (which has high mass and kinetic energy) and a ping pong ball (low mass, low KE) on a pool table. One is really good at knocking electrons around.
