But what\u2019s the science behind language acquisition and does your accent say something about you?<br><br>2 \u2013 In an American survey, 47% of adults found British accents to be sophisticated whilst 51% thought New York accents were rude. Southern accents were considered nice but possibly uneducated whilst New England accents were considered intelligent. But it turns out that humans have a bias towards others who sound like them or who have the same accent.<br><br>3 \u2013 Of course, it\u2019s important to distinguish between a native language accent and an additional language accent. English native language accents depend on factors such as geographic location and socio-economic status. For example, a cockney accent of the working-class London is remarkably different than the Queen\u2019s received\u00b9 pronunciation.<br><br>4 \u2013 However, when it comes to non-native language accents, things are more complicated. If you decided to move to Spain and learn Spanish as an English speaker, you will always speak with an English accent, even if you remain there for decades. After the age of 12, the length of residence has almost no effect on your accent. Studies pinpoint the ideal age as 6 years old with diminishing ability from that point forward.<br><br>5 \u2013 Interestingly, some stroke patients wake up with an accent completely different to their original voice. This condition is known as the foreign accent syndrome and results from damage to the insular region of the brain, which is responsible for language processing.<br><br>6 \u2013 One integral aspect of language is the phonemes. Phonemes are the different sound units we use to make up words, some of which are unique to different languages. For example, the phonemes with \u2018th\u2019, TH and TH, as in words like \u2018the\u2019 and \u2018thing\u2019 do not exist in German, making it difficult for German speakers to pronounce these words properly. Conversely, there are many phonemes in other languages that as English speakers, we cannot pronounce or even hear properly.<br><br>7 \u2013 In a groundbreaking study, 32 American and 32 Japanese 6-month old babies listened to a recording play \u2018la la la\u2019 repeatedly. When the recording switched to \u2018la la ra\u2019 a toy to the side would light up and play a musical tune. The babies were primed to understand that recognizing the difference between \u2018la\u2019 and \u2018ra\u2019 led to an audiovisual reward and both the American and Japanese six-month old babies were able to tell the difference and anticipate the toy reward when necessary.<br><br>8 \u2013 But \u2018la\u2019 and \u2018ra\u2019 are phonemes that do not exist in the Japanese language. When the study was replicated with 10-12 month old babies, the Japanese babies could not tell the difference between these uniquely English phonemes, showing that a critical period for recognizing phonemes and brain development is at merely 6 months old.<br><br>9 \u2013 If you try and learn a language, regardless of your age, synaptic connections are made which ultimately create a denser grey matter and stronger white matter networks. In fact, those who grow up in bilingual households are consistently more sensitive to subtle language differences, compared to their monolingual counterparts.<br><br>10 \u2013 Brain scans have shown that bilingual babies have stronger brain responses in their orbital and prefrontal cortices which are areas linked to focus and problem solving abilities.

Indeed, there is some consensus in the field of linguistics which deals with language acquisition to assume that it will be more challenging for older learners of, say, English to move their accents towards a more native-like pronunciation in the target language. However, having been a language learner for several decades myself, I can by no means subscribe to the idea that your accent will more easily fossilize if you start learning a foreign language at a later point in your life. In my opinion, there are a whole variety of different factors which contribute to the success rate of your acquisition process, including a general aptitude for learning languages (which has a lot to do with how well you can perceive the different sounds of the target language and then imitate them), your personal involvement with the language, i.e. how much time you dedicate to your learning process (the more intensely you immerse yourself in the language, the greater the output will be), as well as an intrinsic motivation to fully commit to the endeavour. Just to reiterate: I am not suggesting that the results of linguistic research should be disavowed or considered to be invalid, it couldn&#39;t be farther from it. Yet, I would like to encourage people not to be blinded by something which, in my book anyway, is nothing more than a common myth that can easily be debunked. I am in the process of learning Italian as a third foreign language, and I am unwilling to buy my way into believing that I cannot master a language because some linguists carried out research on it which made them claim that I can&#39;t do it because I have reached a certain age. Individuals have different strengths and weaknesses, and if you&#39;re really a talented linguists, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything that should stop you from disproving such a general statement.

Everyone has an accent. Heck, even goats have regional ways of saying \u2018bahhhh\u2019. But what\u2019s the science behind language acquisition and does your accent say something about you?<br><br>2 \u2013\u00a0In an American survey, 47% of adults found British accents to be sophisticated whilst 51% thought New York accents were rude. Southern accents were considered nice but possibly uneducated whilst New England accents were considered intelligent. But it turns out that humans have a bias towards others who sound like them or who have the same accent.<br><br>3 \u2013\u00a0Of course, it\u2019s important to distinguish between a native language accent and an additional language accent. English native language accents depend on factors such as geographic location and socio-economic status. For example, a cockney accent of the working-class London is remarkably different than the Queen\u2019s received\u00b9pronunciation.<br><br>4 \u2013\u00a0However, when it comes to non-native language accents, things are more complicated. If you decided to move to Spain and learn Spanish as an English speaker, you will always speak with an English accent, even if you remain there for decades. After the age of 12, the length of residence has almost no effect on your accent. Studies pinpoint the ideal age as 6 years old with diminishing ability from that point forward.<br><br>5 \u2013\u00a0Interestingly, some stroke patients wake up with an accent completely different to their original voice. This condition is known as the foreign accent syndrome and results from damage to the insular region of the brain, which is responsible for language processing.<br><br>6 \u2013\u00a0One integral aspect of language is the phonemes. Phonemes are the different sound units we use to make up words, some of which are unique to different languages. For example, the phonemes with \u2018th\u2019,\u00a0TH\u00a0and\u00a0TH, as in words like \u2018the\u2019 and \u2018thing\u2019 do not exist in German, making it difficult for German speakers to pronounce these words properly. Conversely, there are many phonemes in other languages that as English speakers, we cannot pronounce or even hear properly.<br><br>7 \u2013\u00a0In a groundbreaking study, 32 American and 32 Japanese 6-month old babies listened to a recording play \u2018la la la\u2019 repeatedly. When the recording switched to \u2018la la ra\u2019 a toy to the side would light up and play a musical tune. The babies were primed to understand that recognizing the difference between \u2018la\u2019 and \u2018ra\u2019 led to an audiovisual reward and both the American and Japanese six-month old babies were able to tell the difference and anticipate the toy reward when necessary.<br><br>8 \u2013\u00a0But \u2018la\u2019 and \u2018ra\u2019 are phonemes that do not exist in the Japanese language. When the study was replicated with 10-12 month old babies, the Japanese babies could not tell the difference between these uniquely English phonemes, showing that a critical period for recognizing phonemes and brain development is at merely 6 months old.<br><br>9 \u2013\u00a0If you try and learn a language, regardless of your age, synaptic connections are made which ultimately create a denser grey matter and stronger white matter networks. In fact, those who grow up in bilingual households are consistently more sensitive to subtle language differences, compared to their monolingual counterparts.<br><br>10 \u2013\u00a0Brain scans have shown that bilingual babies have stronger brain responses in their orbital and prefrontal cortices which are areas linked to focus and problem solving abilities.

Most of us sound close, but not quite.  My dad and I almost sound normal, but my grandpa and brother are really off.  Keep in mind that everyone except my dad has lived in our state all our lives.  My brother used to have a very distinct British accent.  He ancidently convinced a former girlfriend that he was a foreign exchange student.  He eventually learned to manually change his voice&#39; s accent, but he has never mastered our specific area accent.  My grandpa on the other hand, nobody has any idea what he sounds like.  He has a very strong accent that nobody can quite seem to place.  We are not entirely sure why he sounds different.  We believe that my bother and Grandpa might sound like that because of various health conditions they were born with, but no one is quite sure.  The rest of us (besides dad who spent the first 2 years of his life in a different state) likely just sound odd from being influenced by their accents growing up.  <br><br>Personally, I&#39;m close enough that people rarely ever mention anything, but sometimes they do.  Once I went to a camp, and a girl from a state over was there too.  Apparently they decided to analyze random accents over the camp.  On the last day, they came up to me and asked where I was from because they couldn&#39;t recognise the accent.  When I said I came from the same general area as most of the others, they were really surprised.  I asked them to list some examples of how I was different, and they listed some subtle pronunciation differences I never noticed before.

Just simply talking to someone with a different accent can lead to this kind of accommodation very quickly.

Alternatively, others will use the flap /\u027e/ (For note, most research papers I see suggest that [\u027e] is the phoneme, but the IPA database suggests [l]). However, [l] and [\u0279] are most definitely allophones in Japanese. Additionally, just because it&#39;s a phoneme doesn&#39;t mean Japanese doesn&#39;t contain or use the other sounds that were offered. Suggesting that phonemes are all a language uses is silly. British English has, Standardly, 4 or 5 different variations of /k/.

Changing your accent depends on three factors: motivation, need, and how auditory you are. Auditory people, like me, can pick up and imitate people&#39;s accents after listening to them for a few minutes. Auditory people are also able to hear very subtle notes in music and can notice change very quickly. Motivation and need are two other factors that can influence your accent.
