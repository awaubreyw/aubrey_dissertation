Non so a cosa si riferisca il 10% che manca, ma so che il Covid-19 non \u00e8 stato ancora isolato e quindi \u00e8 dubbio che un tale vaccino possa davvero contrastare il virus in questione. A proposito di vaccinazioni, obbligatorie e non, vorrei comunque rendere note le risultanze espresse dalla Relazione della IV^ Commissione Parlamentare d\u2019Inchiesta sulla morte dei nostri militari all\u2019estero per uranio impoverito, riguardante anche le vaccinazioni di massa a cui i militari stessi venivano sottoposti. La Commissione \u00e8 giunta a conclusioni che  contrastano palesemente con quelle di alcuni medici, sia per quanto riguarda il tempo di immunizzazione dell\u2019organismo dopo la somministrazione dei vaccini, sia per quanto concerne i rischi connessi alle vaccinazioni di massa, eseguite senza un\u2019indagine preventiva che verifichi lo stato di salute dei singoli soggetti vaccinati. E stiamo parlando di precauzioni nei confronti dei militari, i quali, fino a prova contraria, grazie ai test fisici e psicologici a cui sono sottoposti, si trovano verosimilmente in condizioni di salute ottimali.

Since the beginning of April to the 12th July, the cumulative number of infections in South Africa has doubled about every 14 days. On 12 July 2020, 264,184 cumulative cases have been recorded, slightly more than double the 131,800 on 28 June, 14 days before. South Africa was firmly on track to record half a million cumulative infections by 25 July. Community spread appeared unstoppable. At that rate of increase, 1 million would have been infected by 8 August, 2 million by 22 August, 4 million by 5 September, 8 million by 19 September, 16 million by 3 October and some 32 million by 17 October 2020. That would represent 53% of the population of over 59 million people. The daily number of new infections should then have dropped off steeply.  On that trend, over the first two weeks of October, between one and two million new infections were likely to occur daily. The growth of new cases in adjoining areas, such as Zimbabwe, Namibia, Eswathini, Botswana and Lesotho was much, much slower.<br>However, on 13 July, the number of new cases in South Africa dropped significantly by about 1,440, or about 11%. The day before, the 12 July 2020, sales of alcoholic beverages were prohibited in South Africa, creating a false impression that the ban was the cause of the drop in numbers. However, this is false, because the normal lag period of some 5 to 10 days between the introduction of a new measure that is effective, and a reduction in case numbers, was completely absent, clearly identifying it as fake. This trend of a reduction of new cases continued daily and became progressively stronger. The result was that, today, 20 October, the official cumulative number of cases in South Africa stands at 705,254 instead of well over 50% of the population, had the &#39;trend&#39; of doubling every 13 or 14 days continued. There is no rational reason for a ban on liquor sales to cause such a sudden, steep drop in new cases. Hence the conclusion is that, over the three-and-a-half months before 12 July, the numbers have been manipulated up, as were the numbers on recoveries. Death numbers, on the other hand, were manipulated down: <a href=\"https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2020-07-29-excess-deaths-soar-to-more-than-four-times-official-covid-19-toll-mrc-data-shows/\">https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2020-07-29-excess-deaths-soar-to-more-than-four-times-official-covid-19-toll-mrc-data-shows/</a> <br>The question is, why have the case numbers been manipulated up? <br>Early this year, South Africa applied for an IMF loan of US$4.3 billion at a very low interest rate. On 27 July, the IMF publicly announced that the loan was granted -  <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/27/pr20271-south-africa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-billion-emergency-support-covid-19-pandemic\">https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/27/pr20271-south-africa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-billion-emergency-support-covid-19-pandemic</a> Most likely, South Africa was informed of the grant earlier than the public announcement, perhaps around 12 July? Clearly, the numbers in South Africa have been manipulated up to impress on the IMF an urgent need for funds to fight the epidemic in the country. Most of the funds are likely to land in the pockets of corrupt people in positions of power and their family.<br>A further question is, what is the real motive for the ban on liquor sales? <br>The answer is that the ban on liquor sales will most likely drive many liquor stores out of business. The liquor trade is seen as lucrative, easy business. White owners of such businesses are exempt on a racist basis of financial assistance to weather the covid storm, including the IMF funds. Many of these businesses are likely to go bankrupt and be bought up at bargain prices by black politicians, their family members <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-31-ace-magashules-sons-each-bag-a-free-state-covid-19-contract/amp/?__twitter_impression=true\">https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-31-ace-magashules-sons-each-bag-a-free-state-covid-19-contract/amp/?__twitter_impression=true</a> and other black business people, perhaps using some of the IMF funds paid for other contracts where contract prices have been loaded - <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-sahrc-set-to-probe-gauteng-health-spending-amid-corruption-claims-20200730\">https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-sahrc-set-to-probe-gauteng-health-spending-amid-corruption-claims-20200730</a><br>And <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-30-province-to-disclose-ppe-procurement-details-to-avoid-corruption/\">https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-30-province-to-disclose-ppe-procurement-details-to-avoid-corruption/</a><br>And <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/coronavirus-essentials/2020-08-06-the-ppe-scandal-that-the-treasury-hasnt-touched/\">https://mg.co.za/coronavirus-essentials/2020-08-06-the-ppe-scandal-that-the-treasury-hasnt-touched/</a><br>Fraud and corruption assume many a guise. The South African government is rotten through from top to bottom and the people in power are out on the loot. They saw an opportunity and they jumped on it.

Don&#39;t take the microneedle vaccine patch that will be made mandatory on the right hand or forehead for buying and selling. Read the book of revelations 13 and 14 from the Bible. It will forever alter your DNA and separate you from God and doom you for eternal hell and physical eternal torment in the lake of fire. You won&#39;t be able to get a second chance; the stuff goes into all your cells, your brain, everywhere; it can rewrite your memory your genetic code. Doctors are coming forward talking about this. \u200bLet&#39;s hope for the best, that the Lord Jesus is on His way to rapture his people out of here. (If million of people dissapear and if you are left behind for the apocalypse, don&#39;t buy the lie that it was aliens...). Hold on till the end and don&#39;t take the vaccine that comes in the microneedle patch form (the one that is RNA based). You will be hunted down and killed if you do not worship the antichrist, his image and refuse to take the mark, but you save your soul!! Check everything out for yourself. Turn to Christ. Repent! Read the Bible and pray daily. There will be great deseption; ignore all the lies. The antichirst will be revealed soon, make the mark mandatory as a kind of worshipping him and his image. It is practically high level witchcraft to let anyone inject you with this stuff that contains nanobots, biometric ID, quantum dots, 24/7 tracking device and RNA that forever alters your DNA. Do your own research, your eternal soul and that of your family may depend on it! Even a little girl got dreams about these things from God, what will happen to those who will take the mark of the beast. She says they will go crazy and become like beasts (it opens doorways for demonic possession).

Parameter Values that vary among the five COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios.&quot; :\r<br>\r<br>0-19 year old survival rate is 99.97%\r<br>20-49 year old survival rate is 99.98%\r<br>50-69 year old survival rate is 99.5%\r<br>70+ year old survival rate is 94.6%\r<br>\r<br>As you can see the updated data shows that the initial estimates of the death rate(5-15%) for all people who contracted Covid-19 were way off. The the new data is actually great news because Covid-19 is not as deadly as we initially thought. The large majority of people survive after contracting the disease. <br><br>Side Note: This data is also taken from people known to have contracted Covid-19. From the CDC &quot;The percent of cases that are asymptomatic, i.e. never experience symptoms, remains uncertain.&quot; So the survival rate may even be higher than what is able to be reflected within the statistics because people may have Covid-19 and not experience any issues or get tested; therefore, they would not be included within this data. <br><br>In conclusion, \rif you drive in a car everyday the odds of dying in a car accident are 32x, 48x, and 1.9x more likely for 0-19/20-49/50-69 year old groups than from Covid-19 for a bit of perspective.

Death and destruction are upon us! \u2661 The Blessed hope is in Jesus Christ, Who will meet and rescue all those that have put their faith and trust in Him in the clouds called the Rapture event and it will save them from the judgement of God which will pour down on this earth very shortly. Those that have not put their trust and faith in Him will be here for the Great Tribulation of death and horrific destruction. You don&#39;t want to be here. Without Jesus the penalty of sin is death - eternal condemnation in hell. John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_8CINyQAVI&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a> says For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting. \u2661\u2661\u2661 God&#39;s LOVE for us is beyond human comprehension.

God Bless you ! \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 <br><br><br><b>The Gospel of Jesus Christ</b> \u2661\u2661\u2661 <br><br><br>Today is the day of Salvation: Why would anyone put off the most important decision they could ever make in their lives concerning eternal life? If you die today are you going to heaven? 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 - The apostle Paul tells us what the gospel is: &quot;Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you\u2014unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures. <br><br><br>Gospel means &quot;good news.&quot; Your debt has been paid, the death penalty has been paid, you are free. Here&#39;s the Gospel of Jesus Christ: That Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures. Jesus brought in a little child as a living object lesson to show who enters the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 18:3 - Jesus said: &quot;Unless you become like this little child you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.&quot; This is how to be saved, it is simply child like, as simple as <br><br><br><b>ABC&#39;s of Salvation</b> <br><br><br><b>A</b> - Admit that you are a sinner. This is where that godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against a righteous God and there is a change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out. Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_8CINyQAVI&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a> - As it is written: &quot;There is none righteous, no, not one.&quot; Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_8CINyQAVI&amp;t=3m23s\">3:23</a> - For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (We are all born sinners which is why we must be born spiritually in order to enter the Kingdom of Heaven). Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_8CINyQAVI&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a> - For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. The bad news is that the wages of sin is death, in other words our sin means that we have been given a death sentence, we have the death penalty hanging over our heads, that&#39;s the bad news. But here&#39;s the good news: The good news is that the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Ephesians 2:8-9 - For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith \u2014and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God\u2014 not by works, so that no one can boast. <br><br><br><b>B</b> - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died for your sins, was buried, and that God raised Jesus from the dead. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. Romans 10:9-10 - That if you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. <br><br><br><b>C</b> - Call upon the name of the Lord. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of lords and the King of kings. Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_8CINyQAVI&amp;t=14m11s\">14:11</a> - For it is written: &quot;As I live, says the Lord, Every knee shall bow to Me, And every tongue shall confess to God.&quot; Don&#39;t wait until later \u2014 do this now. -- we are not guaranteed tomorrow. Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_8CINyQAVI&amp;t=10m13s\">10:13</a> - For &quot;whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot; John 14:6 &quot;I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father but through me.&quot; John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_8CINyQAVI&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a> ~ For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting. <br><br><br>\u2661 <b>SALVATION PRAYER</b> ~ \u2661\u2661\u2661 &quot;Dear Lord Jesus, I know I am a sinner, and I know I deserve the consequences of my sin. I ask for your forgiveness and repent to turn from my unbelief to belief in You.  I believe You died for my sins, shed your blood, was buried, and rose from the dead. I have decided to place my faith in You, trusting only in Your shed blood as sufficient to save my soul and take me to Heaven. Thank you, Jesus for saving me!

And after repenting they should say: \u201cOh Allah, I am Your servant, I ask you by the fact there is no God except You, and by the fact of Your mercy that You ordained upon YourSelf, and by the fact of greatness of the Bliss of YourSelf\u2019s good-pleasure that is greater than the bliss of Your heavenly-garden that you heal me from the chastisement of corona or remove it away from me surely I believe in the true caller from You. Oh Allah, remove Your chastisement away from us and from every entrance so we would follow the path of Truth from You, and to make us steadfast on fulfilling what we promised You \u2014 O Who comes between man and his heart, surely we do not have except Your mercy that You ordained upon YourSelf. Indeed, if You do not forgive us and (not) have mercy on us we would surely be of the losers.

And we made the medicine and the solution in the title of the explanatory-statement yet it is the wisdom of the minor chastisement of coronavirus, also the wisdom for healing from its chastisement is \u2014 for they may return to Allah, then repent to Allah an utmost repentance, so they would follow the caller to Allah\u2019s Book, His servant and khalifa of His; the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni. If the arrogant ones turned away from this supplication-prayer, it is then \u2014 Oh community of supporters, know that Allah by no means and He would never answer your supplication-prayer by lifting the suffocating chastisement of Allah away from the criminals among the worlds, that\u2019s according to my knowledge in the Book that if Allah lifts it away from the world by His mercy without them know that it is a ratification sign to who Allah selected him for the people as an Imam (leader), khalifa of Allah and His servant the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad, and I repeat and I mention that if He removes it without them know that it is from signs of ratification for His khalifa Al- Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni verily they will persist in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on, so they would continue turning away from following Allah\u2019s caller and khalifa of His Nasser Mohammad.

And if coronavirus has truly arrived in Yemen after Allah withheld it away from them for months that they may give thanks.
