For example, when you create a quota [minimum] for how many black students Harvard, for instance, needs to accept per year, you&#39;re dooming most of them to failure. Those black students are being admitted, in the case of affirmative action, ONLY because of the color of their skin\u2014NOT because of their intelligence or grades. When you do that, those students are now at the bottom of their class, become demotivated, drop out (or fail) and not only don&#39;t find employment thereafter, but have wasted years of their lives and tens of thousands of dollars. If you, however, let those same students be admitted to a college/university to which they&#39;ve EARNED admission, then they have the opportunity to be at the top of their class, and graduate with awards, honours, etc. Now, I&#39;m not saying that black people aren&#39;t intelligent\u2014there surely are plenty of highly intelligent black people who&#39;ve left their marks on society, but affirmative action mainly aims (actually, aimed, but it was never ended after its initial intended purpose was served decades ago) to help blacks (and other minorities) REGARDLESS of their grades, effort, etc. They gain admission, again, solely due to their skin color, and that&#39;s not only not fair to the students who worked their asses off to earn admission, but it&#39;s also a disservice to the black (and minority) students who are being placed in a school that leaves them with their heads barely above the water, and doomed to fail. In life, it&#39;s critical, in order to succeed and progress, to surround yourself with people who are smarter than you, but it&#39;s still better to graduate at the top of ones class with ease than not at all and be destined for not only failure, but victimhood, debt, depression, poverty, etc.", "comment_date": "2018-04-22T21:59:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nolan Foreman", "comment_text": "Those top schools are just overrated anyway.

Harvard&#39;s graduation rate is in the high 90s. All that chart is saying about Harvard is that most of its graduates have high SAT math scores, not that they will fail to get a degree...<br><br>2) The comparison effect is a fair point, and it certainly may affect your self-perception, but that has nothing to do with the purpose of going to a college, which is to learn, develop, and utilize your learning and development to do something in your life, whether it be a career, devotion to research, community service, etc. One&#39;s self-confidence is also a highly variable thing, and some people might not be affected at all by this effect.<br><br>3) When you discuss STEM and dropping out of STEM, I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re also completely misinterpreting the statistics. Perhaps STEM graduation rate decreases as SAT score increases, but that&#39;s almost certainly because a better school will have a notably harder STEM curriculum, as the course rigor, faculty, and requirements are all at a considerably higher level. This might force prospective STEM majors to switch majors to something that they can handle, or that suits their interests more, as many 17-year-olds who think they want to major in mathematics can be quickly disillusioned once they step out of AP Calculus and into high-level theoretical mathematics.<br><br>Furthermore, there is no way that overall GRADUATION RATE decreases as SAT scores raise, look at any top 50 college vs. any bottom 50 college and try to tell me that the top has a lower graduation rate.... Even if this were the case, it could also easily be explainable by the fact that worse schools have considerably lower course rigor than harder schools, so that its lower-performing students can graduate at all...<br><br>4) What you&#39;re trying to bring up about economists and research papers is not only horrendously wrong, but it&#39;s extremely disrespectful to the graduates from those top 5 schools, who you literally called &quot;failures in their fields&quot;.

That study shows that the top 5 schools are, in fact, considerably better than the non-top-30s.<br><br>Plus, of all of the things you could have used to attempt to quantify your point, Economic research from PhDs is quite possible the absolute worst, as it is a GRADUATE school field, which is clearly not what you are talking about in the rest of the video.<br><br>This was so unbelievably bad, and it was the first YouTube video I&#39;ve disliked in around 2 years.

We didn&#39;t have to go so far away to get a good education or a degree and we were prepared for what we are doing. You learn along the way what works for you. Sadly, my university doesn&#39;t have the masters degree program I want so I have to go away, but even then I feel ready because my university prepared me well. A lot of my classmates have gone to other schools before coming back to our local university because they failed out or thought it was too hard. So I&#39;m not saying people will do horrible when they leave fresh out of high school, but I&#39;m saying we lack the maturity to handle so much independence university life gives us. I think it has to do with the level of maturity you have, too. I knew I wasn&#39;t ready to leave home and my university was a good choice because my brother went there and got his degree and also got into the school he wanted. I had my proof that it was a competitive and decent school. I was a great student in high school, but in university, I learned the hard way that I had to study long and hard. Its not easy, you have to work for it. But its manageable once you find what works for you and that could take some time to figure out. I don&#39;t think top schools are a waste of time, but why go so far away when you have a good school right next to you? People here take it for granted but they always come back to our university.

That gives accurate data on trajectory of achievement etc. If i did compare myself and feel bad, i put ratios in mind. Each human is different, if i underwent a bad week, a family emergency, etcetera. It is totally normal to see some deviation from others.

How the individual defines success matters. Do publications matter in grand scheme of things? Nope. Make no mistake college is important but in high-insight the University plastered on the front of diploma doesn&#39;t matter as much. I can&#39;t speak for other people but I look at the quality of the work not the quantity. Here&#39;s my humble advice for people in high school and college. Do the best you can. I don&#39;t mean that in a corny way but with sincerity. In everything you do regardless of the task-<del>put your best into it. I mean everything from folding your laundry too, sweeping the floor, too how you talk to your teachers and professors. Get a part-time job and do take pride in even a lowly position. Be respectful to everyone even the janitor. Be fifty minutes early for everything for which you have an appointment. Develop your morals and learn from your blunders. Ask your professors and teachers how you can do better. Ask your peers that do great to tag along and learn from them. Don&#39;t fall victim to sloth or over exert yourself on trivial matters. Research areas of interest to you then attend meetings, conferences and seminars with questions in hand.  Be friendly and inquisitive about things your actually like-</del> shake a lot of hands. Write down a lot of names. Be a collector of certificates preferably in things that interest you. Lastly, getting into or not getting into a college of your choice isn&#39;t the end of the world. Use the cards you have and build them up. I didn&#39;t make it into college from high school. I joined the military and put five good years in before be injured. I went to a community college, did well and got an AS paralegal degree. Went to a rather lowly University and got a BA in political science--something that interests me. During those years doing paralegal work with pay and pro bono. Made friends and built solid relationships with people. Followed the advice that I&#39;ve written here. I am a 3L Law Student now and already have skills that the others don&#39;t. Even career offers at large firms and I haven&#39;t even taken the BAR exam. Long story short never give up! I was C student in the beginning with a lot of issues. After, my injuries I was told to just except the fact that I wasn&#39;t going to be able to work or make it through college.

It also can be the part of your resume that allows you to keep moving up with in your career. I&#39;ve worked in the Banking industry for years, and after dropping out of my first year in college, I started working as a temporary part time Teller for Wells Fargo Bank at the age of 18, making 11.36 per hour. I wasn&#39;t sure where I was headed in life at that time, all I knew was that I was nervous and intimidated on my first day on the job working for Wells Fargo, after finishing training. I caught on very quickly, and realized that it&#39;s not only about what you know, it&#39;s also about who you are, that determines how effective you can be. I realized my personality and ability to connect with people socially, was a key to a great future. Banking, is all about Sales and Customer Service. I outperformed Bank representatives in the same area, that were full time (40 hrs), while I was only a temporary 17 hour Teller. I outperformed reps that had been with the company for years, with strong educational backgrounds. After 6 months, I was promoted to a Junior Banker at the age of 18!! Continued to soar, promoted again after 9 months to a Licensed Personal Banker and eventually a Premier Banker 2. BUT! I hit a roadblock. All because I didn&#39;t have a degree. After years of success and learning from some of the best Bankers Wells Fargo has to offer, I decided it was time to take on Wall St. but unfortunately, one of the requirements of becoming a Financial Adviser (Stock Broker), I had to have a degree in accounting/economics. Even though I have years of experience, I was ineligible for the position due to a lack of education. Wasn&#39;t even able to apply.

Lastly, making comparison in STEM majors is dumb. Most people CANNOT handle STEM majors because of it&#39;s difficult and abstract.

Now of course not everything you learn you will use, but if you were challenged in college, you can think better than others, you have the foundation knowledge in order to learn new things, and ofc you learned more than others so you&#39;re more likely to be a better candidate(higher workload and amount of materials). And why would you start with a STEM major stats and then move on to economist stats. Talk about cherry picking and manipulating stats to make a point.

If all colleges were meant to be the same with the same goal in mind, then trade schools wouldn&#39;t exist. Most Amercian colleges are not geared to prepare you for the real world. If this was really true, dept would more actively be fought against, becasue what country truly profits if its next generation is in debted to the same country that needs those indebted citizens to get ahead? It doesn&#39;t make sense. College is really a place to hone your thinking and make you a critical thinkier of the world you live in. Now if you want to spend 25,000-50,000 per year to do so, or 10,000 or below,  that&#39;s your perogative, but what those elite schools have over smaller schools is really, connection. the video hinted at this too, that a reason for more work from an elite school is that you where this schools name like a badge of honor. Thats most likely why you can go to UCLA and see a bunch of freshman wearing HARVARD sewatshirts. With this idea in mind, If you think someone from Harvard says one thing over what someone from UC San Diego says, most would outomatically take the one for Harvard&#39;s word as irrefutable text. Not to say that those who go to these schools do not work hard, or are not smart. Many are, but also many aren&#39;t at least when is comes to real world application. Such schools have an unfaor advatage, and with the cost of schooling going up, it becomes again a classist thing, where only the rich can go, unless one is lucky enough to get a semi- full ride. So when going to college, not matter where you go, Hone your mind, but also make connections. You may be at a disadvantage that those at Harvard or Oxford, or Yale, or Stanford, but hear is a nicely kept secret.

As you know by now, I\u2019d like my kids to GET OUT of college. Preferably with a degree. 57% of students enroll, and leave college without their degree. In addition to the financial burden this creates on a young person, it also creeps back up time and time again as they apply for jobs. Is it ethical to list an &#39;almost&#39; degree on a resume? No. A degree is either completed, or not completed. Misrepresenting yourself can be grounds for termination. As colleagues climb the ranks, often adults become frustrated that they didn&#39;t complete their degree, and may return to college time and time again to do so. This isn&#39;t an exception, it\u2019s the rule. The majority of people will spend their lives in on-again, off-again credit seeking.

While 15.4% of students in the bottom third of their class at Harvard graduate with a degree, not all of this can be attributed to the fact that it is because the smart kids feel inadequate. You are forgetting the fact that the course load and the classes are harder, and on average the kids are spending more hours per week per hour spent in class. It was mentioned in the video that there is prestige in holding a degree at Harvard, and the prestige comes from the academics and the programs offered by the school.<br><br>2. It was mentioned that with every 10 point decrease in SAT scores in US schools, degree completion rises by 2%. This is true , but of course, you aren&#39;t comparing apples to apples. An engineering degree at MIT does not compare to an engineering degree at a an average US school. Using your numbers, kids have an SAT score of 550 they would on average have a 55% graduation rate versus 15% if they went to Harvard. Again, do not suggest that a lower SAT score will yield beneficial results because you cant compare Engineering degrees from different schools.<br><br>3. The study you quoted is incorrect in comparing similar results again. In terms of # of  publications submitted, you are suggesting the someone in the top 99 percentile in an average school outperforms the top 75 percentile in prestigious schools. This is very misleading as (taken from the video) the top third students in average schools have an average SAT score of 569. If you were to do the calculation, a top 99 percentile at this school would require you to have an SAT in excess of 650-700. This just reinforces the fact that SAT score is directly linked to performance in academia. <br><br>You suggest the formula form success is mixed, when in reality its not. This video does not the stress the importance of going to average schools because all it shows is that you require to be in the top 1% of students to be comparable to the above average harvard student. If anything, that would make me feel even more insignificant if academic success (in terms of publications after post doc) was my only concern.

Therefore meaning they can&#39;t get into a good college, all because they couldn&#39;t pay for it(unless they get a scholarship, but they need a lot of lick for that). Now the rich kid is having a awesome life, with a decent job, only because they were rich. Yes they were smart, but only because they went to a school who could teach them. Now the poor kid is stuck at a minimum wage job, but deserves to have a better job due to the fact that he has the same amount of intellect as the rich kid. Basically what im trying to say is that, the more money, the better school. The less money, worst school.", "comment_date": "2015-09-17T01:07:44Z", "likes_count": 199}, {"comment_by": "chair", "comment_text": "What about those that dropped out for business venture/s @ these top schools?", "comment_date": "2015-09-17T01:07:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Galaxis", "comment_text": "Wow!
