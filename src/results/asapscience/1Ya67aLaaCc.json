Stop it immediately and literally do something else to get your mind off lustful thoughts. Always pray that Jesus may free you from such addiction.  Think about your soul, is it worth going to hell for just few minutes of pleasure?! Satan will help you rationalize &amp; justify any sin to keep doing it, but don&#39;t give in... reject temptations in the name of Jesus.<br><br>Also for those who may not be aware of this; whenever you watch pornography or at anyone, with or without clothes, with lust in your heart, you are either committing adultery or fornication in your heart!  <br><br>Furthermore, if you are physically a virgin, and think you are still a virgin after lusting, as described above, you are deceived.  Just as a married person commits adultery by doing so, the same applies to virgins as you are commiting fornication in your heart!  Don&#39;t let Satan deceive you to think that since you are still a virgin and not doing the physical act that it is ok to watch pornography or to look at others in lust just because you&#39;re &quot;only looking&quot;.

The line that really stood out to me is \u201cshould people be entitled to buy other human beings for sexual gratification?\u201d And it\u2019s not gratification, it\u2019s 87% OFF the time aggression and 100% of the time one human abusing, using, de-humanising and dominating another human being. If you asked anyone the same question today.. I think almost everyone would say no.. off course not.. and people get amazed about how in ROME in the olden days.. women used to be chained up to the temple... but it\u2019s happening now stronger, larger than ever and yet people (myself) still continue to fuel it. It\u2019s sickening to see how easily a man can destroy a women\u2019s life.. from birth... to sadly, dead at the age of 33 (average age of a prostitute). Watching porn is a quick easy safe way for men to get a quick enjection of domination and control. Its the opposite of gods plan for relationships. It\u2019s an addiction that can never be filled, instead it forms and grows into deeper, darker forms to furfill the fix men need. Our brains are rewured to create dopamine from more graphic things when we get bored of the last. but it can be killed. Men take the affects of porn and apply it to everything they do, say and act during they\u2019re life\u2019s.. it\u2019s a beast that tears your life apart and crushes beyond else\u2019s whilst it does it. it paints a picture or the hierarchy between men and women.. and how women should be treated... not only in the bed. You can\u2019t kill a dragon if you can\u2019t see it... don\u2019t get distracted.. the battle is against SATAN, the purest form of pure EVIL, it\u2019s a life or death situation. (Like what Paul said in Ephesians) yet the fear of never being satisfied and ultimately turning out being a rapist, or the symptoms of pornography should not be the only deterrent and reason why we shouldn\u2019nt watch porn.. because that again, is looking at us. And it\u2019s selfish just like the act of watching it.. rather look at the mass effect it has on women all over the world... addicted can\u2019t instantly see that because theirs conscious is seared. And they are undereducated about the affect it has on women, that PLUS society not only makes it okay but is starting to encourages it. Read what god says about it.. and what your doing when you watch it. Young girls, and boys are coded from such a young age by seeing this and having to live through it (it\u2019s all around them) and the cycle continues. Not only if it an addiction that is idolised and goes directly against gods teaching, it causes depression, separation, aggressive behaviour, and a thirst that can never be quenched and that is constantly moving onto harder and more graphic stuff. It strips young girls from there purity, scars them for life and codes them the that is the way that they should be treated by men all through there life.", "comment_date": "2020-01-31T07:54:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NIGHT OWL ORDER", "comment_text": "I have long been corrupted sometime when I was young.

He/She may not have been able to talk to you about this in the past, or perhaps they have talked to you about Me, but you were not ready to listen.     \r<br> \r<br>The most important thing I want to tell you is that I LOVE YOU. I love you more than anyone in this world could ever love you. I want you to read this now and learn of Me because you are running out of time to learn the truth.  \r<br> \r<br>Life as you know it now will suddenly and radically change in an instant and I want you to be ready.  \r<br> \r<br>MY NAME IS JESUS CHRIST, THE MESSIAH. \r<br> \r<br>I have come to you to give you eternal life.  I have come in the flesh and given you the most ultimate sacrifice anyone could give in that I died for you, shedding My blood to atone for your sins; not only those sins you have committed in the past, but for every sin you will ever commit.  \r<br> \r<br>The price for your sins has been paid. I was the sacrificial lamb, slain for you. Your debt is paid.  \r<br> \r<br>I did this so that you could have access to the Kingdom of Heaven with Me and Our Father forever. You were beautifully and wonderfully made, intricately designed, and purposed for so much more than this life.  \r<br> \r<br>You have known all along that there was more, that your heart yearned for something greater, something that would fill the emptiness, fill that space inside and &#39;complete&#39; you.  \r<br> \r<br>It is My greatest desire that you know that what you have been looking for is Me! I am the One who has created you for a special purpose and whose love for you will never die!  \r<br> \r<br>My gift is a free gift, no conditions, all you need to do is accept this most precious gift from Me and you will then have all My promises.  \r<br> \r<br>You must know that you could never do anything on your own to earn My love, or earn your way into Heaven. Your acceptance of Me and My sacrifice is all that is required. My blood covers all, and ensures you will live with Me always.  \r<br> \r<br>I have given you a book- The Holy Bible - that tells you all about who I am. It is your instruction manual in this life, and it tells you not only what has happened in the past, but it also tells you what is about to happen to this earth.  \r<br> \r<br>I love all of My creation so much that I always let you know what I am about to do. This is why you are receiving this letter. I am about to make Myself known in a very powerful way. Because so many have chosen not to accept Me for who I am and follow My commandments for your lives, I will shake the very foundations of all you know to be your security. This is how I will get the attention of My creation. \r<br> \r<br>I do not want you to be in fear, and I do not want you to miss the most important reason that you were born to be here. This reason is to have an intimate relationship with Me. To not choose Me is to choose a life in darkness eternally.  \r<br> \r<br>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. I offer you this gift and this decision because of the free will I have given you. I would never force you to love Me, but you must know that to ignore My desires for your love means eternity without light, love, peace and joy. It is a life wasted and cast away.  \r<br> \r<br>Don&#39;t waste another moment believing the lies of My enemy, the devil. Don&#39;t believe that life will go on continually the way it always has been.  \r<br> \r<br>Time as you know it is over and I am coming to make all things new.  The signs of the times in which you live are all around you. Life as you know it has become unsustainable. Everything that can be shaken, will be shaken, and you will be forced to make a choice for your very survival.  \r<br> \r<br>You will choose to trust Me, the One who created you, or you will trust in a system that will fail. My Word speaks truth and all else that is not of Me will collapse.  \r<br> \r<br>Please, come to Me now. Come as you are. I love you no matter what you have done.  \r<br> \r<br>My blood washes away all your sins and makes you white as snow. I will keep you and protect you, I will provide for you and when it is your time, I will take you home with Me.  \r<br> \r<br>I will only have so many warnings, and then the sudden-lies will be upon you. Will you be ready? The choice has always been yours.  \r<br> \r<br>If you accept this free gift and desire to know Me intimately, and want to spend eternity with Me in complete peace and love, please say this prayer (out loud.)  \r<br> \r<br>Prayer: \r<br> \r<br>Father, please forgive me for all of my sins. I accept your gift. I believe that you sent your Son Jesus to die for me, and that He is your only Son.

Could you guys do a video about Nofap? The initial goal of NoFap, was to relieve men of pornography addiction, which seems to be a noble goal, mainly after high speed internet and HD porn became available. However doing recent years a lot of people took control over the NoFap community and filled it with nonsense pseudoscience. Not only pseudoscience but old-fashion moralism as well. These guys claim a lot of non-scientific stuff. one of them even told me that scientific evidence doesn&#39;t matter since NoFap saved his marriage, and this is all people need to know.   This movement does cherry-picking with science, Publishing only material that corroborate their ideals. For instance they seem to know very little about brain chemistry, they focus only on simple things like the dopamine cycle, forgetting about prolactin, oxitocin and endorphins, and also claiming that if you do not ejaculate, your body has the ability to recycle what your reproductive system does not &quot;send out&quot;. That seems contradictory if you consider nocturnal emission and daytime spontaneous ejaculation, a couple of things that happen to me if I stay away from masturbation for a week or so (10 days sometimes), though it was far more common when I was younger.... If you see those NoFap Reddit topics, they even claim you can develop new cognitive abilities after 30 days or so without touching yourself. This is already too far gone. They invoke even transmutation of vital energy, resurrect the theories of Wilhelm Reich, and other embarrassing stuff for people that love scientific and the search for the truth (or as close as we can get to it). Well, thar is it. I totally support therapy and group therapy against pornography addiction, however keeping it inside scientific boundaries.

What follows is a delusional life of self degradation, anxiety, guilt, sadness, disease, uncertainty, moral bankruptcy, doubt, confusion, and despair.  The Porn industry has morally bankrupted society, ruined marriages, ruined families, inspired crime, rapists, and murderers. The &quot;behind the scenes&quot; of porn is hardly ever told.  The heartaches, heart breaks, emptiness, sadness and despair that follows porn actors (moving many to commit suicide) is not glamorous.  Next time you consider viewing or dabbling in pornography remember that you are playing into a vice that has ruined untold millions.  I suspect most wouldn&#39;t masturbate if their mother, father, brother or sister popped up in a porn scene.  It would likely trouble or hurt them.  Yet millions are enjoying seeing the mothers, fathers, brothers and daughters of others desecrate their dignity on film, showing the extent to which society is so disconnected, alienated and uncaring towards one another.  The mentality goes something like this &quot;porn is ok if it&#39;s someone else&#39;s daughter or son for whom I could care less&quot;. It&#39;s an issue of disregard for the well being of others.  It&#39;s selfishness at its worst. No one feels true joy, lasting peace and freedom through the chains of pornography. Jesus Christ can break those chains and set you free,  Those who obey God in a monogamous heterosexual relationship are blessed with true love, freedom, peace, certainty, health and the respect of society", "comment_date": "2016-07-30T11:34:11Z", "likes_count": 101}, {"comment_by": "Nadia Marie", "comment_text": "What happens in your brain when you suffer from an eating disorder", "comment_date": "2016-07-30T03:42:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noah Poustie", "comment_text": "i beat off to this video thanks for making my addiction worse......", "comment_date": "2016-07-29T22:11:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pug man", "comment_text": "This happened to one of my friends", "comment_date": "2016-07-27T00:55:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anmol Singh", "comment_text": "Sasha Grey", "comment_date": "2016-07-23T07:14:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rigby", "comment_text": "Yeah I&#39;m done with porn.", "comment_date": "2016-07-19T16:44:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Imron Khan", "comment_text": "i masterbet so much i am 26 year old from 6 or 7 year i am masterbation so i want to ask i if i got married i can ejaculat long or i have to stop masterbation for 1 year and then got married please reply me", "comment_date": "2016-07-17T18:45:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ferg2113", "comment_text": "So your saying dopamine is basically dope", "comment_date": "2016-07-16T03:09:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lion Kashmir", "comment_text": "damn, well I guess its time to stop paying for brazzers...", "comment_date": "2016-07-16T00:05:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IantheXX013", "comment_text": "Dear God save us", "comment_date": "2016-07-14T22:04:05Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "MomoV", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ya67aLaaCc&amp;t=1m35s\">1:35</a> hahaha rat porn hilarious if thatd exist", "comment_date": "2016-07-11T23:31:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Timo Meijs", "comment_text": "The best way to stop is to trust God to save you from it, though.", "comment_date": "2016-07-11T15:43:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cifyra", "comment_text": "&quot;Pornography addiction can often lead to finding your mate less attractive&quot;<br>Well, maybe they aren&#39;t attractive to begin with.", "comment_date": "2016-07-08T14:11:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mei Tang", "comment_text": "so masturbating is healthy but porn is not. what?", "comment_date": "2016-07-08T03:06:36Z", "likes_count": 455}, {"comment_by": "Howard Mbithi", "comment_text": "rat porn lol", "comment_date": "2016-07-07T07:03:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebas S", "comment_text": "X Videos &gt; Por Hub", "comment_date": "2016-07-06T01:54:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZXN.

There was a study that was talked about from Britain last year where they said, \u201cWe did fMRIs on the brains of people who used porn and their brains looked like the brains of alcoholics!\u201d What that study actually shows is that these people regard pornography as something that is reinforcing in their lives. It\u2019s something positive to them. <br><br>So their brains lit up in response to pornography in the same way that somebody\u2019s brain would light up if they collected model trains and you showed them a picture of a model train. <br><br>Similarly, people\u2019s brains light up in almost the exact same way if they\u2019re fans of a certain football team and you show them paraphernalia related to the football team. So, what that study actually showed was the people who like porn, like porn. I\u2019m not sure how informative that is. <br><br>Secondly, that study has still not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. It is a study that was talked about in the media but there has been no critical evaluation of it yet.", "comment_date": "2015-09-11T11:22:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PotatoPilotTv", "comment_text": "Ok so How the heck can we get rid of the addiction?", "comment_date": "2015-09-11T06:07:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mistic Pepe", "comment_text": "<b>*Close xvideos window*</b>", "comment_date": "2015-09-11T02:21:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clumpy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ya67aLaaCc&amp;t=0m54s\">0:54</a> canadian money?
