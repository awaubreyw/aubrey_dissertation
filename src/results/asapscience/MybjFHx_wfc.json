By looking closely, you can deduct two clues. 1: There is a pattern of the bar shades, first it goes dark, lines, clear, clear. Then to dark lines lines clear. It goes in an alternating switch to the shade to the left. So the pattern tells us the shape must have a bar completely filled in, narrowing us down to 3 and 5. The second clue, is that from close examination, you notice each figure is altered only twice. From the first to the second, the bar changes and the shape rotates, the. Then the shape changes, and the bar shape changes, the shape changes bar shade changes, etc. 3 only makes one change, shifting to a dark bar. The shape does not change.

Besides a few exceptions, this is why the typical IQ tests would not need to measure or consider the other types of intelligence as they are not generally relevant.", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T07:26:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hailea Baker", "comment_text": "Why is math math", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T07:13:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isa Smelli", "comment_text": "i got all of the tests correct", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T06:42:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blizzardheart12", "comment_text": "Let\u2019s admit it: I\u2019m a dumbass with straight A\u2019s", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T06:25:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Great Mallard", "comment_text": "Jesus Christ song 3 is horrendous", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T06:21:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jr", "comment_text": "I guessed all of them and got it right", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T06:14:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ling .t.h", "comment_text": "Got all of em right", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T06:00:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike", "comment_text": "Doing this at 1am wasn\u2019t the smartest choice", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T05:59:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Malachite Heart", "comment_text": "I passed them all, too easy", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T05:54:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "arqueotm", "comment_text": "i got em all right can i join mensa now", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T05:54:55Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "scooby la boo", "comment_text": "Cool", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T05:46:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Baljeet 69", "comment_text": "Got them all right", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T05:42:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dafinete", "comment_text": "i passed all the test 100% and i was born in March 14th", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T05:37:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miss Sassy", "comment_text": "I saw, more like--  &quot;really?

It&#39;s like how with video games, mechanics are built up over decades.  So for example, a game from 20 years ago is played differently than a game from today, because of new mechanics.  So maybe an old game doesn&#39;t have crafting, or save points, or things like that.  A kid from today might play those games and not realize there aren&#39;t save points, then when they die, realize they have to start from the beginning.  These IQ tests are kind of like that, in that they require pre-requisite knowledge that is only trivial and situational. <br><br>For example, in the first test, #3 could be a valid answer if the rule was a repeating pattern of 8 shapes, making the answer subjective rather than absolute.....which is no way to measure IQ. <br><br> In the second test, you have to of heard those songs before to determine which pitch is off. <br><br>And the results of test 3 can be hindered by physical factors.  For example, the size/distance of the shapes.  If you&#39;re viewing them too close, you might not be able to easily get a clear broad view of them, and your eyes might only be able to focus on one vertical row at a time. The sharpness/quality of the picture could also have an effect on a persons ability to quickly determine the answer, because not all viewing conditions would be the same.  For example, for me this is a 1080p video on a 27 inch 1440p screen, upscaled in the browser to 175%.  Needless to say, those images are not sharp, nor is the resolution of the video divisible by the resolution of the screen....and even if it was at 1:1 scale, it would only be relative to watching an image as if it were on a much smaller screen size.<br><br> Intelligence also isn&#39;t necessarily measured in brief time limits.", "comment_date": "2018-03-17T20:41:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Martinez", "comment_text": "Im not the brightest but at least I got all the questions right.", "comment_date": "2018-03-17T20:38:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael", "comment_text": "Who knows the name of Song 3?", "comment_date": "2018-03-17T20:28:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nevermind", "comment_text": "For the first one I imagined he was on a tv show and I felt that someone just roasted him and he was trying not to let it bother him... i think I was correct.

The different types of intelligence are highly correlated, meaning they are most likely one construct, one general-intelligence just with different special-intelligence-aspects, which ofcourse can be trained or ignored and therefore get worse. Kinda like being lefthanded or righthanded - all part of one general body, but not completly different and it can be trained. Someone who has trouble moving precicely in general, will have it with both arms, while someone who is very accurate could train it with both - not both to perfection ofcourse.<br>Also &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;intelligence&quot; (like in the ballet example) are put into a model of fluid and crystaline intelligence - which both make up the actual intelligence. In part because it is impossible to only test intelligence without knowledge or the other way around. This does not only apply to ballet, but to all tests. The shown tests all are easier, if you have certain knowledge. Knowing the songs played in the music-test makes it easy to identify which one was wrong. The visual intelligence was easy because the top-part was always pointin left, the bottom part was pointing right - this is called &quot;chunking&quot;, creating mental shortcuts for complex situations; instead of remembering 6 different figures, I remembered a &quot;top points left, bottom points right&quot;.

Is the source of the embarrassment a fear of humiliation or just something kinda silly? Also, some people might try to hide their embarrassment so the ways people &#39;display&#39; it will be quite varied depending on how they have or haven&#39;t learned to cope with it.  <br><br>I don&#39;t really believe a test for Emotional Intelligence can hold much water (no pun intended ;) ) outside of a live situation.  Showing a bunch of pictures to somebody is extremely basic and is entirely stripped of the physicality and immediacy - the present moment of direct experience.  A true test for empathy requires context.  You can see a picture of a smiley face and know it means happy or something, but it&#39;s nothing more than just a symbol unless it&#39;s relevant to something or someone in a way that gives it meaning.   <br><br>Anyone can fake a smile and say &quot;this person is smiling and that <del>means</del> happy&quot; but what if that guy posing for the photo hates his life and took this job posing for pictures which will be used in emotional intelligence tests, because he&#39;s broke and his girlfriend is gonna leave him if he doesn&#39;t go out there and make some money.  There&#39;s no empathy embedded into the picture because we don&#39;t know <del>why</del> he looks the way he does.  So, we are forced to primarily apply the logical mind to sift through the possible emotional states that might fit, rather than determine what he might be feeling by using any real sense of empathy and a more engaged use of our emotional intelligence.  Sometimes we can infer a lot from very little, but the example in video essentially gave us nothing to work with at all.", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T04:37:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Timmy Two", "comment_text": "I got all of them right <br><br><br>Should I be afraid or proud : |", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T04:37:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XChino04", "comment_text": "Are You Smart?

IQ is also the best predictor of salary, risk of criminality, even health in old age. On the other hand there is little evidence that &#39;multiple intelligence&#39; has much utility at all, although it might be a more comforting idea. I should point out that despite all this IQ is misused and people do use it for pointless ego stroking because ultimately while IQ is a good predictor for future success its still just potential. Unrealized potential is no good to anyone (and people that brag about being in Mensa are basically just advertising how they have wasted their own potential such that they have no other achievements than happening to be lucky at birth).

IQ or its modern name g (general intelligence) is the single most inheritable psychological characteristic which is pretty amazing since its an artificial construct. IQ is also the best predictor of salary, risk of criminality, even health in old age. On the other hand there is little evidence that &#39;multiple intelligence&#39; has much utility at all, although it might be a more comforting idea. I should point out that despite all this IQ is misused and people do use it for pointless ego stroking because ultimately while IQ is a good predictor for future success its still just potential. Unrealised potential is no good to anyone (and people that brag about being in mensa are basically just advertising how they have wasted their own potential such that they have no other achievements than happening to be lucky at birth). Also online IQ tests are nonsense, they are not psychologically valid but they are ego commercialized.", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T01:02:37Z", "likes_count": 276}, {"comment_by": "78Vertigo", "comment_text": "I am super good at seing things, especially ASAPScience", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T01:02:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bob Dole", "comment_text": "I passed the last three test but fail the emotion test, or as my wife has told me many times I&#39;m a Vulcan.", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T01:01:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anakin Skywalker", "comment_text": "Apparently I&#39;m dumb asf \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2b", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T01:01:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unanimated", "comment_text": "Ok I have no pitch I guess :/", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T01:00:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan Gracias", "comment_text": "Does anyone know any free reliable iq test online?", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T00:59:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SilverRain", "comment_text": "Everything was easy for me except the IQ one took a little longer to get.", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T00:59:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0433\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c", "comment_text": "I&#39;m smart, wow.", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T00:59:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus", "comment_text": "I got all three tests right!
