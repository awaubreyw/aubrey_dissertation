It turns out that the air had become too harsh for humans and that&#39;s why we live in buildings isolated. The paradise was real and I asked why are they find.

I actually did originally plan to comment with all my points contradicting this video but the list ended up being to long so here&#39;s just a few of the more critical ones:<br><br>- Eating snow will drastically lower your body temperature and, believe it or not, lead to further dehydration. Snow also contains trapped dirt particles and whatever contaminants it landed on so always boil snow before drinking it.<br><br>- <b>Ahem ahem</b> Solar stills<br><br>- Its true that foxes, owls, and minor predators wont bother you but cougars, coyotes, wolves, bears, lynxs, bobcats, mountain lions, and a huge assortment of other predators will. Each predator is different in its own way and you have to remember certain factors. For example, bears won&#39;t attack you unless they are provoked (unless its a grizzly or polar bear, in which case it WILL eat you), but also remember they are extremely territorial and will attack in territorial defense. Wolves travel in packs and likely wont attack you unless you happen to cross paths during a hunting spree. Cougars are known hide in trees and lure their prey to them by making wailing noises, imitating an animal or human in distress. Coyotes are typically scavengers, and can be dangerous if desperate for food.<br><br>- Actually shelter is a higher priority than food because you can last nearly 3 months without food but you likely wont last the night without a shelter.<br><br>- Berries, leaves, mushrooms, fruits, and even roots are all edible as long as you know what you&#39;re looking for. You probably shouldn&#39;t touch roots or mushrooms unless you&#39;ve been shown what is edible, but go ahead with berries, fruits, and leaves. Note, however, that there are many poisonous berry species that intentionally imitate others (Ex. there is a berry bush that looks extremely similar to wild blueberries in Canada but is in fact poisonous) but blackberries, salmonberries, raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries, and huckleberries, to name a few, are all easily distinguishable and can be found in the wild. Note that leaves from plants like stinging nettle can be boiled to make teas.<br><br>- If you end up not having any Vit. C in a month, you&#39;re hooped. However that shouldn&#39;t be a problem because strawberries, gooseberries, peppers, cantaloupes, rose hips, leafy greens like broccoli and spinach, pineapples, raspberries, tomatoes, and cabbage are just a few natural sources of Vitamin C that can be found in the wild in various regions of the world. It goes without saying that oranges and lemons are also high sources of Vit. C, so if you live in California you&#39;re set :P<br><br>- Sitting there for five hours waiting for a rabbit to hop along is a really dumb way to spend your time. Instead try setting traps and monitoring them regularly, so that you could still catch small wild animals and have time to do other important thing in your day.<br><br>- Don&#39;t ever use cotton, denim, or similar materials. They provide little benefits and if they get wet, they will stay wet for days and also smell really bad. Go for synthetics like polyester, Gore-tex, etc. for waterproof materials, because they are extremely water resistant and quick drying, and wool or metal foil for insulation. Never go out without most of your body covered. Every climate has some sort of characteristic (Hot sun, cold winds, bugs, etc.) that will make you seriously regret exposing your knees, and not to mention it increases the chance of getting cuts and scrapes and having those become infected (and don&#39;t forget ticks and similar parasites). It&#39;s best to wear loose, moderate clothing, and to dress according to the weather. always go for multiple layers of clothing (But not too many layers to be restrictive) rather than just one big jacket, because if you get hot you can take off some of those inner layers of clothing and if you get cold you can put more on. Also each clothing layer provides a purpose (Ex. the outer layer is waterproof, the inner layers provide warmth, and the innermost layer is for comfort).<br><br>- Don&#39;t ever go into a cave, EVER. Apart from the obvious fact that bears, cougars, and many other predators live in caves, caves are often damp, cold, dark, and filled with bugs. They are essentially the breeding grounds for sickness. Also often bears will choose a cave as their place of hibernation and will only return to that cave at that time of the year, so even if the cave looks uninhabited it might not be. I guess maybe if you are a part of a large group a cave might be something to consider, but otherwise don&#39;t do it.<br><br>- Banging two rocks together does NOT work but its quite amusing for the rest of us to watch you do it. You need Flint and either a magnesium alloy, Iron pyrite, or steel. Go to your local hunting store and buy a flint and steel for 5$ (or buy one on Ebay) right now and you will not regret it. Or you could use the million and a half other fire starting methods, such as battery and steel wool, magnifying glass (but only in really sunny climates), matches, bow and notch, etc.<br><br>- Don&#39;t use live grass, sticks, leaves, etc. as tinder. They are extremely hard to burn and create a lot of smoke (I suggest piling that stuff on top of your fire once it is strong if you want to create a smoke signal or signal fire), which isn&#39;t ideal. Always use dead growth. Leaves don&#39;t work so well but dead pine needles, small sticks, and essentially all the dead sh*t you can find on the forest floor works well. Dry birch bark is likely the best though, because that stuff lights even if wet. You should always have all your tinder and firewood before you light the fire, and to start by lighting the tinder, getting a fire going to the point where small sticks and stuff are burning, and then progressively put on bigger and bigger pieces of wood. Also remember the three necessities required for a fire to burn; an equal balance of Oxygen, Fuel, and Heat.<br><br>Thanks for reading and sorry for excessively long paragraph comment. that&#39;s only a few of the points I have in contradiction of this video", "comment_date": "2017-10-06T21:17:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phillysub", "comment_text": "If it happens, I hope I perish on day 1", "comment_date": "2017-10-06T21:15:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ammar Gedio", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxI-8GTqDYA&amp;t=1m04s\">1:04</a> hell nah I&#39;m jumping off a cliff", "comment_date": "2017-10-06T21:15:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "CarbolicSoap", "comment_text": "Timely.", "comment_date": "2017-10-06T21:12:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pat O", "comment_text": "I feel like I just got a speed-course from the Boy Scouts.

Meat should also have a high priority and will best be aquired through breeding though it can be hard to bring them back alive. Sheep and rabbits are a good choice as the wool from sheep is useful as well as there meat and you can probably get a rope around a few you find in the wild as for rabbit finding and stealing domestic rabbits would be better than cathing wild ones as they have less burrowing instinct and will be easier to secure.<br><br>step four: protect your shit from everyone! assuming your little farm is working there will be plenty of people too happy to steal your crops or animals anyone caught must be interrogated for useful skills like farming, medicine, weaving, carpantry, masonary or any primitive skills. Don&#39;t be fooled by any theoretically useful skills a cook may be able to make tastier meals but they wont be able to make non edible things edible. Anyone without skills you can make use of should be killed so they can&#39;t comeback or tell their friends about your place (also free meat!)<br><br>step five: send people to scavange from the cities. By now whatever supplies you took with you will likely be stretched thin or wearing out and its very unlikely you will be able to also operate an iron mine or textile factory. Send very small groups (2-3 to lessen the impact of them not returning) to your nearest urban area armed with whatever you can manage as there could still be groups of desperate people inside towns and cities. Make sure those you send are both well rested and well fed as this will give them an advantage over the more desperate people they may come across in either conflict or fleeing things to grab include metal tools clothing SHOES!! (you will probably never be able to make good shoes) and salt all these things should be easy enough to get sheds will become your best friends<br><br>step six: sit back and enjoy the apocalypse with plenty food you will be king of the wasteland concider letting outsiders in to battle in your thunderdome for scrap swedes this will help to keep moral up amongst your workers. other post stabilization activities you may wish to enjoy include theater, music, colonialism, sacking rome, human experementation, highland clearances, tribalism, leader worship (with you as the leader of cource) and rain dancing. feel free to create your own mythology to give your distant future relatives something to be nostalgic for but please note ifyou do intend to create your own mythology or religeon you must strictly control education to ensure that future generations have very low literacy rates this will help you to contol your subjects by ensuring only the wealthy elite will have full access to the knowlage of your scripture (and hence be able to see through the bullshit) ensuring your messages have maximum impact with the smallest amount of possibile accountabilty though be sure to get rid of any kind of refomation or lutheranism, the longer you can stave off the enlightenmeant the more succesfull your dynasty will be.", "comment_date": "2017-10-06T14:28:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rick Sanchez", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxI-8GTqDYA&amp;t=0m09s\">0:09</a> M-Morty?", "comment_date": "2017-10-06T14:22:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DUDE BRAH", "comment_text": "Now how the heck do you make fire", "comment_date": "2017-10-06T14:17:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Nixon Comedy", "comment_text": "Real answer: be lucky.", "comment_date": "2017-10-06T14:02:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "anna", "comment_text": "Wait. <br>I heard somewhere to never eat snow if you need water.

The super strong waterproof tape that can instantly patch, bond, seal and repair. Flex Tape is no ordinary tape. It&#39;s triple thick adhesive virtually welds itself to the surface, instantly stopping the toughest leaks. Leaky pipes can cause major damage, but Flex Tape grips on tight and bonds instantly. Plus, Flex Tape&#39;s powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater! \u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas without draining them. Flex Tape is perfect for marine, outdoor and\u00a0camping gear, even make emergency repairs on\u00a0air mattressesand inflatables! Flex Tape is super strong. And once it&#39;s on, it holds on tight. \u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holds. To show you the power of Flex Tape, I sawed this boat in half! And repaired it with only Flex Tape! Not only does Flex Tape&#39;s powerful adhesive hold the boat together, but it creates a super strong water tight seal! So the inside is completely dry! Yee doggie!\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>Patch, bond, seal and repair.
