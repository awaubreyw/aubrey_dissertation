But honestly there are many and I mean many things you didn&#39;t cover, for instance human hatred for each other, if two nations go to nuclear war on each other that would be a perfect excuse for other nations to drop nukes on each other that they hate like Russia vs America and plausible deniability would be used by Russia as they claim they were not the ones to drop the bomb it was Pakistan. That&#39;s why a nuclear war is considered mutually assured destruction, if one nation uses nukes, everyone will use nukes to try and become the ultimate superpower by the end of the fallout. Despite what the media tries to claim, and what people believe, the human race is a nasty, greedy and power hungry animal that will look for any opportunity to come out ahead in life even at the cost of billions of lives, yeah there are people who exist like that, north korea is a good example. Nuclear winter would shut up the global warming hippies is the only benefit I can see, and hell if half of the human population died off think of all the free space we would have, sure a few decades would need to pass for the radiated land to calm down but after that we would have prime real estate for anyone who survived, and since man kind would be back in a survival phase, finding a man or a woman will no longer be difficult, anyone still alive I would imagine would be a welcome companion post war so societal stigmas would I believe no longer be an issue, food might. Also think of the changes this would cause, survivors of such an event would most likely or I at least hope would put aside differences and try to make a world without such wars in the future or not, our nature might just bring us back to the old ways that got us into a post apocalyptic world in the first place. But then again shutting up the global warming hippies would be welcomed. FYI by no means would I ever consider nuclear war a beneficial act by any means, I hope people here can read the obvious sarcasm in this and not take what I have written seriously. Obviously death is not funny, but in the face of death I would rather look on the up side rather than the enormous amount of human and animal suffering that would incur if such an event would happen, when faced with death might as well crack a joke even a bad one and go out with a smile as you prepare to give your lord the middle finger for allowing such things to come to pass in the first place and pray that he&#39;s in a favorable mood.", "comment_date": "2019-12-24T11:07:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chasington", "comment_text": "\u201cSo this Bomb would apply 180 tons of force on an object\u201d<br>Also him: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the human body can survive this force, and it would be the buildings that kill", "comment_date": "2019-12-18T09:17:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Maddie Owens", "comment_text": "Here before North Korea\u2019s Christmas gift \ud83e\udd70", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T05:27:48Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "NamoGhost", "comment_text": "its scary humans will cause the end of humanity", "comment_date": "2019-12-12T16:18:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dr", "comment_text": "There&#39;s two types of intelligent people in the world  the people who use it for good and the people who use their high intelligence to create ideas on how to kill each other down to no smaller than this length 1.616255(18)\u00d710\u221235\u00a0m  .", "comment_date": "2019-12-11T15:38:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "corky", "comment_text": "never need you big whit bog roll when shit comes .", "comment_date": "2019-11-30T19:29:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Tobin", "comment_text": "The destructive capacity of a nuclear bomb is NOT proportional to its&#39; megatonage.

Nuclear winter assumes that smoke from burning cities can magically breach this barrier on its own and remain suspended in the Stratosphere for weeks and months, blocking the sun. Something even the strongest and most severe storms, with the strongest updrafts, can&#39;t do. It takes a great deal of force to drive something past the Tropopause and into the Stratosphere. Megaton range nuclear weapons can do it, but only with whatever material gets sucked into the mushroom cloud. But even detonating every nuke on the planet would not put enough material into the Stratosphere to block out the sun for weeks and months. Burning cities an forests have zero chance. Volcanoes can do it, and have. But only to a degree, and very localized. In fact, the only force powerful enough to cause this &quot;nuclear winter&quot; would be a large meteor impact, like the event theorized to have killed of the dinosaurs.

I saw all news learned about all countries nuke and everything...Ok, so countries can cause it is Pakistan and Indian, North Korea, Isreal. I did not add Russia and USA cause we don&#39;t see them nowadays we don&#39;t see them against each other but still 10% chances are there... So if not Korea fires a nuke on any country without a  war for sure world war 3 starts where the USA will response and China and Russia may get involved however if N.korea does not fire the nuke missile how would this all happen? next Isreal. Isreal can not just stay cant last long against Palestine Arabs and Pakistan will response soon which can start a nuke war cause Pakistan is the only Muslim country to make nuke weapons and Israel is also nuke powered.... Pakistan-India both are nuke power and are ready for war anytime...Wait a min there is a connection in all this what I just said wait please read this also if you came till here. If N.Korea fires a nuke Missle the USA, NATO, CHINA, AND RUSSIA WILL BE GET INVLOED NO NOT ONLY THEY INDIA WILL ALSO COME AGAINST N.KOREA AND PAKISTAN WILL COME AGAINST INDIA AND ISREAL WILL COME AGAINST PAKISTAN THEN ARAB AND ALL MUSLIM COUNTRY WILL COME AGAINST ISREAL....World war 3 and qustion contact me my email is gems.fakhir@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a>", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T20:25:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "omg gam", "comment_text": "If that happens the world will end", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T16:09:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathaniel Vasquez", "comment_text": "How To Survive the Last Days<br>here is the guide to download <a href=\"http://2surviveworldwar3.blogspot.com/\">2SurviveWorldWar3.blogspot.com</a>", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T15:20:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I hate google", "comment_text": "I&#39;m gonna make myself a foil suit now.", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T01:57:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u2022Cookie Crumbz\u2022", "comment_text": "Well too late north Korea is starting a nuclear war or threat  us.", "comment_date": "2017-09-20T19:19:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Robinson", "comment_text": "Those were atomic bombs.", "comment_date": "2017-09-19T23:39:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IKILL4CHEEZ", "comment_text": "Who\u2019s watching post-war", "comment_date": "2017-09-19T18:24:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GravelRoad1", "comment_text": "I think we should detonate 20 nukes in the desert to reverse global warming.", "comment_date": "2017-09-19T02:04:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas 0101", "comment_text": "Anyone here because you&#39;re getting ready for WW3 cause I certainly am\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-09-18T15:31:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "johneygd", "comment_text": "Ww3 is going to happen no matter what you try to avoid it, it&#39;s going to happen soon or later.", "comment_date": "2017-09-18T13:34:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dannyoman", "comment_text": "Joerg better lend me a protective white t shirt in Armageddon or I&#39;ve had it !!

When americans used napalm bombings and nuclear weapon against Japan they purposely and consciously massacred hundreds of thousands of innocent people, including old people, pregnant women, little children, babies, toddlers, the families of Japanese soldiers who left those innocent cities to go to the war. Those families, those innocent people were not the &quot;incidental damages&quot; nor the &quot;collateral damages&quot;, they were murdered directly, purposely, they were the target. This is a crime against humanity without exceptions. There&#39;s no justification for that, it doesn&#39;t exist and it can&#39;t exist unless you&#39;re a maniac or a nazi or an american. Murdering the family of a miniac to stop the maniac is not the right thing to do no matter what, those who do that are not better than maniacs themselves and need to be stopped and punished, it&#39;s a common knowledge, well not for americans though.

Most bombs will be airbursts to maximize the blast force which will minimize fallout. Ground burst would only be used on underground targets (bunkers, missile silos, etc)3. Most nuclear bombs are under 500K, as the bigger bombs required heavier lift systems (bombers, or ICMBs). Large single bombs are less effective than MIRV ICBMs and bombers, since more targets can be hit with more bombs for a given delivery vehicle Payload. most ICBMs are MIRVs which a single ICBM carriers a dozen or more warheads that can strike many targets.4. The big problem is not the bombs but the worlds 440+ nuclear reactors which would fail and meltdown as the grid is lost and the ability to service &amp; maintain them is lost. A typical nuclear bomb has fissile material measured in kilograms, and a typical nuclear reactor has fissile material measured in tons. Its likely that in a global nuclear war the reactors will kill off humanity and not the bombs. Most of the nuclear reactors are adjacent to the rivers and oceans since they use large amounts of water. When these reactors fail they will contaminate the rivers and oceans, perhaps to the point no human life can exist. or to the point humans are forced to live in very isolated pockets.", "comment_date": "2017-01-28T19:19:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Dogeanu", "comment_text": "Pro advice: Move as far away from large cities as possible.

But let\u2019s assume these two nations do not press the button, and that tensions eventually explode between India and Pakistan....The two countries have just over 200 relatively small nuclear warheads between them. Suppose they unleash half of them, a hundred 15-kilotonne weapons the size of Little Boy...The carnage from the blast, as well as firestorms and radiation in megacities like Karachi and Delhi, would kill millions...The fires would send about 5 million tonnes of hot black smoke into the stratosphere, where it would spread round the world. This smog would cut solar radiation reaching Earth\u2019s surface by 8 per cent \u2013 enough to drop average winter temperatures by a startling 2.5 to 6 \u00b0C across North America, Europe and much of Asia, and not just for a few days. It would take around five years for the impacts to peak, and the repercussions would still be felt strongly after a decade.<br>Besides a nuclear winter, climate models predict that rainfall would be reduced as weather systems lost energy. The Asian monsoon would collapse: that\u2019s two billion people with as much as 80 per cent less water. The Amazon basin and the already arid Southwestern US and western Australia would scarcely do better.<br>The smoke would heat the normally chilly stratosphere by around 30 \u00b0C, unleashing nitrogen chemistry that would destroy much of the ozone layer. But skin cancer might be the least of our concerns. Near-ice-age temperatures would cause frosts capable of reducing the growing season in the world\u2019s mid-latitude bread baskets by up to 40 days. This, combined with meagre rainfall and blistering UV, would cause crop yields to plummet. Nuclear winter would deliver global famine.<br>All this, remember, from a small regional war. Steven Starr of the University of Missouri has calculated that a nuclear exchange between the US and Russia could throw 150 million tonnes of smoke into the air. That would block 70 per cent of sunlight and cool much of the world by 20 \u00b0C or more.

Jesus lived a perfect life, born of the virgin Mary, conceived by The Holy Spirit who created the heavens and the earth from nothing but Himself. Jesus lived the life we cannot live in order to please God. He met God&#39;s standards while standing in our place on our behalf. Jesus died on the cross as if He were us, under the full wrath of God for all the believing. He was treated as if He were us though He never did anything wrong, so we could be treated as if we were Him. He died and was buried and three days later He was resurrected from the dead. God kept His Promise by showing He has power over life, death, hell, sin and good and the grave. all is subject to Him. Jesus was risen to show that all who would believe in Him would be made right with God eternally by His work and worth only. His infinite Righteousness is applied to all who will forsake sin and trust in Him to save them by His worth and work only, and trust and follow His ways as stated in the Holy Bible. all who are not saved will perish under the wrath of God. <br><br>we must be born again, renewed and given a new nature because our ancestors Adam and Eve sinned and were cut off from God. He gave us His law which we were unable to keep. He gave us sacrifice systems in order to transfer sin and punish sin, but they were temporary because we are sinners who keep sinning. so He sent Jesus to be the ultimate all atoning Sacrifice for those who will believe in and follow God through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the Son of God. <br><br>God must punish sin. He is righteous and just and cannot just forgive or over look sin. that would make Him corrupt and wicked which He isn&#39;t. so He sent Jesus to take our place so we could be pardoned. Hallelujah! praise be to God we can have salvation and reconciliation and forgiveness and the power over sin to not do it and get rid of it. <br><br>Repent and believe in Him today. those without Him will perish without mercy. we are subject to Judgement whether we believe in Him or not. you cannot escape God. <br><br>John 3:1-36, Ephesians 2:8,9, Isaiah 64:6,7 Romans <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL4Kqfxg2KU&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a>,23 Romans <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL4Kqfxg2KU&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a> Romans 10:9, Romans 5. 2 Corinthians <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL4Kqfxg2KU&amp;t=5m17s\">5:17</a>", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T01:29:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "siobhan m", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL4Kqfxg2KU&amp;t=1m20s\">1:20</a> soooo I&#39;m guessing I need to stop dressing in black", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T01:28:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aHuge Gorilla", "comment_text": "Should I spend my saving on a College degree or a bomb shelter?", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T01:27:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stj3rn3", "comment_text": "&quot;What if a nuclear weapon was dropped near you?&quot;<br>Oh man I dropped my nuclear weapon oops", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T01:27:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tineka Edwards", "comment_text": "that Trump", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T01:27:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NighteeeY", "comment_text": "There was a guy who survived BOTH nuclear bombs at a very near location to them and didnt even show any signs of radiation sickness or cancer at all.

True, there are roughly 20,000 active nuclear warheads in the world, but these scenarios are worst case if they were all used at once and produced a maximum yield. Truth is, most nuclear warheads are not strategic, city destroying, mega warheads, or MIRV cluster bombs like the Russian SS-18 or U.S. MX; they number only in the dozens.\u00a0Most are tactical nukes that have yields of less than 1000 kilotons for use to be directed against battlefield targets like enemy airfields, warship ports, oil fields, command centers, and nuclear launch sites. Most nuclear bombs today produce only 1% of the energy released from the Hiroshima bomb, and are able to blow up a battlefield roughly the size of a football stadium. A single volcano releases an equivalent of 100,000 nuclear warheads of energy; yet humanity has survived multiple volcanos in our lifetimes. Remember the eruption of Mount Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland in 2010? That single volcano blew off more energy than almost all the nukes the world ever produced. It blotted out all of Europe with smoke for months; I was stationed in Kuwait at the time and I saw\u00a0the haze reach the Middle East right over me. During World War 2, the Allied bombing campaigns\u00a0of Dresden, Germany, and Tokyo, Japan by conventional bombs killed more people in each city than the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs combined. Nuclear weapons are powerful, and devastating, but the llikelihood that in a war you will be killed by one is remote. During our lifetimes we will have 1000s of times more chances to be killed in a car accident than a nuclear war.
