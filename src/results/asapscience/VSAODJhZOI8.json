With narcolepsy whether you got good sleep or not you&#39;re going to be tired randomly, and you may even fall asleep without realizing it. To prevent this you need to avoid stress and anxiety, for the most part that tends to stop it but not always, that&#39;s why across the day you have to spread out a few naps, about 15 to 30 minute naps about the day, once you wake up you&#39;ll start doing school, then about maybe 2 or 3 hours into your work you can have a 15 minute nap, once you wake up from that nap or have someone wake you up if you have bad narcolepsy like me, you&#39;d go back to school for another few hours about 3 hours then another nap, you also have an nap near whenever your lunch time is, and then throughout the rest of the day you can kind of just nap whenever you feel like it (after school ends that is). <br><br>Also if any of you have questions about narcolepsy don&#39;t be shy to ask I am more than happy to answer! Before that though I am going to put some answers for some more common questions.<br><br>Q 1. &quot;What&#39;s bad narcolepsy?&quot;<br>Answer: What I considered to be bad narcolepsy is what I have, I can fall asleep within around 10 minutes, and I enter REM sleep within about 15!<br><br>Q 2. &quot;Why would narcolepsy make you more tired?&quot;<br>Answer: Narcolepsy tends to pair along with another thing which is known as insomnia, I do have both, so you can&#39;t sleep on command, yet you can sleep when your narcolepsy kicks in!<br><br>Q 3. &quot;Does it make life harder?/Is it a disability?&quot;<br>Answer: No not really, it&#39;s not a disability per say but I suppose it could be looked at like one, yes it makes life harder but not extremely, since I&#39;ve always had it, it&#39;s not something that you can catch it&#39;s something your born with, I can&#39;t really imagine a life without it and I consider it a part of me!<br><br>Q 4. &quot;Do you have other things? Disability wise?&quot;<br>Answer: Yes. I have a few, autism, ADHD, OCD, EDS, Possibly Bi-Polar disorder, and a few others!", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T14:28:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EntirelyBonkers", "comment_text": "I take like four hour naps so", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T13:56:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keerthi Medapati", "comment_text": "Ok, Daniel larusso", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T10:53:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MyraMedchan", "comment_text": "It takes me 2-4 hours to get to stage 3... and I never go back to stage 1 or 2( no lie If it weren&#39;t for me getting nervous about time because of my lucid dreams I can &quot;sleep&quot; for 48 hours...", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T07:57:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Um chile anyways so\u2026", "comment_text": "I didn\u2019t hear anything I was staring at his teeth", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T02:42:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GraceGS720", "comment_text": "Is taking advice from YouTube and TickTockers bad or stupid?", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T23:29:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "seafse esfsefe", "comment_text": "The like only time I took a nap, when I woke up I felt so weird.

I\u2019m no scientist, but I\u2019m well aware that we are animals, just like cats and dogs, and the natural instinct of all animals is to go to sleep whenever they\u2019re tired. Because we are more intelligent beings, we\u2019re able to reason and override our natural desires to take a nap or sleep. I don\u2019t know much about the consequences of sleep deprivation, but one can be sure that they\u2019re not just in harms way when not getting enough sleep at night, but also when operating with a \u201ctired brain\u201d when they needed a nap and didn\u2019t take one. To conclude, I will state that surely not all humans require naps. Not all humans experience fatigue in the later hours of the day. For those who are fresh, regardless of the time of day, certainly a nap is non-consequential.
