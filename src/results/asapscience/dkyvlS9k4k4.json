However, for canned potatoes, Dole is the only brand I will get as the other brands I&#39;ve tried clearly use lower grade potatoes or don&#39;t go through the effort of making the end product better. When it comes to corn, any brand works. Same with sweet peas and pinto beans (and other beans). Store brand milk tends to taste better to me than name brand milk for some reason. Pet milk tastes funny while Food Lion brand or Walmarts brand tastes fine. When it comes to cheese, don&#39;t cheap out, get real cheese. Totally worth it. For bread, Dollar Generals store brand bread is great for the price (about half the price of other brands). Basically, try the store brands and see if you like them.

That is the &quot;bio-availability&quot; of the drug.  Depending on the fillers used, and the way in which the drug is supsended in the pill or liquid, the amount of active drug that is able to reach your blood stream can be different. While the pill you swallow may indeed have the same dose of medication, the amount that is able to be absorbed in your intestines, and the amount that is able to pass through the hepatic portal system is different. Two people swallow 200mg of ibuprofen, the one who took Advil may have 130mg reach the blood stream, whereas the person who took the generic brand may only have 100mg reach the blood stream. This is why the drugs with narrow therapeutic ranges require the use of the brand name drug.  I feel that this is an important aspect in the discussion of generic vs brand name pharmaceuticals.  Many Over The Counter (OTC) drugs have therapeutic ranges that are wide enough to not result in negative results when using generics with less bio-availability.  However, as a health-care professional, I feel that it is imperative that all information must be provided when educating laymen about various options of treatment.

Those are name brands for the drug levothyroxine, a thyroid hormone.<br>First of all let me get this out of the way, if you are started on either the brand or the generic you should stay on either the brand or the generic because there are slight differences in the strengths. And if you switch then your dose might need to be adjusted up or down slightly.<br>NOW as far as the name brand being better or of higher quality? In the case of this drug, that&#39;s not the case. Studies by the FDA show that the generic Levothyroxine is actually MORE accurately matched to the labeled strength than the name brands are.<br>Drugs have to fall within a certain window of accuracy when it comes to the amount of active ingredient in the drug. For example levothyroxine is measured in micrograms which is a very tiny weight. The labeled strength might be 100 mcg and by law they have to be within 5 mcg in either direction of that strength (not sure what the actual window is for levothyroxine, just giving an example).<br>The generic is actually proven to be consistently more accurate than either of the name brands Synthroid, Levoxyl, or Levothroid.<br>The actual reason why modern doctors might want DAW Synthroid is because their patient is stabilized at a certain dose and a switch to generic might require a dose change. It&#39;s NOT because the generic is inferior quality. It&#39;s just because the drug has a narrow therapeutic index and tiny changes are noticeable by the thyroid gland.<br>For most other drugs, those tiny variances fall below a threshold that can&#39;t be detected and make zero difference. Those thresholds are known for every drug and are well studied. Those variances by law need to be the same OR BETTER for generics as they do for their brand name drugs.<br>The next time someone tells you that brand drugs are better than generics, tell them that it&#39;s most likely just in their head.
