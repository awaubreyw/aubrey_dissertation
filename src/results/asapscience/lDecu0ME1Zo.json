Yes, faith is required, but he helps anyone who asks with that, and gives us his living Word, besides. A little proof:<br><br>1. Job 38:7 references the fact that the stars &quot;sing,&quot; which was unknown at the time the Bible was written. Scientists now know that the stars sing at a frequency that the human ear cannot pick up.<br><br>2. Job <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDecu0ME1Zo&amp;t=38m31s\">38:31</a>-32 &quot;Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?&quot; In this verse God is telling Job the things he can, and does, do, by providing examples. Scientists now know that *Pleiades is a group of 250 stars bound together by by mutual gravitational attraction, traveling together in the same direction. We now know that the 3 star &quot;belt&quot; of *Orion is, over the course of thousands of years, drifting slowly apart, and will one day no longer be aligned. *Mazzaroth is the hebrew word for &quot;constellations,&quot; which were made by God for &quot;signs&quot; and &quot;seasons,&quot; because God knew that humans would use the accuracy of the night sky to measure time and distance. Scientists discovered that *Arcturus, which appears to be a single star, is actually one star with 52 additional stars (or sons) connected directionally, and traveling as if a hand guided them through the heavens. This group travels so fast, breaking all the rules of physics, that scientists call them a &quot;law unto themselves.&quot;<br><br>3. Job <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDecu0ME1Zo&amp;t=38m30s\">38:30</a> &quot;The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.&quot; Did you know that 3 quarters of earth&#39;s water is locked underground in a layer of rock? Because scientists only discovered that recently, in spite of the Bible recording this fact thousands of years ago.<br><br>4. In Revelation 21:19 The 12 foundation stones, or gems, of New Jerusalem are listed, and every one is anisotropic. That means they produce a rainbow-colored array when scientists hit them with polarized (pure) light. Isotropic gems (like diamonds), however, only look black under the same light. Out of the 28 stones generally regarded as gems, only 16 of them are anistropic - the chance of randomly selecting those 12 gems in Revelation are 1 in a 1000. &quot;...and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.&quot; Rev. 4:3<br><br>5. Genesis 2:7 says God formed men from the dust of the ground. Researchers at NASA&#39;s Ames research center confirmed that every element in man can be found in the soil!<br><br>6. Genesis 17:12 commands specifically that male babies be circumcised on the 8th day. Doctors now know that for the first 7 days of life, an infant&#39;s blood will not clot properly, but on the 8th day their prothrombin levels are elevated above one hundred percent of normal, and is the ONLY day in a male&#39;s life that this will be the case. It is literally the ideal day to heal from the procedure.<br><br>7. Numerous verses in the bible direct God&#39;s people to wash their hands in RUNNING water, to quarantine sick individuals and have them wear a face covering (mask), and disinfect their clothing. He directed his people to bury their bodily wastes away from camp, throw away clay pots that touched dead things (clay pots can absorb pathogens), avoid unclean animals (the eating of which caused diseases. Ex. monkeys caused AIDS, rodents the plague, pigs the flu and tapeworms, and bats the covid virus), and never to eat animals that died of natural causes. This is all before the existence of germs was even heard of! During the time it was written, human and animal feces was a common cure-all for diseases, and lizard blood and dead mice were used in healing ointments. Yet the Bible was teaching practices far ahead of its time and contrary to the popular \u201cmedicine\u201d in use.<br><br>8. Amos 9:6 details how God calls forth the waters of the sea and pours them out again on the earth. Yet the water cycle of evaporation, vapor rising and becoming clouds, falling, and making its way back to the ocean wasn&#39;t discovered until 300 years ago by Galileo.<br><br>9. Job 26:7 says the earth is hung upon nothing, and Isaiah 40:22 calls the earth a circle. This was written centuries before these facts were proved, and in fact most of the earth at that time believed that the world was a flat disc that sat upon a turtle&#39;s back, or the shoulders of the God Atlas. <br><br>10. The &quot;father of oceanography&quot; Matthew Maury read the expression &quot;paths of the sea&quot; in Psalms and went out to look for them, leading to the discovery of cold and warm continental currents. The bible also talks about the existence of deep channels and fountains in the seas, which scientists were only able to discover in the past few hundred years with modern technology.<br><br>11. Names, places, peoples, and events that were recorded ONLY in the bible, and speculated by some to be made up, have slowly been corroborated by archeological evidence, especially in the last few hundred years. Read &quot;A Christian&#39;s Guide to Evidence for the Bible&quot; by J. Daniel hays for 101 instances in which show how extremely historically accurate the Bible really is. <br><br>12. Ezekiel 26:4 foretold that the city of Tyre would be destroyed and scraped flat, and made into a desolate place where fishermen would spread their nets on, and that her timber and stones and dust would be laid in the midst of the water. Nebuchadnezzar did conquer the city, and when the inhabitants fled to a nearby island, he destroyed the city in a rage. 250 years later Alexander the Great scraped those same ruins flat, using them to build a causeway in the middle of the sea in order to reach the new island city of Tyre who resisted his attempts to conquer them. This is only one of many detailed prophecies fulfilled in the bible.<br><br>A proper study of the Bible will reveal so much more proof. Open your KJV Bible, and utilize youtube vids like Walter Veith&#39;s Total Onslaught Series and The Genesis Conflict, and Nader Manour&#39;s studies. Ellen White&#39;s The Conflict of the Ages books can be read online for free, as well as Uriah Smith&#39;s Daniel and the Revelation. In looking for proof of God, you will also find abundant proof of his love for you!", "comment_date": "2021-04-24T23:08:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ari Quinn", "comment_text": "I am stressed because I am waiting for my parents to see my way of coming out as lesbian", "comment_date": "2021-04-23T23:58:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Accept Gub", "comment_text": "Lol I looked up \u201cstress fnf\u201d because of week 7 and now I\u2019m being recommended videos about stress.

But you, be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.<br><br>Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDecu0ME1Zo&amp;t=16m12s\">16:12</a><br>12 Then the disciples understood that he was not warning them to guard themselves from the yeast used in bread but from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.<br>----<br>So you could see that we have to be wise as a serpent to realize what our Saviour was saying they will take books out and they will add books ,I wouldn&#39;t have known this if it wasn&#39;t for the dreams.<br>----<br>in 1321 a real Christian which are known by Cathars prophesied in 700 years the good man and woman will return, next year is that 700 mark, and many people are having dreams of our Saviour saying he&#39;s coming back soon and tell his people, and rapture dreams.<br><br>The Cathars is in Southern France and they practice celibacy and vegan life&#39;s also that&#39;s where Mary Magdalene went to France .<br>----<br>Something to think about Mary Magdalene and Thomas have went out to preach, so if this accounts are true, they are the original real Christian teachings.<br>----<br>My recent discoveries are the Gospel of the Holy Twelve I believe it&#39;s the original source and there are similarities of Matthew but I think it&#39;s possible that some of it has been corrupted, it mentions not to animals a lot.<br>----<br>For you new Christians this is a lot to understand and to accept but you have to acknowledge that verses are saying they are still valid and for the older Christians you may know your walk is extremely challenging every other day basically and you probably wonder why you have sadness feelings, lonely and urges.<br>     I failed many times and if it wasn&#39;t for me practicing to be vegan and celibate I don&#39;t doubt that I&#39;d still be failing.<br>   For those who do not know celibate means to be single and I practice till the day I die so I don&#39;t think about trying to be with the woman later and there&#39;s scripture that supports this,these teachings make my walk much better because I do not think about the time I would be with a spouse.<br>   And to be vegan means not to eat anything that was killed ,the way I practice it includes milk, cheese and what I also do practice because of Dreams I do not drink energy drinks or coffee.<br>   So if you all want to see how it could be encouraged you all to try to take the books seriously and try the walk for yourselves because it works and saved me from being a repeat failure.<br>----<br>My Dream<br>Dreamed I flew up from a carnival and seemed to be zombies as left the ground and I flew to heaven I guess and door shut like a cellar door and appeared as it closed was a book opened with golden letters writings.<br><br>More dreams are on my page that are very interesting and show me I&#39;m on the right path.<br>----<br>Good Luck on your Journey <br>------------------------------------------------------------------", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T14:58:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chiaki The Gamer", "comment_text": "All I learned is make out and eat gum-", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T05:24:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Starry Cloudii", "comment_text": "SORRY this didnt work<br>THANKS for making it even worse!<br>i haven&#39;t slept in 2 days.", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T21:07:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnny Is super", "comment_text": "drugs", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T18:55:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chew chew", "comment_text": "My family makes me stress everyday", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T07:55:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Not a Gibus", "comment_text": "I have a Format on my Pc that&#39;s why I am stressed (probably no one cares about my life troubles)", "comment_date": "2020-10-11T02:52:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lacuevadelvampiro", "comment_text": "japans suicide rate tho...", "comment_date": "2020-10-11T00:53:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mars Natale", "comment_text": "Music...i have T R I E D SOOO HARD", "comment_date": "2020-10-08T02:07:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gianne usman", "comment_text": "now that online classes have started I badly need this :&#39;&gt;", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T15:34:00Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "SnacksForSnackay", "comment_text": "This helped a lot.
