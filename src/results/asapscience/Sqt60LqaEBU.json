Generally, the direct sound is what&#39;s used to localize something, but the reflections you hear from the first sound to about 80ms afterwards are what actually composes the bulk of what you perceive as the &quot;sound&quot; from something. From my experience, the direct sound is what&#39;s used to localize, while the indirect sound contains the actual perceived acoustic signature along with the cues as to the surrounding environment the source is in (i.e. small room, concert hall, outdoors, etc.). You can get a similar effect after it snows. Outside peoples voices sound muted compared to what you would normally hear. Of course, the above is the two extremes, where either all the sound is absorbed and there are no reflections, or allowed to reflect until its eventually attenuated by the losses in the air itself.", "comment_date": "2022-04-24T04:56:25Z", "likes_count": 45}, {"comment_by": "Anthony LaBarbera", "comment_text": "music producers would love both rooms", "comment_date": "2022-04-24T04:51:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Benoit", "comment_text": "Helen Keller simulator", "comment_date": "2022-04-24T04:01:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "vampkat21", "comment_text": "I would love to check out that room.  3m should do fundraiser for how long people can stay it.

It was a low wind day so not much in the way of wind noise, no birds, no airplanes, no passing cars, no other people not a single sound and I Immediately fell into such a Zen like state, I just stood there in the middle of an open field and did nothing.  I enjoyed the silence so much, the depressurization in my head as you stated due to the lack of sound brought me so much inner peace that I have never since then ever found anywhere, I think I would love being in that chamber too much that they would need to call the cops to drag me out of there.

It is probably easier for me to just drive down to Crater Lake again a few hundred miles than to find an anechoic chamber anywhere in this desolate PNW shitty, I mean city... great video.
