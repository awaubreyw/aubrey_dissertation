If everybody who had corona was a confirmed case and you would measure it against people who are confirmed dead from it, since those numbers are also iffy as a lot of people died from something 100% unrelated to corona but are labeled as a corona case even though they would have 100% died whether they had corona or not. Then you would see that the mortality rate is really low, like same level as the flu. And not even a bad flu, just a mild one. Now contagion rate on the other hand that is really high. But that is typically the case with milder diseases, like a common cold. As people with symptoms still go out and spread it to other people since they are still healthy enough to go to work.

However, young people need to take this as serious as everyone else, if not more because we are the primary means of transmission. We don&#39;t get ill enough to stop us from going to work or going out, so we have to make the conscious decision to isolate for the sake of others.

I am not saying COVID-19 is not serious. I&#39;m just saying that keeping the hype to manipulate idiots into allowing it to be controlled is literally our last line of defense and it is working because of that. I pondered why this is so important... then I thought about who is mostly dying from it, confused old people who watch Fox News, InfoWars, and Rush Limbaugh. So, lip-service how it&#39;s a conspiracy then do nothing real to stop fighting it... got it. Then blame the economic wreckage of the pandemic on &quot;libtard over-reaction&quot; because diseases and reactions to them are somehow also how reality is political.<br>Why did I use the word &quot;hype&quot;? It&#39;s because it applies. The pandemic crossed over political failures, politics that killed government preparedness (globally) and now the kids all over the world spraying gasoline all over the place, throwing paper and kindling all over the place, are now dealing with nature throwing a cigarette out the window.<br>COVID-19 is only deadly and out of control because of its long no-symptom time and politics. Action is taken against it, as a global effort, because bypassing politics and doing something CAN actually do something... not because it is the most deadly thing on Earth. Think about it this way, here in the USA... what if we had a daily report of people killed by gun violence and the total deaths of gun violence since the reporting began? COVID-19 would seem like the sniffles. If that was a global issue, there would be a similar level of Police State on guns. Why isn&#39;t that addressed? Well, frankly, because it cannot be controlled. Violence and weapon use is human nature. Police state weapons and the blowback is atomic on many levels. And before you mention the UK and other &quot;we are not the USA&quot; places guns are banned, I made some side money just throwing a bit of money on guns there. Anti-guns there are just as lucrative as making money on drugs because of the War on Drugs here. I digress... ranting again.<br>Compare COVID-19 to other epidemics and pandemics in lethality and contagiousness... it scores pretty low compared to some flu variants that got side-lined among others, even HIV... the AIDS virus.<br>People die globally, every day, by HIV related illnesses... and we have medications for that even though it is still incurable. There is even a &quot;deadly&quot; strain that kills its victim quickly. Oh... but protect the privacy of the major vector(s) because of privacy... unless it&#39;s COVID-19... COVID-19 is far less lethal but it can actually be controlled.<br>I have a sh^tty immune system. I have a bad heart. COVUD-19 is a virus I fear. It can actually kill me. I do not want the disease and hope to never catch it. I cough up lots of lung butter and sometimes blood when I get a cold. When sick, I have coughed myself into passing out. Each epidemic I choke down my panic.<br>Compared to what I feared many times over my decades of life, after reading COVID-19&#39;s relative stats, I see it as in the yellow area of green-yellow-red danger rating. I see it as a disease ninja, dangerous because it is invisible and can sneak around forever. I don&#39;t see it as a disease warrior, like bird and swine flu or even the other SARS strains. It borders the &quot;let&#39;s sweep this under the rug&quot; ninja of HIV and the warrior diseases of &quot;let&#39;s act upon this immediately&quot; of an observable contagion.<br>So, hype works here. Hype saves lives. If the hype is used, your nation f^cked up. Get everyone in charge replaced. It&#39;s 2020, there were centuries of pandemic defense plans and politics bypassed them because of political sophistry. If nature itself can be the terrorist, your officials failed. The scientific community is light years beyond anything the political puppets lobbyists buy can dream of. If your elected officials consider anything scientific a debate, ax them.<br>Politically, we are all 10-300 years behind the scientists and even the reasonable.<br>COVID-19 is not a hoax not a conspiracy nor a smokescreen... but the powers that be are using it like that.<br>What news is NOT reported because a COVID-19 new update on a new case and-or body count is reported? Someone sneaking in a bill that gets passed without public scrutiny? Yep. Oh, crime is down... so... how many people are poisoning their victims to seem to die from COVID-19 and just get diagnosed with that? How many incompetent doctors are diagnosing preventable (lawsuit needed) problems with deaths related to COVID-19? So... Facebook and Microsoft are no longer in the spotlight lax anti-hacker and anti-propaganda efforts... why? It does not take a conspiracy to create local, national, or global problems... that is a hard thing to do with conspiracies due to the effort and resources involved... it takes very little for all conspiracies to boon from such events. I mean, after 9/11, I sold a lot of &quot;radiation &amp;  biowarfare detectors&quot; to people fearing terrorists. Don&#39;t judge, I was a bit more opportunist and loved the fear. It was a complex kid that always gave a &quot;negative&quot; result.<br>I miss the days when the idiot worker-bee rant was &quot;What about the terrorists?&quot; My complex comforting answers worked there.<br>I cannot even speak about the COVID-19 thing and people who know me find my reaction to it extremely perplexing and more so when I now refuse to speak to them about it other than &quot;Look into it, idiot.

Pure darkness anyways, the type where you cant even see your hands when you put it in front of your face. To me it wasnt just that it was dark, no, it was more than that, it was an abyss of fear that I had to escape from as soon as possible.\u00a0<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 As soon as it gets this dark, I start to see the room as you normally would in normal darkness. Doon, however, I see a purple swirl, when I do the room starts to shake and spinall around. Thats when I see him, or maybe it. He wears a suit, the type for weddings or funerals and stands at about 5&#39;11. he just stands in the middle of the room im in, staring at me. Once I see his face, he starts to slowly. and I mean slowly walk towards me. His face is contorted into a swirl, and there is no defining fetures other than that. The room still shakes, I can run away, but he will still come towards me, slowly, steadily. The only way I have found to get rid of him is by turning on a light. Once I do, I see the purple swirl again and the room slowly stops spinning. With that, he is gone for as long as I have the light on. I am fine as long as theres even the smallest smigeon of light, but as soons as theres none he is back. If the light has run out mutiple times he continues where he left off, or back in the center if its closer. the last time I saw him was about 5 years ago, during a black out. its also how I found out about the last detail I shared. I used an ipad for light and because i didnt touch the screen it would turn off every few seconds due to settings. I quickly learned to keep tapping it, even at random for light.

In Europe, fist studies using serological tests (to see a past infection) suggest that up up 10-15% of individuals in cluster have been infected. This means that up to 90-95% of cases are undiagnosed which would radically changes the odds you presented. Will some under 49 people die of COVID19? Absolutely !! Infect a sufficient large number of individuals and you will have some dead even with a minuscule risk. This is why COVID19 is a huge public health issue given the huge number of potentially infected individuals. The question at hand is what is the individual risk compared to other daily risk that we are exposed to. This is what will shape our perception. As a side note, with no vaccine before the end of 2021 and likely no miracle drug, the only way to protect the more at risk individuals in our society might be to constitute herd immunity i.e. infected everybody at low risk.
