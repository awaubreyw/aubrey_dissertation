CO2 does nothing, it is a conveyor of energy. It is not a source of energy. Back-radiation as shown in the Trenberth Cartoon Diagram is non-physical pseudo-science. The sun warms the earth which radiates the energy to space. This thermodynamic process is irreversible. <br>The atmosphere does indeed radiate, but is radiating the low energy exhaust the earth produced. The incoming energy has already been used. <br>Atmospheric radiation does not and cannot act as heat to the earth. It does not contain the frequencies and amplitudes required to re-heat the planet. You can&#39;t re-climb the Entropy ladder. Jesus! <br><br>The alarmists claim that additional CO2 warms the earth which evaporates more water which is a GHG that warms the earth and so on..... In fact, they claim that the water causes a 3x amplification (positive feedback) and as such is the real culprit. This is poppycock. Think about it. If water in the atmosphere produced a positive feedback, the earth would be a cinder long ago. <br>This theory is illogical, non-physical, pseudo-science. <br>Turns out, satellite data shows water produces a negative feedback, not positive. Sorry guys, but factual. <br>Water actually moderates the planet temperature which is why this planet, covered 70% by water, remains happily pleasant. <br>The alarmists would never openly say that they believe water to be the culprit. Imagine the leftists crying it&#39;s the water, it&#39;s the water. They would be laughed at. So they hide the notion. Manufacturers such as GM and Ford, spending billions on battery vehicles, will be bankrupt in 5 years.<br><br>1 high energy and 1 low energy input source cannot be added together to produce a temperature higher than the highest input source. The lower energy input is ignored as it does not possess the frequencies and amplitudes of the higher energy source.<br>The Trenberth cartoon attempts to recycle the Earths emission and adds it to the incoming high energy emission from the sun.<br> <br>To wit, heat 2 bars of iron to 150 degrees and 130 degrees respectively. Place a temp recorder near them. Initially, the recorder will read 150 degrees, not 280 as the Trenberth cartoon would indicate.The equilibrium temperature will be 140 degrees. That is the average, not the additive. This is because the 130 degree emission is wholly contained beneath the curve of the 150 degree bar. It lacks the energy to boost the 150 degree bar.<br><br>Same applies to Trenberth. Fluxes are, at best, averaged, not added. <br><br>Therefore, using the logic and arithmetic of the Greenhouse Gas Effect theory, we can boil water with two sources which individually and independently could not.<br>It would mean that two or more sources of radiation aimed at the same target would create a higher temperature than either of the sources could acting alone.<br>That\u2019s an easily testable property of heat and heat transfer. It is not a property of Climate or Atmosphere \u2013 it is a heat-transfer property.<br>Show us examples, in the moderate physical world, where fluxes can be added. You cannot even if you a PhD after your name.<br>Per the Second Law of Thermodynamics, Q(heat transferred), varies as T4hot-T4cold. The 2nd Law &quot;can be used to predict whether processes are forbidden, despite obeying the requirement of conservation of energy as expressed in the 1st Law\u201d.<br>&quot;The second law is concerned with the direction of natural processes. It asserts that a natural process runs only in one sense, and is not reversible. For example, when a path for conduction and radiation is made available, heat always flows spontaneously from a hotter to a colder body\u201d. Not the cold atmosphere to the hot Earth.<br><br>Therefore the GHG \u201ctheory\u201d, which relies on two sources (solar radiation and GHG radiation) to be summed,  cannot be true.<br>The Earth\u2019s surface reaches the temperature achieved by either Solar or GHE acting alone \u2013 they cannot be added together.", "comment_date": "2022-06-23T03:25:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Omega Z", "comment_text": "A 1000 years ago, the artic was ice free much of the year. <br>Also, if all the sea ice melted, it would just be negligible.

We have entered the Eddy Grand Solar Minimum. The planet is now going to get colder. Along with getting colder the earth is going to see major changes in local climates with regard to the amount of precipitation, drought and flood. What if all the ice melted? That is a stupid question since the ice in Antarctic has been there for 12 million years and it has been much warmer than now during this inter-glacial period.  The planet is at a point where we should begin to see sea levels drop. The last 100 years the average rise of sea level was 3 mm/yr. That&#39;s an 1/8 of an inch/year. Nye is an alarmist and you can bet someone is paying him to scare you. Who? I don&#39;t know. I would like to scare you too but I&#39;ll do it for free.  Here is my scary story which is a prediction based on data and real scientists. The sun has solar cycles. Solar cycle is the description of solar activity over a period of time. One of them you may be aware of is the 11 year cycle. We&#39;ve been assigning numbers to the 11 year cycle and we are now presently ending solar cycle #24. They actually vary in length a couple of years. In addition to the 11 year cycles there other cycles of longer duration and sometimes they work together to control the sun&#39;s activity. John Casey identified a 206 year cycle and other have found 400, 1000, etc. Another type of cycle is the cosmic ray cycles which are dependent on three variables which filter out cosmic rays or they don&#39;t filter them. If you were to look at a chart of cosmic ray intensity you would see that right now we have gone off the top of the chart for the first since keeping tract of them. Cosmic rays affect climate, health and are also seem to have an affect on volcanic activity. Galileo was the first to keep data for sun spot activity so we have several hundred years of count sun spots. Interestingly are cool spot generally about a 1000 degrees C below the normal surface of the sun but they in turn are in the vicinity of solar flares that are millions of degrees hotter. A solar cycle is just that and they have a distorted sinusoidal shape and vary a little in frequency but also vary in amplitude based on the number of sun spots. Going back in history and comparing the number of sun spots with earth&#39;s temperature it becomes obvious that the earths temperature is in direct correlation with sun spot frequency. Going back to the Maunder Minimum you would observe that the quantity of sun spot diminished considerably and the period was called the little ice age. The same thing happens during the Dalton Minimum which was occurring late 1700&#39;s and early 1800&#39;s and during this time the north east and china and western and eastern Europe experienced the year without summer when every month had frost and ice formed on ponds in July. People died of famine. 1 billion people lived at that time but today we have almost 8 billion. When the sun is less active it&#39;s magnetic field collapses and one of the things the magnetic field does is it filters cosmic rays.  Three things that will determine the severity of the Eddy Grand Solar Minimum is Solar activity, the rate of cosmic ray bombardment and volcanic activity. That means that we don&#39;t know for certainty how extreme this cold era is or how long it will last. I believe this  will be the most horrific event since Toba, but if you look at just the number of deaths this will be the worst. The people in the near future will witness crop failure after crop failure and since no countries really made an attempt at minimizing the suffering it will be world wide. You won&#39;t have to wait till 2100, you&#39;ll just need to be around in ten years.

Some under as much as 700 feet of water, so oceans have risen at least that much. What will happen if the ice melts, we will have another ice age, it is always going to be colder at the poles than at the equator. As Bill points out, ice is fresh water, salt in the ocean water keeps it from freezing. As ice melts fresh water mixes with salt water lowering the level of salt in the sea water and raising the freezing point. Once a threshold is reached, a super sheet of ice is the result covering a huge area and super cooling the air, then we have a global cooling period.

THIS IS STRESSFUL BECAUSE I LIVE IN A BIG CITY (Jakarta) and they mentioned it in the video. As you know (or not) we have billions of homeless people though it is the most modern City across Indonesia. Because of more working people slowly migrating to Jakarta, they now have a bigger income which makes them rich. Rich people would mean they could now afford animal products like meat such as red meat or beef, chicken. Some of the poor people don&#39;t just eat locally farmed vegetables but they eat trash from the wells. It&#39;s so depressing to see one of the most modern city in all of Indonesia to see homeless people. Because they are eating and purchasing meat, that means that the sellers has to work extra hard at their job of well slaughtering animals and by that they get a really good income because of that and that equals to more gas emissions released into the air. If people worked as farmers, they would only farm locally produced produce so that means they won&#39;t get as much money as the butchers do. After they thought, I think I&#39;ll become a butcher because I&#39;ll be more successful than being a farmer so that&#39;s why the weather is changing because of the gas emissions. Everyday, after I come home from school the roads are so crowded because of cars to pick up the students so when I come into my car i feel genuinely scared because seeing that much cars terrifies me, even under the freaking hot weather (well yeah duh). Since more technology is produced, we are now using more electricity which is also the main cause to climate change (it proves because of all those VRChat, playing games and other stuff). God created a world for us to live in and we just recklessly roam around this world without caring of animals and caring about the earth that we live in. If we were the cause of global warming, climate change, pollution, world hunger, extinction then why aren&#39;t we responsible for our mistake?<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23savetheworld\">#savetheworld</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23spreadawareness\">#spreadawareness</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ourfault\">#ourfault</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wearethesolution\">#wearethesolution</a>", "comment_date": "2018-03-11T06:53:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adolfo Herrera", "comment_text": "Can we create a giant white carpet to cover parts of the ocean to help reflect light?

Has anyone possibility thought of the real solution being population control? I know it is an old saying that humans are meant to &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot;, but that was, like many social beliefs, based off what I remember from religion class. I believe the movement towards scrutinizing animal agriculture should be as equal as the possibility of controlling the amount of children a person can conceive. Of course this idea is completely undeveloped, but I do think overpopulation has a direct link with exhausting resources; this leading to methods to find or take/ steal or create more to satisfy the overpopulating world. Most of these methods being detrimental to the environment. I don&#39;t know, I just think there should just be more thought into limiting (I&#39;m not saying eliminating) procreating, as its the next generations that&#39;ll be affected in the end.

Pens and papers or laptops etc ready? Good then we&#39;ll begin. Please save your questions til after the lesson has ended. <br>  <br> Climate change is a hoax peddled by \u2018gravy train scientists\u2019. Take a list of figures remove the lowest reading and \u2018voila\u2019, global warming. <br>This hoax has been running and gaining traction for 40 odd years and as scientists retire and come off their reliance on grants they are now finally admitting it\u2019s a sham.  Regarding Merkels \u2018The Climate action plan 2050\u2019 fossil fuels will start to run out by then anyway providing an automatic correction to matters. Oil in 30 yrs (2050) then Gas and then coal. <br>For those people who want to worry with the depletion of Oil goes the way of life for developed nations, from globalisation to intensive agriculture and for the USA projection of power. Unless you can run container ships, tractors, combined harvesters, aircraft carriers, Boeings etc on batteries. A little bit more difficult to do than run vacuum cleaners.<br><br><br>In 2009 there was the Climategate scandal when emails from the University of East Anglia climatic research unit confirmed Dr James Hansen (a former NASA climatologist), Philip Jones, Michael Mann et al were involved in fabricating evidence of climate change. More emails followed in 2011. Meanwhile NASA had been busy fabricating data throughout 2007-2014. All this involved massaging figures, altering data sets and so on. A tweak here, a tweak there and voila you have a hockey stick. <br>In 2013 UN IPCC scientists reported a \u2018pause\u2019 or \u2018slowdown\u2019 in global warming in the period since 1998. In 2015 back came Thomas Karl who was director of the NCEI part of NOAA and we get the \u2018pause buster\u2019 report just in time for the UN climate conference in Paris claiming the pause/slowdown in global warming never existed and world temperatures had been rising faster than scientists expected. On the 22 April 2016 175 countries signed up to the agreement. at a cost of $1 trillion a year. Job done. Didn&#39;t any of these clowns check the facts first? <br><br><a href=\"http://www.dailywire.com/news/9767/9-things-you-need-know-about-climate-change-hoax-aaron-bandler#\">http://www.dailywire.com/news/9767/9-things-you-need-know-about-climate-change-hoax-aaron-bandler#</a> <br><br>Dr John J Bates erstwhile colleague of the above at NCEI had a lot to say about all this earlier this year. Data sets were seriously flawed and were never approved or verified. Software was afflicted with devastating bugs giving different readings every time the same data was run; unreliable methods were used. None of the data on which the paper was based was properly archived, so no chance of the results ever being verified Oh yes and the computer used to process the software has suffered a complete failure. Whatever that means. Also when needed large adjustments to the raw data and substantial changes in successive datasets versions were made or the data was just plain ignored. I mean why not? <br><br><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4192182/World-leaders-duped-manipulated-global-warming-data.html\">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4192182/World-leaders-duped-manipulated-global-warming-data.html</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/noaas-pausebuster-study/\">http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/noaas-pausebuster-study/</a> <br><br>Is it any wonder that Professor Judith Curry called it a day earlier this year? <br><a href=\"https://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/25103-professor-resigns-due-to-craziness-over-climate-science\">https://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/25103-professor-resigns-due-to-craziness-over-climate-science</a> <br><br>It must be sickening to find the field you have devoted your life to has become a bloody joke but didn\u2019t any of these scientists test the data they were using or did they just accept it and peddle this pseudoscience in labs and classrooms in exchange for the almighty dollar, for a grant, for their salary? <br>So sorry to all you climate change guys your ship has sailed and reality has just checked in. To you tree huggers I&#39;m also sorry because I&#39;m on your side but seriously all the spare change from the environmentalists is going to Al and in the meanwhile this planet is being turned into a mono culture. And no I&#39;m not a great fan of Donald, I think he should chill out a bit more and be a bit more moderate in what he does and his comments. But give me Trump over the Clinton/Bush cartel. <br>Peace love and happiness Mike <br>ps The above is a fraction of what I can off load to trash Gore. But I appreciate most people like Donald prefer things to be said in 140 characters or less and I think I&#39;ve run out in that respect.<br><br>AND BREATH. Incidentally there is a reason why this &#39;climate change&#39; &#39;global warming&#39; has been given traction and I&#39;m happy to give the details on that in full if I&#39;m asked nicely. It&#39;s to do with Oil depletion and it&#39;s very serious consequences. And if you want something to keep you awake at night then happy to tell you all about it :). Oh yes the scary thing is you can&#39;t do anything about it and that is the &#39;inconvenient truth&#39;. Yep five hundred miles an hour into a brick wall and you guys can&#39;t see the obvious coming and that&#39;s the way the Governments want it hence this global warming distraction. <br><br>For those who have read this far, congratulations.", "comment_date": "2017-12-13T12:38:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luce Gibbs", "comment_text": "and here I thought this channel couldn&#39;t have gotten better but here we are.

Heat is water destroyer, not water multiplier.<br>thank you Bill Nye, for asking.<br>By the way your question is equivalent to the question |what if all the stars fall on earth? right?thanks.", "comment_date": "2017-11-08T15:01:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hunter Gawron", "comment_text": "Bill Nye he is here he is back from elementry school", "comment_date": "2017-11-08T01:31:09Z", "likes_count": 34}, {"comment_by": "DrFive", "comment_text": "people should think more before doing something!!!", "comment_date": "2017-11-07T14:39:25Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "not jei", "comment_text": "Bill nye the science guy, BILL BILL BILL BILL-okay, I&#39;ll stop now.", "comment_date": "2017-11-07T03:06:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "a", "comment_text": "due to climate change???COUGH COUGH <b>GLOBAL WARMING</b>", "comment_date": "2017-11-07T02:37:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Farteater", "comment_text": "I didn\u2019t know so much would happen, I just thought it would flood", "comment_date": "2017-11-06T21:47:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cisneros", "comment_text": "First off, glaciers don&#39;t melt primarily from the top down as a result of the sun&#39;s radiant heat. It melts from the bottom, up due to geothermal heat. As the top layers go thru the stages of minor melting and refreezing, its become air tight and able to trap more and more geothermal heat. As the ice melts, it falls away from the cooler glacier, creating a tiny stream that travels downhill towards the ocean. As it travels, that warmer water melts more and more glacier ice. By the time it reaches the lower levels, it has become a massive river. It&#39;s the snowball effect... Only in reverse. Water, cutting away at the base of a glacier through thermal erosion is cause of huge iceberges breaking away from the glacier. It&#39;s the ice melted from top, you&#39;d have little - no break away iceberges.

Hi! I&#39;m a child of the 80&#39;s; I grew up on Captain Planet, your rockin&#39; early morning, mind-expanding children&#39;s shows (along with Beekman&#39;s World, if anyone remembers it), reduce-resuse-recycle PSA&#39;s, classic rock and some of the stuff those generation x-ers were listening to - you know, the kind of music that commented on social inequality but still motivated you to get your &quot;arse&quot; moving, make a difference in the world &amp; be proud to be an American all at the same time? Remember those times? Oooo, and schezwan sauce, can&#39;t forget sweet and tangy and oh-so-good schezwan sauce... (As an aside... F* U McDonalds, I know you have the recipe and could re-release it at anytime - BTW, how&#39;s that Rick&amp;Morty licensing deal coming???  Gotta stay Hip for the twitter kids and not fall behind Wendy&#39;s &quot;sas&quot; campaign, eh?)  As someone who has gained Mensa level recognition (151 out of 155 WAIS 3 in the his-ouse woot-woot!!!), all internet-speak joking aside...  I commend your diligence in providing scientific truth to the masses, but I regret to inform you that your words of wisdom are falling on deaf ears from both the right (who view your facts as heresy to all that is holy, in their narrow-minded abrahamic-dominated worldview), and the left (who view your worldview as overbearing white patriarchal dominance as a result of militant third-wave feminism and yellow-bellied spineless metro-sexuality).  Instead, as a student of anthropology and history, I suggest the following: Natural [Social] Selection.  I know, it&#39;s hard to fathom for our modern compassionate, empatheticly(sp?)-trained minds, but the truth remains - we must weed out all the negative aspects of our modern society if we are to progress in any way towards a more stable future (whether it&#39;s better or not I leave in the hands of social novelists akin to Upton Sinclair, Anne Rand, and George Orwell for future review, as &quot;better&quot; is a subjective word...).  Instead of educating the masses, become a bastion of truth that can serve humanity once the dust has settled from the inevitable conflict that is to come (I&#39;m looking at you political theorists who just witnessed trumps &quot;visit&quot; to the middle-east).  I&#39;d hate to say it (being Atheistic and scientifically Agnostic to boot) but we must become the force that the rest of the world has &quot;belief&quot; in for when things seem darkest.  Science must become religion, only then may we be free from the shackles of primitive religions that restrict our truth-seeking minds.  But beware dogma without temperance of opposing thought.  I&#39;d hate to admit is, but as a truth seeking Atheist, I seem to get along with Pagans more than monotheists when it comes to environmental issues and protecting and respecting our planet&#39;s resources...  Food for thought indeed... And now I must end, for my musings at this point must seem like the errant ramblings of a madman, or worse, a fool...  But no matter, for regardless of what others think, exempt from the public haunt, I will find tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in Stones and Good in Everything.  I would not change it...

Instead of building sea walls, build massive pumping stations powered by wave energy to bring water inland to deserts (Sahara, North Africa to begin with), desalinization plants powered by solar energy, and there allow for deserts to become gardens (Psalm 107:35). I must be wrong somewhere in this scheme as it hasn\u2019t happened or even been mentioned yet. If rising sea levels is even a possible issue, international cooperation should invest in a solution, much like Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal era. <br>My question is would the Sahara desert be a suitable location, or rather the coast of North Africa, for building wave, solar, and wind energy stations capable of powering desalinization plants and water pumping stations and inland conduits?<br>Other areas might be Australia with a large inland desert.<br>Possible problems might include damaging local maritime habitat.<br>Any suggestions or possible political action?", "comment_date": "2017-05-04T03:41:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C G", "comment_text": "the melting is low through those months to june 2016 but what about july aug, sept<br>... those were normal if you do alittle unbiased reasearch. dont get mad at me just do it if you dont believe me.", "comment_date": "2017-05-04T01:42:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dum & ded", "comment_text": "Oml I love Bill lmao", "comment_date": "2017-05-03T21:37:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darren Pellichino", "comment_text": "I think there needs to be a follow up video.

So basicly austerity seems like a solution for many things until we figure out how to get stuff without damaging our habitat or our fellow humans and therefore our own families in the long run. But go and buy products wich already achieved that. At some point, when enough people do this, companies will either change or chease to exist.<br>2) Reparing the atmosphere: bury a few million tons of carbon into the earth or get rid of it elsewhere. We could simple put as much carbon back into the earth as we took out, quiete a bit. And/Or we can make use of it, but without burning it back into the atmosphere. Architects should work on this one i guess... In the netherlands they are quiety creative with what they can build out of molten plastic instead out burning it. If you have the change to decide on such stuff: try to find profitable ways to make use out of carbon based raw materials like wood and waste. If you have political power (and basicly everyone has, even outside of democracy), support those actions whereever you can.<br>We could simply clean the atmosphere by growing fast-growing plants that give much carbon per year, preferibly without using too much rare minerals, bury them, regrow them, ...<br>But by continioung to pump oil and dig for coal this seems a little bit absurd for now. It will be harder to get the carbon back in i guess.<br><br>Speaking about: support and use non-exhaustable energy-sources like solar etc (non-exhausable, because re-newsable is quiete bs. Nothing gets renewed by us...) instead of exhaustable ones like coal, oil or nuclear (yeah, even this is finite). This will bring us faster into a good future and free us all from dependence of the suppliers.<br>Speaking of wich: if you are one or working of one, better change the company instead of seeing it slowly dying. Invest into companies that do the thing, or start your own. Someone has to produce, install and maintain all the stuff, and has to get paid for it...<br><br>Even the people that ingore climate change can&#39;t ignore the fact that all exhaustable energy sources will slowly stop to bring us power, in becomming more expensive over time. So better get a head-start when it comes to non-exhaustable energy sources while the market isn&#39;t even fully awake.<br><br>Heck, i go into this buisness myself.

Antarctica holds 90% of the worlds total ice. Now if Antarctica melted, assuming the entire continent is made solely of ice... Which it&#39;s not, but lets just say it is. It would cause the sea levels to rise only approximately 45.5 feet. Do the research, do the math. If Antarctica is nothing but a 5.4 million square mile ice cube, which has an average elevation of 9300 feet were to melt, Ice is about 8.6% larger than water so we need to account for that. In terms of gallons it would be 1/568,415 of the total water in the ocean now at an average depth of 12,100 feet, I come up with slightly less than 47... But figuring the area the giant ice cube takes up which is about 1/26th of the ocean&#39;s square mileage and it vanished, I figure we should drop it by about a foot and a half just for good measure. So in reality, assuming only half of its ice and the rest is rock... We are looking at no more than 23 feet...

It&#39;s always been changing, yes there are man-made changes occurring, but the earth has been flipping between warm periods and cold periods naturally for millions and millions of years. The Roman period was even warmer than it is today! And there were several epochs before civilizations began that were much much warmer or\u00a0much much colder. <br><br> Also, Europe does an insane amount of farming in green-houses already because they need year-round food\u00a0production. Also, a wetter-warmer earth could make the Saharah\u00a0green again, so perhaps food production would move south, and if refuges can cross the Med with no problems, I don&#39;t think food shipments would have any problem crossing it either. <br><br>Humans would have to adapt to an ice-age, if one were coming, human&#39;s will have to adapt to a warm period if that is coming. We are much better adapting ourselves, and our own climates and micro-climtes for our needs, than trying to control the weather on a global scale. Plus, to melt all the earth&#39;s ice would take a sustained 6 or 7 + degree anomaly in the world&#39;s tempature and goverments are hoping to curb the tempature anomaly to 2 to 3 plus degrees. (C) So, it would take centuries of warming for it to become that warm, by then people could have built cities under water, or under-ground to benefit from passive cooling, just as the ants do, and people could have transformed their urban homes into floating citices Just as Veince Itally did long ago. And they could have colonized earth orbit, and both the moon and mars by then as well. Depending on the political and economic situation, the future could be even more densely populated than now, and rural areas could be mostly unpopulated. Or we might have a really big war, and than the opposite would be true, rural areas would have surivors, and the mega-cities might be left mostly in ruins. <br><br>Anyway, if scientists and engineers are worried about this, they have to be the ones providing the solutions, and they have to provide solutions that corrupt politicians can&#39;t abuse (for instance, they easily could abuse the Carbon Cap and Trade Scheme.)", "comment_date": "2016-09-12T03:06:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YikesCami", "comment_text": "But they said you were dead\ud83d\ude2b\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2016-09-12T03:02:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WXW Entertainment", "comment_text": "So we should kill the vapers?", "comment_date": "2016-09-12T03:00:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mustafa Ali", "comment_text": "Bill nye your moms a guy", "comment_date": "2016-09-12T02:59:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Name", "comment_text": "BILL NEY THE SICNECE GUY", "comment_date": "2016-09-12T02:59:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KaraokeWithBeaux", "comment_text": "How long have polar bears existed?

Statistically thats a very very small sample size to draw any conclusions from, especially when pin pointing to a 3 month period within that 37 year window. Was there growth at any point before or within those 37 years? Most reference points for example when talking about CO2 in PPM are discussed over an 800,000 year scale. NASA has been observing ice for 0.00005% of that 800,000 year benchmark used for atmospheric CO2, further discussing a 3 months slice of that is extremely vague. <br><br>2) There have been many times in Earths history where there was no Arctic ice caps for example 65 million years ago. Back then Mean global temperatures were 6-10 degrees Celsius warmer than today, CO2 in the atmosphere was also around 3000-4000 PPM as opposed to ~380PPM today...<br><br>3) Whats with the IF of the antarctic melting? IF the planet drifts 40 million miles towards the sun it&#39;ll be a bad day for all of us, but thats irrelevant because its not going to happen... So why the fear mongering of &quot;IF the Antarctic melts; this will happen...&quot; The average temperature of Antarctica is -57 degrees Celsius (-71 degrees F), for it to melt you need to be above 0 C, thats a 58 degree C temperature change that has to be sustained for centuries if not a millennium to melt all that ice. If man is still around, it will have relocated within that time, its not going to happen overnight. Lets be realistic. <br><br>So people living by the coast; you&#39;ll be fine. <br><br>3) For all those that are going to start yelling about the Antarctic, this is why you should be skeptical of this video, and Bill Nye: <br><br><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-new-record-maximum\">http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-new-record-maximum</a><br><br><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-study-mass-gains-of-antarctic-ice-sheet-greater-than-losses\">http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-study-mass-gains-of-antarctic-ice-sheet-greater-than-losses</a><br><br>Conveniently leaves out inconvenient facts that will discredit him. Keep in mind &quot;The Science Guy&quot; is actually a mechanical engineer. He gets paid 10&#39;s of thousands of dollars at a time to advocate man-made global warming... I know, I know! He needs to earn a living, but for years he was skeptical of GMO&#39;s and Monsanto right up until 2013 when advocating for labelling foods, discussing how Monsanto causes an imbalance in the ecosystem... and then in 2015 he met with a representative of Monsanto, and, magically, he became a believer! <br><br>&quot;Compared to all the other herbicides, glyphosate&#39;s pretty benign, which I&#39;ve done research on and I&#39;ve decided that&#39;s true.

Global warming will lead to less climate related deaths, larger crop yields, lower energy costs, and many other benefits. <br><br>Government agencies aren&#39;t objective sources of information on this topic; they have far too much to gain personally from the global warming claim being true. Again, you&#39;re breaking the most basic principles of science in that you should never trust a biased source. If it&#39;s not appropriate to quote oil companies on the positive effects of global warming, why should it be appropriate to quote government agencies on the negative effects of global warming? Both have a conflict of interest.

Re: South Pole: much of that ice is in fact on land, however, there is no calculable figures that suggest the coastal flood scenario will happen.  While it&#39;s possible; the known changes in coastal water levels have much more to do with tectonic movement then it does melting waterways. While the popular analysis on climate change has people in a panic over &#39;global warming&#39; - the fact is that there is slightly more data suggesting global cooling.  While all data DOES show climate change is occurring, the theorized 10-30,000 year planetary season analysis shows that the earth SHOULD in fact continue to warm for a few more thousand years as part of it&#39;s normal cycle. Therefore it is erroneous to claim man&#39;s influence is the cause.  Furthermore; even if we ignore that data, and use only the global warming figures to calculate climate change, there are three major factors of which mankind&#39;s influence is actually the smallest contributor.  Geothermic conditions and cosmic conditions (especially solar) are far greater contributors to climate change then all of man&#39;s influence throughout human history.   So even if environmental legislation worked, AND the entirety of every nation on the planet strictly enforced such measures, it would still have negligible effect on reducing climate change. <br>  Perhaps the most disturbing data, is that which shows every legislation passed with the intent to save the environment thus far, has actually caused more damage to the environment. It&#39;s clear no one really knows HOW to reduce man&#39;s influence in any meaningful way to begin with, but as these facts show - even if we did, it changes nothing.<br>   We at A.P.I. DO agree that everyone should strive to be a good steward of the land we inhabit. However, before you spend all your money converting to so-called green energy, or chain yourself to a tree in logging country, you may want to take a look at the big picture.

Read about the &quot;Carboniferous&quot; time period, 358-298 million years ago. It went through its own climate change. It had its own warm and glacial periods. All before humans. We have nothing to do with climate change on the macro scale. Maybe on the micro scale, but the earth quickly recovers from that. The eruption of Mt. Tambora in 1815 created a year without a summer in 1816, having freezing temperatures in June and July in the northern hemisphere. This type of event has happened many times during human history and the earth has recovered. Its inhabitants suffered, but they too recovered.  Lets work on getting countries like China and India to get their pollution emissions under control. Remember when you had a smoking section and a non-smoking section in a restaurant?  Didn&#39;t do much good, did it? The smokers air just drifted over to the non-smoking area and polluted it. China and India are the smokers. You can&#39;t have a clean world unless everyone participates. Sorry, but we do need affordable oil if you want modern living. Wind mills, solar panels and their batteries, the copper cables to carry the generated power all need fossil fuels in the manufacturing and transportation to the location of their use. And once they are used, they are removed and transported to a location to be recycled. There is a balance to be found between green energy &amp; fossil fuels.", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:51:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dana Chen", "comment_text": "why can&#39;t bill nye be my science teacher", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:48:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean oo", "comment_text": "Bill nye kinda sounds like Rick. morty.", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:47:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elaine Hack", "comment_text": "I&#39;m only hear for Bill. \u2764", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:46:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I see good", "comment_text": "What if Bill Nye had had to work in a coal mine?", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:46:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stigmatogaster", "comment_text": "isn&#39;t there more polar bears than there has ever been before?", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:38:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Stamos", "comment_text": "&quot;All of Florida&quot;<br>Good.", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:36:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ImDaddyPig", "comment_text": "&quot;From Europe to Russia, right over the north pole&quot;... is everebody just gonna ignore that..", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:36:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cosmic247", "comment_text": "bill nye the science guy", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:34:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr lover", "comment_text": "a person who believe it isn&#39;t as bad as people are making out.", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:28:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrChuckyGaming21", "comment_text": "Global warming is natiurql and not a threat, stfu you globalist shitty channel", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:26:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darren Loyie", "comment_text": "hi", "comment_date": "2016-09-10T10:18:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Electrifyyy", "comment_text": "God I love Bill Nye.

And fact is: We don&#39;t know what is going on. Climate processes and their effects are very complex. Nevertheless, human life will allways be connected to the water. Ancient cities were flooded, modern will too. Humans will rebuilt cities in other locations, again at the coast. We will adapt, like nature does. Icebears and penguins are adaptations for the ice age. In fact: Most time on earths history the poles were not frozen. What are humans thinking in stopping this process?

While there is some good information, the perspective is out of kilter. How?<br><br>First of all, rising sea levels creates an inconvenience, while expensive, is at least doable. Global Cooling in our current Ice Age could trigger the catastrophic end to the Holocene interglacial which could result in a drop of -12C worldwide. This could kill 99% of the people and a large percent of the land species. This because of what happens during a glacial period of the current Ice Age:<br>1) Once again, permanent ice could cover all of Canada, a third of USA, and a third of Europe.<br>2) The cold climate would displace hundreds of millions of people.<br>3) Ports would eventually have to be moved, because sea levels would fall.<br>4) Global Cooling creates more droughts, deserts and dust, just as it did last glacial period.<br>5) Global Cooling creates more and stronger storms, because wind is created by thermal potential. When polar cold gets closer to equatorial heat, you get more power for building storms, like the Little Ice Age storms (1588, sinking of the Spanish Armada; and the Great Storm of 1703).<br>6) Global Cooling forces oceans to absorb more CO2, making them less alkaline.<br><br>Climate change has been a &quot;constant&quot; for 4.5 Billion years. Get over it! Some changes are disruptive and uncomfortable (Global Warming), and some are downright deadly (Global Cooling in an ongoing Ice Age).<br><br>Global Warming made civilization possible 12,000 years ago. If you understand why, then you&#39;re very close to understanding why the Warming Alarmists, like Bill Nye, are full of half-truths on the topic of climate.<br><br>Global Warming is good. Cold kills; warmth promotes life. And if you think something is going to burst into flames because palm trees start growing in Greenland, you don&#39;t know climate science at all. Earth has a wonderful temperature regulator called water. Because of our oceans, temperatures have not changed more than 5% over the last few billion years. But Ice Ages are the most deadly periods.

His claims seem alarmist and non-science. Climate change is a fact of Earth&#39;s history. Did you ever wonder why Greenland(now covered by ice and snow) is so named? A few centuries ago it was green and residents there farmed acres of it and cattle grazed there. Then, the climate changed for the colder. As to sea plants giving us CO2, most of ours comes from trees and other green plants on land. Finally, CO2 causes greater vegetation growth...more and better food crops, etc. That&#39;s why commercial greenhouses deliberately enhance their internal environments with it. If you&#39;re concerned with famine and want to provide more food production on Earth, you should NOT want a reduction in our atmosphere&#39;s CO2 content.

What if all this fearmongering over the last 50 years was pure nonsense? What if someone stood up and told people to use their own eyes to see NO coastal cities are under water, the beaches are fine, we have more food and oil and lumber than ever, there are not mass extinctions, we aren&#39;t living in domed cities, we don&#39;t all wear jumpsuits, we didn&#39;t have the global ice age the scientists predicted would happen by now, the hurricane season got less intense - not worse, and EVERY SINGLE PREDICTION by the climate change crowd has been WRONG. <br>Tell us, what EXACTLY is the temperature supposed to be? Should the climate EVER change? Have one or both polar ice caps ever melted to any extent in the planet&#39;s history? Is it not true that the Antarctic ice cap is growing, not shrinking?  Has the climate EVER changed in the last ten thousand years? How can you make a reasonable temperature prediction one hundred years in the future for an entire planet? <br>And the biggest question of all - why are those leading the call for climate change rules and regulations (Yes, you ONE PERCENTERS like Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio), always concerned with making the 99% pay more and live under increased regulations - and tighter/more constrained eco-friendly lifestyles while they live like gods on private jets, superyachts, ten thousand square foot mansions, multiple cars, and wild parties in exotic locations? <br>There is too much of a rush to make us all live in smaller houses, drive smaller cars, eat less, travel less, not have too many children, not travel too far to our jobs, and pay all kinds of taxes, fees, and fines for &#39;climate change&#39; which can be defined as any time it&#39;s too hot/cold/wet/dry. And the worst part of all is the new climate change groupthink mentality where anyone who disagrees must be shut down, silenced, ostracized, or arrested. <br>Folks, I&#39;m all for a safe, clean, healthy planet. Let&#39;s put our resources to better use by cleaning up pollution (a noble cause that was kicked to the curb by the climate change crowd) and planting more trees. <br>Finally, rather than simply complain, I offer some solutions with the most important part to remember that they should be VOLUNTARY, not forced by some &#39;authority&#39;.

They would still make money and have the same employment but the fact is they would loose control over there market and wouldn&#39;t be free to do whatever they wanted, this is better for everyone except the fat businessman at the top so it wont happen for a while. <br><br>another thing is if the people decided to take this into there own hand&#39;s not by rebellion but as the human rights act of the people, we could force this change much quicker the problem is just like with any major problem no offence but genuinely the vast majority of any population are poor, stupid, ignorant and gullible and are completely brainwashed by anything in a newspaper or on the internet which is why this never happens, people actually think they can&#39;t do anything but anyway that&#39;s the reason.", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T14:35:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Francis", "comment_text": "A lot more places on earth such as northern Canada and Russia would be habitable.", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T14:33:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aj Ravalo", "comment_text": "i remember those days where the comments are still related to the video", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T14:33:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dhujdic", "comment_text": "Yeah guys, lets join the movement and stand up for the arctic by talking about how melting water will affect us instead of spending that effort and trying to create solutions..", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T14:32:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ObscureWatchCollector", "comment_text": "Bills bow tie is on point", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T14:31:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ObscureWatchCollector", "comment_text": "Bills bow tie is on point \ud83d\udc4c", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T14:31:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Skelecat", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t wait for Bill Nye&#39;s show on Netflix", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T14:30:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hamzoloo", "comment_text": "life is crazy", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T14:30:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "emeraldwarrior", "comment_text": "So Atlanta becomes the new Atlantis Hmmmm interesting...?", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T14:30:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Burntburgers", "comment_text": "Spare me your propaganda bullshit you&#39;re a traitor", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T14:30:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Billy Batson", "comment_text": "Citizens of Atlantis will rejoice due to the demise of the surface dwellers.", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T14:25:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gonzo Town", "comment_text": "I&#39;m surprised they brought up the Europe getting cooler bit.

If he were, he would realize that for at least 20,000 years the world has been warming up. NYC was under about 4,000 feet of ice back then, and the Great Lakes region may have been under 5,000 feet of the cold, hard stuff. Long Island and Cape Cod are the results of those long gone glaciers due to the moraines they created. The real cause of this increase in temperature is the sun. Sun spots increased, more solar radiation has been arriving and temperatures go up. Unfortunately for all the alarmists like dear ol&#39; Bill, who believe they should control your life, they know there is nothing they can do about the sun. So they find\u00a0a &quot;plausible-impossible&quot; scenario that\u00a0too many people actually think can happen. Like Wylie Coyote running off a cliff and not falling until he realizes he is running on air. While man-made warming seems plausible, it is not the reason the earth has been warming for the last 20,000 years or so. But you can&#39;t make a living off of that, so develop a scary scenario, and rake in $ MIllions. Al Gore would be a drunken bum living under a bridge without it. BTW, in a somewhat related note, the entire world was about 2 degrees warmer about 2,000 years ago. Crops could be grown hundreds of miles further north, and 2 growing seasons allowed civilizations to flourish. Places like China had some of their most prosperous periods during that time. Warming is not the problem. But if that sun ever reduces the sun spots (and it will), there will be massive crop failures, and the famines you hear about in olden times will return. It&#39;s just that the sun operates on a cycle that is a lot longer than the 365 day cycles we are use to.", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T12:40:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dumb Carpenter", "comment_text": "no comment on ocean currents. thermohaline.", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T12:39:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VanDerBeek", "comment_text": "BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILLL BILL", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T12:39:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "luke scorgie", "comment_text": "I&#39;m an Australian, I&#39;m looking forward to our new &#39;sea&#39;.

On first hear that might sound plausible, but on closer inspection seems filled with bs. Everything on earth reflects light. Every single thing on earth. Some of what he says is true, as darker things tend to be less reflective. But there is not a single thing on earth that absorbs sunlight in totality or else it would be invisible. In fact if you take a second to go to the nearest puddle of water and look into it you will curiously see what may be called by some a &quot;reflection&quot;. Why does this water not work the way Bill Nye says it is supposed to? If you take a gander at the way your eye works, the reflection of light by objects is key to you being able to see. Most of the people in the world are highly dependent on this reflection to be able to go about their daily life. It is called seeing. <br><br>How many people think Bill Nye, the &quot;Science Guy&quot;, actually scientifically tested and measured the photons bouncing off of ice to see if they do in fact direct back into orbit? When you spray your car with water (actually very similar to light when you get into quantum mechanics) how many of those water droplets go straight up into the sky? Do you feel you have been told the truth? Or do you feel like you are being sold some beach front property in Colorado? The answer to that question in itself could be a scientific experiment conducted socially through this medium. It would be more scientific than the bs he just let come out of his mouth. This guy is a mouth piece for people who are under the impression that you are very stupid. You have the tools available to prove them wrong. Never has the amount of information been at the hands of common everyday people as you possess right now at the click of a mouse. Do with it what you will. In saying this my hope is obviously changing the world in a better way. Or you can be like this dupe. Guess the choice is yours. <br><br>In the old days only special people could read or write. The common everyday folk had to depend on the people who could to tell them what was what. Science does not belong to Bill Nye anymore than the Bible to the Catholic Church back in the days.

We need oil. Everything we use on a daily basis uses oil in one for or another. From our fuel, to phones, health products, etc. Wind power does need oil to keep the bearings in the turbines lubricated, so they don&#39;t seize up and potentially catch fire. Yes we can create synthetics, but we need a mass scale amount. Plus a lot of this revolves around a lot of jobs. Drilling for oil and maintaining pump jacks and off shore drills, a lot of it is on the job training and only a little bit requires any bit of school, usually done in a technical college/trade school or community college. This would put a lot of people out of work. Welders, pipe fitters, maintenance workers in these places and refineries. Sure they could get jobs else where but the huge surplus of people out of work with years of experience would get priority on the new jobs, where people who went to school for it, would be out of luck until that group retires, which may take years.<br><br>All of this stuff would have a huge negative impact on the global economy and would skyrocket unemployment. Unemployment in the US is already high, don&#39;t let news outlets fool you. I&#39;ve been out of work for almost 2 years now and they would consider me to be working, even though I have not collected a paycheck in a long time. Unemployment is probably around 15% or more right now if you put people who&#39;ve been out of work for a year or more.", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T03:33:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SekSeaAzn", "comment_text": "&quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy flashbacks&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T03:33:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beam", "comment_text": "ft.

And pls read the whole thing before hating (this is pretty long, sorry). The whole global warming thing is complete bs. We are releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, but compared to amount released by volcanoes and such, it is insignificant. Plus, humans have already started to control emissions. Most of the studies that support global warming are severely skewed. I used to believe all of this, but then I took psychology. Our teacher talked about how most of the studies about global warming have false data (Veritasium made a great video about this, you guys should check it out). Scientists are just human, and if they have results that indicate that dark chocolate makes you lose weight (debunked, it doesn&#39;t), the study is more likely to be published. Many researchers than skew data to get published, because that is their source of income. They sometimes do get those results, but with either a small population or biased variables. And often times, these researchers will not replicate any of these studies because they know the results they got were due to random chance or other confounding variables. This trend with global warming is very similar. When studies say that 99.98% of scientists agree with global warming, they are lying. Let&#39;s say that 1% disagree, 87% think no affect is happening, and the rest agree. Well these &quot;studies&quot; group together all the 87% and 12% under supporting global warming, even though they weren&#39;t. I think last year, the Artic Ice caps actually froze twice as much as before (or something like that, you should Google it, don&#39;t take my word), setting records. The polar bear was used as publicity to support global warming. In fact, polar bears can swim up to 100 miles at a time, so they are in no danger of drowning due to melting ice caps.", "comment_date": "2016-09-07T23:24:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Worst", "comment_text": "I miss bill nye from those old elementary school vids", "comment_date": "2016-09-07T23:24:07Z", "likes_count": 2808}, {"comment_by": "zunkwind", "comment_text": "i like these &#39;What If&#39; videos.

I could tell you  the results here but as it&#39;s often  said  seeing  is believing.<br>   Land based ice is a different story all together. if most or all the glaciers, Antarctica and Greenland  ice covers were to melt it would truly be a  disaster.  The good news is that even The IPPCC&#39;s worst case prediction of 3\u00b0 C temperature  rise will not even get you  close to melting the Antarctic ice cover. The average anual temperature in Antarctica  is a balmy - 40\u00b0F. Ice melts at 32\u00b0F. That&#39;s  a roughly  70\u00b0 temperature  rise which would be  needed to start melting the land ice. In other words if it ever gets hot enough to melt all the land traped ice on Earth rising sea levels won&#39;t  matter  much to life on earth because there won&#39;t be any  life left on earth.

People <br>who live down here don&#39;t seem to notice the rising part.  Many homes <br>here were built so that high tide comes <br>within 1 ft of the top of their sea walls.  If the tide changes, they <br>notice.  When the storm just came through, the water swelled a bit.  <br>That we notice.  Hurricanes, tropical storms, and tsunamis are quick on <br>the mind.  Science says the ocean has risen 1/10 of an inch per year the<br> past 30 years.  The shell mounds on the islands built by the natives <br>are said to have taken 2000-3000 years to build.  There is one on West <br>Part Island, and a large one on nearby Cottage Key.  Cottage Key has <br>been built up about 30-40 ft above sea level by this shell mound.  Atop <br>the mound sit a couple of 500+ year old banyan trees.  All of this is a <br>sign that the ocean level around the islands is such that they have <br>always been shallow spaces with little rise above the ocean... at least <br>for the last 2500-3500 years.  So if the sea is rising now, I still <br>don&#39;t anticipate it covering an island that rises as much as 4 ft above <br>sea level.  A home would likely be built 15 ft above sea level on <br>risers, and have wooden walkways onto the island like the dock pictured.", "comment_date": "2016-09-07T18:17:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kalamari", "comment_text": "Oh my god...
