A change in dust, heat and humidity irritate the nasal tissue which cause drainage, drainage causes coughing, coughing and climate change irritates the throat. Put dust filters in your vents to help. Turn on a humidifier and use a barometer to keep humidity around 45-50. Use a space heater instead of central and layer your clothing.<br><br>3) When allergy season is in, cover your mouth and nose with a paper towel when walking from house to car and vice versa (especially if someone is cutting grass). If exposed to grass mold, dust, etc., do a sinus irrigation as soon as possible. Use anti-allergens on bed linens. Vacuum and dust regularly.<br><br>4) Keep hand sanitizer in your car and use it if you have to touch public doors, shopping carts, etc. Don\u2019t touch your face!

So that would be only important once I have caught the virus and I am healing. Understandably, that&#39;s why I lie blanketed in bed if I have caught the flu.<br>Viruses have a stronger envelope during the winter and so is simply more likely to spread. Wearing insulated clothes doesn&#39;t deny viruses floating in the air or outside the body to still have this durable armor!<br>In reference to the study on cold feet, 13/90 of those chilled reported cold symptoms 4-5 days after the chilling while a control group of 5/90 of those that weren&#39;t chilled reported cold symptoms. That seems to show an obvious difference and effect. However, all 18 who reported these delayed cold symptoms were reported to have had significantly more colds each year during their previous untouched lives than the 162 who did not report colds. Even the study refers to the knowledge of the common folklore of being chilled as a possible bias of REPORTING (subjectively) whether they later had cold symptoms. Perhaps a placebo effect had taken place because people simply BELIEVED and were conditioned since children that being chilled could get an individual a cold or flu. Test subjects self-diagnosed cold symptoms as nasal stuffiness, sneezing, throat irritation, and mild fever; I feel that these mild symptoms may have been exaggerated by the effect of hypochondria from conditioning bias. Something as minor as chilling of the feet (which is a body part without openings for viruses to enter the body) seems illogical to me for someone to get a cold from. I take cold showers every single day. Many of the best athletes take entire-body ice baths to heal their body.<br>Cortisol is produced anytime the body or mind&#39;s understanding is under stress and as an effect, suppresses the immune system. It has been shown to be produced during high temperatures, and during psychological stress perhaps due to a high workload. If one simply does not feel stressed by the cold, one simply does not have to wear heavy insulated clothing.<br>And these premises brings my argument&#39;s conclusion that, as I love the winter chill of Southern California, I do not have to wear a coat if I don&#39;t want to..

According to Immunologists, which I have read from Medical Journals, the cold (which is a virus) can only be acquired by being exposed to the virus. So that part of the video is correct. The part I don&#39;t agree with is that if you&#39;re body temperature is colder, you are more likely to get the virus. The Immunologists stated that the cold virus actually doesn&#39;t do anything as far as they could tell, the symptoms you get are from your Immune System reacting to a virus in the body, and creating an Immune response. So the stronger your Immune System, the stronger the symptoms. So if your Immune System gets weakened, your symptoms will be weakened.<br><br>To put it simply, if the cold virus gets into your body, you will have the cold until the body can create antibodies to the virus, and then get rid of it (Unless you have already had that particular strain of cold, which would then be destroyed before symptoms occur).
