After the conference they still had not made the teacher stop, and then my parents were about over this teacher so they made sure she would get fired by reporting this to the school board. Guess what..<br>THEY KEPT THE TEACHER?!?!<br><br>Apparently the board deemed she would stay because this was her last year anyway. <br>Lesson of the story: Sometimes your elders are wrong.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Also as of now I am right handed because of this and you might think I would be ambidextrous, but it made BOTH my hands super weak as my body doesn&#39;t know which one is better.

Was everything you ever did without purpose and never really mattered, or will you just stop existing after your heart beats for the last time? Think about this, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real, place of eternal bliss. Hell is real, place of eternal torment. You&#39;re gonna spend eternity in one of those places. God&#39;s will is, that nobody would perish. One day, every single one of us has to appear before the Judgement Seat of the Holy Righteous God, and to give an account, how we have lived our life. The only way to get to Heaven is if you are without sin, and every single one of us has sinned. That is why God in His love and mercy sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. He left Heaven\u2019s Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a holy perfect sinless life, was condemned unjustly to death while being innocent, was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf, for there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, but Christ, the spotless and unblemished Lamb of God, the Perfect Sacrifice once and for all, died for us, so we may be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God, after the fall in Paradise by satan&#39;s tempting, through the Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Calvary, in His everlasting love towards every single one of us.<br>\u00a0<br>If you truly repent and ask for forgiveness of your sins from Jesus Christ, and believe with all your heart, that Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, rose from the dead by God\u2019s power on the third day according to the Scriptures, and by faith receive Him as your Lord and Savior, through the Royal Blood of Jesus Christ you will be saved, and are born again of the Holy Spirit. Every sin that weighs you down, even the ones you never dare to speak of, will be forgiven. Repent, believe, follow Christ, and you will spend eternity in Heaven with our Holy King, where is no more death, sorrow, pain nor crying.<br>\u00a0<br>John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son (Jesus Christ), that whosoever believeth in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>\u00a0<br>John 14:6 - Jesus said unto him, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father (to Heaven) except through Me.\u201c<br>\u00a0<br>Book of Acts 4:12 - Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men (only Jesus Christ), whereby we must be saved.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 10:9-10 - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 10:13 - For whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD (Jesus Christ), shall be saved.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 8:1-2 - Therefore, there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus (born again of the Holy Spirit), who walk not after the flesh, but after the (Holy) Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.<br>\u00a0<br>1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.<br>\u00a0<br>Ephesians 2:8-9 - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>\u00a0<br>Isaiah 1:18 - Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br>\u00a0<br>John 10:10 \u2013 (Jesus said:) \u201cThe thief (satan) cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\u201c<br>\u00a0<br>1 Peter 5:8 - Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking, whom he may devour.<br>\u00a0<br>Ephesians 6:12 - For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>\u00a0<br>The LORD bless you and keep you; The LORD make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; The LORD lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.<br>\u00a0<br>In Jesus Christ Holy and Mighty Name.

Which eventually can hurt people. Like the orthodontic industry which pull teeth for aesthetic reasons. They get more space for the teeth to move which makes their job easier and easier to get that smile. They don\u2019t tell you anything about the possible dangerous consequences of pulling healthy premolars and then retracting the palate/jaw (which also is difficult to reverse if something wrong happens, than say just expanding the palate to correct the wrong bite (which is much easier to reverse)). The consequences can be, reduced tongue space, neck and jaw pain, sleep apnea, TMD, tinnitus, etc.) They simply deny that they can make the jaw/palate smaller which is utterly wrong. <br><br>If people have heard of falsification in science, it\u2019s about that we never can deny anomalies that occurs. <br><br>It is there to make sure to constantly evolve science because we can never know whether a hypothesis or theory is completely true, partially true or completely untrue. Only time will tell.<br><br>Falsification is today an important concept in the philosophy of science, especially in Karl Popper, who argues that there is a significant asymmetry between falsification and verification when it comes to general statements and natural laws. A complete verification of natural laws is impossible if they (simplified) have the logical structure &quot;All A has the property E&quot;.<br><br>On the other hand, it is in principle logically possible to falsify them: the statement &quot;All ravens are black&quot; is in principle falsified if we find a non-black raven, even though all the ravens we have seen so far are black, we can not know that it never  have been, or will emerge, ravens that are not black.<br><br>For Popper and his followers, it therefore becomes a methodological principle in all science to increase the degree of falsifiability. A law or generalization (theory, hypothesis) that resists attempts at falsification thereby increases its acceptability or credibility. The more effectively we search for falsification or falsification opportunities, the more effectively we also promote the growth of knowledge.<br><br>There are countless patterns in nature and many patterns that will agree with a hypothesis even if it is not necessarily true. Therefore, it also means that it is very easy to generate false positive data in scientific research whether it is conscious or unconscious. After all, it is people who conduct the research. Much of what I say here actually supports the &quot;correlation does not equal causation&quot; argument.  But the problem with that argument is that it can be used against its purpose by authoritarian people. There is a large amount of corruption most people do not know about.
