But, for me, the saddest part of it all is that he still has diehard (and closeted) supporters.  Through the use of polls and interviews, it\u2019s been proven that the vast majority of people who voted for and continue to support him do so knowing full well that his inflammatory, racist, hateful, ignorant decisions, tweets, comments, \u2018speeches\u2019 at rallies, interviews, and policies are rooted in racism, greed, hate, insecurity, vanity, and treason, but they don\u2019t care.  They are willing to jeopardize their receiving such benefits as affordable healthcare for themselves and their families rather than allow those who they deem unworthy of those same benefits.  We can no longer give Trump supporters the benefit of doubt that they do not know or understand how how hateful, damaging, and racist his politics are because it is now proven that the MAGA individuals support Trump because of his these very hateful, damaging, and racist politics.  It saddens me because I once believed that my fellow Americans were basically good people, and while most are, my eyes are now open to the very large number of people (Republicans, conservatives, and right-wingers) who are not.

Assuming the wall has a thickness of 0.1 m, and that it\u2019s 8m high, the volume of the wall would be <br>2,552,000 cubic meters. Considering the price and density of steel, 8050kg/m^3, and then steel costs $0.20-0.60. Assuming Trump wants a decent quality wall, $0.30/lb seems reasonable. That\u2019s about $0.66/kg.

Let&#39;s say that we allow such individuals to America. Due to the Mexican education system being incredibly lacking compared to the American one, many of such immigrating individuals can only work menial labor. That dosnt pay well. So you family is in need of money, you know how to deal narcos, and you know that narcos can greatly improve your lives. You are incredibly tempted to do narcos. And we all know what narcos on a mass scale does to a country. That&#39;s what happens when we allow illegal immigration. So why the wall? Because the wall is better then what border patrol can offer. Democrats and Republicans allowed fencing, with the belief that a barrier would better ward off immigrants. If fencing is useless shouldn&#39;t we follow both political beliefs and build a wall? (You might ask why Democrats say no to the wall. Because they want votes.) Technology only goes so far. Border patrol will also be safer doing their job behind a wall. So 5 billion to eliminate a good portion of narcos? Why not. We get less neighborhood violence.
