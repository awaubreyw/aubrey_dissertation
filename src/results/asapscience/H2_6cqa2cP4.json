The Judaeo-Christian Bible was written over millennium ; the further back in time you go, the less accurate it is. The New Testament therefore, being most recent, is most accurate. Events such as Noah\u2019s Ark ; Noah was probably a Carpentry Genius who figured out how to rapidly convert houses &amp; barns into a huge Floating Barge, thereby surviving a nasty, deadly flood. Wild animals too probably clambered on to this Barge\u2026 thereby the Legend of Noah\u2019s Ark.. Noah\u2019s Ark probably \u201csaved the world\u201d of ONE large river plain ; NOT the entire Earth ! Jonah, was probably rescued by a Dolphin cetacean NOT a Whale, And probably lived ON its back, not IN its mouth but FROM its mouth the Dolphin may have given Jonah , fish to eat at sea\u2026 EVERYTHING written in our Bible, is rooted in SOME Truth or other, albeit perhaps not literally exactly so\u2026 To understand, you really sometimes need to\u2026 THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX !!!", "comment_date": "2019-09-15T14:45:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wisest Of the the century", "comment_text": "&quot; we suddenly see animal life erupt&quot; we can see why atheist believe that nothing turns to something", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T00:35:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Young Earth Creation", "comment_text": "more woo woo psychology pushed as science.", "comment_date": "2019-08-20T01:07:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aridity", "comment_text": "god is a fictional character made by people too retarded to accept that we are related to banannas. guess what? we&#39;re also related to palm trees. and that one bug you stepped on. get over your obsessions and get with science.", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T04:22:07Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "loopter gaming!", "comment_text": "Wait humans evolved in hours???

I got him at Petsmart on sale. One night while I was sleeping, Gioff climbed into my head and started randomly singing STYX songs. Once I was done screaming like a little girl who just got the <b>**</b> scared out of her because somebody jumped out from behind a bush with a monkey, I tried to stick my hand inside of my head and retrieve the damn platypus. I didn\u2019t fully succeed. So, with half a platypus hanging out of my ear, I went back to Petsmart and complained. I told them that I\u2019m never buying an animal from them again because they crawl inside of me. They were shocked, and I clarified that it went through my ear, and then they were relieved. They told me that there wasn\u2019t anything they could do about it. I threw myself on the floor, making a scene, and demanded a free hamster. That night I was eating my dinner and all of a sudden Gioff, still hanging out of my ear, started to cry. I asked him what was wrong and he said that he doesn\u2019t like it in here anymore. I told him to shut up and that it was his fault, he didn\u2019t like that. I attempted to get a shower the same night, but it\u2019s a little hard whenever you have a platypus hanging out of your ear. I did what I could and headed off to bed. But, just then, I remembered I left my free hamster in the car and by this time it probably already ate the cheese puffs I had hidden under my seat. I dashed down the stairs, Gioff screaming from the sudden movement, and bolted through the garage to the car. I than opened the door cautiously incase of a sneak attack from the vermin. To my surprise, my cheese puffys were still there, and the hamster was asleep on the back seat. I went to pick up the hamster carefully, but it freaked out and bit my finger. I tried to yank my hand away from it, but it latched itself on pretty well. Running up the stairs, Gioff now screaming even louder, I remembered I had forgotten my cheese puffs in the car. Running BACK down the stairs, Gioff in hysterics from the stress, I safely got them cheese puffs. With the hamster still biting and Gioff still flipping out inside of my head, I managed to work my way up the stairs. Once upstairs, I gave my hand a good whack to the wall, and off came the sadist hamster.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-02-23T22:18:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dave", "comment_text": "Stop acting like a bunch of bloody 3 year olds and stop arguing about religion vs science.

To all you Christians commenting that evolution is false or whatever:<br><br>First off, lets get this off the bat. If you don&#39;t believe evolution to be true, then you are not properly educated on it. Your so called &quot;education&quot; you have received on evolution sounds like the typical propaganda that would be taught in a creationist organisation. You are misrepresenting the whole concept.<br><br>Okay first let&#39;s get your terminology right. Evolution is a scientific theory. The word theory in science has a different meaning than its normal everyday use. \u00a0In science, a theory is not a guess, not a hunch. It&#39;s a well-substantiated, well-supported, well-documented explanation for our observations. It ties together all the facts about something, providing an explanation that fits all the observations and can be used to make predictions. In science, a theory is the ultimate goal, the explanation. It&#39;s as close to proven as anything in science can be. Gravity is also just a theory, and not believing in evolution doesn&#39;t make it any less real than not believing in the theory of gravity allows you to float the fuck away. It has been proven and stood the test of time for more than 150 years. It is probably one of the most well-substantiated theories out there.<br><br>Micro and Macro Evolution are ambiguous terms and are not considered scientific since they hold no form of value to the concept or theory. I challenge you to find one peer reviewed published scientific journal that uses the terms Micro and Macro Evolution and if you do, I will consider changing my stance on the matter.<br><br>There is tons of evidence for evolution:<br>\u2022 \u00a0We have the fossil records that show how species gradually change and evolve over time in order to adapt and survive in their ever changing environment.<br><br>\u2022 \u00a0We can physically observe evolution occurring in micro organisms. We know that the more complex the species, the longer it takes for evolution to change the species to such a notable level that it is can be considered an entirely different species from what it was originally. Noticeable evolution in a complex species does not happen over one or even 10 generations, it happens over thousands of generations of natural selection, survival of the fittest and the rare beneficial genetic mutation.<br><br>\u2022 \u00a0We humans are losing our wisdom teeth and our jaws are shrinking. Even though we have changed the recipe for evolution to happen in our own species by allowing the weak to survive and changing our views of natural selection from mere reproduction purposes to more complex and diverse traits, doesn&#39;t mean that we have stopped evolving. We are just evolving based on the environment we are in which is artificial at best. It&#39;s interesting if you think about it a bit.<br><br>\u2022 \u00a0We can even see how different races of human beings adapted to suit their environments. Black people have dark skin and less hair because of the intense heat in Africa and white people have more hair and lighter skin so they can absorb more Vitamin D from the sun in the cold climates in Europe. Creation does not explain this.<br><br>\u2022 \u00a0Look at dogs. Dogs are a prime example of evolution being manipulated by man in order to create a separate species from the wolf and other canines who would rather be a companion to man instead of adapting to survive on its own. We messed with evolution thousands of years before we even knew what it was. Dogs are a man made species completely separate from the wolf. Humanity witnessed the wolf change into the dog. We made the dog. That is evolution. We have seen it with out own goddamn eyes.<br><br>All these little facts and pieces of information and much more come together to form the theory of evolution. That is all it really is. It&#39;s an explanation of how life came to be the way it is today from the moment it came into existence, nothing else, and it&#39;s the best explanation we have and has since it has since its induction, only grown stronger . Evolution doesn&#39;t explain the origin of life or where life came from, that is a different topic, evolution merely explains what happened a split second after that. We don&#39;t know exactly how life came into existence, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we should just throw our hands in the air and scream &quot;GOD DID IT!&quot;. We need to use science, logic and reasoning to figure it out and we will figure it out soon. Science is moving faster than it ever has and one day we will know.<br><br>The problem with this though is that it disproves the creation story from the bible and if the creation story is not true, then the story of Jesus would have been pointless and without Jesus, Christianity kind of falls apart. That is why you either have liberal moderate Christians who kind of admit that evolution makes more sense but they still find a way to wriggle god in there somewhere and disregard the creation story as metaphorical for evolution and thereby keeping their religion relevant or the fundamental conservative christian who either distorts evolution with propaganda and dismisses all scientific evidence for it, or just blatantly keeps themselves ignorant on the subject by only reading material on it via christian platforms instead of legitimate scientific forums.<br><br>Hopefully now you will be more educated on what evolution actually is and hopefully you will not choose to just blatantly ignore all the facts I stated that prove it to be true. Evolution is a collective name given to all these facts and phenomenon happening in our physical world. Anyone who says different doesn&#39;t know what evolution is or has been greatly misled.\ufeff<br><br>Evolution has been proven. There is no debate there. The only thing we are still arguing is exactly how it happened.", "comment_date": "2014-09-19T07:10:58Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Mishal Sheik", "comment_text": "Nice music.....what&#39;s the name?..plzz reply", "comment_date": "2014-09-17T08:18:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Orny Gorny", "comment_text": "And the Christians rage on!", "comment_date": "2014-09-15T04:16:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alyssa Rose", "comment_text": "What about god???

About a year ago I became very interested in religion, At first, I just wanted to know what each one believed or how they saw life. My parents had never said I was Christian or Jewish or anything so I really didn&#39;t know what I was, neither did I care. When I started getting interested I realized I wanted to know. My mother told me I could believe in whatever I wanted. That&#39;s when I started learning about it. This year I am still just as curious. I have so many questions that I want to get answered still. But while I researched on some religions it felt like I was looking into different worlds. So many of us believe in different things. No religion I researched was alike. I get it though, none of us can be alike perfectly. I don&#39;t know if I believe in God or don&#39;t. But why do we all have to choose a religion? Some of you were born into a religion, and always believed in it and feel very strongly about people who don&#39;t. There&#39;s nothing wrong with believing in a religion, but do some of you have to be rude to others who don&#39;t? It always feels like I don&#39;t have a religion, like I&#39;m an outsider looking in. I&#39;ve never met one person like I was. Once, the teacher asked us to raise our hand when she called are religion. I didn&#39;t raise my hand for any of them. Is it wrong that I can&#39;t decide what religion to choose? It feels like I&#39;m in a glass case with all different kinds of people standing around me, screaming different things that I have to believe in. I listen to each one but realize all of them can be right in there own ways. Every. Single. One. I could go on, and on, and on about it but I think I have already bored to death many, many people.

I like discussion so responses are encouraged, just don&#39;t be rude about it, I&#39;ll just ignore you. Obviously this won&#39;t have all my thoughts to back up my views in this comment but here we go! My biggest problem with evolution is that something cannot come from nothing. There is a counter argument that says that scientists have discovered electrons just &quot;appearing&quot; in space with no cause (as told to me by a friend) however even in space there is no complete vacuum not to mention there is an unknown number of other scientific processes that we have not discovered that could explain this so it is incomplete at best and flat out wrong/inaccurate at best. One can then take the causality approach to God which requires some more typing and if you would like me to I can type out in a reply to those who are interested but causality allows for the possibility of an existence of God. There is no proof for evolution nor any absolute proof for God. However, there is enough evidence to provide for the strong possibility of God whereas there is proof against evolution (so far to my knowledge, there could always be a reason behind it) and I would be glad to share it with anyone who wants a response. :) I am a Christian and I don&#39;t like the light that Christianity is put in in society today. Much of it is justified by the wrong actions of so called Christians but that&#39;s not what Christianity is supposed to be. In all truth it&#39;s only supposed to be love for everyone and help to get to a place where they can meet God themselves. You don&#39;t need to be perfect, I&#39;m not, and that&#39;s the point, we aren&#39;t perfect so that&#39;s why God took on the job for us and made it so we eventually can be perfect.

Also, if the reason for the diversity &amp; &quot;designedness&quot; of life is evolution, why even assume a God?", "comment_date": "2013-10-29T18:03:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lunasticks", "comment_text": "EVERY SINGLE EDUCATIONAL VIDEO ON YOUTUBE IS SUPPORTED BY AUIDIBLE!!!", "comment_date": "2013-10-29T17:49:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Athena", "comment_text": "i know its weird. the point is supposed to be that the old testament is a description of how people used to live and what the old rules are, and the new testament is after Jesus came and died for everyones sins, making the crap that happened in the old testament was dismissed and no longer applied. like in the old testament people had to kill a lamb when they did something wrong, but not after jesus arrived. .", "comment_date": "2013-10-29T15:55:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grass Hopper", "comment_text": "It&#39;s not belief.
