Der Kampf, h\u00e4ufig aufwachen zu m\u00fcssen, um zu urinieren, und das Gef\u00fchl, jede Minute zu urinieren, war ein Schmerz. Ich konnte wegen des Verlustes der Blasenkontrolle keine langen Strecken zur\u00fccklegen. Komplikationen durch Alpha-Blocker-Medikamente verschlimmerten das Leben und mein PSA-Wert zeigte 20 ng / ml, was sehr hoch war, sodass eine chirurgische Option empfohlen wurde. Unter das Messer zu gehen war f\u00fcr mich keine Option, also begann ich meine Suche und Versuche mit Kr\u00e4utermedikamenten. Ich hatte so viele Kr\u00e4uter probiert und wurde auf der Suche nach einem Heilmittel betrogen. Ich h\u00e4tte total aufh\u00f6ren k\u00f6nnen zu suchen, aber das Prostataproblem wurde schlimmer. Mein Durchbruch gelang durch den nat\u00fcrlichen Kr\u00e4uterbehandlungsmodus ZIGAMA-90. Meine \u00dcberzeugung war die Kommunikation mit Dr. Fredrick \u00fcber Telefongespr\u00e4che und WhatsApp, was meine Zweifel an seiner Echtheit beseitigte. Die Behandlungsmodi waren alle nat\u00fcrlich, es passte meine Ern\u00e4hrung und meinen Lebensstil an, um in weniger als 3 Monaten dauerhaft geheilt zu werden. Es ist 3 Jahre nach der Behandlung gewesen und ich habe die totale Kontrolle \u00fcber mein Leben.

And if I see a pimple beginning to show, I hit it hard with the toner and overnight, the inflammation and redness have damn near fled the city of my face. Fair warning, it BURN when you use it, so if you have never used salicylic acid or have sensitive skin, start out w. a lower % of the acid. They have .5, 1, and 2% available OTC in various forms but I suggest a toner, not a face wash, as the wash doesn&#39;t give the acid enough time to dig deep into those pores. Its also an excellent exfoliant, so you can ditch your exfoliant while using. Exfoliating with this toner also helps to speed up cell turnover which equals healthier, more elastic skin that is less inclined to break out, assuming you use it in your regimen enough. I can&#39;t tell you how much this little product has changed my life. It even works on chest and back, and as a woman, I can&#39;t say how relieved I am to not have to worry about acne on my goddamn chest like I&#39;m a pubescent 14 yr old male. Do give it a try.

So when we eat sugar for example it may seem like your acne is getting worst but, in reality it increases a better living condition for hormones. So this can also seem like your acne is getting worst. Also having a lot of dairy in your diet can cause the same effect. Studies have recently shown that dairy products have a huge amount of hormones in them, so this can cause a positive feed back loop (hormones that are only being produced and there&#39;s no switch, chemically to turn off the production of hormones). In conclusion acne is treatable  through medication/ organic treatments, and a clean life style (grooming/washing), controlling stress levels (stress increases hormone production, example cortisol).

Hormonal balance can only be achieved with certain diet. Radical diet changes significantly effect acne. Just because there has not been enough research on acne and diet does not mean there is no relation. Actually, one study has shown how effective eliminating dairy can be for preventing acne. (this is due to hormones and insulin spiking effects from dairy.) Other foods to avoid are oils with Polyunsaturated omega 6 fatty acids and trans fats like Canola, soybean, sunflower, safflower, and corn oils. (replace with monounsaturated fats like coconut and red palm oils.) This will rebalance the ratio of omega 6&#39;s to 3&#39;s which reduces inflammation and oxidation (two key factors of acne.) Eliminating sugar (except fruit) reduces inflammation, decreases insulin resistance (insulin is a known acne causing hormone), and takes away the source of food for malicious bacteria colonizations and candida in the gut. Gut microbiota plays a major role in creating hormones in the intestines which are absorbed. There are so many causes of acne, many indirectly caused by diet, that is why science has not yet succeeded at finding a strong link between acne and the foods we eat. This is why diet is too often overlooked as a solution to clearing skin. The best way to find dietary acne triggers are to eliminate foods you may be allergic to, as well as all dairy, sugar (except whole fruits), grains, and the aforementioned omega 6 oils. Once the skin is clear, reintroduce until acne reappears.

I&#39;m 13 years old and I have had severe acne for 4 years now. I&#39;ve tried everything I could get my hands on (Which isn&#39;t that much, my family is not that wealthy), Proactive, tea tree oil, my dad bought a bunch of different things I can&#39;t remember what they&#39;re called. I cleanse every night, every morning, I use face masks sometimes, they&#39;re usually soothing masks though, which I would use cause it helps my irritation and redness. Most of them worked for a little bit, than started giving me side effects like skin irritation and than stopped working all together. Depression and anxiety runs in both sides of my family, and my depression is just starting to show. I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s genetic or not though, if I was really meant to have depression, because my life has been such a shit storm lately and I&#39;m not being over dramatic. I&#39;m not going to bother going over the details though, there are too many. I always have back problems or joint pains, though I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s normal, everyone is telling me it&#39;s growth pains though I don&#39;t know, my mom is really short and my dad is really tall and I&#39;m already as tall as my mom, but there&#39;s been a solid year or 2 between the last time I grew so i have no idea what height I&#39;m going to end up to be, and knowing that contributes to whether the growth pains are actually growth pains or not. I have pretty dry skin and lips.. I&#39;m just saying all this because I&#39;ve read that they&#39;re all side effects of Accutane. Depression (Which when I said I think I have, I didn&#39;t mention, gives me suicidal thoughts), suicidal thoughts/actions, joint pains, dry skin, etc. <br>I&#39;m reading the reviews for Accutane but on the website I found, it says they&#39;re discontinued, and it has a calendar for like when it got FDA approval and all that stuff and the last &#39;activity&#39; it says was in 2003 or something, but the reviews are from this year and some in 2015, they&#39;re all clumped though like there&#39;s a couple reviews for January February and March and then there&#39;s reviews for December 2015, but it&#39;s not like there&#39;s any reviews from May 2015 or September 2015 or whatever, which leads me to think they&#39;re fake.. At this point I&#39;m willing to try anything that will get rid of my acne, since it plays a big part in my apparent depression, and I wonder if taking Accutane will heighten my pain and dry skin and depression, which could definitely push me over the edge (I&#39;ve had suicidal thoughts, I&#39;ve never conflicted self-harm, I&#39;ve never tried to kill myself, just thoughts, I&#39;m wondering if taking Accutane will.. Assist me in taking those steps) or if it will just cancel out what I already have because it&#39;s all listed as side effects.

Maybe I&#39;ve just been surrounded by a different genetic makeup of individuals in the regions I live, regions like Seattle and Kansas City. For me personally and those I&#39;ve given suggestions to have always had huge success when it comes to changing diet and lifestyle. Reducing sugars (both natural and un-natural), drinking more water, eating more vegetables and fruit (mainly vegetables), and one biggy for me get enough sleep on a constant sleep schedule. I have had fairly severe acne for a decade since I hit puberty. Used a varying amount of products during that time with little results. For general health reason, not really for acne at the time since I had kind of given up finding a cure, I wanted to improve my diet and exercise more. I completely changed my lifestyle of eating out everyday at fast foods and started cooking at home. Lots of stir fry at first lol. But heavy with vegetables and little meat. Made smoothies every morning with things like spinach, banana, honey, coconut, avocado, almond milk, chia seeds, blueberries, pineapple, and strawberries. Only drank water, with the occasional juice. And actually that hardest thing, but one of the more effective, was going to bed at consistent time, and for me close to 8hrs a night. It still took a few months to see results but after a few months my acne dramatically reduced. It&#39;s been a couple years since and I only get small occasional breakouts, usually when I go out and eat lol. I&#39;ve discussed this with quite a few people in my years since and the ones who adopt similar lifestyle changes see the similar results. Guess I should do a case study ;). So I don&#39;t know but from my perspective with me and the people in my region diet seems to have a great impact on acne. Through, funny enough, a process I think we should be doing anyway for just our general health let alone acne. And I have a real hard time hearing companies downplaying this and saying you can&#39;t do anything when I&#39;ve seen amazing results in my life and many others. This might just be rumor but when I looked into undeveloped countries, studies seem to show that acne does not affect their populations anywhere near the amount it does in the developed ones. While that could be to genetics as stated in the video, and I&#39;m sure it does play apart especially since generations of people have been on different diets now from the developed to the developing. I think the source is the food not that we were originally genetically prone. I still have yet to really get into physical exercise though lol.

A lot of people are also deficient in probiotics which fight off bad bacteria and help with digestion. All these factors are a HUGE reason why a lot of people have acne and a number of different problems. So you must detox, get regular exercise, hydrate, and try to limit toxins your surrounded by.
