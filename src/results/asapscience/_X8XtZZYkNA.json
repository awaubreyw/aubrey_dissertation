They spend the day studying at an institution, and spend the night studying some more.<br>When it comes to humour, dark humour is usually represents the harsh reality rather than silly things that crack people up. For example, the apple joke in the video is considered dark because it states that everyone will die, regardless of what fruit they choose to consume, and in what amount. <br>I am not a musician, but I was forced to play a bit of guitar by my elder brother, so I can say with confidence that it can help improve memory(memorisation of scales and chords) and problem solving(improvising). <br>Personally speaking, I dislike the word \u201csmart\u201d as it is very vague. If someone scores a 95 on a test, it only means that he knows 95% of the answers that came for the test. There could be many more questions that someone who scored 80% knew, but didn\u2019t come for the test. The one who scored a 95 will be considered smarter than the one who scored 80%, even if he has more knowledge. <br>If person A can recite the multiplication tables up to say, 20, and person B can name every single pokemon, its typing, abilities, evolutionary line, its gender ratio, its egg group, base stats, its origin game and its locations, and also has the type chart(a 16x16 square) memorised, tell me who is smarter, and who will be recognised as the smarter individual by an institution?<br>People tell me \u201cOh, it must be so nice to be smart\u201d or \u201cI wish I was as smart as you\u201d or \u201cOnly someone as smart as you can solve this problem\u201d and I hate it. <br>They never see the amount of effort I put in and glare at me when I call a score of 83% a low score. If they put in three hours of effort and get a score of 40%, it seems a tad bit unfair to me that I put in three hundred hours of effort and get only 95%. <br>They never realise that I failed to solve the same problem that I showed them, learned from my mistake, and then showed them in a quick and simple manner how to solve the problem.<br><br>Thank you for listening to my rant.", "comment_date": "2021-12-12T05:57:28Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Salt Cube", "comment_text": "So what I get from this video is that I am very stupid", "comment_date": "2021-12-12T00:05:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yureno", "comment_text": "&#39;Virgins likely have higher IQ&#39;<br><br><br><br>My time has come", "comment_date": "2021-12-11T03:14:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Astrid Moquete-Blomstrom", "comment_text": "Me, a straight A student not wanting to drink in the future, short, and is 10 years younger than my brothers.", "comment_date": "2021-12-10T13:23:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ssj9devil", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know if I should really say all this online to strangers... man were those videos fleeting while in elementary school.

Please god stop it. You&#39;re hurting yourself, you&#39;re hurting others, and you&#39;re contributing to a society that makes people feel worthless for not fitting into very specific boxes. Getting good grades does not mean you&#39;re intelligent, it means you&#39;re a good student. You&#39;re likely to succeed in the world because you have the skills that are necessary in modern society, however that does not inherently mean you&#39;re above average intelligence.<br><br> I did an IQ test in middle school and I&#39;m 30 IQ points above average, but I was nearly held back 3 times. I dropped out of high school. My classmates and teachers dismissed my struggles in school because I&#39;m smart, so how could I possibly be struggling? Highly intelligent people are more likely to have learning disabilities, executive function disorders, autism, and all kinds of other stuff. It&#39;s awful that we assume that if we were just smarter, all our problems would be solved. <br><br>You are not stupid. You are not struggling because you&#39;re stupid. And you&#39;re valid for struggling even if you learn really easily. Society is not made for the average person. Society is made for a very specific type of person and they try their damndest to fight tooth and nail to shove us into boxes we most certainly do not fit in. If you&#39;re trying to succeed, it&#39;s not your fault that you aren&#39;t. If you feel guilty for not succeeding, it is not your fault. You are not stupid for struggling to be someone you were never meant to be. Because if society were based on a person like you, you&#39;d be thriving.<br><br> Our negative image of ourselves comes from comparing ourselves to others. Because you don&#39;t feel stupid when you realize everyone else struggled on that assignment, too. I hate that we&#39;re taught to hate ourselves from such a young age because of the standardized school system. Because for those of us who don&#39;t fit the bill.. we&#39;re abandoned. We don&#39;t matter to the system. They just want us to go away, shut up, and do what they tell us to. And they look down on us. <br><br>When you hear &quot;high school dropout&quot; you think of a 40 year old man who lives in his mom&#39;s basement and has no life goals or motivation, not an incredibly bright kid who never studied for a test in their life and always got 80% or higher. The school system failed me. And it&#39;s failed so many other people who have incredible minds. Most of the kids who drop out aren&#39;t to blame. They can&#39;t focus on school because they&#39;re working to support their family. They have learning disabilities, sensory processing disorders, executive function disorders, and so many other things that affect huge parts of school that we don&#39;t even realize are a part of it. <br><br>History has always been my worst subject because my abusive father was obsessed with it. It&#39;s now a trigger for me and I could never focus in history class because I was too busy trying to hide the fact that I was shaking and crying. I have complex PTSD from it and one day I had a flashback in the middle of class because of a trigger, and it was the single most terrifying moment in my life. It was like a switch had flipped and everything that had ever happened to me past the age of 12, when my life began changing for the better, was gone. Everything that ever made me happy, gone. In a matter of seconds I went from focusing on the French Revolution to feeling like a helpless child who saw no way out except suicide. I skipped my next few classes to recover and when I came back the next day, my teachers didn&#39;t care. They just told me it wasn&#39;t a valid reason to skip class so I was getting an F on that day&#39;s classwork. <br><br><br>504s and IEPs are cool and all but they don&#39;t fix the system. They make it a little more tolerable. I just want all of you out there, diagnosed or not, whether you know that you&#39;re different or if you beat yourself up over not being able to be like everyone else, <b>you are not alone.</b> And it is not your fault. Your worth is not determined by your grades or your success in school. You are so much more than a letter. You are so much more than a percentage. You are a person just like the rest of us, and you are valid. You deserve everything that the rest of us do. All of the injustice you&#39;ve felt was not your fault. You did not deserve it. The system has wronged you, and you are not to blame. You&#39;re doing your best.

When you mix a certain amount of intelligence with introversion, it can become a mess.  I personally am lost compared to those around me. I don&#39;t fit in well with others, or at least without creating a relatively false image of myself in order to interact sufficiently with those around me.  I watch videos like this to feel understood.  We are in a world where intelligence is seen as the ones with the greatest capacity for storage, I disagree.  Those with a certain amount of intelligence (130+ roughly speaking) see the world through a unique lens.

I ruminate and though I have a high vocabulary for someone my age (I&#39;m 14) and even though I worry and ruminate, I have mild dyslexia and sometimes my brain doesn&#39;t process words as good as I wish it did. Especially with math I wish they just kept word problems out of math I get confused and read it wrong or they did something grammatically incorrect and that word mistake ends up being all I can think about. (Also I can use words grammatically correct, but punctuation is a struggle aside from the obvious).I definitely daydream sometimes you can find me staring at walls just dozing off into my mind not sleeping just yee. So one more thing in my favor I guess, but the majority has been NOT in my favor. I&#39;m fairly ambidextrous, but my right hand is still dominant. Music runs through my family and though I can make pianos sound fairly good, that&#39;s about it, I can barely read sheet music either sooo... That&#39;s fun. I don&#39;t smoke, but I get it second-hand since my mom smokes in the house. Definitely a virgin and I&#39;m to scared of the process of me becoming a devil-child (non-religious by the way). So one more thing in my favor. Yes t&#39;was funny. One more thing for me.<br>Anyways someone could check out none of these and be the smartest person you know people are varied, there are outliers in everything, and well, yeah. So don&#39;t be offended by this video it&#39;d purely research of what they&#39;ve found. IQ&#39;s are also not a good measurement of intelligence. I&#39;ve taken online tests before and have gotten, like 300, or something, but trust me I&#39;m dumb in a lot of ways, but smart in my own ways to, so think about the ways you&#39;re smart and a little dumb, and recognize it and have a good time.", "comment_date": "2019-02-20T02:10:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarah G", "comment_text": "Soo nerds don&#39;t get laid.", "comment_date": "2019-02-19T02:26:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SunlessPeriwinkle", "comment_text": "Well.<br>I&#39;m an night owl.<br><br><br><br><br><b>am I smart yet???</b>", "comment_date": "2019-02-18T16:42:15Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "pluto!!", "comment_text": "<b>wow that&#39;s 4 minutes of my life I&#39;ll never get back</b>", "comment_date": "2019-02-18T05:45:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HW", "comment_text": "I took an iq test and I am a 158 and I&#39;m British and I also have anxiety and I&#39;m ambedectras", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T21:40:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0647\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0647", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude46\ud83d\ude46\ud83d\ude46 Are   \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 but boys are \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e", "comment_date": "2019-02-16T08:26:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tala __", "comment_text": "When i took an iq test, it said my iq was 133 up to 149.

Alarmingly you only gave one study as evidence for every claim you listed (though the virginity one did have different studies for different age groups but there is still no overlap to help solidify each study). And there are a lot of other things that you could link to many of these claims. Let\u2019s start with the first one about height.There are many other very logical reasons why taller people are higher earners, so one study is especially little proof here. Plus which intelligence tests were they taking? You said tests plural were they taking more than one, or were they taking different tests (if they were taking different tests, that is a lot of variables)? How do we know that these tests are the best tests and that they aren\u2019t specific to one area of intelligence. On the subject of breast vs. bottle feeding, the study was taken in Brazil which is a poor country, do we know wether or not the mothers could get good quality formula? Were all of the mothers using the same formula? Plus do we know why the mothers chose the feeding method that they did; maybe the formula mothers were poor so they didn\u2019t have enough time to breast feed the babies, and they couldn\u2019t take them to work to feed them when they had to and couldn\u2019t afford a breast pump to make the to make the feeding easy enough to deal with and so that other people could feed the baby breast milk when she wasn\u2019t there. If being poor did have a link to being more likely to bottle feed than that would explain the results because, being wealthy increases most of the stats that you measured there intelligence by (it increases both, educational income) (and while wealth doesn\u2019t <i>totally</i> controls these things it still has a <b>sizable</b> affect on these things no matter what your intellect is), meaning that it was really wealth not the method of feeding (or really intelligence in general). Plus there are many people who disagree with the idea that breast vs. bottle feeding impacts intelligence. On top of that some of the studies you sited were very small, such as the ones for the link between intelligence and rumination (which didn\u2019t even have higher results in all categories of the test), and the one about righties vs. lefties. While you did slap a correlation does not equal causation on the end there, you did not put enough emphasis on it, instead encouraging the viewer to use these methods and \u201c <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> \u201d.

I\u2019m probably not going to make it out of high school, nobody\u2019s going to hire me, and I\u2019ll end up like the rest of my family. An IQ does not guarantee anything. It\u2019s a glorified number. When taking the test, they asked me to tell a story by looking at a picture, then they asked me to point to the image which best represents the word said aloud, then probably some other stuff which I don\u2019t remember. Touchy subject for me, since I\u2019ve been getting called smart and gifted all my life. I\u2019d rather have an IQ of 80 if it meant I\u2019d at least get out of school and get to college. I\u2019m ranting, either way, moral of the story is that your IQ score, whether it be high or low, means absolutely nothing.

Not precisely, more likely my intellectual personality just drives me forward to learn (Despite that it takes me more than twice as long to learn something than the average person, much longer than that probably), while the smarter people (Or anybody, really) fall in a hedonistic lifestyle and pay less attention and do less work in school.

Also, we don&#39;t inherit intelligence. That comes from the experiences of being the older sibling.

How would you interpret this student was intellectual if you only used the signs of being ambidextrous? And, &quot;above-average&quot; is an extrusive stereotype, any person can be very intellectual.

For example I can&#39;t play right-handy guitar, I put my belt opposite than all right handers and I drive a car mostly with my left hand. Also I can use trackpad and mouse on computer with both hands and also I can write with both hands. I can do a lot of things with both hands and in some situations I just switch between them to make things easier for me - for example when I sip a tea or coffee behind keyboard I just type and use mouse with left hand while holding a cup with right hand.

But there was an extra grace given to me by My Father.<br><br> That was the grace of protection. I protected my Son, from the start, in a way which was different. I knew that He was the promised Messiah and, therefore, I had been given a very special responsibility, although I had no idea of the magnitude which this responsibility would entail.<br><br>I was not given to understand, early on, that my Son, the Saviour, sent by God to save the human race from the fires of Hell, would be killed. This part of my mission came as a terrible shock and my pain cannot be described, so intense was it.<br><br>I suffered through my Son, in Him and with Him. Even today, I feel His pain and sorrow at the disbelief of my Son\u2019s Existence in the world today. As the Mother of Salvation, my responsibility is to assist my Son in His plan to salvage souls.<br><br>This is the time of the deluge; this time for swift and sudden change. As wars will break out, and a great war emerges from the ashes, God\u2019s Plan will increase in its pace to awaken His Presence amongst all nations and all races.<br><br>My child, I plead with you to pray the most Holy Rosary as I weep today. My tears, which you have just witnessed are for those souls who will not acknowledge my Son.<br><br> It is those Christians who say that they accept Jesus Christ, as Saviour, and who insult Him, by not praying to Him, who sadden Him the most.<br>The spread of atheism is like a dreadful epidemic sweeping the earth. God has not been forgotten, instead, His Existence is being deliberately ignored. His laws banned from your countries.<br><br> His Churches not honoured. His sacred servants too timid and not courageous enough to proclaim His Holy Word.<br>The earth will now change both physically and in spirit. The cleansing has begun. The battle will be waged between those who follow the evil one and God\u2019s Remnant Church.<br><br>Those loyal to my Son must always call on me, your beloved Mother of Salvation, so that I can consecrate you to my beloved Son, in order to grant you much needed graces.<br> You must be prepared as a soldier of Jesus Christ. Your armour must be made stronger, because your role is as a crusader and you will have to march against great cruelty and injustice.<br><br>Go in peace children and keep in daily prayer as the changes commence, so that the salvation of humanity can be achieved.<br><br>All will be done according to the Holy Will of my Father, through His only Son, Jesus Christ. You, my children, who ask for my help, will be granted great protection for your nations.<br><br> Your beloved Mother, Mother of Salvation<br><br>i9887", "comment_date": "2018-01-13T17:59:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Annamole", "comment_text": "This is rigged I\u2019m not THAT smart Jesus I feel like he\u2019s just doing it to make us feel better", "comment_date": "2018-01-13T17:59:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Light", "comment_text": "If the average is Trump, a rock would be above.", "comment_date": "2018-01-13T17:58:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Non Est Anima Mea", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a cat", "comment_date": "2018-01-13T17:58:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mandilyn", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X8XtZZYkNA&amp;t=0m18s\">0:18</a> Fuc.", "comment_date": "2018-01-13T17:57:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Burrito Dog", "comment_text": "if alcohol drinkers are smart then frat boys and NELK are geniuses", "comment_date": "2018-01-13T17:56:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "maluboo on ig", "comment_text": "IM OVER AVERAGE \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude29", "comment_date": "2018-01-13T17:56:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pushpendar tiwari", "comment_text": "7 categories out of 13", "comment_date": "2018-01-13T17:55:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Farcraft2", "comment_text": "what about race??? hehe xd.", "comment_date": "2018-01-13T17:55:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Kelly", "comment_text": "i didn\u2019t find that apple joke funny, but that\u2019s because i like dark humor that is pitch black, darkest of the dark.

An interesting study to be done would be the level of self-control in intelligent people compared to that of people with a higher &#39;emotional intelligence&#39;. In the UK (where I live) especially,  PSHE (personal, social and health education) is currently of a really low quality and so you have all these really smart people who get hooked on drugs because they don&#39;t know better. However, the point about smokers and non-smokers is interesting. I can definitely see the reason being for that is that schools and society have recently focused on getting people to stop smoking because of the devastating effects, if there were more studies done on drug-use and its effects, perhaps we could shrink the amount of people using them.

Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I&#39;m out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I&#39;m really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I&#39;m a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she&#39;ll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can&#39;t sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can&#39;t take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she&#39;s sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what&#39;s up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I&#39;ve been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer.

There\u2019s also Rick\u2019s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they\u2019re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick\u2019s existential catchphrase \u201cWubba Lubba Dub Dub,\u201d which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev\u2019s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I\u2019m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon\u2019s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.
