The difference is that thc is psychedelic, meanwhile cbd is purely euphoric. It will give a sense of euphoria in the emotional, which is why it helps with depressions and anxieties for many. <br><br>It may be less, but its still certainly a high that effects you. <br><br>Reference : <br>I smoked real weed every day for over 10 years <br><br>I also smoke CBD bud in between it to lower thc tolerance at times, and the entourage effect isnt fake, i actually start to get high off of cbd if the quality is good enough. Its a very similar feeling to what opiates haven given me. <br><br>If the cbd bud is bad, youll feel nothing and slightly happier. If it&#39;s good CBD bud you&#39;ll feel warm, loving, at peace and one, your vision will change to more vibrant hues.. It just feels like a weaker controlled version of thc lol<br><br>If you&#39;re a true old school weed head, just remember how even though regs and brick was trash back in the day. But yet even if it was green bud some how you still got that little high? Its the same little happy high on good cbd...

I gained a ton of weight and lost my motivation to do anything. I stopped going out and avoided socializing at all costs when I was high because it made me paranoid all the time. It made my depression much worse and I started thinking about ending my life. I knew that I had to stop and I\u2019m glad I did. I was definitely addicted to it. I understand that marijuana doesn\u2019t affect everyone the same way and different strains can have either energizing effects or relaxing or a combination of the two, but for me, it just compounded the issues that I was already dealing with when I was sober. I would just sit on my couch or bed and eat non stop. When I wasn\u2019t eating, I was sleeping. A lot. Once I completely detoxed, I felt like a new person. I finally had the energy and motivation to do things besides sleeping and eating. My son was so much happier because I finally started going outside and was spending a lot more time with him.

It regulates you pain, mood, memory, and appetite. The chemicals tch and cbd disable the system, which is why people smoke to ease pain. This is also why i\u2019d you get high, you forget sometimes. Also, that\u2019s why people can get relaxed by smoking. And most importantly... the munchies. Tetrahydrocannabinol or \u201cthc\u201d and Cannabidiol or \u201ccbd\u201d have similar chemica structures. But there\u2019s a difference, thc containd a cyclic ring and cbd contain a hydroxyl group. The difference in their chemical structures control whether you feel high or not. The cb1 receptor contains of a Anandamide cell. This cell and the tch chemical are almost exactly the same in shape. So when thc enters your body, it goes into the cb1 receptor. Cbd is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor. Therefore it doesn\u2019t make you feel high. Although, it does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system in other ways. This means that if you consume cbd it binds to your cb1 receptor and turns it off. Therefore the thc can\u2019t bind as well. Due to that it decreases how high you feel. <br>-Written by Nicholas Jacobs \u00dc", "comment_date": "2021-02-02T14:07:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rafi Rahmani", "comment_text": "So just smoke CBD a load of it then smoke thc after and fly!!", "comment_date": "2021-02-01T05:23:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Key Chain.", "comment_text": "If your seeing this comment, go type in (Watch while high) and enjoy.", "comment_date": "2021-01-31T23:57:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thilak", "comment_text": "Do you smoke weed ?<br>If yes like \ud83d\udc47", "comment_date": "2021-01-31T09:59:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Osamu's Tales", "comment_text": "Wait did they said what obvious ways CBD affect our bodies", "comment_date": "2021-01-30T14:28:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Selma B", "comment_text": "The music in the background is the vibe", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T17:39:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mama Sho-otocheki", "comment_text": "THC:Coffee<br>CBD:Tea", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T09:39:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vedronex", "comment_text": "On the 20 videos i just watched about the subject , this one is by far the most complete and easy to watch.

I was screaming/moaning out in horror as 5-MeO-DMT was showing me this. Mary was with me during these Holy Communions. I couldn\u2019t believe how many humans were dying and I am still unsure if it was tens of millions or hundreds of millions; could it be billions? The faces of all these people as they were crying out and dying and there were so many of them that they covered the whole planet, humans across the entire planet were drowning and dying from poison also, this was horrible. Besides my screaming outloud in utter horror I\u2019ve spent a lot of time crying about this, and trying to warn humans for over a year now (all documented) about what is about to happen across this entire planet, but almost nobody believes me and/or nobody wants to believe me. I had these visions from the Psychedelics before any talk of the covid-19 virus. Later, while researching viruses I discovered that the etymology of virus is poison &amp; that dying from corona virus is literally like drowning, your lungs fill with fluid and you drown. In November of 2019 \u00a05-MeO-DMT were clearly showing us that this virus was coming and was going to kill many millions; how many millions is still unknown, but it was more than tens of million for sure. I still believe that the earth is going to flood over now and millions will drown because other Holy Angels of God\u2019s Heavenly Realm have clearly shown me this. I have been shown things before they happen by the Psychedelics dating back over 30 years now, I see before things happen. And my dreams? several down to the smallest details have come true. All True Psychedelics will confirm this to any human who inquires respectfully.<br>I have other Revelations to share but this one and the fact that there is about to be a global food shortage that the USA will also be gravely affected by are the most pressing, I believe an unprecedented number of humans starve to death in a very little while - this is what I am seeing.<br><br>In the hopes that more humans take the necessary steps to prepare immediately,<br>      -vincent <br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/3IHThwOlbWs\">https://youtu.be/3IHThwOlbWs</a><br><br><br>I wouldn\u2019t recommend ingesting toad venom. Besides the Bufotenine (5-OH-DMT) and the 5-MeO-DMT it also has epinephrine (adrenaline) and bufagins which mimic digoxin overdose.

The only religion that says that we need a perfect, sinless sacrifice to die and rise from the dead, conquering death is Christianity.  It was only God in human form (God incarnate, named Jesus Christ) that died for our sins (crimes) on the cross and rose again and ascended into Heaven.  All we have to do is believe and have faith in Jesus saving us from Hell and letting us into Heaven.  Just pray: &quot;God, forgive me of my sins.  Jesus, come into my heart, I make you my Lord and savior.&quot;  For example, I beat up my mother when I was drunk (I don&#39;t remember doing it).

I have been consuming THC for around 20+ years and recently crossed over to CBD to understand it a bit more.  CBD just makes me so tired I cannot function.  It&#39;s very unpleasant.  It may be useful as an anti-emetic for sure, possibly for seizure reduction, but it&#39;s totally opposite of the feeling experienced with THC.  The smell and taste are another thing.  The terpenes are so much less pronounced in CBD than THC laden marijuana that it makes it almost not enjoyable to ingest/inhale. It&#39;s dank and heavy to the mouth receptors and lungs.  &quot;Hemp flower&quot; is basically bad non-alcoholic beer.  It gives nothing to the user except frustration. <br><br>Now there is this.  I have found CBD to be useful in other aspects.  Drug withdrawal is painful.  My experience is more dealing with a more unassuming form. Alcohol.  When the physiology of the body is disrupted by over consumption of &quot;booze&quot; it makes everything horrid.  Sweats, clammy skin, sleepless nights, and just overall disgust for one&#39;s self.  CBD can assist in reduction of all of that.  Whereas it may not get you high, it may be able to save lives in a more holistic way than Librium or Ativan.  The need to sleep after a large amount is taken seems appropriate and needed for the body to &quot;reset&quot;.

If this is you, here are some tips I have<br><br>1. Get a strain that is pretty balanced between CBD and THC<br>2. I\u2019d recommend an Indica strain as opposed to a sativa strain. If you don\u2019t know what these two things are, they\u2019re both types of THC. Indica has a more laid-back high whereas sativa has a more energetic high.<br>3. Don\u2019t smoke too much. I usually use a dab pen, and if you\u2019re using one of those I wouldn\u2019t recommend more than three hits for your first time, but two will probably do the job especially if you\u2019re smaller. As for other methods of smoking, I can\u2019t really tell you how much you should smoke for your first time, but google can!<br>4. I\u2019d recommend playing some music, it can give you something to focus on. If you\u2019re by yourself I\u2019d also recommend headphones. I\u2019d recommend not playing anything too sad.<br>5. Make sure you\u2019re comfortable in wherever your setting is. If you\u2019re underage, I would do it when your parents aren\u2019t home/at night, or maybe you\u2019re lucky and your parents just don\u2019t bother you. I\u2019d recommend doing it either by yourself or with a friend who you know won\u2019t try to pressure you into smoking more or trying to make you stay awake. Also make sure there are snacks in your house, you don\u2019t want to be stoned with no food lol. Also personally I prefer dim lighting. <br>6. For the final tip, make sure you have a good mindset. If you\u2019re super stressed for some reason, I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing it. That\u2019s probably contradictory to what you would expect, considering many people smoke to relieve stress, I just wouldn\u2019t recommend being super stressed out for your first time. Also don\u2019t be anxious about smoking, if you follow all these tips, which I know there are a lot, but if you follow all of them you will be 100% fine! If you were planning on doing it one day but you start to get really nervous about it, don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s that simple.<br><br>I hope this helps anyone who\u2019s super nervous about trying it. It really can be very helpful, which is why I am sad seeing all these people who are so anxious about trying it. I\u2019ve never asked for likes before, but if you could please like this so that people who are nervous about smoking for the first time can see this, I\u2019d really appreciate it! Also I\u2019m considering making a YouTube video basically explaining all of this, so check my channel and there might Be a video where I go more into detail about all of this. And once again, if you follow all these tips you will 100% be okay!", "comment_date": "2020-07-21T02:14:04Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Stunned", "comment_text": "we high 24/7 in uruguay lol", "comment_date": "2020-07-20T01:35:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Heart2016 Sim", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t smoke pot and I love my life.", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T17:45:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ya boy jay", "comment_text": "I guess I&#39;ve been smoking thc\ud83d\ude2c", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T09:01:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laughing Buddha1997", "comment_text": "Weed is dangerous don\u2019t do it!!!

Unfortunately today the term &quot;hemp oil&quot; is being used to skirt around legal and marketplace regulations. For example, Amazon explicitly prohibits the sale of CBD products, yet displays a wealth of &quot;hemp oil&quot; when performing a search for CBD oil. Taking a closer look you&#39;ll find that these sellers are deceitfully selling hemp seed oil using CBD-like marketing terms, to make you think you buy a CBD product. If you&#39;re looking for CBD oil, you should find &quot;CBD&quot; clearly printed on the label and the actual CBD content of the product should be easily confirmed. This is done by verifying the cannabinoid potency on the lab reports for that specific product. Without this confirmation, do not buy this product and move on! <br>On the CTFO website you can download the lab reports, done by third party, so you are sure you buy the proper CBD oil.<br> What is Hemp Seed Oil?<br> Hemp seed oil is a nutritious type of edible culinary oil made from hemp seeds. Hemp seed oil is made by cold pressing the small brown, nutrient-rich seeds of the hemp plant. Hemp seed oil has a dark to light green color and a naturally mild nutty flavor that works well in salads, dressings, and sauces. Often described as a \u201csuperfood,\u201d hemp seed oil is packed with vital nutrients, including amino acids, fiber, Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, as well as an array of important vitamins and minerals. This makes hemp seed oil a valuable addition to any diet, especially those that may be nutrient deficient. Available in most grocery stores and health food markets for low prices, hemp seed oil has an olive oil-like consistency and is commonly used as a substitute for traditional cooking oils with the exception of deep-frying. This hemp oil is also commonly infused into body care products to nourish the skin, nails, and hair. Don\u00b4t be misled, most hemp products sold on major websites, shops, drugstores and grocery stores are made with hemp seed oil, which contains only trace amounts of CBD.<br> Our CTFO CBD hemp oil is produced from the specifically selected hemp cultivars that are naturally high in CBD for a much higher level of CBD in our products, with 3th party test reports.<br><br>What is CBD Oil? Is CBD oil the same as hemp seed oil? <br>No. Although they are extracted from the same plant, there are some important differences between hemp seed oil and CBD oil. CBD oil, also called CBD hemp oil, is a thick botanical extract made from the stalks, seeds, and sometimes flowers of hemp varieties that are naturally high in CBD. CBD oil contains all the many essential vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids found in hemp seed oil, as well as greater levels of terpenes, flavonoids, and cannabinoids like CBD. Unlike hemp seed oil, CBD oil contains high levels of CBD. CBD, or cannabidiol, is an all-natural and non-intoxicating cannabinoid that promotes balance by supporting the body\u2019s endocannabinoid system, a signaling network that regulates many of the body\u2019s functions, including appetite and metabolism, sleep, mood, and immune response. Over the years, CBD has become a highly sought-after cannabinoid because of its natural wellness effects. CBD oil is made through a specialized extraction process that pulls the CBD oil from the hemp plant. We at CTFO create incredibly pure and healthy CBD oil. This CBD oil concentrate can then be used daily on its own or infused into products like tinctures and liquids, capsules, topicals, vape oil, hair and skin care products, and more. CBD concentrate can also be purified through a filtration process that removes all excess plant material and compounds other than CBD to make a highly-concentrated powder called CBD isolate. <br>Regardless of how you choose to take CBD oil, products like these allow you to tap into CBD\u2019s balancing properties and boost your quality of life, Change The Future Outcome!<br><br>Share this important article with your friends and family to ensure they are properly educated on this important topic.<br><br> Our shop: <br><a href=\"https://healthybodyhappymind.myctfo.com/shop.html?catekey=10xpure\">https://healthybodyhappymind.myctfo.com/shop.html?catekey=10xpure</a>", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T21:11:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Hinojosa", "comment_text": "Ima about to get High of this dispensary cart these hoes dummy good I ain\u2019t trying to go to work to high lmao  ( yes I went to Illinois to buy )", "comment_date": "2020-06-04T11:18:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lawful Vigilante", "comment_text": "Why does the narrator sound like a high trans-gender man?", "comment_date": "2020-06-04T04:57:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "CARLAEHER", "comment_text": "Wow!

So I decided to experiment because I couldn&#39;t get a job anyway at this time. I was amazed I smoked a whole gram blunt of full spectrum cbd flower and it actually got me high only containing .03%\ud83e\uddd0... but I did not feel high from a pure cbd isolate cartridge i purchased aswell. In these times I was constantly drug testing myself to try and see how long it really takes and if the cbd flower would pass the test. The full spectrum did not pass the test. When I first quit smokeing strong normal thc weed it took me 3 1/2 weeks to get clean. Now I&#39;ve been using the full spectrum cbd flower and it takes 2-3 days to get clean after consuming and it gets me high which is AMAZING for my current situation lol. Helped me get through this damn quarantine and not go back to normal weed that would take so long to get out of my system once this is over and it&#39;s time to work somewhere good. It&#39;s very interesting because I have quit normal high thc weed before and everytime I go back to useing it I literally only have to hit it once or twice and I&#39;m super high, and if I hit it too much i would get way too high lol.  I&#39;m usually useing high THC weed everyday in large amounts and not getting to high EVER from being used to it smokeing whole grams and high THC cartridges constantly. now that I don&#39;t smoke normal weed this full spectrum cbd I can smoke the whole joint or blunt and I definitely feel it to where I&#39;m high enough that it makes me worse at call of duty and my YouTube shows so much fun to watch while snacking\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.. I was always told you couldn&#39;t get high off of it but I guess if you consume enough and don&#39;t have a tolerance built up from normal good strong weed it will if you smoke a joint.

I was always curious about weed having heard so much good things about it like no hangover, pain relief, ect, so when the opportunity to try thc came I pounced on it,  having used cbd many times I though it would be just as harmless and having researched all the weed forms and web sites all saying you can smoke mountains of weed and not overdose or get sick, so I went full on in to a pure thc vape the next day I woke up and was feeling very off ,so I asked my friends who also vaped if they felt off they said they were fine so being concerned about my situation I Googled it and found many other people that had the same thing happen. Its called depersonalization and its hell in the realist way there&#39;s not a cure the meds you can take may cause psychological damage making you worst, its horrible so I just wanted to let any teens or young adults who wanted to try weed on this video that its not worth it your not missing anything. Also im not saying you can&#39;t recover from depersonalization but believe me its betters just to avoid it from the get go.

I smoked weed many times and nothing happened to me. but the last time I smoked weed, it started very badly. as soon as I pulled, I coughed, choked, fell to the ground. I threw up 4 times. my legs and hands were spinning, I was walking hard. one moment I thought I was dying, another moment I thought it was just a dream. I tried to wake up but I couldn&#39;t! I&#39;ve seen characters from movies and stories like Simpsons everywhere. I also saw the samara from the circle. my heart ached, I felt like I had a big ball in my lungs. I was terribly scared and I was screaming. I was shaking, I couldn&#39;t stop. my friends were desperate. they didn&#39;t know what to do. they almost called an ambulance. everything went very fast, my heart was beating very much. my eyes were swollen, I still wanted to sleep. I was so out of that I told a lot of secrets to my friends. when I came home my mother didn&#39;t notice anything. I was lucky. I went into the bath, I fell asleep there. I was lucky again, because if my mother found me like this ..... when I woke up quickly I went to bed. I fell asleep immediately. I had nightmares, I woke up to someone standing by me. I was not fine in the morning. I couldn&#39;t think but I was happy to be alive. And yes, I am sure it was marijuana. And yes I regret this. I&#39;ve never smoked since this. Sorry for my english btw. Kids please don\u2019t smoke weed ! :Dd PS: if you want do it, guaranteed, it won&#39;t happen to you what happened to me.

When you smoke or take oil that has CBD/THC you are taking a dynamic duo.  The CBD calms you down while the THC revs you up and puts you in a semi sleep state without the REM.  Reason THC does this is to work on you as the sleep mode in humans is when the body repairs itself.  CBD can be hard on the liver but guess what...THC repairs what CBD does so they work as a team.  It&#39;s best to avoid THC before sleep as it &quot;can&quot; in the right circumstance rob you of your REM sleep, the most important sleep portion of the night.  Also, it&#39;s best to avoid just giving in to the THC and flying high as a kite.  Keep your mind in a positive state without freaking out or zoning out.

I grew up with a dad who abused drugs very heavily and due to seeing what it did to him, I never touched the stuff. I was diagnosed in 2017 in a state where medical marijuana is legal. My friends raved about how much it helped them with anxiety and such and let me try some of theirs. I smoked it. I had one of the worst panic attacks I have ever had. I vomited, I couldn&#39;t sleep because when I closed my eyes even just for blinking, I got extremely dizzy. They insisted I try vapor. I tried it and it wasnt nearly as bad. No panic attack. No nausea either, but I had increased anxiety not decreased. I decided to try CBD. It was very gentle but seemed to help. I need more help from medicine than a gentle calming feeling so I went with some medication I was prescribed and that helps a LOT. <br>I&#39;m not against marijuana use, but its just not for me. I just hope as it becomes legalized completely that people are respectful of the smell. Because I had a panic attack smoking it, it bothers me smelling it. Doesnt really harm me, but if I&#39;m having a bad mental health day it can bother me alot being reminded of the awful experience.", "comment_date": "2019-03-07T07:58:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "THAT ONE WEIRD GIRL Vlog Channel", "comment_text": "If you consume too much THC or consume it in the wrong setting, of course you will have an offputting experience!

There were two times I smoked and I felt really bad; besides making me very high, it made my anxiety worse and my heart beat too fast, I never felt so bad in my life. These two times I wasn&#39;t in a closed environment, I was walking and interacting with people, which only made things worse. So much that at a certain point I had a meltdown and started to cry so much, for no apparent reason at one of the two times. On the other one there was a time I was on the bus and couldn&#39;t even sit straight (I was sliding towards the ground over and over lol), and of course was feeling very anxious and terrified too. The sensation of not being in control nor being able to think was killing me. I think if I had stayed home it would have been cool, though (I had severe social anxiety and general anxiety at the time, so that explains things just getting worse in those situations)<br>And there&#39;s this other time when I smoked and everything felt pretty much normal - I wasn&#39;t feeling my usual anxiety and I also wasn&#39;t super high as well, nor was I near to having an anxiety attack or feeling like I was gonna die. But the bad experiences made me hate the drug. I mean, yeah, it was kinda cool to get high, but not cool enough to pay for the what came with it, is what I thought. So it was either smoke weed that made me high (which is kinda cool if I&#39;m home), but with the side effects of increasing my anxiety and my heartbeat, or smoke weed that kills my anxiety but doesn&#39;t really make very high. I guess the one with more THC works great if I stay home not doing much, just being high, and the one with more CBD works if I go out. But here it&#39;s not legalized, so there&#39;s no way of knowing these things.
