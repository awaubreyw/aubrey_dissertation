The video does a good job of pointing this out. However, neither of these are necessarily bad things. Saturated fat is necessary for a healthy diet. Read that again. NECESSARY. Not only that, fatty foods like bacon, when eaten with other foods like fruits, veggies, and high protein sources (such as eggs), will help increase satiety, keeping you fuller longer. Also, they help increase nutrient absorption.\u00a0<br><br>That said, the points made in the video are all completely valid, but with the above facts in mind, the key is to include bacon in your diet, but still in moderation.

Seriously, you must have missed the recent reports that saturated fats aren&#39;t nearly as harmful to cholesterol levels as once believed. In fact, pork fat otherwise known as lard, has a high percentage of what is called &#39;Steric Acid&#39; which has been shown in studies to elevate the levels of the good, fluffy cholesterol and reduce the amount of bad, dense cholesterol that lead to arterial congestion.<br>Also, the studies that link nitrates to high rates of colon cancer actually were found to have weak statistical evidence to support those claims. For instance, studies conducted that show a link between smoking cigarettes and developing lung cancer generally have a forcing factor of 20. That is, if you smoke for 10 years there is a 20 fold increase in the chance of developing lung cancer. Whereas, the studies that link nitrates to colon cancer generally had forcing factors down in the range of 4. In other words, the forcing factor of eating nitrates and the chance of getting colon cancer doesn&#39;t even go outside of the range of statistical noise. That is, there is a very weak degree of certainty that when someone eats nitrates that, ah yes, you&#39;re going to get cancer. Certainly not with the same degree of certainty that we can say the same as someone who smokes cigarettes for 10 years.<br>Also, out of all the things you are eating with breakfast the bacon and eggs are the least fattening of them all; eating fat does not in fact make you fat. It&#39;s the pancakes smothered in syrup and the sweet, fructose laden fruits that cause your blood sugar levels to shoot up and cause you to really put on the pounds. I&#39;ve been on a low carb diet for the past 6 months, eat bacon and eggs religiously, and have lost about 40 pounds so far. In fact, I eat as much meat, fat, and non-starchy vegetables as I want and limit by carb intake to about 20-40 grams a day and the pounds just fall off.<br><br>Plus, you need to learn how to cook bacon; every piece was burnt and unappealing looking.", "comment_date": "2015-06-28T18:17:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jfb-1337", "comment_text": "I shouldn\u2019t have watched this video while slightly hungry.", "comment_date": "2015-06-28T17:53:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Pham", "comment_text": "Hey I don&#39;t care it&#39;s BACON\ud83d\udc37\ud83d\udc37", "comment_date": "2015-06-28T17:39:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dragorach", "comment_text": "I like how they actually have a bacon condom and they just drew the toothpaste and air freshener. ;)", "comment_date": "2015-06-28T17:23:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GiGi Hay", "comment_text": "Hey can you do a video about how your  health would be affected if you ate by serving size?", "comment_date": "2015-06-28T17:06:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Siiri", "comment_text": "You can call me crazy, but I don&#39;t like bacon :/", "comment_date": "2015-06-28T16:58:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HXGHMUKE", "comment_text": "This is why i&#39;m vegetarian.
