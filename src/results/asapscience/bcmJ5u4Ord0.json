There is nowhere to go. Were being watched heavely by the Lord and His Angel&#39;s from Heaven which is above the waters over our heads now. The sky is blue all over the world (even in the Sahara desert) because the water has engulfed the firmament, which is keeping it from crashing down on us (again). The firmament is made out of diamond and something they call &quot;skystones&quot; which is made up of hydrogen and mostly air (look it up).  This is no game folks. Remember the flood that killed everyone except Noah and his family, well this time it will be with fire. Everyone will die again and not be saved except for 1/3 of the 12 tribes of Israel (aka the elect). There will be no more chances like the flood when Yahawahshi returns again. It&#39;s straight torture in the fire and brimstone.

It&#39;s about damn time that we learn the science of ---- SLEEPWALKING ---  ! :D <br>I&#39;ve been curious for so long since I used to walk in my sleep when I was younger. Sometimes bringing stuff with me. My parents said I&#39;d walk with eyes open sometimes and talk. I could answer them when they asked why I was up, but the answer was always a weird one. I remember waking up often to the radio being on by my bed, that was a sign that I&#39;d been sleepwalking because usually I&#39;d ask for the radio to be put on, when they led me back to bed. <br>As I&#39;ve grown up I don&#39;t sleepwalk anymore, but I do other stuff. I remember once that I thought I saw something by the door and ran up from the bed and opened it. Standing there I &quot;woke up&quot; and got slightly confused because I had no idea why I did that, the intent, though I was &quot;awake&quot; while doing it. There are also several instances where I can wake up in the room and it&#39;s dark, and not remembering where the door is (in the middle of winter in sweden, it gets really dark and I can&#39;t see shit if I wake up an no light is on) so I fumble around in the dark, searching. There are also instances of me shouting stuff and slightly panicking, though I&#39;m not aware of this myself, so my BF have to calm me down and tuck me back in. I do remember once that I woke up to him hugging me and telling me it&#39;s alright and I was like &quot;Wtf? why you wake me :S ?&quot; though I felt that my heart was coming down after how it feels like when you panic. He told me what had happened and I just shrug it off.<br><br>I also remember my dreams very well. Always had. I think it goes a little hand in hand with my sleepwalking and whatever this is now that I&#39;m older. But I can recall at least &quot;1&quot; dream per night when I wake up, and they are always all over the place. <br><br>Anyway, please do a video about sleepwalking or anything along what I&#39;ve tried to explain here :P If you have any questions, feel free to PM me.

Two formula F=m*a and F=G*m1*m2/r^2 prove my point, the hydrogen will always accelerate toward the earth unless if there is a force strong enough to overcome the gravitational attraction between them pulling it away from the earth. Since there is no force apply to the hydrogen gas that is strong enough to overcome the gravitational attraction between the earth and the hydrogen gas pulling it away from the earth, It will accelerate and attracted toward the earth. Obviously you don&#39;t need enough force to be able to overcome earth&#39;s gravity, there is a second way is to achieve high enough velocity, with high enough velocity, your momentum will cause you to fall away from the earth as fast as you fall in it, but this is also impossible because there is no force apply to accelerate the hydrogen gas to that speed.  Another reason why this is impossible is that force pulling the hydrogen away from the earth/the force it take to accelerate the hydrogen gas to be fast enough to overcome the gravitational attraction come out of nowhere and there for violate the law of thermodynamics, you need energy to generate force and energy can&#39;t come out of no where.<br>Your fake fact violate 3 laws of physics.", "comment_date": "2018-05-04T09:49:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jade Stephan", "comment_text": "Gah!

The important thing is that I do accept most of mainstream science. <br><br>I would also like to point out that I accept that the earth is obviously spheroidal, because apparently you have to state that nowadays (which is stupid). I don&#39;t understand why flat earthers still exist in 2018; I would think they died out by now, but apparently not. Apparently stupid still exists. Science isn&#39;t on their side and neither is Scripture. Both Isaiah 40:v22 and Job 26:v10 clearly states that the earth is a sphere, so why do these idiots think it says otherwise? If they really want to believe in a holy book that actually truly does teach a flat earth, it&#39;s not the Bible, they want the Quran. The Quran teaches a flat earth, saying things like the &quot;earth is a carpet&quot;, &quot;mountains are tent pegs&quot;, &quot;the sun sets in a muddy creek&quot;, etc. ... The Bible teaches a spheroidal earth and you&#39;re not gonna tell me otherwise, because I know for a fact I&#39;m right. It has to, because it&#39;s the Word of God and it has to tell the truth and it does. I can give more Bible verses that clearly teach a spheroidal earth, but I think the above two will suffice for now. So let&#39;s just agree that the Bible teaches the truth and the Quran teaches lies. Moving on, amen!! <br><br>To conclude: I accept mainstream science and I&#39;m a Christian.
