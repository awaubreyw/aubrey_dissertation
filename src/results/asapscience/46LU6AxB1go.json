Too many blades (if you are prone to ingrowns you don\u2019t need 3 or more blades)<br><br>3. Pressing too hard on the skin with the blade. A gliding, light touch is all you need. This is likely your biggest issue. Follow #4<br><br>4. Not enough prep time. You should be using a warm/hot water prep (5 mins). Then leave the shaving creme on for more than 3 minutes to really soften the hair. The hair stubble should literally fall away with little or no pressure at all. Pressing is the problem! Be gentle ya&#39;ll.<br><br>5. Using a used blade (this one is obvious, of course).<br><br>6. Use of skin/pore clogging cremes or lotions. These keep hairs from growing up. After a shave, keep your skin bare; let it breath, and allow those newly shaved, really small, microscopic hairs to grow out just in time for the next shave.<br><br>7. Not enough exfoliation to remove excess layers of skin. Use an brush specifically designed to prevent razor bumps as directed.<br><br>8. Shaving too many times. This rule is hard to follow especially if you have to shave for your career but if you are prone to ingrowns, try shaving with an electric clipper. The results are not super close but no one but you will know the difference.<br><br>9. Shaving against the grain. Shave in the direction of hair growth (usually down, but perform a face map to be sure).<br><br>10.

The VNO is the first stage of the accessory olfactory system and contains sensory neurons that detect chemical stimuli. <b>In plain terms, \u00a0the Vomeronasal organ is what allows animals (and at one time, Humans) to detect chemical messengers that carry information between individual species.</b> Fascinatingly enough, <b>the VMO is present in Humans during fetal development</b> but in adulthood the organ atrophies. Though there is <i>some</i> trivial evidence to suggest adults <i>may</i> retain the use of the VMO, in reality studies that use microanatomical methods have reported zero evidence that human beings have active sensory neurons like those in working vomeronasal systems of other animals. Pubic hair&#39;s vestigial purpose was to soak up the stink under our arms and between our legs to aid the transmission of chemical messages between our species.
