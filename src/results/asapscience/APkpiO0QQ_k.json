This is because you at least you have some place to sit. On a busy subway, you are very likely to be standing during the entire trip. Unless they make local transit more passenger friendly by giving everybody a comfortable seat, there will always be people who prefer to drive around. The other issue is that local transit isn&#39;t always the fastest way to get across town depending on the route you&#39;re taking. In some cases, a car can go on a local freeway while a bus is restricted to local roads and stopping every few minutes to pick up passengers.<br><br>Definitely getting drivers to maintain a constant speed does more than improve the flow of traffic. A car cruising along instead of speeding up &amp; slowing down would improve fuel economy producing less Greenhouse gases. Drivers in sports car who are always tempted to accelerate a bit faster to get the Adrenalin up. The next major innovation is the self-driving car that is programmed to always drive close to the speed limit.<br><br>1 thing left out of the video that often interrupt the flow of traffic is car accidents.

Telling people to slow down/set cruise control during traffic jams will make traffic dramatically worse!<br><br>Think of it this way. In the example of cars driving in a circle, over time the inconsistencies in speed eventually add up to traffic coming to a complete stop. Lets say each fluctuation costs the flow of traffic 1mph of loss. If the cars start out going 60mph, it will take 60 fluctuations to get to 0mph. If they start at 30mph however then it would only take 30 fluctuations to get to 0mph. Now imagine if in the study all cars were told to go 30mph, except one driver was told to go 25mph. Instantly all cars are limited to 25mph, and the line of cars is that much closer to 0mph. That is what this video is telling us to do!<br><br>You mention &quot;block driving&quot; as helping, but I found it counter intuitive, so I tried researching it. I could find literally nothing about this actually occurring, let alone it actually helping the flow of traffic. The only thing that popped up was this video! Again, please delete this video.

They know how to make space and they know how to take space. adding a buffer zone sounds like a good idea and unfortunately in the Seattle area because of the drive and culture it&#39;s the only thing that could help unless we advised the public better on how to drive properly. if you can actually drive driving on someone&#39;s bumper is not a bad thing so long as you pay attention to the car in front of them and the car in front of them and the car in front of them and the cars on the sides of you as well as in front of them and behind them as well as the cars behind you and you know exactly where you are on the roadway.

It&#39;s a function of the fact that action is always faster than reaction, and is made worse by widespread poor driving technique.  In slowing traffic, the delayed reaction time of drivers farther back in line tends to eat up the space in front of them as traffic slows (especially if they were following too closely or not paying attention to begin with).  That space becomes smaller and smaller until traffic comes to a dead stop, very much like an accordion compresses, then extends, compresses, etc..  When you get up to the spot and discover there was seemingly nothing there to cause the stop to begin with or the problem was entirely on the other side of the road (&quot;rubber necking&quot;), the Accordion Effect is what happened.  <br><br>It&#39;s also made worse by two basic mistakes that many drivers make.  They fail to keep their &quot;eyes high&quot; as is taught in many (most?) basic drivers ed classes but is soon forgotten (or never learned) by many drivers.  So many drivers look no farther ahead than the back bumper of the car ahead of them (or less), so as traffic slows, it catches them by surprise.  They also fail to increase their gaze/focus distance as their speed increases. <br><br>Many drivers also far overuse their brakes. In fact, brakes are the &quot;go to&quot; default crutch of marginal drivers.  Something (anything) happens somewhere in front of them?  BRAKE!  About to make a lane change?  BRAKE!  Road not perfectly straight?  BRAKE!  Merging onto a highway?  BRAKE!  Confused about where they&#39;re going?  BRAKE!  Riding the bumper of the car ahead of them?  BRAKE!  Rushing up to a red light or stopped traffic that was visible for the last several thousand feet?  BRAKE!  Every few seconds for no apparent reason at all?  BRAKE!  On the other hand, drivers who use appropriate modulation of the gas peddle to manage their momentum  (aka &quot;speed averaging&quot;) combined with the &quot;eyes high&quot; technique to look far enough ahead of them to anticipate slowdowns or to increase speed slightly to make those green lights ahead, use their brakes 1/10th of the times of drivers who rely on their brakes as their primary control method.  The eyes high/speed averaging technique is far more efficient, decreases wear on the vehicle, and helps prevent the needless compressing of traffic (Accordion Effect).", "comment_date": "2016-08-12T21:29:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cedi", "comment_text": "This video didn&#39;t teach me how not to get stuck in traffic", "comment_date": "2016-08-12T21:24:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ibrokemymirror", "comment_text": "Really good sponsored video!

You have no control over whether the driver behind you chooses to create a buffer at all. Maintaining a constant speed, as I know this first hand, also does not work. I do drive at a constant rate of speed for dozens of reasons including it&#39;s less work, safer, keeps you from wasting gas, etc. Once again, it reaps no benefit if every isn&#39;t driving at that same pace. The public transit claim only reduces the &quot;traffic&quot; for those using it. I don&#39;t know about where you live, but here in Baltimore the bus drivers are completely oblivious to everyone not in the bus. Once more, taxi drivers are known for there belief that they own the streets and also replaces you, someone who is, hopefully, a capable and safe driver, with someone you&#39;ve never met in your life and one who is part of a population where the intelligent are severely outnumbered. The fact is (based of my experience driving for not on myself, but as my girlfriend&#39;s primary source of transportation), 49% of drivers travel at speeds no higher than the posted speed limit, 49% (who apparently REALLY need to take a shit BAD and pretend they&#39;re in a real-life version of Need for Speed) drive dangerously fast, and the remaining 2% are the actual good, capable, safe drivers. The ones that drive at a constant speed, are actually AWARE of the laws/rules of the road, remain aware of their surroundings, drive defensive, perform the minimum of maneuvers efficiently, make other drivers around them aware of the maneuver they wish to execute (i.e. USING TURN SIGNALS), coast instead of using the brake pedal/use brakes excessively, utilizing turning lanes/fast lanes/merging lanes properly, don&#39;t have headphones on, etc., etc., etc. There are simply TOO many responsibilities that come with driving an automobile for the average human or even American ever since the &quot;Idiocracy Effect&quot; passed the point in which the less intelligent became the majority of our population.

While you&#39;re at it, move closer to your work, this might be more expensive, but your time is valuable too, people underestimate the value of their time, and choose to live in a cheaper bigger home farther away, while experiencing a decreased quality of life from spending so long traveling.  And travel by bike.  And travel off peak times.  Now, I know EVERYONE has an excuse why they can&#39;t do this.  And some, maybe even most, really can&#39;t make these types of changes.  But many people could, and as pointed out, it only takes a small shift to make big changes in the traffic congestion.<br><br>Oh, and another thing, support smart growth plans, transit expansions, etc., that are designed to guide your region/local area into a denser smaller more sustainable area.  These areas are inherently better for transportation.<br><br>Last thing, don&#39;t put too much focus on traffic.  Here&#39;s an interesting question, would you rather spend 45 minutes commuting at rush hour, a trip that would take 20 minutes at midnight, or you would prefer a 2.5 hour commute at rush hour, that would take only 2.25 hours at midnight?<br><br>The first right?

Since everybody defines how a &quot;good&quot; driver is, most people can indeed be right in that they&#39;re a better driver according to their own criteria. This is not strange at all. Define a &quot;good driver&quot; and then ask people if they&#39;re better than average at this, and you might see other results. Is a good driver purely defensive? Accommodating to other drivers? Strictly safe with huge margins? Great at handling their car at the limit? Sufficiently safe when driving fast? Avoiding risks at all cost? It&#39;s all a trade-off, and there is no definition.<br><br>2. Highest throughput on a highway is around 70km/h. At this point, flow is at a critical point. Any disturbance, of any kind, leads to lower throughput which will not fix itself until new cars are added at a lower rate than the flow rate.
