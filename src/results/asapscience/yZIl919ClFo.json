Why not install the copper pipe tubing inside a 55 gallon steel drum, with both ends removed and the bottom capped in steel wire meshing, and the exterior then painted with the most BLACK paint on the market?<br>This tiny investment in a VERY incredible SUNLIGHT-ABSORBING paint, would significantly scale down the amount of biodegradables required to achieve the same end result.<br>In my past, I&#39;ve seen this method (55 gal steel drum) used in two ways, one method being similar to yours (but within a 55 gal steel drum) and the other, using fallen timber to burn inside the barrel, to heat a swimming pool and a hot tub. You can also run black tubing in a zig zag pattern atop your home and let the black casing of the tubing, in conjunction with the heat roof shingles absorb from sunlight, to heat circulating water within the tubing to heat your spa, hot tub or pool.<br>Work smarter...not harder bois ;) cheers", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T07:50:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Douch Mush", "comment_text": "So which one of them is the pile of shit?", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T13:13:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dj kim", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 wow!

There&#39;s one rule, never touch the outhouse except to go poo. hahaha! Everything else was okay. My grandparents didn&#39;t use wood, we would gather bricks and stones from the bonfire pit. My grandpa put copper wires on the bottom of the porcelain tub. We turned the tubs upside down when we were finishing using it. They were covered with a special blanket my grandma made for them.
