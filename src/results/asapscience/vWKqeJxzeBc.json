At least people should know they are aborting a baby, a life, not contents. Most abortions are a convenience. A true risk to a woman&#39;s life is both more rare and always treated as such, not as abortion. You might be suggesting the millions of abortions taking place are all a danger to health and life of the mother but the practice is largely for unwanted children, bad timing financially, too young, a career, and rape. I suggest it is never the fault of the life being formed, and if rape is the cause more healing can take place through the life of that child than does abortion. There are so many people who want a child and due to the high rate of abortion have to adopt from foreign countries. Give life a chance. Consider mistakes made to become pregnant and take responsibility, have faith that this life can be meaningful. Any later than four - five weeks is especially cruel to the fetus and does take a human life. It isn&#39;t any other. With a conscience and faith, a new life can become a gift, a blessing, regardless of money, job, age, circumstances. If a person has been given a life, don&#39;t take a life. How can we morn so deeply over a born child&#39;s death but see the life forming as nothing more than tissue, contents? How many great minds have been aborted? Our healers, philosophers, scientists, innovators, farmers, laborers, our very evolution of mankind. Are we not hastening our own demise on this planet with millions of abortions? I don&#39;t say it&#39;s unforgivable for those who regret and I don&#39;t judge anyone&#39;s decision but I suggest there is a better way to support those who cannot be the parent to the life created by the miracle of human life we have yet to acknowledge.", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T19:44:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OK", "comment_text": "Should the government have the legal right to force people to use their bodies against their will to save the life of another person?

I think that it should be punishable by law depending on what people are normally sentenced to be committing murder. If God says it&#39;s wrong, and that it&#39;s sin, and that it&#39;s murder, then why doesn&#39;t the U.S. respect that? God absolutely WILL punish anyone and everyone who takes an active part in abortion because the poor innocent baby feels pain and is forced to squirm and squirm trying to defend itself but yet is still not able to because of the doctor forcing the needle in or whatever tool the doctor forces into the baby that causes baby&#39;s death. How in the HELL can doctors be so EVIL??!!! Why do they take such pleasure in being the one who ends a baby&#39;s life? That makes me sick!! That there are doctors out there who ACTUALLY WANT to KILL babies by ABORTING them! I hope that there&#39;s a SUPER SUPER HOT place in HELL waiting for them!! Don&#39;t they know that ALL murderers are going to Hell?? And how can someone even think to tell me that abortion isn&#39;t murder? Well it IS murder because when the doctor keeps poking baby with needle or whatever horrific thing he&#39;s doing to force the baby to die, the baby CANNOT defend herself/himself and the mother has pretty much already sentenced her baby to death. I hope it haunts both the mother and the doctor and the nurses and everyone else who made it happen for the REST of their lives. As far as I am concerned, abortion is EVIL. God has a plan and purpose for EVERY baby. If you do not want the baby or are not ready to become a mother, then give the baby up for adoption but that should be the ONLY option. New technologies have made it more possible to ease the pain of giving birth like epidurals and stuff. You can give your baby up for adoption and then if you ever decide you want to meet him/her or contact him/her whenever you get your life back together then at least you have that option and then at least you don&#39;t have murdering  your baby on your conscience just because you weren&#39;t ready at the time of pregnancy. But God frowns heavily on those whose hands shed innocent blood and he WILL JUDGE those who are not sincerely REMORSEFUL for committing that sin.", "comment_date": "2022-05-23T01:10:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M Arendse", "comment_text": "Here&#39;s what actually happens when you have an abortion:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKv5ABgqPTw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKv5ABgqPTw</a>", "comment_date": "2022-05-22T19:46:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M Arendse", "comment_text": "So much euphemism it&#39;s sickening.", "comment_date": "2022-05-22T19:45:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GUNSjk", "comment_text": "Mother&#39;s Day Card: Thank you for not Aborting me Mom. <br><br>She laughed.", "comment_date": "2022-05-21T22:51:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charity Sims", "comment_text": "and he is not accurate in the first 2 months, at LEAST twice as much mothers dies from abortion than they do child birth", "comment_date": "2022-05-21T21:19:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sylvia isgod", "comment_text": "This is useless.

THATS why I am for abortions because boy or girl does not matter PLEASE save them from this awful world. No one deserves to have that chance of suffering. I lost everything I enjoyed in 2020 and I WISH I WAS ABORTED. I am not pro choice or pro life but pro abortion. If a woman does NOT have an abortion I hope they have a miscarriage because they failed at bringing a child into this awful world. I know its hard to get people to understand especially liberals lol. But I am for abortions 100% And I am greatful to ALL women who had one because they spared a child from this world. Thats why I was so happy yesterday about that Texas lady and her self induced abortion. It made my day because everything I said is coming true and women are taking matters into their own hands. :D Thank you all women who had an abortion. :D It always makes my day when a child is spared from this world.

They wish make it seem as if abortion is just a mechanical procedure. But of course it\u2019s not. Before a girl decides to have an abortion, she must consider the moral aspect of what she plans to do. <br><br>But pro-abortions group claim that there is no moral aspect to the decision, so no discussion is required. At issue is the question of whether a mother has the right to end a human life. So for the sake of illustration, let\u2019s say that the needs of the mother outweigh the needs of the unborn child. For example, a pregnant eighteen year old girl wants to go to college. She doesn\u2019t want to stay home with a baby for two reasons: First, she\u2019s not married. And second, college is considered to be an absolute feminist requirement, and a baby would just get in the way. Women believe that through the bureaucratic process of granting \u201ccredentials\u201d to millions of other women, the dream of a feminist world government can finally be achieved. <br><br>As a result, there\u2019s tremendous political pressure being placed on young girls to reject love, to reject marriage, and to reject children. The maternal instinct itself is the enemy of communism. So to counter this political threat, young ladies and young men will have to be trained in the joys of love and parenthood. But Washington will do anything to stop that from happening, so the public schools will be of no help. And here\u2019s the hard part: America has millions of women aged twenty to sixty, who have been carefully trained as communist agent provocateurs. Feminists. Those persons must be identified, and then neutralized. Only when when these professional dealers in hatred are gone, can we begin teaching the children about how good life can be. And when the children\u2019s eyes are opened to the beauty of our heritage, and our culture, and the enjoyment of life, then the maternal instinct will return, and abortion will be reserved only for blacks, and for women who have been identified with retarded embryos.", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T20:05:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Eric Son of John", "comment_text": "By &quot;contents&quot; you mean the  human being.", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T17:57:24Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "DanDCool", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a> Tee Hee \ud83d\uddff", "comment_date": "2021-11-10T09:01:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DanDCool", "comment_text": "pRo ChOiCe<br>Had to choose condoms :|<br>You can&#39;t just make a mistake on purpose then say nah i have a choice", "comment_date": "2021-11-10T08:57:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u8aa0", "comment_text": "What happens ?

Supporting my girls who get an abortion!! But my opinion on abortion is Abortion is about allowing woman the right to make choices about when they want to have children in relation to their age, financial stability &amp; relationship stability. It is the not the place of government to legislate against woman&#39;s choices. Raising a child is not easy and a lot of times kids end up in a super bad home. \u201c why don\u2019t you put the child up for adoption?\u201d Well because adoption is extremely abusive and toxic. Do y\u2019all know how many kids get abused in the foster care and adoptive familys?? I don\u2019t think a child should stuff that. I know I would rather be aborted than live in a shitty environment! Also I don\u2019t think sexual intercourse should be a punishment EVER. Why would some woman want to risk their body Heath and years of memories just to save someone they don\u2019t even know? Why should woman who aren\u2019t mentally stable have to go through an unwanted birth? Why should a woman in general be forced to give birth?? Woman aren\u2019t incubators! I believe the people who don\u2019t want an abortion should have the right to choose to keep the child. I also think woman who don\u2019t want a child should have the choice for aborting it! Also not to mention rape happens every day and millions get pregnant from it. Woman shouldn\u2019t have to keep an unwanted reminder for 9 painful months of that traumatic experience. Some kids get raped at a young age and if they I\u2019ve birth they will die. We need woman to have the choice!! People cry and complain ab abortion being legal in a lot of places instead of focusing on real world problems! It annoys me sm!! Especially when men think they have an opinion on woman\u2019s choice. But anyway I also as a woman can\u2019t make anyone keep or abort a child. That is not my decision for them. I can only make that decision for myself not others!!

In my childhood, my dad was very critical. Everything was about appearance to him. He constantly oogled women and made comments about their physical attributes to me, even when I was a little girl as young as 5 yo. So, I grew up thinking women were just objects for men&#39;s pleasure. I had very little sense of worth. My heart was \ud83d\udc94. I started battling depression in my teens and wanted to die many times. I developed a warped idea of food and eating, which of course led to an eating disorder. I let men use and abuse me. I had two abortions, one at 19, one at 20. I was a dark, broken, angry, bitter, mess, wrapped in a young woman&#39;s body and I plastered a smile on my face for public use so no-one knew the destruction inside. At 30, after going through a divorce from a narcissistic addict who cheated all the time, I was then a single mother of an 18 m/o. At that moment I reached my breaking point and realized I needed help. A friend, who truly cared, asked me why I didn&#39;t believe in God and Jesus Christ. I didn&#39;t have a good answer...it was simply that I felt I could only trust myself and I doubted there was a God when I looked at all the pain in the \ud83c\udf0e. Not long after our conversation, I heard the Gospel, which is the Good News that Jesus Christ came to earth 2000 years ago, fully God and fully man, to be the ultimate sacrifice for our sins, so that we could then be counted as God&#39;s children here on earth and then for eternity in Heaven. WHOA!! That blew me away....Jesus loves me (and you) so much that he allowed himself to be mocked, ridiculed, BEATEN, and HUNG BY SPIKES AND ROPE ON A \u271d, then he was brought back to life by God the Father after three days, spoke to his many disciples and then ascended to Heaven in his glorified body!!  AND, He did that as the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. All we need to do is believe he is alive, repent of our sins, and pursue him in prayer and in his WORD, the HOLY Bible. Abortion is a sin because its spilling the blood of the innocent lives God created. God wants to forgive us tho and that&#39;s why He sent Jesus. Since the moment I said yes to Jesus, he has given me SO much. He healed my \u2764 from all the pain and regrets of my life. No more depression or questions about my value. I&#39;m a new creation through Him, and because I chose Him, I&#39;m worthy of God&#39;s goodness. He gave me a new life... a new job, a new husband who loves me for me, not what I look like or what I can do for him, a new home, the $ ability to send my child to private school. He blessed me with a 4th child (2 in Heaven, 2 on earth), the college diploma I had worked for but had not received, work promotions/bonuses, and now I&#39;m blessed to be at home and care for my elderly mother and young child. The Lord gives me peace, love, kindness, joy, patience, comfort, strength, and goodness! The Lord is our great councilor if we&#39;ll let him. I&#39;ve never regretted choosing Jesus. He&#39;s waiting for you TODAY! He wants to heal you, love you, and be with you for eternity! If you don&#39;t know him, I challenge you to just ask Him... Jesus, are you real, are you alive, did you create me, is the Bible your word, etc.??? If you&#39;re sincere in your questions, he&#39;ll answer you. I pray you don&#39;t doubt when He answers you!

About an hour and a half later I still felt nothing and asked my friend for another hit of gel tabs, we went back to his home I started to feel a little strange but I had been high on marijuana before nothing really that out of the ordinary. We went to my so-called friends older sister&#39;s room at his parents house and he asked his sister for some marijuana to smoke, She also asked if we wanted some of that dust I did not know at the time that dust meant PCP. I wound up in a demonic dimension we&#39;re humans were golf balls on a rotating conveyor belt that dropped us onto a driving green. When it was my turn to be dropped from this machine I noticed that I was hundreds of feet high, I could feel the wind and I could hear the Roar of 2 horrible-looking Giants in late 1800 Scottish golf attire laughing at us. When I dropped I felt the G-Force like going straight down on a roller coaster and landed on the driving green. The red-haired giant which was approximately 500 or so feet tall looked at the dark-haired one laughed and drove me across a large Lake and I landed on an island green where I went into the hole for a hole-in-one. I then found myself in my friends kitchen where he turned into a demon in front of my eyes with green slime and sharp teeth his ears grew in his eyes turned yellow, also the dog in the room that was in a cage turn to a demon as well every time the Rottweiler barked it grew and grew and started to fill the entire room. I broke through his sliding glass window and ran down the street he said faster than he&#39;d ever seen anybody run in his life. While I ran I noticed that everything was getting darker, none of the houses had color anymore the trees were not green and The Lawns were not green anymore but everything turned Grey, then darker and darker. Then all of the sudden the lights turned out completely. I did not know at the time but I was in the place where the Bible speaks of the outer Darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. Unbeknownst to me fully at the time I was hit by a car and the EMS drivers picked me up in the ditch about a mile from my buddies house. My soul kept trying to return to my body and when it did I was inside an ambulance and they were asking me what I took and what happened and that I had been hit by a car. I remember my blood pressure being 210 / 180. Then all the sudden like a snap of a finger I was back in absolute utter Terror darkness and the only light was a light above my head with the perimeter around me up about 10 or so feet. I could see the Silhouettes and the eyes of the demons in the outer Darkness that could not penetrate the light but I understood their language and they were telling me they were going to rip me apart and laughed because I did not know Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. All of the sudden the light started to fade from around me and the perimeter got closer and closer to my body to the point where one of the Demons was able to get his claws upon my flesh and I could feel his hair he was a massive Beast. But because there was just a small amount of light it was like being on novocaine at the dentist you could feel pressure but no real pain. It was utter hopelessness and Terror indescribable. When you are in the Darkness you know the truth about everything nothing is hidden you have the mind of Christ and you understand where you are, why you&#39;re there and that you will never be able to leave for all eternity you are stuck there in torment. As the light was almost gone I remember falling to my knees and at this point the demons had me in Chains when I called out to the Lord Jesus Christ for the first time in my life truly. Then all the sudden the chains begin to break one by one. I got to the point I could get my legs out and start running towards this light and it was a light like I&#39;ve never seen brighter any light here in this world. I broke the chains and like a flash of lightning I wound up in an orb on a floating what looked to be operating table. To the right of me was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen and the only explanation was she was an angel. Her hair was gold and literally sang songs as she floated over to my bedside, she did not speak from her mouth but from her heart and she touched my shoulder very gently and said&quot;We have you now you are going to be just fine.&quot; The orb that I was in was approximately 15 feet wide by 8 feet tall. There was also a man on board, he was an African-American looking man very strong he did not say a word and as soon as I saw him I wept because every time I heard a racist song or friends said the n-word it came flooding back to my mind and I was truly convicted. He was looking up at like a screen and he was touching it like a touchscreen directing this orb. She looked at him in almost disbelief and said in the most gentle voice I&#39;ve ever heard,&quot;I can&#39;t believe we were actually able to save this one because he was so far gone!&quot;Then she took large needle-like Rod&#39;s that were rainbows and stuck them into both of my arms, at this time I could feel the force of gravity lifting us up at an accelerating rate. As we were accelerating up instead of blood total darkness came out of me blacker than any black I&#39;ve ever seen floating like when you see astronauts in so-called outer space all around the cabin of the orb. I understood that blood is the life and in the outer Darkness you do not have blood and you literally become the darkness. After all of the tar like blood came out of me like a flash the orb disappears and I&#39;m flying in a rainbow tunnel of light, next thing I know I&#39;m in the emergency room, they had cleared the entire right side of the floor and had a team surrounding me. I was in spirit form hovering looking down at me but not realizing that I wasn&#39;t in my body. I remember I had defecated on myself and a pretty young nurse was tasked to undress me and I was yelling at her but she couldn&#39;t hear me when I told her that &quot;I&#39;m okay look I&#39;m right here I&#39;m fine!&quot; I remember looking into the pupils of my eyes and I did not blink I remember how dilated they were that they had to put solution in my eyes every so often. I was able to look around the room across to the other rooms but I still didn&#39;t know I wasn&#39;t in my body so I was getting upset. I thought I was fine. All the sudden there were these men dressed in what I thought were potato bags but I now know is sack cloth robes with hoods. These men circled my bed with their arms crossed over their heart they began to what I can only assume was a prayer to put me back into my physical body. The next day I was in the recovery room and had EKG leads and IV tubes all over my body. And for about five seconds I knew all the secrets of the universe I remember getting out of bed and shouting to call our local newspaper because I have so much to say about everything in this world and the afterlife. But after just a Split Second all but a few memories vanished from my mind. I was drawn to the door and a little boy stopped at my door turned to me and without moving his lips like the angel in the orb told me this was my second chance. He smiled with a twinkle in his eye began to walk down the hallway once again. I wanted to thank him so I ripped my IVs and EKG leads off and was at the door in 3 seconds and the young boy was gone! I have never told this story on any social media platform before and some people might say it was just a bad trip. But I believe LSD and other hallucinogens open up doorways to demonic portals that may never be shut if you go so far down that rabbit hole like I was. I want no one not even my worst enemy to experience that level of Torment. Jesus Christ is the Way, he is the Truth and he is the Life, and no man or woman comes to the father without knowing Jesus Christ as their lord and savior. Please accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior before it&#39;s too late! Brothers and sisters we are not promised or guaranteed one more second on this Earth, do you know where you will go when you die? I have heard of fire and brimstone and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s such places but to be in utter darkness and despair with demons is unimaginable. I will share one of the truths I was able to take back with me, when a child dies in this world albeit tragically, untimely or by abortion those children become Warrior angels for the Kingdom of Heaven. In my open vision while I was in the Darkness I was standing at the precipice of a large pit with smoke coming out of it. Behind me was a red sky with mountains all around this crevasse. All the sudden the earth started to tremble around me and over the mountains there were what appeared to be shock waves that were sound coming down the mountain over me and down into the pit. As the sound grew louder I could hear the voices singing our God is an awesome God! After a period of time as the sound grew and grew I saw what appeared to be countless legions of children that were armored not unlike Spartan gladiators with wings and I knew that these children had perished early and they&#39;re being used as an Unstoppable Force against the enemy! Peace be with you all!

She wanted to keep her baby. She&#39;d be finished school by the time it was born anyway and it wouldn&#39;t stop her from attending college, becuase she knew that both her parents were pro life, like her and wouldn&#39;t want her to abort it. She also knew that her parents would help her take care of it, and she would be able to leave the baby with them when she was at college.<br>Jasmine,  however thought differently. She couldn&#39;t keep this baby, she would have to abort it. Her reason for doing this was that she was afraid her parents would disown her or physically hurt it if they found out. She didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go if they kicked her out. And if they physically hurt her, they&#39;d probably kill the baby anyway since it was so small (8 weeks gestation). <br>17 year old Julie and 15 year old Cora both came to the decision that they would keep their pregnancies, but not the babies. They would give life to them and then put them up for adoption.<br>When all the girls were 22 weeks pregnant they were out on a road trip. Julie got out of the car to use the bathroom at a gas station. Whilst the other three girls were waiting in the car, something terrible happened. A van crashed into the back of their car. Tragically, the airbag pressed right up against Amy&#39;s stomach, causing the placenta to disconnect. Her baby did not make it. <br>Jasmine hurt her stomach becuase of the airbag too, but there was no baby in there anymore, so no life was lost. She was alright.<br>Unfortunately tho, Cora was in the back seat and the airbags were broken, so no airbag protected her and the roof of the car caved in and hit her head. A bit of it bounced of her head and onto her stomach, Her baby went into distress. <br>When the girls got to the hospital, Amy already pretty much knew that her baby hadn&#39;t survived, and this was confirmed. Julie had followed Cora into her room in A and E. Out of the blue they asked her how far along Cora was. Julie asked &quot;why?&quot; They said &quot;Her baby is in distress, if it&#39;s at the age of viability, we need to deliver it now otherwise it will die. But if she hasn&#39;t hit the age of viability, We don&#39;t need to do anything&quot; Julie stared at the ultrasound as she could see the heart beat and the baby moving around. She told a white lie and said &quot;Well, Let me think. She&#39;s a week and a half ahead of me, she&#39;s 23 weeks, almost 24.&quot; They believed her and saved the baby. Amy, Jasmine and Julie went to see the baby 5 hours later. Amy was in bits that she&#39;d lost her baby. Jasmine however, was seemingly coping well, until she saw Cora&#39;s baby. She listened as Julie explained how she&#39;d told a white lie about how far along Cora was to make them save the baby, how she&#39;d saw the baby move on the scan. Then she made the comment, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I had to lie to have them save it, it&#39;s clearly a baby and it&#39;s alive and somewhat well now. And to think, there is no biological difference between this baby and the one inside me. Babies the same gestational age as Cora&#39;s can legally be aborted even though they have the potential to survive, like hers if born.&quot; That was the last straw for Jasmine. She left the room in tears. All she could think was &quot;There would be no biological difference between that baby and mine, if mine was still here. But it&#39;s not. Why did I do this???&quot; Unfortunately tho, it was too late for Jasmine. Her reason for having an abortion was understandable of course, but now she regretted it. And there was now nothing to do but continue to regret it, forever. <br>Cora ended up changing her mind about adoption, she decided she wanted to keep it with her family once she saw the baby, 3 weeks after it was born. She was able to find out it was a girl and she had that chance of changing her mind. A choice that Jasmine never got becuase she had an abortion. <br>Julie stuck with her decision to give the baby up for adoption when it was born 18 weeks later. But she was still able to find out the gender, it was a boy. This was another choice Jasmine never got. She will never know what gender her baby would have been had it been able to develop enough to have one. She could only guess.<br>Amy had a rainbow baby 6 years later. (Which just so happen to also be when Cora moved out of home with her now 6 year old daughter.) Even though this was an option that was open for Jasmime, she felt she didn&#39;t deserve another child because she&#39;d chosen to have her first child aborted. When she was in her late 20s, She decided to foster, so that she could help as many kids as possible, to make it up to herself for doing what she did. <br>Wow, thank you for reading all that.

No harm would have been produced and women could leave procedures without worries.  Ultimately, the pro-life community would look stupid, but they would have nothing to lose. However, if pro-life individuals were correct in the abortion debate, people who were pro-choice would have to accept that abortion is killing innocent lives. Pregnant women would \u201close\u201d nine months. They would have to carry their pregnancies to full term and once the baby was born, they would have the choice to keep the child or give the child up for adoption. People would have to accept that every abortion that has ever happened was the unjust killing of an innocent baby\u2019s life.

Not really making a case for abortion but I&#39;m going to give the actual facts of making abortion legal vs illegal. If you make abortions illegal truth is abortions won&#39;t stop just because you make it illegal it just makes it more unsafe. Countries that make abortion illegal actually have similar abortion rates to those that make it legal. Another fact is in the US abortion is a dying out trend basically and Democrats actually make abortion rates go down faster than Republicans because Democrats are pro birth control and actually have solutions to lower abortion rates while Republicans want to make abortion illegal and make birth control harder to get meaning more reason to have an abortion. Like I said making abortion illegal doesn&#39;t change abortion rates. However though would you rather let abortions be preformed by a trained doctor with proper medical equipment or would you rather have it preform in a motel with by an unlicensed person with limited equipment. That is what abortion being legal vs illegal actually means. And I know someone will probably say something like oh you want to get aborted. But really if I did feel pain and my mom did decide to abort me I would rather it be safe and quick rather than hard work and a long and painful process. I wouldn&#39;t be able to decide for my mom and I can agree with that. But if an abortion is going to happen it might be best that a doctor who knows what their doing does it rather than some unlicensed untrain person that my mom met just to get an abortion. Not trying to make a stance for or against abortion but the real truth is there&#39;s really nothing you can do.

Women die from abortions all the time, but it&#39;s covered up because abortion and the selling of baby body parts and organs is a HUGE Billion dollar a year business.  Planned murderhood gives huge contributions to the democrap party (Bill Clinton first legalized partial birth abortion and abortion up to the day of birth) and have judges and politicians on their boards.  Highly unethical but true.  \r<br>\r<br>Truth be told, what happens in an abortion is this. \r<br>\r<br>A totally unique and complete little boy or girl is cruelly murdered by their very own &quot;mom&quot; and dad instead of being loved by them. \r<br>\r<br>An entire human lifetime is stolen from someone who is no different than the person reading this right now.  The poor little victim has their entire lifetime stolen from them, and never gets to be held in a loving mother&#39;s arms or say &quot;I love you, mommy.&quot;  Nothing. Dead is FOREVER.   \r<br>\r<br>Because a complete and unique human life exists at CONCEPTION. This is scientific FACT. \r<br>\r<br>It does not matter whether you murder your child and steal their entire life at 6 days or 6 months after conception.   \r<br>Because the end result is EXACTLY the same. \r<br>\r<br>Your innocent and defenseless child still ends up DEAD.  FOREVER.  \r<br>\r<br>And you will forever be the mother of a dead child.   \r<br>\r<br>What this video also doesn&#39;t tell you is that a heartbeat can be detected by 16-18 days after conception.  Before most women even know that they are pregnant.  So abortion ALWAYS stops a beating heart and a life. \r<br>\r<br>By 8 weeks (1st trimester) your baby has ALL the organs he/she will have as an adult.  Not fully developed, but there.  Which is why baby body parts are taken and sold even from babies this young.  \r<br>\r<br>And as early as 8 weeks, the baby will release the EXACT SAME ENZYME in response to pain that an adult does.  That&#39;s right.  The nervous system has to be there for a heartbeat to exist.  And there is no way to tell how much pain a baby this young feels.  We only know that even at 8 weeks, pain is felt. \r<br>\r<br>And if you want to watch an actual abortion of a little girl at 11.5 weeks (still first trimester) watch the &quot;silent scream abortion&quot; on youtube.  You can clearly see this poor little girl desperately trying to escape the abortionists tools, her heartbeat getting faster and faster as she tries to swim and twist away, and you can see the &#39;silent scream&#39; on her face as she is torn apart. \r<br>\r<br>The truth is, ANY abortion is brutal, barbaric, cruel and totally lacking in any mercy, compassion, kindness, human empathy or love.   An adult is supposed to take responsibility for their actions without making someone else pay for them just so they can get off the hook.  \r<br>\r<br>Adoption is so easy nowadays, with pregnancy centers in every town who can find adoption parents before your child is even born.  Or help you keep your child.  There is just no excuse for acting like a sociopathic, selfish little coward.  \r<br>\r<br>Human life is a precious thing.\r<br>\r<br>6", "comment_date": "2020-12-17T16:22:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nevermore", "comment_text": "IF YOU ARE PREGNANT AND READING THIS REGARDLESS OF IF YOU PLAN ON GETTING AN ABORTION OR CARRYING TO TERM DO NOT GO TO A CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTER!

What&#39;s abortion, the premeditated killing of a baby by his mother. So therefore abortion=murder. Case closed. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to realize that. Also just because I&#39;m helping you get out of this set &quot;hate&quot; mob mentality does not mean you can use your hurt ego to clap back, because well, you ain&#39;t got nothing to clap back with, your just using misinformation and that&#39;s facts!", "comment_date": "2020-11-29T08:27:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "alysha benit", "comment_text": "The audacity of some women, who believe that abortion is okay is humongous!

I suffered from HIV for 2years, but with the help of Dr Eguabor herbal medicines,i was cured within some few weeks of drinking the herbs he sent to me through courier delivery service. This same doctor also cured my Aunty from herpes.

Have you tried herbs before?. You have spent so much money on drugs,injections, etc and yet you have no good result to show for it. Dr Eguabor is a herbalist doctor,i believe he can help you if you can follow his instructions and drink his natural herbs.

We believe in obedience to Him unto salvation, Hebrews 5:9.<br><br>Salvation is not a one step, one stop process. Salvation is something that is a multi-component process. The first step is to believe in Jesus, John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a> as well as believe in the Gospel. Believing in Jesus to be saved is the very initial part, as well as accepting Him, John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a>, John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=17m20s\">17:20</a>. But obedience must follow after that initial belief immediately followed by true repentance, Luke 13:3, Mark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a>. Those who do not believe will be damned, John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=3m36s\">3:36</a>. Even the devil and demons believe in Jesus as well, James <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=2m19s\">2:19</a>. Thus, a true believing in Jesus is something continuous, as it is written with the Greek word in John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a> for believing. Jesus is the Word made flesh, John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=1m14s\">1:14</a>. Jesus is the Word of God, John 1:1. Jesus is also the Creator of all things, John 1:3. So if one believes in the Word, that means what the Word says, one will obey. If one disobeys what the Word says, how can there be any true belief there? The belief therefore is in vain. If one truly believes in Jesus, the Word, one will live out what the Word teaches.\u00a0<br><br>The Gospel is more than Jesus dying on the cross and rising. This is only a part of the full Gospel message. The Gospel is the wisdom of God for us to learn and abide in. Jesus came to teach us this wisdom personally, Micah 4:2. There is no sin in His wisdom. So if we choose to follow Him, we choose to adopt His wisdom as well as live by it, Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=10m38s\">10:38</a>, Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=16m24s\">16:24</a>-25. Jesus commands His Apostles to go and teach everything He commands, Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=28m20s\">28:20</a>. Jesus did not tell them to go and teach what Peter or any other apostle commands. He strictly has the perfect wisdom of God to the fullest, again, which is why He never sinned.\u00a0<br><br>If we continue in sin there remains no more atonement for us on the cross, Hebrews <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=10m26s\">10:26</a>. For knowing the Bible is not enough, we must also put the Gospel into practice in order to enter the kingdom, Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=7m21s\">7:21</a>. If we truly love God, we will keep His commandments, John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=14m15s\">14:15</a>. Paul reiterates that we must repent and do the works worthy of repentance Acts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=26m20s\">26:20</a>. This repentance is for everyone and was first preached by John the Baptist in Matthew 3:8. So both the Apostles in the New Testament and John the Baptist preaching to the people of Israel under the law still are required to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance. Jesus defines repentance as turning from sin as well as a change of mind, both, not one nor the other. Jesus says Nineveh would have repented at the preaching of Jonah. Then looking to Jonah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a>, we see how Ninevah repented. They did not simply have a change of mind only, but they also had a change of works as it says they turned from their wicked ways.\u00a0<br><br>We believe in being saved by grace which is through faith, and that faith without works is dead faith, James <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=2m14s\">2:14</a>-26. Jesus is the author of our faith, Hebrews 5:9, and His faith was filled with works that pleased the Father, not men, not flesh. Jesus had the perfect faith that always pleased the Father, John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=8m29s\">8:29</a>, Revelation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=14m12s\">14:12</a>. Grace, with respect unto salvation, is the opportunity to repent. Without true repentance, no grace will save anyone. Ephesians 2:8-9 by Apostle Paul says &quot;we are saved by grace through faith, and this is the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast.&quot; Nearly always when Paul mentions works in the New Testament he is referring to the works of the law as well as Jewish traditions not found in the 613 Mosaic laws but were considered in that culture and society as law. For instance, the priests questioned why Jesus and His followers did not wash their hands before eating. This was not in the 613 Mosaic laws but was a tradition the priests added into their culture/religion. Thus, Paul is referring to dead works or works of the flesh in Ephesians 2:8-9. Obeying Jesus is not part of the Old Testament law. Jesus gave new commands such as &quot;Love one another as I have loved you, this is a new command I give you.&quot; There are many detailed teachings from Jesus we must abide by if we truly are in Him, which Paul confirms in 1 Timothy 6:3. We must abide in the teachings of Jesus as He, Paul, and the other Apostles taught. This is the will of the Father, Matthew 17:5.\u00a0<br><br>In the Old Testament they were under the law. They were dead on the spot or had to pay a pentalty for their sins on the spot. Now we are under grace. This means we have the precious opportunity to repent, but if we do not do our part and do such or overcoming our sins, we will taste the second death then, Rev <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=2m11s\">2:11</a>. The blood of Jesus, through His death, burial, and resurrection, is what we need. Because the Son obeyed the Father perfectly, His blood was shed for the remission of sins. And because of His perfect obedience to the Father, the Father accepts the Son&#39;s request to have mercy on us. That&#39;s why Jesus is the only mediator between God and man, 1 Timothy 2:5. So now the Father wants us to obey His Son, Matthew 17:5, Hebrews 5:9. This forgiveness for our past and present sins is made available freely, for salvation is a free gift that cannot be earned Ephesians 2:8-9. This means there is nothing one must do in order to be forgiven by the Father. Christ paid the price for us in order to receive that forgiveness. But moving forward, we must maintain that by obeying our new Master, Christ, no longer sin. For we cannot serve two masters, Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=6m24s\">6:24</a>. Christ was prophecied in the Old Testament as the &quot;Redeemer.&quot; To redeem us through His precious blood, means He purchased us out of spiritual slavery that is sin and death, for the wages of sin is death, Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a>. He then is our new Master whom we must abide in, no longer willful sin.", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T02:42:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sa", "comment_text": "her body her choice,,, full stop", "comment_date": "2020-10-30T23:01:15Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "teferi fenti", "comment_text": "&quot;remove the contents&quot; lol", "comment_date": "2020-10-30T20:23:31Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Adriana", "comment_text": "pro-life blm and Biden 2020. fight me", "comment_date": "2020-10-30T06:36:59Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Eli Kim", "comment_text": "They say \u201ccontents of the uterus\u201d.

I&#39;m sorry but you did not explain what abortion is at all, which was the entire purpose of this video. If you actually did explain what it is, it would be too graphic and disturbing that it would probably get you demonetized. An abortion is ending the life of an unborn child, many times it involves ripping the innocent child&#39;s tiny little body into hundreds of pieces. Your video is full of happy cartoons, euphemisms and vague terms like &quot;the contents of the uterus&quot;... I think you mean the BABY? Say it like it is if you&#39;re claiming to be &quot;real science&quot;. And if you were real science, you would admit that life begins at conception because there is no arbitrary line of when a life suddenly gains intrinsic value without it contradicting a life outside the womb. For example, is it when the baby has a heartbeat? Because many people cannot survive without a pacemaker because their heart cannot beat on its own. Is it when the baby becomes &quot;viable&quot;? Because many cannot survive without being on life support. Is it when they no longer depend on someone else in order to survive? Because in that case, a 2-year old child has no more value than a 1 week-old fetus. Some adults cannot survive without constant care or depending on someone else. Many disabled individuals cannot physically express themselves any more than an unborn child can. So is it okay to kill them too because it&#39;s an inconvenience for those around them to care for them? Of course not. Why is an unborn child called a baby if the mother wants her but called a &quot;clump of cells&quot; or a &quot;parasite&quot; if the mother doesn&#39;t want her? So your child&#39;s life only matters if you <i>decide</i> it does? No. You cannot have it both ways. Your child&#39;s life matters, no matter what. You cannot end someone else&#39;s life because it inconveniences you for 9 months. Deal with it. If you don&#39;t want your own child that badly, give it up for adoption, end of story. &quot;Oh but that child&#39;s life will be awful if they go through foster care!&quot; Oh okay, so they shouldn&#39;t be put in foster care because they may suffer but killing them is okay? They can&#39;t experience any hardships, but they can be killed? Right, makes perfect sense. Many MANY happy and successful people have come from less privileged upbringings and have wonderful lives. You do not get to decide whether or not they get to live that life. I don&#39;t care what you say, EVERY child has the right to their own life. It&#39;s not your body that grows inside your uterus, it&#39;s an entirely different person than you, and you do not have the right to take their life away from them. It&#39;s not about &quot;your right to choose&quot; to go through only 9 MONTHS of being uncomfortable, it&#39;s about giving a baby their right to 80+ YEARS of life, which they so absolutely deserve.", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T03:45:34Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Freya Sunfire", "comment_text": "Why does he say content, u mean baby?", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T01:23:57Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Scorpion", "comment_text": "So, do you wanna show us actual footage of an abortion?

If anyone reading this has had an abortion, know that Jesus loves you and will wash away your sin through His blood if you repent and follow Him. If you are thinking about getting an abortion remember that you are strong, and I encourage you, if you cannot afford a child financially or are too young etc., to please give your baby up for adoption because that baby will be a blessing to the world because God has a plan for your child.

We panicked, as we didn&#39;t feel &quot;ready&quot; to be parents - even though my dream is to be a mother. My husband said that we should terminate the pregnancy and try again when the time was right. We sought abortion counselling from a family planning clinic and were also assured that the abortion would have no affect on my future fertility - as this was a huge concern of mine.

I expressed this to my husband who simply told me that my fears were not justified and it would all be okay.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>Immediately following the abortion I was overcome with regret. This manifested into depression and suicidal thoughts. Over the following months I started to deteriorate physically and mentally. I was having increasing pelvic pains and new that something wasn&#39;t right. Finally I found answers, after being brushed off by many doctors. And last month I had surgery which found that I was suffering from a pelvic infection (most likely caused by the abortion) and also riddled with endometriosis.

My mind spins in circles thinking about how much I regret the past, how much I hate the present and how much I fear the future.

Do people think that having an abortion is some magical time machine where every one pretends you were never pregnant and didn&#39;t just kill your own child? That&#39;s not how it works. If you have an abortion you better believe that that memory and regret and pain will follow you around your entire life, especially on a certain day every year. Yes the would-have-been birth day of your dejected child. For those considering abortion, it will not end your pain. Be the hero instead. Use the gift of adoption instead, then you can have that sweet feeling of peace continually with you instead, especially every year on their birthday.

He seems be suggesting that the life of the child in the womb is of less worth than that of the mother. All living beings are endowed worth by our Creator. <br>Where does human worth originate? From where do we all derive our value? Do our parents give us our worth so that if they believe ill of me I&#39;m nothing?\u00a0 How about society? Well, to use a quite extreme example, in Nazi Germany, the life of the Jews was deemed as not worth as much as the flourishing of Germany (as they blamed all the post WWI issues in Germany on the Jewish people). Now, the holocaust is remembered as an utterly horrible and ghastly atrocity showcasing the worst conclusion of pure materialism. What worth does anyone have if we are all purely a product of time, matter and chance? Since there is no absolute point of reference for worth (in materialism) then the power to place relative worth on others is in the hands of the strong. As a black man, if I lived in pre-1900 United States, my life would be deemed by that society as not worth as much as a white man&#39;s at an institutional and even personal level. My goal is not to compare the holocaust to the plight of the black man in rather my goal is to point out that the outcry and moral position the majority of the collective now takes on both issues speak to assumption of a robust, instrinic worth that humans possess is not grounded in neither society or other people.

Wade was decided.&quot;<br><br>Those who offer the unsafe abortion argument frequently appeal to examples outside of the United States. They point to some countries (such as many in Africa) that prohibit abortion and experience high maternal mortality rates and to other countries (such as most in Europe and North America) that permit abortion and boast low mortality. They infer from this correlation that laws against abortion cause a high incidence of maternal death. But that&#39;s a fallacy.<br><br>The highest-mortality nations are developing countries with poor maternal health care; the lowest-mortality nations are developed countries with advanced maternal health care. This is true irrespective of abortion policy. Some countries, for example, permit abortion and have high rates of mortality because their health care system is lacking. Other countries prohibit most abortions and have very low rates of maternal death (often lower than that of the U.S.).

Not just any body but your CHILD. Now I understand that there are some cases where it must be done, and I think if the pregnancy is life threatening to the mother or baby it should be allowed. But this should be detected as early as possible to spare the fetus the pain it will endure. Also, I&#39;m unsure of the exact number, but less than 5% of abortions happen because of a rape or for a medical reasons. The rest are just for people&#39;s convenience. Read the article then tell me if going through a pregnancy is worse than FORCING another human being to go through those procedures. It is so so wrong, and even more screwed up that there is no information on it. Please start treating the fetus as a human life. I bet if more people thought that way everyone would be pro life.

Never, ever, in any place, even if the universe repeats itself infinitely many times, that wonderful creation of life in its fetus can be combined again. As you will understand, when you calmly meditate on this, the very decision to end the life that is being formed from your own life is a decision that it is not for us to make. That little baby has his own rights that we older people have to enforce because if that were not the case, nobody will be able to safeguard his life, so fragile and helpless.

Jan 9, 2019. Everything is unfolding just as the bible<br>foretold. Wars, Volcanic Eruptions, Earthquakes, Extreme Weather, Christian<br>Persecution, Violence and more! I was told by Jesus to tell you. You are<br>special, it is not your fault, the world is falling apart. Its unfixable by<br>human hands. The Rapture is soon, we are in extended time now. All answers to<br>your problems and \u00a0spiritual growth and<br>direction lie in Jesus here. Much is on Youtube already. Liebesbrief von Jesus<br>- Loveletters from Jesus. Or PDF Dump below. Rejoice for our King is Coming. <br><br><br><br><br><br>FINAL WARNING FROM FATHER GOD<br>YAHUAH THE GREAT I AM This particular message is<br>one from Father, Yahuah Himself. For most of my ministry, Father has spoken<br>about His heart along with future events related to prophecy. Although He<br>continues to warn those walking in disobedience to repent, He is not often<br>extremely hard in tone or presentation. Remember, however, He is just, and He<br>is Almighty, and nothing exists outside of Him. This is a message that I wish I<br>did not have to write, however, in my obedience to Him and His words in<br>Ezekiel, I will write it. My prayer is that is saves at least one soul from<br>eternal damnation and separation from Father. There will always be mockers and<br>scoffers and those who disagree with what is written here, but it matters not<br>to me. My entire existence and purpose is to draw souls to Him and call men to<br>repentance. Please pray for discernment, and ask if it is your responsibility<br>to share this, whether anonymously or not, with those you know who are in this<br>group Father is referring to. When you know truth, you are accountable for it.<br>This message is for those living in willful sin. Let these words be a reminder<br>to all who are still partaking of the world, in whatever manner, whether they<br>are confessing to be followers of Yahushua or not. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Daughter,<br>it is your Father speaking to you. It is I, the Great I AM. Do not be afraid to<br>speak My words. I speak a most dire warning to all the inhabitants of the<br>earth. I speak to anyone who has NOT heeded My previous warnings- those whose<br>eternal destiny is damnation. Listen to your Father! Listen to the One who gave<br>you the breath of life! Your failure to respond and repent from your wicked and<br>sinful ways will cost you eternity! You know not of that which you will face<br>when the breath of life is taken from you and your soul leaves your body.<br>You who have ignored the continuous and countless ways I have desperately<br>presented truth to you. You who continually and repeatedly choose the desires<br>of your flesh over the food I offer for your spirit. You who act and live as if<br>you can serve God and mammon with no accountability. The eyes of your soul<br>feast on murder, anger, rage, fear and death; fornication, idolatry and lust of<br>every kind fill your eyes, minds and your ears everyday. You do not even know<br>the meaning of the word compromise. You entertain yourselves by feasting on<br>blood and death. Therefore, I will give you over to your desires. I will not<br>save you who do not want to be saved. You give your allegiance<br>and are in covenant with another by the willful sin you allow to perpetuate. Do<br>you have any idea what you are doing? To give allegiance to any other god but<br>Me is certain death. Eternal death. I will not protect you or keep you from the<br>hour of trial coming imminently upon the earth when you feed from his table,<br>the table of the enemy. I am holy and I am just, and you walk<br>with no intercessor, My Son Yahushua to plead your cause or to intercede on<br>your behalf. Judgment is here and you will stand alone, naked in your sin,<br>filthy and repulsive in the presence of the Great I AM, and you will already be<br>judged by your words, deeds and actions and your refusal to live a life of<br>holiness and obedience. Your witchcraft will not save you then. What witchcraft<br>is this you ask, in your vanity and your pride? It is the vile and filthy<br>things that fill your lives. You dine with devils. You invite darkness in at<br>every turn and darkness will be your abode eternally if you do not repent. You<br>have given the enemy permission to enter all aspects of your lives and he finds<br>his dwelling place already within you. I created My people and<br>breathed My breath into you in order for you to glorify and reflect Me. Your<br>agreements with satan and the permissions you have given him will turn your<br>vessels from that which I desired to be used for My glory- vessels of honor,<br>into that which satan will use to destroy you. Do you hear what I am saying?<br>Because he cannot create and needs an army to inhabit to wage war on My<br>righteous ones, you will be used as his instrument, instead of you being My<br>instrument. The moment in which he and his demons are plunged<br>from My Kingdom and cast to this earth, he will be desperate for a physical<br>place of habitation. Those who are not walking with Me will be those he then<br>completely inhabits. Why do you think My warnings have been shouted so urgently<br>now? Because that time is imminently upon you, and then satan will have his<br>army, and literally, all of hell will be loosed on this planet. This world has never<br>seen anything like this before- an unimaginable and purely evil army of<br>darkness and death, countless in numbers, hunting down those they may devour.<br>Why would I warn and warn as I have, if I didn\u2019t wish any would perish?<br>But when that moment of fulfillment of My words are here, you do not want to be<br>one that is not completely covered by the blood of My Son\u2019s sacrifice, because<br>then, it is too late, and your fate is sealed. Are these words<br>harsh for you? Or do you laugh them away as you have in the past? Do you<br>suppose they are being penned by an insane writer who has lost all sense of<br>rationality? Do you have the courage to remain in your wickedness<br>and find out if indeed these words speak truth? Mocking the messenger of these<br>words is only mocking Me.This may be the last time you hear these words.<br>WHO DO YOU SERVE THIS DAY??? YAHUAH GOD THE<br>FATHER.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.heartdwellers.org/all-pdf-files.html\">https://www.heartdwellers.org/all-pdf-files.html</a> Jesus is returning! Do you know Him? Jesus is God in flesh<br>form. Jesus was born of a virgin. He died on a cross to save us from our sins.<br>He led a perfect life to be the perfect sacrifice for you and me. He<br>resurrected three days later to show His power over death! Jesus is the only<br>way to Heaven. Time is short. Accept Jesus offer of salvation today. Here are<br>the ABC&#39;s for becoming a Christian. A - Admit Admit to God that you are a<br>sinner. Repent, turning away from your sin. &quot;For all have sinned, and come<br>short of the glory of God.&quot; Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=3m23s\">3:23</a> B - Believe<br>that Jesus is God&#39;s Son and accept God&#39;s gift of forgiveness from sin.<br>&quot;While we were sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; Romans 5:8 C \u2013 Confess.<br>Confess your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord. &quot;If you will<br>confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and believe in your heart<br>that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&quot; Romans 10:9 After a<br>person admits to God that he or she is a sinner, repents and believes that<br>Jesus is God&#39;s Son sent to die to pay for the sins of the world, and confesses<br>that faith in Jesus, they are now a Christian and knows Jesus as their Savior.<br>Repentance, properly defined, is necessary for salvation. Biblical repentance<br>is changing your mind about Jesus Christ and turning to God in faith for<br>salvation (Acts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqeJxzeBc&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a>). Turning from<br>sin is not the definition of repentance, but it is one of the results of<br>genuine, faith-based repentance towards the Lord Jesus Christ. Here is a prayer<br>you can pray to God if you like. Dear God, thank You for choosing to love me! I<br>know I am a sinner. I believe You sent Your Son, Jesus Christ, to die for my<br>sins. I believe He rose again and lives today. Today, I repent and turn away<br>from my sin. Thank You for Your wonderful love and for changing my life<br>forever.

If you start arguing then go away, this is a disclaimer. <br><br><br><br>I am neither pro life OR pro choice. I&#39;m pro circumstance. If, for example, the abortion was due to a health reason (about 4% from my source) then duh, it&#39;s obviously gonna be excused. If it&#39;s due to rape (it&#39;s probably not, less then 1%) and the person is young meaning the child would go through months of pain and hours of labor just for the baby to probably be adopted, it&#39;s still really, really sad but it&#39;s be called for.

The doctors also told me that because of my condition right now, as I am not fully recovered, I couldn&#39;t carry out the pregnancy for much longer, they told me the risk of me dying even during the first two trimesters is extremely high and the only logical option was abortion.

So let me explain how I see this from my point of view. <br><br>1.&quot; The Baby is a living person&quot;<br>To me people consider a impregnated womb a living person. This confuses me however  because yes it CAN turn into a human but to me it just isn&#39;t. Let me make an analogy to further elaborate my view. If you are an engineer creating machines and you create the outline of a phone(fertilized egg) which can further be grown and enhanced by fundings and aid from the company(Parent). Unfortunately though the comany can&#39;t fund the project anymore due to financial issues, the project is cut(Abortion). Now how does that relate to an abortion? Well, in my eyes the fertilized egg has POTENTIAL to be a functioning human being. You would consider a wheel a bike or a piece of paper a book; but as you add on and develope it, it becomes a fully developed item.  <br><br>2. &quot;The child has no say in the matter&quot; <br><br>Now this reason is where is get controversial as it&#39;s extremely objective. To me though, i&#39;m extremely practical so the overall population is more important than a potential life(Look to first reason as to why I sat potential). Bringing a whole new person into existence to a family unprepared and struggling only makes the childs life worse. Adoption doesn&#39;t work as about 100,000 kids are left unadopted each year leaving them to feel unwanted. This also adds one more person to the already over populated earth(may sound messed up but small amounts add up over time.) Lets say the parents keep the child? Well now the parentd are struggling to take care of a child and will probably lead to an abusive or at the very least stressful relationship.  <br><br>3. Heres my last point just from a biological stand point. We have feelings and emotions and most people dont want to see a baby be killed. However why is this life so important. What universal reason justifies his/her existence? &quot;We all deserve to live&quot; is a common  statement but thats your empathy talking because we all fear death. We all fear pain. Its confusing to me how people would let an unborn child be more valuable and protected when people die all around us. No one thinks about it, no one does anything. Soldiers, citizens, animals all killed with no say in the matter or chance. Its like they were &quot;aborted&quot;.  Why do so many people weigh a babie&#39;s life over others. Would you kill an unborn baby or Donald Trump. An umborn baby or Hitler. Most people would pick the unborn child but are blind or in to much denial to admit they were unborn children too. Would you abort them and why? Why would there value change because of their actions. Every view is objective and thats why im sharing mine to get an insight knowledge on how other people think. Thankyou for reading and please tell me your view so I can expand my knowledge and get to know your point of view.", "comment_date": "2019-02-15T01:34:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Taylor Atwell", "comment_text": "JESUS IVE ALREADY RANTED DOWN 3 ARGUMENTS AND IM ONLY 15 COMMENTS DOWN AHHHH", "comment_date": "2019-02-15T01:27:21Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Uzair Ahmed", "comment_text": "YOU CANT ABORT WHAT U CANT CATCH <br><br><b>FLASH BABY RUNNING</b>", "comment_date": "2019-02-15T01:20:39Z", "likes_count": 302}, {"comment_by": "Enma Mallqui", "comment_text": "Abortion:<br><b>Basically Fetus Deletus</b>", "comment_date": "2019-02-15T01:11:27Z", "likes_count": 2279}, {"comment_by": "Milk", "comment_text": "There are more comments saying the comments will be bad than bad comments.", "comment_date": "2019-02-15T00:44:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hey There", "comment_text": "No there are 100,000 deaths for every 100,000 abortions", "comment_date": "2019-02-15T00:39:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cimone Harris", "comment_text": "Disgusting!!!", "comment_date": "2019-02-15T00:35:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "plorykiss", "comment_text": "Why is it that when a pregnant woman is killed the killer is charged for killing two people?

I can tell you about two incidences that really educated me on pre-born life...  The first was what happened to a baby bird when my neighbor&#39;s cruel son dashed it&#39;s egg on the concrete at my house....   I rushed to stop him, but I was too late, the tiny bird, fully formed, gasped for breathe &amp; writhed for at least 5 minutes.  I was helpless to save the poor thing, so I just watched with sadness.  That was a forced evacuation but no scraping and suctioning or pulling involved......    Then the second, was once when I had chickens, I had apparently skipped an egg (from another day) in the nest box when I collected the eggs for the day.  How do I know this egg was sitting there for a while?  Because when I cracked it into the frying pan, I saw the chic moving in the yolk. I grabbed a spoon quick as I could to pull it out.  It was only has big as a 1/4 of an inch long, yet it&#39;s beak, feet, and eye were clearly visible and the body vigorously moved, the beak opening and closing. When it died, it melted into the yolk and was hardly visible except for the eye, which was black.  I felt sooooooo bad. Another forced evacuation, and I had been the cause of ending it&#39;s life, there was no way to put it back together.....  ..... These two incidences in my own life showed me without a doubt how marvelously formed pre-born or pre-hatched creatures are.... They are precious and alive...The same as a human pre-born is....... ...

So you\u2019ve got a little under 9% of these last trimester abortions going on because the parent decided that the child was inconvient. Doesn\u2019t that seem at least a little morally wrong to you? At this point the baby can suck it\u2019s thumb and kick and not to mention it has had a separate dna set and blood type from the mother the whole time so I think we can throw away the \u201cmy body my choice\u201d thing. I mean your killing a human. It\u2019s also not a glob if cells either if you look up aborted children pictures (yes I have) you can see that even in it first ten weeks it looks humanoid. Plus the whole situation could\u2019ve been avoided with a few precautions and if your going to use rape as an argument (which thankfully this video didn\u2019t) one why are you hiding behind less than 0.5% of something your trying to defend? Two does rape excuse ALL abortions are just in that case? Of course its awful if something this bad happens to you but there is adoption and family support, you don\u2019t need to take a life.  I just am trying to prove my view that MOST cases for abortions are morally and biblically wrong, morally because you\u2019re taking a human life and biblically because God controls the development of all fetus\u2019 and thinks of them as humans multiple times in the Bible. Maybe someone will side with me but my opinion on the video has shifted majorly to neutral to plainly upset that someone could think that taking a life for convenience is mortally ok. <br><br><br>There\u2019s my rant feel free to comment I\u2019m open to other views,  that\u2019s why I watched the video<br><br><br>This has been out for a while and I want to see if people will take me serious when I throw this out<br><br><br><br>I\u2019m 12<br><br><br><br>And I did all of this <br><br><br><br><br>And quite frankly am more civil than some of the people here<br><br><br>bUt iM nOt dOne yEt<br><br>No no no<br><br>This video doesn\u2019t bring up what happens during an abortion does it? Ok let\u2019s all go watch the documentary: The Silent Scream, where it shows the baby during the abortion fight as it\u2019s murdered and torn to pieces. Watch it. Tell me that\u2019s not a human. Go to an abortion center and look into the race of that unborn child then look at me and say, \u201cthat\u2019s not human\u201d <br><br>Look abortion should be an emergency procedure for lifer or death not a situation or moral choice. I know some people are turned away by my little bible remark and even I kinda can get turned away from that stuff, but here\u2019s a lite bible section for those people not like I\u2019m a super Christian or anything<br><br><br><br>So I\u2019m the Bible it says tat god has, \u201cdesigned you in the womb,\u201d and, \u201cformed your inward parts.\u201d SO doesn\u2019t that mean he regards you as a human then? These are just the verses off the top of my head though there are better.<br><br><br>I\u2019m just coming here every so often to keep adding and yes I kinda ignored this for some time and it seemed like I was defeated, but give me time, I assure you, I\u2019m still here<br><br>Look I\u2019m an edgy and depressed kid, but it doesn\u2019t seem fair really to just not give a child a choice I don\u2019t see why so many parents do this and yes adoption is harsh yes this stuff is sensitive, but the reality is what you think isn\u2019t what is true ok. You think it has a bad life but I might not. I think I\u2019m a waste of oxygen and kinda wish I was dead, but maybe that\u2019s not what it is<br><br><br>People are just so used to saying what they think instead of know and that\u2019s not ok in this kind of sotuation<br><br>bUt wAiT thErEs mOrE<br><br>So how come if I woman who is one Devon pregnant is killer it counts as 2 murders but if someone gets an abortion it\u2019s legal?<br><br>R/therewasanattempt<br><br>I\u2019m coming back here every night I get a chance with my phone in bed and I keep on googling info and I guess it just keeps coming. <br><br>So here\u2019s my 10000000th edit lmao<br><br>I kinda don\u2019t really think that abortion will ever be completely illegal in the US but I do believe that with enough work there can be a compromise. Like with the Georgia heartbeat bill. Things like these baby steps can help.

The only time I disagree with abortion is when they start using it as birth control. Aside from that abortion saves pain for a future child and potential parent. Also in my opinion a baby is not a human being until born because before that it is just a parasite. I agree that people just need to keep their damn legs closed but sadly people are too hardheaded and hedonistic to do so. And y&#39;all think bringing a child into this disgusting world is something noble when in reality it isn&#39;t. Also it&#39;s funny how the governments want cats and dogs spayed and nurtured and infertile but when it comes to humans they want to be in an uproar.

I know the foster care isn&#39;t great everywhere(where I&#39;m from the kids are treated exactly like normal kids as they should be but I know that&#39;s sadly not the reality everywhere) but that&#39;s another problem that we need to work on. Call me weird but I truly believe all life is created for a reason.  An unplanned child can still grow up to be wanted by a loving family and do great things. It&#39;s irrational for parents to be forced to raise the child and it&#39;s unfair to the child as well to be raised by people who were never prepared for them, as well as to force women who physically are not in a position to safely give birth to deliver(this happens alarmingly often and is one of the main things I think prolifers are insane about) or can&#39;t afford it.

I think it\u2019s ok because women may use protection and that stuff, but it doesn\u2019t always work, sure it works most of the time, but it also doesn\u2019t, obviously. Women have abortions when they can\u2019t afford to help the baby. If they have an abortion just because they won\u2019t love the baby, I think that is very stupid, but that was their choice. Yea it\u2019s murder, but people get murdered. Okay this is going down hill, but I still believe abortion is ok, yea I\u2019m not that religious, I do believe there is a god and hell. Believe me, I know I\u2019m going to hell, so no need to remind me. The world is over populated, and if not already, then it will soon. So, (so many people are gonna hate me for this) it\u2019s ok if they die. Sure they won\u2019t be able to experience life, but we all die, sometimes at young ages, shiz happens in life, it can destroy a persons life, especially at a young age. Where am I going with this? Yea I should look up more about this stuff, but whatever it is, it still won\u2019t change my mind. Yes murder is bad, no this isn\u2019t different, it\u2019s still murder, but woman can\u2019t care for a baby, they only have abortions because they can\u2019t help the baby. Maybe they don\u2019t feel bad, but I wouldn\u2019t either, well might take me a week or a month to get over it, but I will know that that baby didn\u2019t have to go through hell, it didn\u2019t have to live in a terrible house, it would be happier somewhere else. I\u2019m sorry, but I just can\u2019t believe there are people against this, I sometimes wish we could read each others minds so we can understand how the other side feels, it might change our minds, or it\u2019ll make everything worse. Ok, that\u2019s my opinion. Good night/evening/afternoon/morning to all of you. Hope you all have a wonderful life.

Imagine a 14 old kid raped and got pregnant. And she couldn&#39;t have abortion bc it was illegal. Also it was risky. So, kid died after abortion. And baby... Just born with anyone and killing with the mom. To me, it is not ok. So, giving them the choice to do is the best. I don&#39;t think no one would say &quot;lets make me pregnant and I will have abortion&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-07-21T01:13:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "peppers dang", "comment_text": "Pro adoption", "comment_date": "2018-07-20T22:45:29Z", "likes_count": 225}, {"comment_by": "Evelyn Anna", "comment_text": "You can&#39;t kill something that was never alive in the first place.

Listen to the last line of the video: &quot;access to legal abortions make women&#39;s life safer and healthier&quot;. It should say &quot;access to SAFE abortions...&quot; There&#39;s a difference, in my own opinion. If the abortion is made in a safe environment, then it can be argued that it is healthy. However, LEGALIZATION DOES NOT guarantee that this will happen. And here is where it might get interesting. The video mentions that in the US the risk of death associated with childbirth is higher than that of an abortion. But think outside the US. Think about underdeveloped countries. I speak of what I experience. Here, in Argentina, health is free, so you don&#39;t have to pay to get medical assistance. Nevertheless, you find hospitals in poor states, specialists missing (specially in pediatrics), and equipment not available to use due to lack of maintenance. Corruption, bad politics, you name it. So, now imagine, we are having this discussion of whether abortion should be legal or not in the middle of this health (and economical) crisis. How do you imagine abortions will be carried on if even when you are ill you receive poor or not a treatment at all? So this is why I say that legal abortion is not the same as a safe abortion. Legal is nice on paper, but does not guarantee a safe procedure. Furthermore, I would have wanted to know whether the embryo is considered a part of the human body or is inside it. Wouldn&#39;t that kind of information be interesting as well? I mean, whether the embryo has its own genetic code different from the pregnant woman or not? Of course no one would object to clipping nails; your own body, the nails have the same genetic code as the rest of your body, I suppose. But maybe I am wrong, so it would be interesting at least to see that information as well.

We are told from a young age or see this inforced that killing people are bad, but even then there are circumstances when its okay. (I live in washington) years ago (sorry if it wasnt that long bare with me) people were put on death row to be killed, this is somewhat a degree of murder but the judge found necessary. For the people who dont support abortion there is also something most forget to calculate into this equation, sometimes when people go for an abortion, you probably dont know why. Yes rape is a possibility, incest too but there are people who cant physically carry the baby later along the pregnancy, some people may also be mentally unready and even may not be of age to be a parent (cough cough teen pregnancies cough cough) there are pros in cons in both sides and though I cant force you to change your opinions what ever they may be, I hoped this opens people eyes a little more instead of fighting.

But don&#39;t pretend to be objective. Don&#39;t show both sides at the beginning, and then proceed to only present the evidence that suits your beliefs. It&#39;s as if your goal is to promote your pro-choice agenda rather than educate the public. If you truly wanted to educate the audience, why not tell them how only about 2% of abortions (if that) occur due to health concerns or rape. Or maybe tell them about how a baby&#39;s heart starts beating 4 weeks after fertilization, and how the baby moves by 7 weeks. Maybe talk about how by 12 weeks, a baby&#39;s nervous system can be detecte, and pain is likely felt before that. Why not mention how women are more likely to become depressed and commit suicide after an abortion? We shouldn&#39;t even need a statistic for that, common sense alone should tell us that overwhelming guilt is likely to follow the murder of your own unborn child. The list goes on and on. If people were truly educated on abortion, it would never be legal. So if anyone is reading this, go ahead and do your own research. Talk to people from both sides.

Its like exfoliating the cells on your face. After the 3rd trimester, it is illegal (in the US) to get an abortion unless the baby is endangering the mothers life. But do you know what a fetus is?

Humans for <br>some crazy reason now appear to believe that ending nature&#39;s cycle is <br>right. It doesn&#39;t matter what religion you are. When did it become okay <br>to decide if someone else will live or not? That shouldn&#39;t be anyone&#39;s <br>choice. Just like I have no right to hurt somebody else and nobody else <br>has the right to hurt me. I don&#39;t have the right to kill anybody else <br>and nobody has the right to kill me. Why is society now even considering<br> placing personal issues and <br>personal convenience over somebody else&#39;s life? Of course, measures need<br> to be taken. These women require support that they deserve. Just <br>because I am pro-life does not for one second mean that I don&#39;t <br>understand what these women have to go through and I see that change is <br>needed. Killing life in the womb being a right is a scary thought. <br>Society should never decide that killing an almost fully formed human is<br> a right. It&#39;s not simply a termination of a pregnancy, this is a <br>termination of human life. It shows disrespect to life, disregard for <br>the gift of life. We get to choose so many things in life. Now some of <br>us are certain that we get to choose if another person&#39;s life even goes <br>ahead or not. This is science, at no stage of the pregnancy is this baby<br> not alive. To knowingly kill a person in this manner is devastating. We<br> are taking the rights away from the most innocent in our world. Their <br>chance at life is gone. People say that &#39;this baby wouldn&#39;t have a happy<br> life&#39; or other excuses along that line. What I say to that is there is <br>always a chance that someone will have an unhappy or unhealthy life. <br>Always. But there is also always a chance that somebody can have a happy<br> life.Always. By killing this person before letting them even have one <br>day of life, a life that should be cherished, it is decided on their <br>behalf that no, they won&#39;t get a life, a chance, a voice. They don&#39;t get<br> to make their mark on the world. We are talking about the unique <br>creation of a human life from day one, no matter the circumstances.This <br>is common sense. It is not a matter of personal choice. How is it that <br>when somebody is out of the womb we would be disgusted to hear that the <br>mother decided she couldn&#39;t take care of it and killed it. People say <br>well that&#39;s a completely different situation. But how? Both are humans. <br>One may not be fully developed but it will be and we kill it knowing <br>that fact. The humanity of the unborn child is denied by pro-choice. But<br> science clearly shows that from the moment of conception a unique <br>organism comes into existence. This is not a clump of cells, this is an <br>original, growing person. Since these cells contain human DNA, it is <br>therefore correct to state that he/she is human. Abortion is morally <br>wrong because it destroys life. Just because it is smaller than us <br>doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t share human traits, because it does. It is <br>amazing to me that we ever have to even question this. Suddenly people <br>who are pro-choice attack pro-lifers for daring to mention that it isn&#39;t<br> their body so it isn&#39;t their choice. Facts win overall and the facts <br>point to saving this precious life, this masterpeice bearing a soul and a<br> future. There is no other right more basic or more important than the <br>right to life. This act supports evil, it is morally invalid.Considering<br> someone else life as less important than your own or &#39;a burden&#39; is <br>cruel, where are the equal rights? This puts so many future lives at <br>risk. People also state that it isn&#39;t my business what somebody else <br>chooses to do with their body. Number 1, its not their body we&#39;re <br>discussing, and number 2, it is just as much my business as it is <br>anyone&#39;s to protect life. How can so much slaughter be okay? Please can <br>we protect the truth of life. We need to make this world safer for the <br>unborn. It&#39;s like somebody saying I don&#39;t agree with slavery I think it <br>is bad but I have no right to judge. I mean how ridiculous does that <br>sound. People say that people are going to other countries to get <br>abortions anyway so why not just make it legal. A lot of things are <br>illegal, should we simply make those legal too?

When I think about it we&#39;re complex beings that learn things once we&#39;re taught so let&#39;s say a newborn baby had someone hold a gun to its face and kill it (I know morbid but just give me a second). Who would be scared for that baby&#39;s life while that person waves the gun in that baby&#39;s face? The baby? No of course not that baby doesn&#39;t understand what death is. It doesn&#39;t even know what life is either! The person who would grieve for that baby is the mother. Once a woman has an abortion it&#39;s so terrible for them mentally! They just had to abort their CHILD! Their own flesh and blood! Do you think they wanted to do that?! In most cases no of course not but because of their circumstances they were forced to! Some people say &quot;there are plenty of people who want to adopt newborns!&quot; Then tell me why there are 153 million orphans worldwide? What about those kids that don&#39;t get adopted? What should they just live as an orphan? Put them through the tormenting thought that their parents didn&#39;t want them even if that&#39;s true or not? What about the parents or the mother? Do they just have to accept that this child that they have been carrying, struggling, and bonding with for a year is finally birthed and all of that work, that bonding, that struggle.... Was for nothing. It&#39;s just tormenting for everybody! There are so many mothers that commit suicide after aborting or giving away their child! It&#39;s not easy for both parties but the way I see it is if the baby was aborted they don&#39;t have to go through the pain of life. The pain that the would be mother would have to go through.

Thought I\u2019d add this to the discussion. The reason why abortion is usually talked about in the context of \u201cbefore 20 weeks\u201d isn\u2019t because the fetus is \u201ca clump of cells,\u201d or anything to do with pain.  It\u2019s because before 22 weeks gestation a fetus is incapable of surviving without the mother. If a preterm fetus is born before or at 22 weeks, doctors do not have a legal obligation to try life saving procedures (cpr, intubation, etc) and they don\u2019t attempt those procedures because that baby is not capable of surviving. At 23-25 weeks a discussion with the parents needs to be had about their wishes for neonatal resuscitation and after 25 weeks there is usually a legal obligation to try as there is more data to support that those 25+ have viable survival rates. A fetus aborted before 20 weeks has no chance of being viable outside of the womb at that gestational age. If that pregnancy had continued, then certainly they could have (though 15% of all pregnancies end in spontaneous first trimester miscarriage).

Some case-control studies, however, have found an increase in risk.<br>book:<br>-<a href=\"http://www.rachelsvineyard.org/PDF/Articles/Abortion%20and%20Post%20Traumatic%20Stress%20Disorder%20-%20Theresa%20.pdf\">http://www.rachelsvineyard.org/PDF/Articles/Abortion%20and%20Post%20Traumatic%20Stress%20Disorder%20-%20Theresa%20.pdf</a><br>-<a href=\"http://afterabortion.org/2004/forbidden-grief/\">http://afterabortion.org/2004/forbidden-grief/</a><br>-Breast Cancer: Its Link to Abortion and the Birth Control Pill<br>Many more...<br>i could give more but they are in portuguese so you would not andrestend.", "comment_date": "2018-03-06T00:05:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scarlet Ram\u00edrez", "comment_text": "I really like this video and the fact that it is done in a neutral way.

(Though, it still looks very much like a baby, not just a blob of flesh, even as early as 12 weeks.)  So this avoids one of the biggest problems I have with the pro-abortion movement: &quot;Failed&quot; abortions that literally leave a living child to just die on a table or in a garbage can (this is a thing that happens, even in the United States, but I&#39;m not sure how widespread it is).<br><br>Anyway, the methods mentioned that take place before 22 weeks&#39; growth are definitely not killing a baby who could survive right then.  Which is different from the later abortions, especially D&amp;X, which deliberately kills a baby who could survive outside the womb -- and the argument of &quot;severe birth defects&quot; is one that is up for debate.  I&#39;ve heard that a lot of disabled people are upset at the mindset that a disabled child (of any level of severity) ought to be deliberately killed rather than allowed to live, and I&#39;m rather of the opinion that people who have lived their lives with these problems are in a better position to judge the ethics of this act than I am.<br><br>Even the kid who was born without arms or legs has gone on to have a good life and be a motivational speaker (&quot;If this didn&#39;t stop me from doing good things with my life, what&#39;s stopping *you*?&quot;).  I know a man with hydrocephalus who&#39;s got a bit of processing problems, a bit of trouble with his balance, but he&#39;s lived a good long life and been encouraging to many people around him.  And look at how many people are convinced that it&#39;s okay to kill a fetus simply for having Down Syndrome!  What an insult to all those wonderful people in the world who have Down Syndrome and still brighten the lives of those around them, or even achieve college degrees!  &quot;It would be better for you if you never lived!  Because you&#39;re different from other people!&quot;<br><br>That being said... I acknowledge that there are certainly times when the mother&#39;s life is at stake, and that not having abortion facilities available can lead to avoidable deaths.  And I acknowledge that there may be cases where the fetus has the kind of birth defect where they wouldn&#39;t survive pregnancy enough to live outside the womb.  There are legitimate reasons for abortion, and an outright ban would be unethical.<br><br>What&#39;s funny for me is, I&#39;ve examined the issue from two perspectives: the perspective according to my religious viewpoint, and the perspective if you set aside all religious ideas in my head and just try to analyze it from a secular viewpoint.  And according to my religion: There&#39;s nothing fundamentally wrong with abortion!  You&#39;re not killing a baby.  God creates the human soul at the point of the first breath, so as long as you kill the body before that breath happens, there was never a person.<br><br>(Though, again, the &quot;it&#39;s not even a baby&quot; mindset leads to situations where the &quot;failed&quot; abortion (and live baby outside the mom), who ought to have rights at that point, is left to die, or hurt/harmed.  And it leads to the Barbara Boxer mindset, where it&#39;s impossible to agree that a live-born baby should be afforded 100% of the human rights the rest of us get, regardless of if the mom was in there for an abortion or not.  And there&#39;s a bit of sadness over the loss of a potential life, but that&#39;s not enough to base policy on.)<br><br>However, from the secular perspective: There is absolutely nothing that distinctly separates a fetus from a baby.  From the moment of conception, that thing has its own DNA, and it is alive, and it is human and nothing else.  You can say &quot;it&#39;s okay to kill a living human being before the human is capable of surviving outside the womb&quot; if you like, and I&#39;m not sure I would disagree, but you can&#39;t say &quot;that&#39;s not a human being&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s not alive&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s just part of the mother&#39;s body&quot; because all those statements are false.  Without the human soul, the baby inside the womb and the baby outside the womb are the same baby, just one is breathing air finally.  And if you use the D&amp;X procedure past the 21-week threshold, you are killing a baby who could survive outside the womb (even if for a little bit, but possibly for a normal if handicapped life) -- there&#39;s no distinction there, you&#39;re killing a living human being who, if you did the procedure a little differently, would be considered to be fully human by our courts of law and by the public in general.<br><br>Also, people who say that the difference between a 22-week-old fetus and a baby is that the fetus can&#39;t survive without intervention... well, there&#39;s living babies, premies, who can&#39;t survive without intervention, and they still have human rights and should not be killed.  And if you say it&#39;s a difference of how aware they are, well, a newborn isn&#39;t as aware as a toddler, yet we can&#39;t just kill a newborn.  The only real distinction between a fetus and a baby is that the baby can get handed off to another person, leaving the mom to go her way, while the fetus can&#39;t (for a while).<br><br>So I do find it kinda bizarre that from a Christian perspective, abortion is no big deal, but from a secular perspective, we really ought to have better controls over it -- better legal standards to ensure that no human being gets killed when it <b>could</b> survive.", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T09:04:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CrazyKeet!", "comment_text": "I got a A-BOR-TION", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T06:55:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bunny", "comment_text": ";_;", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T06:43:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ladder", "comment_text": "The fact people don\u2019t think twice to take birth control or wear a condom is unbelievable.", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T05:36:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allison Rae", "comment_text": "everyone in this comment section is so uneducated \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T05:20:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L0r3l0rd2401", "comment_text": "Dead baby", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T04:46:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeanette McQuillan", "comment_text": "I love babies.

Personally I feel like abortions should be available until the baby can either feel pain or have conscious thoughts. Before that I don\u2019t consider it a living thing and it\u2019s until to choose FOR the mother that she has to quit school or maybe her job if she cant afford a babysitter. Not to mention even if she had a job, she would still have to take time off of work when in the last stage of pregnancy. It\u2019s a lot of sacrifice to raise a child alone and unprepared, and I have so much respect for anyone who does it, but you can not force someone to do that. Also, while adoption may be an option, many would not want to force someone to go through that. While some kids get adopted to happy homes, there are way more who don\u2019t. And as for the fetus getting a choice, before 8 weeks it cant even feel pain, let alone feel upset over dying. At that stage in pregnancy it\u2019s not this huge murder it\u2019s played out to be.

Ever since I was little I saw the matter as obvious and deemed the pro-life as radicals (growing up in Sweden, where pretty much everyone supports a family&#39;s right to abortion). <br><br>However, as I have grown older and gotten an education, I see no other way but to percieve abortions of fetuses (or really, any human zygote) as immensly immoral. When does a foetus become a human being? Obviously, this is a hard question to answer since there is no real definition to it, and even if there were, it would in the end be subjective and not based on reality. That being said, it does not really matter when we consider the human being to have been developed, since that does not really say anything at all about the factual, essential existence of the living organism. Therefore, I see no option but to view the unborn as a human being since its first conception and its early stages in prenatal development. A bundle of tissue or not, the organism possesses its own DNA, its own genome, independently from its mother. Therefore, it is not a part of the mother, but an independent (in this sense) human being with human rights. Of course, morals are highly subjective, but in a world of subjectiveness, we can take german philosopher Immanuel Kant&#39;s categorical imperative as a path to what &quot;can be perceived&quot; as ethically correct. If you do not know this imperative, it is basically the notion that the only way one should act is a way that one would want to see being an universal law. This is also pretty much the essence of the Golden Rule as well. <br><br>Taking Kant into account, his imperative states that morality is a maxim that one would like to see becoming a universal law.

You can\u2019t expect her to go through with it knowing she won\u2019t be able to give her child the life it deserves. And also what if there\u2019s an issue with the fetus. It can come out deformed, with health problems which can cause death and can even kill the mother herself. Almost all abortions which take place in the 3rd trimester is due to problems with the fetus that can make giving birth unsafe for both the child and the mother. A friend of mines aunt died from not being able to get an abortion. Her community was a very religious place so hearing that she had to get an abortion otherwise she would most likely die was very traumatizing for her. She tried to go back to her church and village for support for the abortion but instead got a ton of hate from you \u201cpro life\u201d people. She even got death threats that were so bad that she ended up cancelling the abortion at the clinic. On the day that she gave birth my friend told me she ended up dying right after, the baby died 18 minutes later. This church the next day ended up giving a speech about how she was such a kind friend and how she shouldn\u2019t have died so soon, but reality check, you guys were the same people that created so much guilt and pressure making her lose her life.

The Greek Orthodox Church rejects this argument outright. First of all, the Church points to the sacredness of a God-given life, and also points to the fact that if it is forbidden for a Christian to raise his hand against his own life, all the more so does a Christian not have the right to terminate the life of another, even if this life has the appearance of a still not completely formed embryo. Our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, as the Apostle Paul teaches; this means that the cessation of the life of any other person is considered to be a crime not only in regard to that person, but likewise in regard to the Holy Spirit.<br>The Holy Fathers teach that a fetus is a complete PERSON ~body and soul~ created the moment of conception and that all those PERSONS (embryos) that were killed before coming into this world in this criminal away WILL ASK FROM GOD (at His Second Coming) to RENDER HIS JUSTICE UPON THOSE WHO TOOK THEIR LIFE (parents and doctors) \u2026 ON THEIR BEHALF for their personal pain and desolation.", "comment_date": "2018-02-04T18:13:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ana Sylvia Espinosa de los Monteros", "comment_text": "FYI abortion is legal in Mexico.", "comment_date": "2018-02-04T16:10:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edward", "comment_text": "Simply, if men were to respect women and women were to respect themselves, and WAIT.  and if both the man and the women where to understand the importance of having a child, there wouldn&#39;t be any abortions.

If it was special and all that stuff, don&#39;t you think fate would be like &quot;oh crap wait, lady change your mind, that&#39;s gonna be the new steven hawking&quot;. Let&#39;s be honest here, we all live, then die. boom shablam we all aren&#39;t as special as our mommies tell u, we are a race of monkey that just so happened to be smarter than other animals. It doesn&#39;t matter if they had potential, they aren&#39;t even alive yet, the person doesn&#39;t exist. by the way, technically you are not classified as a living human being after and i quote &quot;he is alive when brainwaves start. When do brainwaves start? We can meaure them at 6 weeks.&quot; that is from this website:<a href=\"http://www.pregnantpause.org/develop/when.htm\">http://www.pregnantpause.org/develop/when.htm</a> and that is the latest information on how declare if someone is alive. and that does not start until the 6th week and most abortions take place before that \u00a0 now i say\u00a0au revoir", "comment_date": "2018-01-17T08:43:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Getsiked", "comment_text": "The one topic that pisses everyone off no matter what", "comment_date": "2018-01-17T06:09:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Milena Rodriguez", "comment_text": "If you&#39;re anti choice (pro life), I only accept your opinion if you&#39;re down to raise that kid the mom doesn&#39;t want yourself.

That is the moment of BIRTH of a human. Up until that point - it is a part of that woman&#39;s body and is her choice whether she wants her fetus aborted or not. You absolutely have no right to tell me whether to remove one of my kidneys - and you do not have a right to tell me how to treat the fetus I am carrying up until it is born. Yes that fetus has a potential to become a life. And my kidney can also save someone&#39;s life if I gave it up to someone who needs it! But while I am living no one has the right to come to me and ask me to donate it unless I CHOOSE TO. That&#39;s it - why is there even a damn argument here? You are pro-life? Then don&#39;t have an abortion - bam, problem solved. Educate your young daughter to use contraception - it is your choice! What gets me super angry is why do you feel like you have the right to push your agenda onto other people? WTF? You are not special, get off that high horse and look at the reality of it all.<br><br>You want every abortion to become a life? Mmmmm - how many of them statistically speaking will give any damn about environment? As a general rule - not many. Do we need more humans polluting and ruining this planet for our children? I doubt you will say yes - unless you are narrow minded and ignorant of environment issues yourself.  We also do not need more orphans without parents awaiting adoption that never comes. And our government using or tax money to support all those kids - guess what? Your taxes will go up A LOT!!! <br><br>And pro-life folks, do you have any effing idea how much adoption costs????? Go look it up!!! I dare you! Most people that want to adopt - are unable to afford it, like myself included. It is extremely expensive. So any of those kids that you want to bring into the world and put up for adoption - only a fraction of those kids will ever get adopted. Many of them will grow up bitter at the world and some will get themselves into trouble - and I don&#39;t blame those kids for acting like they do! It is not fair to them. Some of them will have enough drive to succeed - but by far not many. So, for once, put yourself into the shoes of all people involved here, take off those pink glasses and look at the world realistically. People will continue to be born, no one is aborting every pregnancy. There is nothing wrong with allowing a woman the choice of managing her body and her future.

Women die from abortions all the time, but it&#39;s covered up because abortion and the selling of baby body parts and organs is a HUGE Billion dollar a year business.  Planned murderhood gives huge contributions to the democrap party (Bill Clinton first legalized partial birth abortion and abortion up to the day of birth) and have judges and politicians on their boards.  Highly unethical but true.  <br><br>Truth be told, what happens in an abortion is this. <br><br>A totally unique and complete little boy or girl is cruelly murdered by their very own &quot;mom&quot; instead of being loved by her. <br><br>An entire human lifetime is stolen from someone who is no different than the person reading this right now.  <br><br>Because a complete and unique human life exists at CONCEPTION. This is scientific FACT. <br><br>It does not matter whether you murder your child and steal their entire life at 6 days or 6 months after conception.   <br>Because the end result is EXACTLY the same. <br><br>Your innocent and defenseless child still ends up DEAD.  FOREVER.  <br><br>And you will forever be the mother of a dead child.   <br><br>What this video also doesn&#39;t tell you is that a heartbeat can be detected by 16-18 days after conception.  Before most women even know that they are pregnant.  So abortion ALWAYS stops a beating heart and a life. <br><br>By 8 weeks (1st trimester) your baby has ALL the organs he/she will have as an adult.  Not fully developed, but there.  Which is why baby body parts are taken and sold even from babies this young.  <br><br>And as early as 8 weeks, the baby will release the EXACT SAME ENZYME in response to pain that an adult does.  That&#39;s right.  The nervous system has to be there for a heartbeat to exist.  And there is no way to tell how much pain a baby this young feels.  We only know that even at 8 weeks, pain is felt. <br><br>And if you want to watch an actual abortion of a little girl at 11.5 weeks (still first trimester) watch the &quot;silent scream abortion&quot; on youtube.  You can clearly see this poor little girl desperately trying to escape the abortionists tools, her heartbeat getting faster and faster as she tries to swim and twist away, and you can see the &#39;silent scream&#39; on her face as she is torn apart. <br><br>The truth is, ANY abortion is brutal, barbaric, cruel and totally lacking in any mercy, compassion, kindness, human empathy or love.   An adult is supposed to take responsibility for their actions without making someone else pay for them just so they can get off the hook.  <br><br>Adoption is so easy nowadays, with pregnancy centers in every town who can find adoption parents before your child is even born.  Or help you keep your child.  There is just no excuse for acting like a sociopathic, selfish little coward.  <br><br>Human life is a precious thing.", "comment_date": "2018-01-05T17:08:40Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Indie_Gangsta Advice", "comment_text": "Are you the guy from Game Tim???? \ud83d\ude31 you sound like him omg", "comment_date": "2018-01-05T15:56:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BraidyBraidy03", "comment_text": "Thank you for this video.

Technically, men don&#39;t get pregnant in the first place, but I feel like the phrase is trying so hard to make it seem like America is a sexist country or that the country is non-progressive.<br>Anyways, I know that women may do their own &quot;DIY&quot; abortions that will most likely be unsafe and may end up killing the mother and that the finical/health/support risks may be too high. I&#39;d also like to point out: In many countries where rape is more prominent and also unsafe, pregnancies may result and I think it would be so cruel to deny someone an abortion when it was not remotely their fault (especially if they are a minor, good god!) The biggest issue is overpopulation. We can&#39;t afford to support more births that we already have! ( I really stress that last one?)<br>On the other side, I do understand the Pro-Life(rs?) view. How is life defined? Does it necessarily start when a brain, a beating heart, and other organs start working? If fetuses aren&#39;t alive, are they dead? How do we humans get to choose what life is defined as? <br>Also, I know some women regret doing abortions because they would have loved to have a child at that time and they feel like they missed a wonderful opportunity. Finally, there&#39;s also the issue of selective abortions. In China, the one-child policy resulted in parents choosing to abort females to prevent a life without a son, which could mean that they won&#39;t receive care in their old age. That doesn&#39;t really seem fair, does it?<br>I&#39;ve started to come to this insane conclusion: Perhaps we are killing life, but maybe all the cons outweigh the pros, and in order to save our planet and the human life on it, we have to say goodbye to some of our young. It&#39;s like euthanasia. I&#39;d love it if abortions could somehow be prohibited if they are gender or genetically (ex: down syndrome babies) selected. It may be almost impossible to do that.

The city (itself) seems to be waiting almost &#39;eagerly&#39; for any capable &#39;community of humans&#39; to come to fill the town and live there. This would likely grant the people a rich life and provide a healthy environment for the tribe to proliferate. The tribe wants to reach the city, but they must cross the deep lake to reach the other side. They can also sense that they must have a healthy culture for the city (itself) to accept their presence. The tribal elders are huddled around the bonfire, staring at the stars and &quot;talking to the city.&quot; The city tells them they must &quot;bring a healthy race of people.&quot; They must decide whether it would be wiser to fashion ships and Roe across the lake or would it &#39;fit their fancy&#39; to Wade across? The city warns them: &quot;Be careful what you ask for!&quot; After much arguing and bickering, they decided to wade across the lake... There was adventure - and danger! Opportunity? Perhaps. Some were saying that there was &#39;treasure to be discovered&#39; along the bottom of the lake and that they would mine it. According to this theory, the bounty would help to provide them with an &#39;inspiration&#39; which would &#39;prove out their worth&#39; to the city when they arrived. They decided to wade across the lake... Soon after they embarked and entered the lake, a steady attrition was steadily taking effect - but it was often said that &quot;sacrifices have to be made on this journey.&quot; No one noticed the effects of attrition, as it had (at an earlier time) been &quot;priced in.&quot; Eventually the tribal chief reached the other side but when he got there he looked around to discover that everyone else had drowned or had passed away from the Storm. <br>He had emerged from the lake and was destined to be crowned as the &quot;King&quot; of a shining city of NOTHING. <br><br><br><br>If YOU liked my story and if you have the means to do so; please send some currency to help me spread this message: If you really want to, you can find me...

This is the entire question, with the other questions entering only secondarily. So, for example, if it turned out that the fetus were fully human, not some non-human or intermediate species; were genetically distinct and not a part of other organisms but a whole unto itself, though essentially dependent; were undeveloped though actively developing according to its own internal instructions, only ever becoming a fully-formed human being like you and me -- and the only thing from which fully-formed human beings like you and me have ever come; and were distinguishable from fully-formed human beings like you and me only in virtue of factors that are ethically irrelevant, such as size, location (within the body of another), specific functionality of individual systems, and so on; then it would seem that a woman&#39;s choice is totally irrelevant, in the same way that no where else does a person&#39;s right to choose trump the fundamental right of another -- quite the contrary, in fact, with infringement of fundamental rights of others being precisely where the line is drawn in limiting choice: you can choose to do anything you want so long as your choice doesn&#39;t unduly or disproportionately pose harm to another. If it turned out that the status were highly ambiguous or indeterminate, yet without recommending (above all) caution or the Hippocratic principle, then choice might enter as a sort of tiebreaker or to tip the scales. The idea is that it is always secondary, following upon the question of fetal status.  <br><br>Here I&#39;ve made a shortened version of the argument that a fetus deserves at least some ethical consideration, though not necessarily to the same degree as you and me; but that wasn&#39;t my main point. The main point is that the status of the fetus is all that matters when the action in question involves cutting the thing to pieces, and to talk about choice before settling the question of status is to blabber solipsistically about something of little relevance. Both sides of the argument would be better off if we kept the focus squarely on the question of fetal rights (again, whether or not they have any), and if ever we could hope to rationally resolve the issue of abortion it would be in this way.", "comment_date": "2017-07-06T01:03:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaliyah Strong", "comment_text": "Literally gave an entire pro choice speech about this for speech class before this video came out \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "comment_date": "2017-07-04T04:12:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "bulin k\u00e4se", "comment_text": "Why would you ever do an abortion? :(", "comment_date": "2017-07-03T20:41:04Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Stoned Nihilist", "comment_text": "If the child could speak and want to make a choice if thry wanted to die or not would they deny it that?", "comment_date": "2017-07-03T06:37:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "ray hnter", "comment_text": "all those dead babies Nazis have nothing on western women of today", "comment_date": "2017-07-02T06:58:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rena Rich", "comment_text": "empty the contents... ie.  murder the baby", "comment_date": "2017-07-01T18:31:14Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "GrarGirl", "comment_text": "They need to state what happens to the baby.

In this video, they explain the basic of what actually happens when you have an abortion. What actually happens and the ways you go about with abortion can really affect one\u2019s body. What really matters is how far along the women is to be able to have an abortion. Taking a pill or having a surgery are two ways one can use to have an abortion. There is such thing as unsafe abortion because women used to feel that it is illegal of them to get an abortion. Having abortion is not about murder, in my opinion, having an abortion before 13 weeks, during the first trimester, is what the person thinks is best for them at the time. My mother had an abortion at age 18. She took a pill for it because she could not afford a baby at the time and she was at a young age. She thought best for the unborn baby who has barley developed and herself. Laws that limit women\u2019s access to an abortion or make abortion illegal does not reduce the number of abortions. The women would have an unsafe abortion which could affect them even more.

Some people believe that it is inhuman and that you are killing life. Others believe that is the best choice. I am one to stand with abortion. Like stated in this video, 92% of abortions happen within the first trimester. To say that the fetus is a human being and in a sense committing murder is wrong. The fetus at this point is just meristematic cells, that may be in the beginning stages of heart and brain development. You are not committing murder, because there is a time and a place to have a child and if the intentions of the mother are right then there is nothing wrong with having an abortion. For an example, if a young high school student who has no income cannot support a child very well, and may not be completely ready for motherhood at this point in her young life. If abortion was the path that this young woman would like to talk and was denied so because it is considered murder take a step back and think of the life that can hypothetically be lived. If the mother is considering abortion, then she obviously does not want the child. Secondly, to financially support a young child is quite outstanding, and in this situation being a young high school student would have to invest more of her time at a job. The possibilities are never ending for this hypothetical example. Furthermore, this video touches on the idea that if abortions are to be illegal, that is not going to stop women to travel to other places as to where it would be legal. Also, the idea of making abortion just increases the use of toxic abortions. So why cause more mayhem on women\u2019s health, that cause more danger in the long term for woman when it is completely unnecessary. The final point that can be made about why abortions should be okay is that, if we just better educate not just the young population but even the older generations to better women\u2019s the need for abortions may fall as well.", "comment_date": "2017-02-28T01:09:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hijo de Yahweh", "comment_text": "Hey pro-choice people, I don&#39;t think your mom should have had the right to abort you.

However, many abortions take place because it is seen as an inconvenience to the mother or father. Mothers or those that support abortion use the popular argument of &quot;their body, their choice&quot;, but this defies science. Pregnancy involves two bodies, not just one. The embryo is not an organ, it is a growing life. From the moment the baby is conceived it forms its own DNA. The child is in the mother&#39;s body, but it is not a part of the mother&#39;s body, therefore is a completely separate human being. Along with this argument, many choose to believe that a woman has the right to control her own body, but if that statement is true, then they also have the responsibility to do so before they get pregnant. If a woman knows they do not want a child, then it is their responsibility to practice abstinence, use protection, or invest in a reliable birth control.

So when most women find out they are pregnant they are already 5 to 6 weeks into a pregnancy as that is the week after they have fully missed a period.

Making it legal actually makes things better, safer, and less problematic for folks in general. We heard here how many women die from trying to get an abortion done in secret in a non-professional setting, and that is most likely because of the pressure/laws against abortion pushing them to these unprofessional, unscrupulous individuals that the women feel they have to turn to because these unprofessional individuals will do it when most others can&#39;t or won&#39;t. I hear what folks are saying about the fetus inside the woman, but I feel it is even worse to force folks that are not ready or willing to be parents to bring a life into the world and then get rid of or improperly raise the youngster which could lead to suffering for the child and then, possibly down the road, negatives for society when the child born, raised, or discarded by folks that weren&#39;t ready or didn&#39;t want the child grows into an unscrupulous individual.

Often the bias of a source is very clear in the presentation and editing of information. The actual information is pretty much secondary, because it&#39;s been edited down to a point that it only makes one side of an argument without effectively dealing with obvious counter-arguments. This lends an unwarranted level of credibility to a source. To someone who is familiar with this issue, the obvious omissions and obfuscations presented in this video are obvious, but to the uninformed or those already in the presenter&#39;s camp, it may not be so clear. I will endeavor to point out the most obvious example of rhetoric in this piece and let others decide whether or not it&#39;s enough to erode trust in the source: On late term abortions we&#39;re told WHY (they only reasoning for late abortions they give is fetal anomalies) they tend to be performed but not HOW. Ostensibly the video is, &quot;What actually happens when you have an abortion?,&quot; but neither the procedure of late term abortions nor the experience of a woman undergoing the procedure is even discussed. But with the earlier term abortions, the opposite tactic is taken. The video discusses HOW they are performed (while glossing over such elements as what a curette does to both the uteran lining and the developing fetus, which would likely be distasteful) but not WHY they tend to be performed. Now that is a very significant change in one&#39;s argumentation! But why would one make such a switch? Well, the most obvious answer would seem to be to avoid the elements that are not in favor of a pro-abortion argument. In earlier abortions, the procedure is, seemingly, simpler, less violent. A pill or suction removes a small embryo or fetus (here illustrated by a simple, impersonal circle). These abortions tend to be performed more for choices that could be boiled down to &quot;convenience.&quot; So the WHY is seemingly more distasteful than the HOW (particularly when the how is somewhat sanitized by the art and commentary). In the later cases, we&#39;re given only one WHY--severe fetal deformity--as the only statistically significant reason why late abortions occur. We are not given those statistics (or what constitutes &quot;severe...deformity&quot;) but we&#39;re given that WHY and then moved on to why it&#39;s good for abortion to be illegal without even a passing mention of the HOW (which often involves partially delivering an almost full-term baby breach, cutting open its head and suctioning its brain matter). Obviously, the HOW is the more distasteful element here. Additionally, we&#39;re told of deaths from unsafe abortions, and the assumption is made that these only occur when the abortion is illegal. Google the name &quot;Kermit Gosnell&quot; and the many women who died in his completely legal and regulated abortion clinic, and you&#39;ll see that this is not entirely true. Now, I don&#39;t claim to be unbiased in this matter. But clearly AsapSCIENCE is not either. Nor are they &quot;scientific&quot; in their presentation of the facts, since they&#39;ve only presented the elements that make their argument stronger. You don&#39;t have to agree with me or them, but I trust that this overlong post has demonstrated that using the word &quot;SCIENCE&quot; in your name (even in all caps) does not mean that you are honest with the facts of an issue.", "comment_date": "2017-01-16T18:07:00Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Hi U", "comment_text": "Bacteria is called life, but unborn babies aren&#39;t.

Congress has referred 9 criminal charges and 41 healthcode violations from the CMP video investigations.  If PP is defunded, the funding will go to community health clinics, which perform true healthcare services and are much more common.  PP is sucking resources from life giving clinics and directing it to their own murderous goals.<br>Contraception is abortion, the American Medical Board redefined pregnancy to be after implantation so they did not have to state contraceptives like Plan B are abortifacients.  Contraceptives increase abortion rates.  50% of women seeking abortion were using contraceptives the same month they got pregnant.<br>Abortion is not a constitutional right.

One of you is pregnant though, conditions under which the conception took place are irrelevant, just that one of you is pregnant. As a presupposition, we&#39;re saying it&#39;s a given that our species wants to survive.  At the end of the gestation period, what will come out (would this product add to your population in number)? If so, at what point during the process of gestation would it have been vital to allow it to grow? Then we&#39;ll add that a majority of those alive deem the process to be crucial if numbers are to increase, and therefore any attempt to destroy that growth might be seen as an act of sabotage. If one were to argue say, that currently there are too many people, thus justifying the destruction of our species to an extent, it then becomes a moral argument and that person is fine with genocide. The argument that the growing organism is merely a sack of cells (or some other simian phrase), is of course completely nonsensical given the outcome, and not even justifiable as a reason to destroy a possible benefit to the sum; e.g. &quot;we decided not to continue the species because they start out as mere sacks of cells.&quot; The argument that the organism was imposed on an unwilling carrier, and therefore it&#39;s destruction is justified, is for the reasons mentioned above not connected to a crime having taken place, as it does not negate the end result of the process, or even alter it in any way; to equate the tragedy of crime or convenience with the process and therefore the termination thereof is then no different than killing a store employee because his store was robbed. <br><br>Where we are at currently, is that philosophical line in the sand between a people, and it&#39;s enemy. Relativism has had such an effect on so many individuals, that they are no longer able to understand even the most basic logic. People who stand in favor of the destruction of that &quot;sack of cells&quot; have now only one of two possible identities: first that they have knowingly chosen to join the ranks of evil, and second that any notion of morality must cease to impress them and they have become willfully silent, thereby giving consent to the ranks of evil. I promise, we will see some bizarre things in the coming years as a direct result of this type of thinking.

Obviously we accept that nature itself takes certain courses which we may not understand, but, to my mind, it is the intervention we have a problem with. My primary disagreement is that if it&#39;s alright to intervene in the future life of a child (emphasis on the future part), why is it not alright to intervene in the present life of an adult? After all, most murders occur for the same reason one might have an abortion. Practicality. You don&#39;t want somebody around and it seems, often, that the best course of action is to get rid of them. I think the problem we have is that you think of time and existence as some sort of linear process which is divided up into little sections, rather than as existence as a whole which has no particular time constraint, simply different happenings within a non-linear event. Two of those happenings are life and death, obviously, but there are hundreds of religions and philosophies which do not treat those two events as part of a linear sequence.

In order to remove the head of the baby, the doctors must first find it and crush it in order to reduce size. Once the doctors see a white liquid oozing out of the vagina, they know they have crushed it as this is the baby&#39;s brain. The remainder of the head is then pulled out and the abortion is complete. According to a Harvard study, an unborn baby can feel pain as early as 8 weeks meaning many of theses babies can FEEL their limbs getting ripped off. For everyone who thinks that abortion is simply the removal of a blob of cells, this is also untrue. Babies begin to take human form at 5 weeks of pregnancy and most abortions occur between 7-9 weeks (which means yes most aborted babies feel pain).

Many times, women get an abortion because they got pregnant by accident and did not mean to have a child, and as a result, they are not physically, emotionally, and/or financially ready or capable of raising a child. Say, hypothetically, that the fetus was not aborted under even though the mother wanted to do so, the child born would either be put up for adoption, because the parents didn\u2019t want it, it would be stillborn, born with defects, or some other issues because the woman was not physically able to properly carry the child for nine months, or the parents would be forced to take care of the child even if they didn\u2019t want it/weren\u2019t financially able to do so, and the child would live a miserable life of abuse and neglect and very likely would not grow up to have any bright future. Also, it isn\u2019t as simple as putting a child up for adoption; the child could still feel very unwanted and it could take a long time for them to get adopted; their life in adoption centers or orphanages, etc would be quite miserable as well. Not to mention that if the child does get adopted, they might not be as loved or cared for as they deserve to be, as sometimes couples plan on adopting a child and later realize it is a mistake because they can not raise the child very well. If the woman was being forced to give birth when she wasn\u2019t physically ready for it, it could put her physical health at risk and may even kill her.<br>Another thing to make note of is that even if abortions were made illegal, it would only increase the number of illegal abortions made by women at home or without the consent of a doctor, which would only increase the risk of either the woman or child getting hurt or killed.<br>Also, to the people asking why people would be okay with abortion if they wouldn\u2019t kill a man in a coma that would wake up in nine months is because abortions happen for a reason, and there is no reason to kill the man if it doesn\u2019t put anyone else\u2019s life at risk. No mother gets pregnant just for the sake of aborting a baby, neither do they just abort a baby they\u2019re pregnant with just because.

If you want to argue that I&#39;m wrong, you&#39;re gonna hear what I have to say too. Okay? Okay. Okay? Oookay.<br> Forgetting all morals, logically, under certain circumstances, abortion is not only okay, but understandable. Our &#39;morals&#39; on &#39;taking life&#39; however, make many see abortion as practically murder, which, even though most of the time the &#39;infant&#39; isn&#39;t really and &#39;infant&#39; yet. People cling so tightly to their traditions and their morals, but you know what it get&#39;s people at the end of the day? Nothing but pain, struggle, and sometimes, a nice warm bed 6 feet under. God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in the shoes of women who have unexpected pregnancies due to conditions that are totally out of their control, such as defective condoms or RAPE, and go get an abortion. Then you might now what it&#39;s like to have to choose, to have to know that, because of the choice you are making, everyone you know is going to treat you like shit because of it. Also, for those who say: &#39;well a rape baby is a baby nonetheless, it should be given a chance.&#39; How would you feel if you knew you were born out of the malicious sin of some creep? How would you feel knowing that your mother never wanted you in the first place, and that you are basically a constant reminder of her fear and suffering? On top of that, some women who can&#39;t get abortions commit suicide because they can&#39;t take it, and as this stated: More people die because of child birth than abortion, and many could be saved if abortion laws were not so strict, since they&#39;re exposed to unsafe environments. assuming both mother and child die (Going to heavily assume this for suicide, just saying), that&#39;s two versus one. and in those cases, ask yourself: Is &#39;saving&#39; that baby from being &#39;murdered&#39; really worth it? Is attempting to spare the life of one really worth the death of two, one of which being the life you were trying to spare in the first place? Or if only the mother dies, then what about the child? They grow up motherless, that&#39;s what. Not having a mother, like, at all, is tragic.<br>And don&#39;t give me that bullshit about &#39;They&#39;ll regret it for the rest of their life.&#39; That is so not true. Abortion is not something people take lightly, and it&#39;s something they&#39;ll have thought long and hard about. If they come to the conclusion that abortion is better than birth, who are you to tell them different?<br>For one minute, please, let go of your traditions, let go of your morals. Shut your bibles and slide them under your seat, and just think, think about all that I have told you. If you can come up with a solid argument, not just &#39;you&#39;re taking a life&#39; or &#39;It should have the chance to live just like everyone else&#39;, or &#39;it&#39;s wrong because ~insert religious belief here~ says it is.&#39; Feel free to post it. otherwise, keep your mouth shut, because I for one am sick of people using the same 3 arguments over, and over, and over again.

I don&#39;t like that it&#39;s an option, but do what you must. A good portion of abortions aren&#39;t just slip ups - some have health concerns to the mother or child. Then there&#39;s rape. But even with accidental pregnancy, who am I to financially burden someone or to create a life for a child that will only hinder it and possibly hinder the lives of that child&#39;s children? &quot;But adoption!&quot; The world has plenty of children to adopt. In fact, far too many. In America, less than half of the 107k+ kids get adopted yearly. And then there&#39;s international adoption. My brother was adopted from a country with similar bans on abortion - and his orphanage didn&#39;t have enough milk formula for all the children, so he was often just given tea. So he grew up with a pretty bad mental disorder that effected his schooling (and how he was raised) up through his high school years. I&#39;m sure similar issues happened to other infants in that orphanage (it&#39;s also third world). It&#39;s easy to say you care about the child when it&#39;s not born but not caring after. Congrats, welcome to the world, now off to an orphanage, good luck! Or foster care (which my mother also did before she adopted us all) which doesn&#39;t have the best system for it, especially years ago. I don&#39;t agree with abortion and wish it wasn&#39;t a thing people had to do, but I also need to care about all the kids out there currently, who had no say in where they are either.

OK now I decided to abort my pregnancy (fyi I&#39;m not pregent just explaining as if I was) let&#39;s say in was the first semester. so it&#39;s clumps of cells. but that fact I stoled the chance for that baby to be life away. and yes I believe no matter what stage the pregnancy is in. it&#39;s still life being made. I see as a book chapter 1 is the creation of a body. and chapter 2 is being born cuz the baby&#39;s body is done being formed so now it live outside the womb. cells is what to be a body so thus life is being created. so to me I see as no different then murdering a 30 old man or a kid. to me I believe it&#39;s still murder. taking a soon to be a baby&#39;s body or is a baby&#39;s body while in the womb chance to live. but I can&#39;t tell a woman not to get a abortion.

Is that why everything seems so lighthearted and gives off a tone of &quot;oh yea, I agree&quot; and &quot;oh, that&#39;s interesting.&quot; I don&#39;t actually think it&#39;s for kids, but the people who made this video are treating its viewers like children.

Abortion should be looked at as a last choice, a final option. Not some great thing or women&#39;s right. The option should be there but it should be a womans final option.Women and men both should be required to take a small but comprehensive  course during high school which concentrates on pregnancy, birth control, how much it costs to raise a baby through childhood and exactly what a abortion consists of.

Also going around comment sections saying &quot;killing children is wrong&quot; will not solve anything. I could get into science but that&#39;s not the point I&#39;m trying to make here. The fetus is NOT a living being in first trimester abortions nor is it in the early second. Also. Since these people seem to be full of wisdom. What will you do to support these children? There are over 400,000 children in the US foster care system. Most foster parents only do it for the money every month. Only 100,000 are in the process of being adopted. And of that number 30,000 kids become ineligible for foster care after they &quot;age out&quot;. So only 1/4 of children who are given up to foster care actually reach a loving family. Now let&#39;s look at single mothers. Out of the 12 million single-parent families, more than 80% are headed by women (that&#39;s including me). Then out of the 80% that are headed by women, 40% fall beneath the poverty line. They then move to welfare (which is not enough) to help raise their child or children. Those parents who are on welfare are then unable to attend any higher level of education since welfare benefits are lost since college doesn&#39;t count as &quot;work&quot; in the system. So the majority of single parents (who are women) that are in welfare are not only stuck on welfare but loose any chance of getting off since the system won&#39;t support mothers or fathers who decide to go back to school. Keeping them stagnant and unable to get out of poverty. I&#39;ll share one of my favorite quotes to end this rant I&#39;m on from sister Joan Chittister about the hypocrisy in the pro life movement. &quot;I do not believe that just because your opposed to abortion, that you makes you pro life. In fact, I think many cases, your morality is deeply lacking if all you want is a child born but not a child fed, not a child educated, not a child housed. And why would I think that you don&#39;t? Because you don&#39;t want any tax money to go there. That&#39;s not a pro-life. That&#39;s pro birth. We need a much broader conversation on what the morality of pro life is.&quot;  You want to make abortion illegal? Fix the system first.

Unless you believe a soul inhabited us near birth, rather being the soul (animal, person, creature), you would know you ARE still killing, per the definition, a person to be, as, once the sperm has initiated the process, that IS the end of it, as from there, the unit is the very core, despite what other changes and personality there is. You are ending a person&#39;s life, their existence, which had all possible means to fullfil itself. You&#39;re gone, you&#39;re gone, and pain doesn&#39;t change that nor the fact you took a child&#39;s chance at existence when he/she would have after winning the fight, fair and square, uninterrupted.

You might as well weigh the worth of a newborn next to an adult in a situation of life and death, and say we could sacrifice a baby if only to save a more valuable adult... &quot;Oh good, it was only baby&quot;, like one could say dog...and adult dog...or wait...there&#39;s still weight to that, so let&#39;s try something else, like say, AN INSECT OR BUG!

It is her right to decide if she wants to carry a child for 9 months and push it out into the world and take responsibility for the new life she created, or if she decides to abort it in its fetus form, before it becomes an actual baby.

But I do want to say that not aborting a baby even when you really don&#39;t want one is one of the most heroic things I think a person could do. I know a woman who was told by doctors that her child was going to be born with many mental problems and her family tried to convince her to abort it, but she didn&#39;t. Her child grew up healthy with no mental issues. Even if you give a baby up for adoption afterwards, there are families out there who are physically unable to have children but really want to. Adoption centres give these parents a chance to have children and, by choosing to avoid an abortion, you are providing couples with children of their own. I know many will disagree, but I think women should have the baby, give it up for adoption if they really don&#39;t want it, and let the child choose whether it lives or dies.

When a woman decides to abort a fetus, it does not have thought capacity, it cannot feel pain, and it is basically nothing without the woman&#39;s body to support it.  Also, what right does it have to inhabit her body, if she doesn&#39;t want it?

These procedures are literally dismembering and mutilating the child in the womb, and the song you choose to play is absolutely despicable, putting smiling faces and making everything seem so hunky dory. Here&#39;s the nitty gritty. If the thing inside the womb is alive and human then there is no justification for abortion, not even cases of rape because the child is innocent. If the thing inside the womb isn&#39;t human then abortion is fully justifiable. So golden question, how do we determine the humanity of the being inside the womb? Simple, the moment the nature of that being is created it is human, meaning the moment of conception. At that moment we are human, much of our characteristics are at that point determined. We cannot have the nature of that like a frog, or a lion, or bird, only human. So when we are human we have the right to life, and the right to life supersedes bodily autonomy I don&#39;t care what you say about that. Abortion is murder, period. The only way to possibly justify abortion is to dehumanize the child, but since we&#39;ve established our nature is determined at the moment of conception justification at this point is inconceivable.  I love how you didn&#39;t mention the fact of the post abortion depression rates either, making it seem like after an abortion every woman is perfectly okay with their decision. Majority of women after the fact live with relentless guilt about the fact they murdered a child who was innocent. And for those who would compare a child to a parasite, go screw yourself, a child is not a parasite you pricks. To those who would compare a child in the womb to having to do a blood transfusion to someone forcefully, they&#39;re two completely different scenarios, one is dealing with a mother and child and the other never happens in real life, so postulating a hypothetical to a situation  that actually happens is illogical. And here&#39;s the icing on top of that, show me the mother who wouldn&#39;t actually do that for their child, the ones that wouldn&#39;t are absolutely sick. The bond between a mother and child is one of the strongest of all familial bonds. And lastly, trying to justify murder by saying that if we don&#39;t have safe murder facilities then more people have the chance of getting hurt is the stupidest garbage I&#39;ve ever heard in my life. Just don&#39;t get an abortion period. Your want to kill your child does not make it my responsibility as a tax payer to have a facility ready for you to do so &quot;safely&quot;.

Maybe, the mother-to-be wants to prevent any soul from suffering that action of discrimination. A fetus, or unborn child, will not feel pain during the process of an abortion, unlike how they&#39;d feel pain, emotionally or physically in reality whilst being discriminated against for their defect. <br>Maybe the mother does not have the sufficient funds for a child to provide them with a life that they always wanted to provide for there child. <br>If the child is a product of rape (this a large reason, yet by fact only 0.3% of Americans abort there children for the reason of them being a product of rape) then I feel as if the female victim would not want to remember the night, nor want to see her genes fused with his. There are other rape reasons, but I wont get into detail.<br>The mother may have a mental illness that can be triggered whilst giving birth. Now, not many people talk about this, but many mental illnesses (e.g bipolar) can be triggered massively by giving birth or after birth of there children.

The sperm and egg are specialized cells that are part of the corresponding male and female. They are not separate living organism no more then if you let some drop of your blood out. But when the egg is fertilized then the embryo becomes a separate living organism. It even hides in the ovarian walls so the mother&#39;s immune system doesn&#39;t attack it. Though it is just made up of a single cell its DNA is that of a human being.

Tbh, I think going through a pregnancy is one of the most testing challenges a human can go through and I commend women who have had a successful pregnancy.

Abortion is wrong in every case. In the most extreme case, a mother is murdering her child because she is too lazy to take care of it. In other cases, there isn&#39;t enough money or the parent doesn&#39;t eel equipped to handle the situation. Have you ever heard of adoption? And don&#39;t excuse that with &quot;What if the child doesn&#39;t have a great life in the adoption system&quot;, that is not a valid excuse. You cannot assume it will not have a better life than you can give it, and even if they don&#39;t it&#39;s still better than no life at all. In the most excusable cases (rape or danger of death), if you are raped, it is still murder if you kill the baby. If you want to put it up for adoption, that&#39;s all right by me. If you want to raise it, also good, but don&#39;t kill it. In the case of it being a danger to your own life, you do not have the right to choose which life is worth more. Even in the case of someone pulling a gun on you and threatening to kill you, you have no right to choose your life over theirs. Killing another person is only excusable when the lives of many are at risk, and eve then, it shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly. I don&#39;t care how safe the procedure is, or how dangerous it would be to allow back-alley abortions, abortions should always be illegal.

If a mother has two kids and can&#39;t afford a third, it would be indeed a bad thing for society if she raises a 3rd or 4th child she can&#39;t afford, children whom will have little opportunity, but its far worse to have a planned unrepentant homicidal caretaker raise 2 children. Law can only help her realize she ought to be contrite rather then repeat her action; ultimately making her a better woman and mother to raise children. <br>Yet, trying to create an artificial reality, a legal and philosophical environment that facilitates a remorseless murderer, that accommodates her with ideological support can only go so far. One only needs to look at the emotional and psychological effects abortion has on most women, these women do what their pressured into or may even rationalize it long enough to go through with it, but after it leaves them disrupted and changed. You can&#39;t remove remorse, regret, depression and self loathing with rhetorical platitudes and pseudo psychology. Spiritually breaking a woman just  isn&#39;t a good means of empowering them.

I&#39;m wondering if people who are pro-life and pro-choice realize, if you don&#39;t want a baby, and you become pregnant. It&#39;s best to decided early on in development. After the chunk of cells inside the mother forms, it slowly forms the anus first. No heart to beat, no blood to flow, no mind to work. No consciousness to think about the ideals of life. If an abortion is early enough, you&#39;re only removing an literal asshole out of your body, that&#39;s not even complete. That being said, I think there should be a legal cut off point. If there&#39;s a heart and a brain, there&#39;s no go after that point. You&#39;re having the baby.<br><br>On a different note, if the woman&#39;s life is at risk, and the only way to prevent her death is a late abortion. Then it&#39;s still, up to the couple to make the decision, or risk the death. Now, if she dies, and there&#39;s a law against abortion completely (and if enough deaths occur) there&#39;s going to be an uproar. It&#39;ll traumatize the man for years and years, and once he&#39;s finally found someone new to help raise his son or daughter that, in birth, caused the death of his girlfriend/wife, that kid will be close to the ages of 12-15 (in most cases.) I couldn&#39;t imagine the trauma of watching his girlfriend/wife slowly deteriorate overtime, scream in pain as she pushes out their newborn, then to have her die in/shortly after the process. And to, everyday, look to their child and know deep down in the darkest corners of their minds, that their child caused the death of the one person that meant the entire universe to him. Now, he will still love his child unconditionally. Yet no matter what, he will forever suffer. No matter how far, or how deep, it&#39;s burred.<br><br>Case in point: It&#39;s not about religion, it&#39;s not about if it&#39;s ethical or not. It&#39;s about the people. Great people. People who just want to be happy. There&#39;s always consequences to the actions a person takes. The girlfriend/wife and boyfriend/husband will still be there for each other at the end of an abortion, though as sad as it may be, they&#39;re not ready. They may never be ready; financially, or emotionally. But they will still continue to grow and support each other.<br>If a law were to prevent the abortion, and the girlfriend/wife dies, congratulations. You just killed the boyfriend/husband&#39;s hopes and dreams, and now the kid will grow up, not having a mother. A single parent is hard enough in this economy, even worse so if said couple were force to give birth to a child, and not have the funds to support the child.<br><br>If you &quot;pro-life&quot; people want to stop abortions, then give the people who are giving birth, because of your actions, money to support their families. You cannot, ABSOLUTELY cannot, force a mother to give birth to a child because it&#39;s unethical, then pretend that the family, that is now living in poverty, is not your problem. You complain about them needing food stamps and welfare now? Maybe you should have considered that when they were forced to have a child. Not everyone has the means to raise a child.<br><br>You&#39;ll create a massive snowball effect. In summery: Leave it legal...but have a certain cut off point. If one of the two are going to die? It should be the couple&#39;s choice of who lives and who dies.

Making it legal actually makes things better, safer, and less problematic for folks in general.  We heard here how many women die from trying to get an abortion done in secret in a non-professional setting, and that is most likely because of the pressure/laws against abortion pushing them to these unprofessional, unscrupulous individuals that the women feel they have to turn to because these unprofessional individuals will do it when most others can&#39;t or won&#39;t.  I hear what folks are saying about the fetus inside the woman, but I feel it is even worse to force folks that are not ready or willing to be parents to bring a life into the world and then get rid of or improperly raise the youngster which could lead to suffering for the child and then, possibly down the road, negatives for society when the child born, raised, or discarded by folks that weren&#39;t ready or didn&#39;t want the child grows into an unscrupulous individual.

If you believe that my credibility is invalid, I can assure that I am not being close-minded or prejudice. I am simply stating what I believe and why I believe it. Thank you for reading.<br>On the topic of abortion, I am pro-life because of two reasons: my faith (abortion is wrong because it is a form of murder) and science (the fetus is early development of a human being). I understand there may be certain instances, such as rape, potential harm of the mother and/or lack of resources, abortion might seem permeable to perform. Be that as it may, I stand firm in, as it says in the Declaration of Independence, \u201c... that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\u201d. Whether or not the baby\u2019s life or the mother\u2019s life is filled with hardship, struggle, and/or turmoil, we should hold everyone\u2019s rights as equal and not give doctors, or mothers, the option, or opportunity, to murder unborn babies. <br><br>Now a Question for the comment section:<br> Ask yourself this, if you were a fetus, and your mom had you aborted, how would you feel? How would you feel that you had no say in the value and/or fate of your own life that is co-dependent on the woman you are inside? Think about it. All the things you accomplished , all the experiences you enjoyed, and all of the people you meet and loved were nonexistent because someone viewed your life with little value and/or as too much of a burden. Don&#39;t get me wrong, things such as rape and incest are terrible consequences of another man&#39;s morbid decision that the mother of the child has to deal with. However there are options for those situations like adoption, foster homes, and other social services. Some people say adoption rates are low and that kids in foster homes have terrible lives. I would counter that and say that at least those kids have the opportunity to live life, whether it destined to be bad and/or good, then no life at all.<br><br>Thank you &lt;3", "comment_date": "2017-01-12T23:41:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rlsukovaty", "comment_text": "Those &quot;Contents&quot; are a human baby.

I hope no one eats me alive for this but despite being a catholic I am completely a pro-choice advocate. I&#39;m well-educated about these sensitive topics because of a bioethics class I have taken at UCLA (MCD 50 for those curious). Topics like abortion and stem-cells create a lot of controversy and I feel inclined to share what I know. The heart of many (especially religious) arguments against abortion and stem cell research focus on life. But what makes human life particularly special? Moral relevance. Think of chalk, breaking a piece in half raises no ethical concerns because it isn&#39;t morally relevant, but doing so to a human being would. But the real underlying question is what specifically grants humans moral relevance? Science may say cognitive capacity, religion may say our souls but many arguments are (objectively speaking) easily refutable (like potentiality) due to their illogical rationale, and many have infinite counterexamples. The reason I mention this is because there is absolutely not an objective, impartial, and scientific understanding of what gives humans moral relevance, let alone how we can quantify it, or use it to determine whether or not babies/embryos/pre-embryonic stages of life have it.<br><br>          Furthermore imposing one&#39;s own views/beliefs on others infringes upon the latters&#39; rights and freedoms, which is unfair and (in my opinion) unacceptable. This is why I support choice. Many ethicists (like Robert Audi) suggest we use objective scientific data (in the public domain, unlike religion which is a private one) that is accessible to everyone to make decisions (whether or not you choose to accept factual information is at each person&#39;s discretion). However, the problem here is that science can&#39;t tell us whether abortion or hESC research is morally permissible. THIS is WHY people look to their faith for answers, but personally I don&#39;t want to make another&#39;s person choices for them because their beliefs may not align with mine. Even then, each unique case is just that, unique and shouldn&#39;t be judged with general, homogenous laws. Hopefully this conclusion that I have reached, with the knowledge given to me by a wonderful class (thank you Professor Cvrkel)  may enlighten you or make you reconsider things.

Therefore, if you agree that all human beings have an innate right to not be killed (mind you, we have no right to live because that would entail that someone is violating your rights when you trip off a cliff and die on accident), then consciously ending that beings life is by definition murder.

But the problem with that refutation is best described with an analogy--imagine a deserted island with 2 people, one is going to starve if he does not kill the other, does that give it the right to kill him? No, that is still murder.
