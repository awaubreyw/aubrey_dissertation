Some foods can start out natural but the process ther put through makes them poisoness....... the right color, right smell right texture ...these food comanies are money oriented and will do all they can to get your money even poison you .

That which is natural and non-toxic our bodies are able to process better and prolong our health. Examples for those who see is, 1(someone who eats fast food will be at higher risk for health problems) 2(someone who eats organic and exercises a few times a week will have better health) I&#39;m not saying that being fat means you&#39;re unhealthy because you can be eating clean and still be chubby but it&#39;s very unlikely you&#39;ll be obese due to being able to process clean food quicker. I&#39;m saying that in the long run organic, not natural because natural is just a label, will benefit you in the long run. Eating cleaner foods that are not even necessarily natural or organic, EX:(bananas at walmart with no label) will still have a better effect on your health rather than man made chemicals that aren&#39;t natural in any way shape or form.

In a real food (plant/animal - such that is not produced in a factory, food that once had a life on its own) - chemicals that make it are result of complex interactions between the plant/animal and its environment during its lifespan. If the soil was say mineral depleted, so will be the plants that grew on it and animals that ate those plants. Man made foods on the other hand are, biologically speaking - totally random. Most of them are just made to taste good. Chemicals that are added are mostly to enhance taste/texture (increasing the pleasure of eating it, therefore making it more addictive), or to prolong shelf life (making the product more marketable).<br><br>The problem is context.<br><br>There is a reason for each and every nutrient in each and every real food. That is - a biological reason. We don&#39;t know most of the cause/effect relationships here, but if a chemical is present in a plant/animal it has a very specific role in defining that plant for what it is. We may not know that role for each chemical, but we need to start appreciating the complexity of nature more. (both when we eat, and when we grow our foods)<br><br>So by eating real foods, we do not only eat the chemicals these foods contain - we actually eat those foods, with their colour, taste, texture, that each and every one of those chemicals contribute to uniquely. And it&#39;s the whole food that produces a reaction of our bodies. A very specific one at that.\u00a0<br><br>It&#39;s not that man made foods are toxic themselves, it is a lack of context that confuses delicate systems inside a human body that is. And by toxic i do not refer to a specific chemical, since, a dose is a poison - i refer to &quot;incompleteness&quot; of the information received by a living organism by eating &quot;incomplete&quot; foods.

I&#39;ll tell you what, don&#39;t buy a phone, buy a list of the chemical compounds that your phones are made of and see how effectively you can text with a pile of dust.

You tell that 6000 year old digestive system that it needs to get with the times.<br><br>Yes everything is made of &quot;chemicals&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t mean all chemicals are to be treated the same. The reason we call them chemicals is because they usually come from a chemistry lab or a chemical processing facility.

Our digestive system is made to process food when it is available in certain natural packaging format i.e. apple, banana, orange etc. All food we consume is processed to some extent, from peeling a banana, to kneading dough, to cooking it. However, there is a line in the sand, and when you start using industrial chemical processes to change the properties of the food, it does not seem unreasonable to allow people to have the freedom to make a choice.This looks more like a marketing video for chemical companies than anything else.\u00a0<br><br>These days people are making choices based on the past actions of chemical companies.\u00a0The &quot;scientists&quot; who claim that chemical x is safe have been proven wrong so many times in the past that people are getting sick of hearing the same story again and again.

This is why we know not to eat poisonous mushrooms. The true argument is that man made chemicals are relatively new on the scene and don&#39;t have the historical backing like most foods do. Although foods have been manipulated by man to produce things like seedless watermelon typically that manipulation doesn&#39;t lead to a poison. Occasionally it does. Moral of the story for me? Stick with whole foods that history has already revealed to us as safe. Furthermore, the essential nutrients necessary for life and survival are found in whole foods. Sure we can make it in a lab with the help of other essential things ie, glucose manipulated to make vitamin c. But it still remains that these essential substances originated and started in whole foods. blah blah blah..I could go on and on.<br><br>P.S - The reaction to historically backed substances for ingestion also allow for a broader predictability in how are liver and body will break the substances down. In other words, for the majority of the population, eating a banana will not result in the creation of a new substance by the liver that can cause harm or death. How do we know this? Well when is the last time you watched the news etc and people became sick or died from eating a banana? However, think back of how many times you have watched recalls on novel drugs during a television commercial. Some of you here can attests to getting headaches from consuming aspartame or sucralose. Guess what? It is still controversial although you know you don&#39;t feel right. But don&#39;t worry in 10 years time researchers will likely come out and agree that what you are experiencing is not in your head.<br>The problem is we become experiments for these new substances.<br><br>As far as dose goes.. well...once again humans have a rough idea due to inherent mechanisms that let them know they don&#39;t need anymore of a substance the body recognizes as essential such as water. However, some are arguing that chemicals and other things (like stress) may be helping to disrupt this natural mechanism that let&#39;s you know you have, for instance, had enough sugar or fat dose. Yes almost too much of anything can kill you. When it comes to essential nutrients, too little of something can kill you also.<br><br>\u00a0Please feel free to eat your experimental stuff and I&#39;ll stick with what works regardless of how long or complicated the sound of the substance found in my fruit is.", "comment_date": "2015-07-18T16:39:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carmen Yeung", "comment_text": "I have a question: When you&#39;re pregnant where does the baby live?", "comment_date": "2015-07-18T15:57:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Veggie Louise23", "comment_text": "Can anyone provide a understandable explanation about what quantum physics is", "comment_date": "2015-07-18T15:52:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Riley the Alien", "comment_text": "Can you please do a video on schizophrenia ", "comment_date": "2015-07-18T15:51:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammad Ziab", "comment_text": "fruit its god made , candy its man made , well\u00a0 who you trust more to make your food ??", "comment_date": "2015-07-18T15:30:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S.A.", "comment_text": "The thing about this is that I can be 100% sure any fast food (like Burger King or Pizza Hut for example) are bad for you.
