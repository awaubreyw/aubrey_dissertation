We use data to find out the best way to control pests.  The buildings and fountains are called mechanical control, removal of stagnated water is called cultural control, and the genetic modification is called chemical control.  They are the trifecta that makes up IPM.  What he\u2019s explaining sounds ingenious but it\u2019s literally a very common science that\u2019s been around for over 100 years.  <br>As for the genetically modified mosquitos, it\u2019s also experimental, bill gates paid for it and also paraded the idea around.  What\u2019s concerning is they chose Disneyland where millions of people funnel in and out to do a pretty potentially risky experiment that should have happened in swamp lands, not a place many people will travel and potentially be exposed.  <br><br>Lastly, humans are not mosquitoes \u201cfavorite snack\u201d they tend to bite wild animals a whole lot more than anything else.  We just tend to want to be in their natural habitats or accidentally create them.  He also makes absolutely no sense.  He said the gmo skeeters made the females all die so the male could carry on the gene.  Only female mosquitoes bite and they only feed to create eggs, it\u2019s called a blood meal. If you kill the females, there isn\u2019t any eggs, there isn\u2019t another generation, the male mosquitoes cannot carry a gene over generations that cannot exist.  Male mosquitoes do not bite.  They will inevitably die.  These gmo females are made the way they are as to produce sterile eggs.  They aren\u2019t a multigenerational gmo.  They are a single generation experiment that ended some time ago.  Also if mosquitoes disappear the world won\u2019t end, they have no natural predators so nothing relies on them as a food so ecologically.

Lots of people will see this Short, many of whom will have inevitable natural collections of standing water. Please know that you can buy things called &quot;Mosquito Dunks&quot; which are corn cob pieces that are coated in BT bacteria and which are designed to float in the standing water and inoculate it with the BT bacteria. The mosquito larvae eat the bacteria, become infected, and die. You can buy and throw these mosquito dunks into every small puddle or small pond near your home and it&#39;ll cause no harm. The corn cob decays naturally. The bacteria don&#39;t survive long term. If you have a poorly maintained fountain, aesthetic pond, etc that neighbors or HOAs or apartment complexes have installed but never chlorinate, you can throw a few of these in there every few weeks and there will be no mosquitos. The BT won&#39;t hurt fish or other larger wildlife. The BT bacteria ALSO kill fungus gnat larvae and caterpillars, so you can buy &quot;Mosquito Bits&quot; which are just the corn cob bits loose in a container and make a &quot;tea&quot; with them which you then use to water your indoor plants. The BT kills the fungus gnat larvae and voila, no more gnats in your face while you&#39;re trying to eat your dinner. For caterpillars, the BT is bought as a garden hose sprayer or a standalone spray bottle product that you mist onto a tree or plant and then the BT are eaten by the caterpillar when it eats the leaves. Some caterpillars are invasive and destructive.
