They would get stressed very quickly and may have a spike in adrenaline but that&#39;s it. They would start to feel tired if they don&#39;t get enough food, even if they eat random animals they might get poisoned. The elements would also wear them down, their health would decrease with time. Even if it&#39;s a rabies like thing that trasmits by a bite, 1st that would be a open wound on the new zombie, accelerating decomposition and infection and 2nd the zombie who bit didn&#39;t feed itself much right? Like either we have thousands of starving zombies that don&#39;t eat much or we have a few zombies that actually eat people. Also not everyone is in the best fit in the first place, old people, unhealthy people would have an ever worse time. So basically, in a while the number of  actual scary zombies would decrease, most would have died either killed or by starving/injures etc.<br><br>The scariest part really is the virus itself. If it somehow is spread by air (saliva droplets?), then yes that would be very scary. ESPECIALLY if the first symptoms took a long time to appear so we could have a very high initial number of them, including scientists and medics and stuff. But that&#39;s if a virus like that could appear in the first place. Science wins again: hopefully microbiologists will be tracking these potential viruses to see if one could actually achieve that, and then study the precautions to not get people contaminated and extermine it (i know that&#39;s a very hard task). And like i don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible that someone in an instant becomes full on zombie, they would probably feel stuff beforehand and unless the disease can disguise itself as something else, the doctor this person sees will notice something strange and investigations begin. Lockdown would happen on this person&#39;s town and they would track their habits/locations and notify the government for other actions. Other tool for us would be communication.: hopefully governments would work together and notify everyone, this would be a local event at first to so we would do our best to make everyone STAY HOME. anyways i really hope thos never happens or if it does, it won&#39;t be so brutal.

Here is how it would work to produce exactly what one sees depicted in movies and television series about the zombie apocalypse:<br><br>1. Extraterrestrials drop off nanotechnology virus in atmosphere, perhaps for sick entertainment (we cannot assume extraterrestrials have empathy or concern for humans) or to cull the heard, even to save resources they figure they might need in the future.<br>2. The nano-virus reproduces and infects everyone on Earth.3.<br>3. The nano-virus then creates networks in the bodies and brains of most people who are infected, and they die from the process. It also builds networks in the eyes, nose, and ears for crude sensory input, and the virus invades the brain to build the control network on the microscopic level. The networks are not visible to the naked eye, if one were to cut open a zombie.<br>4. The dead are reanimated with microscopic nanobot fibers, built and embedded in the flesh, that act like muscle fibers to animate the corpse, and the apocalypse takes over the Earth extremely quickly, as everyone is already infected. The government and military also turn, so there are no agencies to save the living from the apocalypse.<br>5. The nano-virus maintains the dead by keeping the flesh and blood from drying out and going stiff, and puts antifreeze into dead flesh in winter to keep the dead from freezing solid. The virus does minimal repair to the rotting flesh so zombies will last indefinitely.<br>6. Damaging the brain damages the control network built into the brain, so the zombie goes down, but harming the rest of the body does not stop it.<br>7.

Then people begin to realise that the virus doesn&#39;t actually affect everyone, that some people are actually immune. But we are still bent on finding a cure for this terrible curse.

Most of them will be immune to the virus, but some of them won&#39;t be. They&#39;ll have groups that run through the ever changing maze to try to find the exit, while terrifying creatures try to tear them apart limb by limb and then absorb them into their skin. Inside the centre of the maze, the kids who weren&#39;t running started a fully functioning community and established a stable society.

These symptoms continued for a couple weeks, gradually getting worse. Her parents took her to the doctor and she was misdiagnosed with migraine headaches. On May 31, she was shopping with her father, Tony Reid, when she suddenly got a startled look in her eye, stood stiff for a moment, then collapsed and started convulsing. Her father caught her and held her head to prevent her from injuring herself. She was taken to the hospital. She was in a coma for two days. On the second day, the medical staff noticed that her vitals were indicating oncoming death. They notified her parents. Her mother, Patti Reid, said, &quot;I can&#39;t be there when my child dies.&quot; She had to leave the room. On June 2, 2003, Shannon Reid &quot;gave up the fight&quot;, to quote the show. Her body was taken to the morgue to find out what it was that killed her. All that had been said was that Shannon had headaches. It wasn&#39;t until months later that the Reid&#39;s found out that it was rabies that took there daughter. That story shook me to my core and tore my heart out! I was born only about 3 and a half months after Shannon and I remember what I was doing just about the time she died. I used to think rabies was kind of funny, with the foamy mouth and stuff.

I&#39;m fascinated by the concept. I&#39;m always planning for the zombie apocalypse; noting key locations that could serve as a good place to hold up for the long term. I always buy a couple of extra bags of rice and pasta, as well as tinned food when I&#39;m shopping. Me, my wife and two kids will hold out in attic till things have &quot;died&quot; down enough for us to make the move to one of my predetermined safe zones. We&#39;ll probably eat our dog Shadow on the first day of the outbreak though, as she barks every time someone comes near the front door and it&#39;s only a matter of time before she starts attracting the zombies. That will probably mess with the kid&#39;s heads a bit, but by the time we&#39;ve eaten their mother it won&#39;t seem like such a big deal. I&#39;ve got a baseball bat and a hurley stick for protection, which is as good as it gets for now as I live in Ireland and machetes are hard to come by, but I am hoping to pick up some more effective weapons while I search for food and water supplies (always during the day). We live on an island with a reasonably low population and plenty of isolated areas, I think if we were able to secure a large enough area, such as the grounds of a castle, we could grow crops \u00a0making sure we have easy access to a natural water supply. Of course we&#39;d probably try to team up with other groups to increase our chances of achieving this. I don&#39;t know what happens after this stage as, but I assume the zombies will soon become the least of our worries, as groups of desperate and hungry survivors scour the countryside for food and shelter. Hopefully we will be in a position to defend ourselves and eventually out-live the zombies, assuming that they WILL eventually decay and rot....so as I was saying, I&#39;m a little obsessed with zombies.", "comment_date": "2014-02-15T19:02:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nepeta Leijon", "comment_text": ":33&lt;does anyone remeber resdent evil when the guy threw the virus and it leeked into the air vents? is that how it relly works?", "comment_date": "2014-02-15T16:04:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jipdos1", "comment_text": "what is the science of why we can sometimes not think of a word or phrase when we need to", "comment_date": "2014-02-15T02:17:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Green Alpha", "comment_text": "Well, my family basically lives in a pile of guns, then ya", "comment_date": "2014-02-15T00:45:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Smith", "comment_text": "The specific requirement for human flesh would be ridiculous, the most likely scenario would be a virus that makes you angry and hungry.

The transformation could take as much as a week. 3) Taking on zombies one at a time is no problem, but if you run into a &quot;herd&quot; of a 20 or more, you&#39;re pretty much f**cked!

Originally, the doc&#39;s would feed their victims a poison made in part from tree frogs I believe, and a few other nice and deadly on their own ingredients. The result would be that the victim would fall into a coma after experiencing high enough fevers to basically kill off most brain functions. Everyone would assume the victim was dead, and so would bury them. The witch doc then would exhumate them and revive the body, which by this point is basically a shambling mostly dead vegetable, making an ideal slave  that doesnt feel pain and wouldn&#39;t fight back. Downside is the limited ability for them to understand instructions, but thats what I&#39;ve heard about the origin of zombies. Its been a few years so I can&#39;t remember where I read it though, sorry. But from that its not much of a stretch to the dead coming back and infecting others.

Another example would be prions - a retrovirus that infects other proteins, altering them from their original function ans turning them into more prions, as what happened with Mad Cow Disease. In addition, the video game The Last of Us demonstrated that a tropical fungus, cordyceps, presently accomplish said goal of infecting insects, and for the purpose of the story it was written that they were able to infect humans, which in all honesty isn&#39;t too far of a stretch, seeing how Influenza is transmitted across ducks and pigs, so why can&#39;t a fungus infect another species?
