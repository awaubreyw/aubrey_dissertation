Our body produces only what requires. Even the hypertrophy works the same way, where in your brain feels the need of more cellular density. So goes for strength, hunger, blood, chemicals etc. The essence of necessity is all that has lead to this whole evolution of not only humans but also every other life. We\u2019ve gained new things and lost quite a few. It\u2019s all about what the brain things we need. With a decent nutrition, continuous hard work and proper rest, and pushing yourself to a point where we need more testosterone, can definitely intrigue the brain to produce more testosterone. And yes, even when you are older. The thing is we seldom push to the limits, or for that matter, through the limits. When you can\u2019t do what is required and still trying, that\u2019s the time your brain decides to intervene. That\u2019s how body works. No matter how much you talk about calories, protein and workout, it\u2019s the brain at the end that is the engineer. You\u2019d need to get hold of your brain, and convince it to do stuff. That\u2019s when you are doing it as a human. Otherwise there are numerous animals who can do the physical stuff far far better. <br><br>The overall point is that for every ease of work, or for a shortcut taken, you have to compromise with your strength, skill, potency, capabilities and what not which you would require to avail that otherwise. Please do not use EST unless you have reached to best you could and you are competing for the best of the bests. Yes steroids can do it much easily, much quicker and with least of efforts.

I like the \u201cillustration\u201d of this video.  But I don\u2019t like the creators use of Wikipedia for FACTS!<br>Let\u2019s address a couple issues...<br>1.  ROID RAGE:  this is a FAKE phenomenon that is always talked about!  This is FALSE.  Let me make it simple:  if your an AssHole and you take steroids?  Your going to be a BIGGER AssHole!  If your Chill?  Your going to be Chill-Er...  steroids ENHANCES what you ALREADY are!!!  But, all the media and YT wants to reports is... ROID RAGE!  Why?  They just want to report the NEGATIVES!!!<br>FACT:  can you go to your doctor RIGHT NOW and get a prescription for TESTOSTERONE?  YES!!!  So... please tell me how they test for ROID rage or other health factors?  They DONT!  It\u2019s a naturally produced product in the human body!  \u201cI jumped a little there but this subject is a sore with me.\u201d<br>2.  There is NO evidence of heart disease or stroke!  NONE!  There are assessments and theories, but there is NO EVIDENCE!  Just fear factors against its use!!!<br>3.  Every DRUG (TEST is a drug) has it\u2019s uses and abuses... when you use something correctly?  It\u2019s side effects are minimal if any!  If abused?  Then the side effects are maximized and may be great!<br>4.  Does anyone take Ibuprofen?  Of course!  Can the abuse of it KILL YOU!  Yes it can... ibuprofen can SHUT your kidneys down!  Is that on the label?  NO!  Why NOT?  Because it\u2019s an prescribed and over the counter drug!  They make MONEY OFF IT!<br>5.  The possession and use of steroids is NOT ILLEGAL.  The distribution and sales of them is?  WHY?  Because the doctors are NOT getting their % of that sale.  So getting steroids from a doctor is legal and healthy for you!!!  Getting steroids from another source is illegal and unhealthy for you!!!  WTF??<br>6.  After any major surgery, what do you think the doctor proscribes for you?  STEROIDS!!!  But since they prescribed it to you?  ITS OK!!!  I\u2019m speaking from personal experience where my friends are open heart surgeons.<br>7.  I\u2019m TIRED of the bullshit videos and speeches about STEROIDS!  Especially from NON USERS where they get their info from Wikipedia or controlled sources...<br>8.  Why not do a video about how big pharmaceutical, our govt, and Big industry has \u201cpurposely\u201d reduced the production of TESTOSTERONE in our MEN these days through GMO, Foods, Drugs, Water, Fluoridation, Vaccinations and the Main stream media???<br>NOW THAT WOULD BE A \u201cTRUTH\u201d VIDEO!!!<br>9.  Or should we just send the TEXT to another video of a baseball/football/celebrity about getting the next PILL that will boost our free Testosterone???

My philosophy is ideally to be as reliant on as few things as possible. Food, water, and air are things that we are all inherently dependent on, but consider an addicted smoker; they HAVE to spend money and time to acquire nicotine because their body is dependent on it or it drives them nuts. If you want to shortcut it to get bigger muscles because you seek the positive feedback from being exceptionally muscular and lean then you have to deal with the trade-off of becoming a slave to this substance, in order to keep getting that positive feedback you have to keep using it. It all depends on your philosophy as to whether or not using steroids is worth it. <br><br>Personally I just put the drive for being muscular and athletic towards working out the slow, hard way, and granted I am not big at all, and sometimes it is easy to sense the appeal of using steroids (also I definitely could be eating and working out far smarter) but I cannot find the justification in my own life to have to introduce another reliance that steroids would be. Funny enough my cousin once asked me if I was on steroids and I thought he was joking lol but he was young, just starting high-school, and I have been pretty &#39;cut&#39; for a long time (pretty lean and lots and lots of pull ups) but any serious lifter would say I am scrawny which is totally fair, the best description I&#39;ve heard for me that makes sense is &#39;wiry&#39;.  I think if I just ate more I probably could get pretty big but whatever, I&#39;ll get to it when I get to it (see: probably never lol).<br><br>Also a side comment on people who said steroid-users must be insecure, I would say there is a good chance that&#39;s true but in my mind it is often the insecurities that push us to supreme levels of things, as an insecurity makes us either completely avoid something or try to contain and deal with it. If you asked a massive body builder if he&#39;s big or sculpted enough, despite what he might say, I would wager he is never satisfied. Satisfaction leads to complacency and complacent people do not strive for excellence (whatever that &#39;excellence&#39; may be - think of anorexic people too as another extreme example). The best athletes look for the holes in their game and work on them, the brightest minds don&#39;t focus on the things they know but the questions they still have unanswered, I think you can find a way to look at most things people do as an attempt to avoid or contain an insecurity, to avoid negative feedback. To me life is a perpetual cycle of sensing insecurities and seeking to contain them which can give some brief positive feedback, but it can never last. We are in a constant avoidance of negative feedback because as an organism this is the only way to survive since it would make sense that the root of all negative feedback is death.", "comment_date": "2019-03-09T17:44:34Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Random Task", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2V7YQhsFo4&amp;t=2m05s\">2:05</a> become this mouse, that&#39;s my game plan", "comment_date": "2019-03-09T16:48:11Z", "likes_count": 98}, {"comment_by": "Caesar", "comment_text": "Hard work and a lot juice.", "comment_date": "2019-03-09T14:32:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "George Quiroz", "comment_text": "fun fact gorillas get strong and bulky on fruits.", "comment_date": "2019-03-09T10:19:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Funny People Productions", "comment_text": "Now there&#39;s 642 genders in 2019", "comment_date": "2019-03-08T22:22:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kumail raza", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2V7YQhsFo4&amp;t=0m01s\">0:01</a> powerpuff girls left the chat", "comment_date": "2019-03-07T21:29:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erty", "comment_text": "So.. you can take them for 1 week and get ONLY the good benefits?

What you do after you reach that point is what separates the men from the boys. Taking steroids and lifting to build muscle past your genetic limit is much harder than being natural. It requires every piece of the puzzle to be in order. Diet, training, supplementation, drugs, and sleep necessarily have to be tuned to a very extreme/mentally taxing degree. 4,000+ calories a day, 4-5+ injections pre-comp a day, a million little tablets to swallow, needing to sleep 10+ hours while on massive doses of tren, on top of grueling workouts that a natural athlete couldn&#39;t hope to copy. Anabolic steroids increase the rate of protein synthesis, so your muscles heal much more quickly. When you&#39;re trying to build supernatural amounts of muscle, you have to train a supernatural amount of times per week. Unfortunately, your tendons and ligaments don&#39;t heal at the same rate as your muscle tissue, which greatly increases your chances of becoming injured. The amount of pain an &quot;enhanced&quot; athlete has to endure dwarfs that of natural lifters as a result of this. All of these things can be done relatively safely while under the supervision of a doctor. Steroids are relatively benign when used by someone who knows what they&#39;re doing and is making an effort to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Steroids are PEDs, not recreational drugs. They were developed to build you up, not tear you down. The most dangerous drugs a bodybuilder takes are diuretics, insulin, designer peptides, thyroid medication, and DNP, not anabolic steroids.

This year, during the winter time, my asthma wasn&#39;t doing me much justice, and I had to go to the hospital, what a surprise. And, I had to take steriods, again, I don&#39;t know what kind, but it did help. But ever since I&#39;ve hit puberty, I&#39;ve seen how large I&#39;ve blown up over the years, and my self-esteem plunged greatly as time passed by. Once, when I was only eight or nine years of age, I was at least nintey-nine pounds and was very self-conscious instantly when I noticed my classmates, and neighbors who were around my age at the time, weren&#39;t bloated like me or anything and I had no clue. Junk food, soda, fast-food, is what I thought of my increase in size. But my grandmother, or mother, don&#39;t recall which one told me that the reason I&#39;d gain so much weight was because of the medication which were the steriods to help my breathing. And now that I have some sort of confirmation on this, I&#39;m truly grateful for this video.
