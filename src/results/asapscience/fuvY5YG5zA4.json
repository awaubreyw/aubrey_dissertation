[{"comment_by": "Bruce Frykman", "comment_text": "This is why &quot;science&quot; should never be taught to school kid with no background in physics, chemistry math skills and critical thinking skills <br><br>The whole basis of this piece of video propaganda is based upon a naive misunderstanding of mechanics.   Even if the average ocean temperatures were rising (this has never been established) such thermal expansion, even if we fancifully accepted their premise has no chance whatsoever of encroaching on shore lines.<br><br>Are the authors even dimly aware of this?    If not they are incompetent, and if they are, then they are  abusing children with fear mongering based solely on evil intent. <br><br>While water, including sea water does indeed increase in volume during some phases of positive temperature  change, in some cases the opposite occurs.  Science for kids is typically filled with such half truth and political propaganda.<br><br>For the record, warming and cooling water does indeed change volume but it does not change mass.   The implications of this simple truth mean that thermal expansion in  confined containers, open at the top, can not expand outwards but only upwards as in the case of their heated pot.<br><br>Guess what, this is exactly the same situation as with the oceans where the &quot;top&quot; is the open atmosphere and &quot;the sides&quot; are the rest of the ocean itself with equal mass with which to contain and confine the presumably heated area. <br><br>This means that no matter what the temperatures of adjacent waters their mass and the pressure of their mass will always confine the thermal expansion/contraction on only the vertical axis of sea waters as their temperatures vary.   No lateral (sideways) movement of sea waters can be correctly attributed  to thermal expansion/contraction.<br><br>In &quot;real&quot; science we refer to this as &quot;column height,&quot; such as in the expansion of mercury within a thermometer.<br><br>In order to determine the amount of thermal expansion/contraction we multiply the column height by the fluids thermal variable coefficient of expansion.    <br><br>The column height  at the shore is effectively zero, if you wade out to your knees, much warmer waters may expand by the width of  a knee high column by a hair (less than 1mm)   but would this be a huge alarm?<br><br>Of course if the upper several hundred meters of deep ocean waters were actually to warm (again only for argument sake) by even as much as a degree,   it might actually cause the several hundred uppermost meters of the ocean to rise by a centimetre or two (1 cm is about the length of a fingernail)  How does this cause alarm ?<br><br>Do you think a ships captain would sound the alarm if the 2.5 miles of water (average depth of the deep sea) under his hull were to rise by a fingernail&#39;s width?<br><br>Waters below the uppermost several hundred meters are constant in temperature and not subject to change in terms of periods of less than can be measured in thousands of years        <br><br><br>You are being misled by your educators, when you begin to learn this you will begin to truly become educated.", "comment_date": "2021-12-28T20:26:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex's Channel", "comment_text": "Fast Forward 8 years \ud83d\ude0e: <br><br><br><br><br><br>Jk, shit is worse.", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T23:50:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anannya Tripathi", "comment_text": "Plzz post something in hindi also.
