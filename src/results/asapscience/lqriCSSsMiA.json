But after I adapted all of that went away.  I learned that I simply had to eat raw spinach or raw broccoli  every other day (basically your dark green leafy vegies).  Also a good amount of marrow &amp; gelatin and lastly, a good amount of animal brains (mussels work well for that).  Calcium is not an important mineral for the teeth but magnesium is. Plants that are deficient in magnesium will have a pale leaf color. Magnesium can be added to the plant diet by diluting a tablespoon of Epsom salt to a gallon of water. When buying produce always buy the greens that are the darkest as they are likeliest to have the most amount of magnesium. Raw broccoli and raw spinach have the best amounts of magnesium for plants that one can readily buy at the grocery store.  People who heed my advice will not ever get pain in their mouth, minor cavities will cure themselves, periodontal disease will not happen,  and there will be no bleeding. Also, because the same plants are high in iron, bruising and anemia will go away.  And, once again, because the same plants are high in (plant-based) calcium, osteoporosis is checked! This advice produces no garbage, just compost! People who follow your advice will endlessly have to buy product that will only end up on a landfill. They will still get cavities and gum disease. They will still suffer a host of other health problems (like anemia) because they are neglecting to ingest the most important nutrients.  And they will still suffer a lot pain in their mouth. I am not convinced that you are really helping people or the planet with this video. These days everyone brushes their teeth and they all get cavities and gum disease and they endlessly have to afford the dentist, so obviously the &quot;brushing the teeth&quot; thing is total nonsense and it will not save you from a ton of dental bills.", "comment_date": "2020-12-20T15:15:20Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Victoria Gonzalez", "comment_text": "I should watch this every night and morning to scare myself so I can brush my teeth", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T04:53:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "I Love My Dogs572", "comment_text": "hey guys i\u2019ll brb because i forgot to brush my teeth for idk like 635 days if that so ya i\u2019ll see you in like 90 minutes anyway brb", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T16:06:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Taffster7", "comment_text": "who else licking their teeth while watching", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T08:19:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joryerlin Martinez", "comment_text": "Wtf?

Sometimes I don&#39;t brush because I feel like it doesn&#39;t make any long term difference for me. The plaque is removed but I still have yellow teeth and bleeding gums. I wonder if toothpaste companies lie to sell their products. I&#39;m really tired of trying. I&#39;m only 20, and I&#39;m worried I might not have teeth when I grow old.

Pockets that measure 1-3 mm are considered healthy. 4 mms and onward would require a deeper cleaning at a dental office and this is purely to save the bone from further resorption and to restore the gums to a healthy state. There are different kinds of deep cleanings they can diagnose patients with and this depends on each individuals case. Hope this was helpful to someone.

I greatly appreciate you guys trying to teach people science and in this instance, oral health. As a professional there is misinformation here on the etiology of cavities and gum disease. Please consult with a dentist (not a hygienist or dental assistant) and the relevant dental associations before releasing another kind of dental video. I am happy to point you guys in the right direction. Some of the sentences also don&#39;t have scientific evidence especially the paragraph on cavities leading to gingivitis, which they don&#39;t, it is not a cause and effect here. Both cavities and gingivitis/periodontitis can occur at the same time as their disease etiology are not mutually exclusive. The etiology is bacteria and biofilm that release by-products or cytotoxins leading to tissue destruction as a result of either lactic acid or a non-specific inflammatory response. I am not going to point out all the issues but next time, please consult with a dental professional not just do your own research. First I want to point out, where is the mention of flossing at the end? If cleaning your teeth with brushing is so important, why not clean in between your teeth? Your audience is probably young teens and millenials, they may take this information and say, look it&#39;s all about brushing not flossing since the video doesn&#39;t even mention brushing and flossing in conjunction. Most importantly, if dentists are the experts, why don&#39;t you go in for a check up every year? You&#39;ve mentioned the rapid deterioration of tissues, yet the most important way to combat this is not with brushing, flossing, diet, it&#39;s seeing a dentist that can appropriately consult on proper oral health, diagnose, and determine the etiology if damage is already present. Where is the mention of xrays in conjunction with dental exams which provide a significant amount of diagnostic information for both cavities and periodontitis? Remember kids, teeth are stronger than your bones, teeth don&#39;t hurt until it&#39;s too late. We don&#39;t go through 4 years of undergrad and then 4 years of dental school to do the kind of job anybody can do or what anybody can look up on the Internet to self-diagnose, it is an expert field of medicine.

Billions of people live in poverty. While people in developed first world countries generally have better dental health, if this video were true all impoverished third world citizens would have terrible teeth or none at all, which isn&#39;t the case. In fact while in more remote areas of Central America I&#39;ve met people who&#39;ve rarely ever brushed their teeth, and they looked just fine. I&#39;ve also either watched videos or seen pictures of people with literally nothing in places like Sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia and some of them have the whitest teeth you could imagine. Of course these people also eat WAY less sugar than we do over here in the first world, but still. This video is blowing it out of proportion.

They are basically saying your teeth will rot out if you don&#39;t brush for a month which is just ridiculous. In their juul video they said each pod costs $16 when its really $16 for 4 pod (last time I checked there was never a correction and that was a significant argument in their video).

I was in the dentist with the I guess pro dentist? He was the one who is above everyone who makes sure your teeth are good after the other dentist cleans them... anyway he ended up spending 2 hours scraping my teeth and all of them said you have to brush twice a day. I brush once a day after dinner when I take a shower and I use a whiting tooth paste. I floss, brush my tung and wash my mouth with mouth wash... But my teeth are still stained yellow. I talked to my dentist and I went in a few weeks later and he said it would be nearly impossible to make my teeth white. And that they where stained badly.

Cavities (or caries) has a different disease pathway than gum disease (gingivitis/ periodontitis). Sure, not brushing/ flossing can lead to either one, but caries and gingivitis develop separately. Gingivitis/ periodontis is a painless chronic inflammatory disease in reaction to bacteria near the gumline causing gum and bone attachment loss. This leads to the eventual loosening of teeth. However, I&#39;ve never heard of strong evidence linking it to erectile disfunction, dementia, and other diseases noted in the video. There is strong evidence of it being associated with diabetes and bacterial endocarditis. The caries process is not an inflammatory response. It is caused by a drop in pH due to the byproduction of acid produced by Strep Mutans (video is correct here). The drop in pH weakens enamel which leads to its degradation. The bacteria then finds its way into dentin, then pulp.

According to this video I should already have lost all my teeth and should be about to die. - But smh every dentist appointment so far was a two minute thing where the dentist took a look and gave thumbs up. <br>Don&#39;t know the first thing about dentistry but what little I have heard (from people who know, for varying reasons, a lot more about it than me) it seems there are a lot of conflicting &quot;facts&quot; out there and a lot of outdated knowledge as well as plain old misinformation (and disinformation as far as sponsored studies go). So for me it&#39;s basically another case of: listen to your body.
