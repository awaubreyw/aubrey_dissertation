One advice, never try getting high on caffeine, before you reach that state you&#39;ll experience short of breath for hours and you might feel there&#39;s no air left in the room, followed by a heartburn. Also you can die on overdosing without reaching the point of hallucinations, or if u have a weak heart and weak body metabolic rate a little more than 1000mg of black coffee in a go can cause serious heart issues that can cause death. I&#39;ve had 1000mg of a coffee in a go to stay up all night and couldn&#39;t breathe till hours later followed by terrible heartburn and headache.<br><br>If you want to get high and don&#39;t have access to any safe way to do so don&#39;t sleep for three days straight, have a packed schedule. At some point you will hallucinate and it will be like a &#39;high&#39; but i doubt you&#39;ll enjoy the euphoria will be temporary, dopamine released in your body will make u feel relaxed but you you won&#39;t be able to enjoy it bcz to reach that state you will have to force yourself to stay up when your body is in dire need of sleep, if your brain is relaxed enough to enjoy the high you&#39;ll feel asleep already without enjoying the high", "comment_date": "2022-04-09T14:58:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis Ortiz", "comment_text": "Coffee helps with my bowels but doesn\u2019t keep me awake", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T16:28:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Giannelli", "comment_text": "The nutritional synergy of coffee will energize your metabolism, torch fat, and give you energy all day long.  @t", "comment_date": "2022-04-07T21:34:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "THEPLANETEARTH", "comment_text": "Why is no one talking about reduced blood flow to brain!", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T11:33:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fernando Ruiz", "comment_text": "I hate coffee but caffeine is great.

Immediately after my first sip, the symptoms came. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing and being more upbeat than I\u2019ve ever been (the only similar situation i\u2019ve experienced, not even half the amount of, uncontrollable laughter was after a 360 degree pirate ship ride and the laughing only lasts 3 hours max). The symptoms persisted for two hours and got worse, I began laughing more and dizziness spells began. The laughter calmed once more and the dizziness spell stopped for a few minutes after an hour until I got home. I started laughing, crying, shaking, making facial expression, making odd sounds for two hours with the dizziness and headache as my first and only warning before the \u2018episode\u2019. I was kept to the floor, barely even able to sit upright for HOURS until I finally could get myself out of my room to take a shower. Right before I shower, I had a moment of dissociation. After that, all is currently well. As much as i\u2019d like to say i\u2019m never touching caffeine again, I know that this will reoccur one day like all the times before.

Ultimately, the more adenosine there is, the more tired your brain feels. Which makes sense as the longer you\u2019re awake, the more fatigued you become. Conversely, while you sleep, the concentration of adenosine declines, gradually promoting wakefulness.<br><br>3 \u2013 But it turns out that the caffeine in your coffee is incredibly similar to adenosine in structure. The caffeine works its way through your bloodstream and into your brain where it starts to compete and combines with adenosine receptors. But because it\u2019s not adenosine, the sleepiness effect isn\u2019t felt. Adenosine can no longer bind, meaning its calming properties are diminished. Which is great for you when you\u2019re feeling tired.<br><br>4 \u2013 However, with long term use of caffeine, your brain responds by creating more adenosine receptors, which means more caffeine is required to elicit the same response. It also means that when you try to quit drinking coffee or miss your daily intake, you might experience some withdrawal symptoms and feel more tired than you would have before you ever drank coffee. But the caffeine doesn\u2019t stop there.<br><br>5 \u2013 It also stimulates the production of adrenaline \u2013 you know, the fight or flight hormone. This increases your heart rate, gets your blood pumping and even opens up your airways. Furthermore, it affects dopamine levels by preventing its reabsorption in the brain, which makes you feel happy. In fact, this is the exact same thing that cocaine does, just to a lesser degree. It\u2019s a drug after all.<br><br>6 \u2013 This dopamine stimulation is also the aspect of coffee that makes it moderately addictive. So, can you drink too much coffee? It turns out there is a lethal dose of caffeine, which is somewhere around 150 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of your body. This means if you weigh 70 kilograms, you require 14,000 milligrams of caffeine to overdose.<br><br>7 \u2013 Put into perspective, an average cup of coffee contains roughly 150 milligrams of caffeine. Meaning if you\u2019re 70 kilograms, approximately 70 cups of coffee would kill you. However, you would have to drink those cups all at once, making it effectively impossible to overdose on caffeine from coffee, since you wouldn\u2019t be able to physically fit that much in your stomach.<br><br>8 \u2013 You would also start experiencing mania and hallucinations before getting to this point. Caffeine also has a half-life of around 6 hours. So, if you drank a standard coffee with around 150 milligrams of caffeine, after about six hours, there would only be around 75 milligrams left in your system and you\u2019ll be feeling half of the effect.<br><br>9 \u2013 And 6 hours after that, you\u2019ll have 37.5 milligrams, leaving more room for adenosine to jump back into action, which is why you may reach for another cup throughout the day to remain that glorious alert and energetic feeling. So, drink up and enjoy the buzz while it lasts.<br><br>10 \u2013 And for all of you who are in school, while we know that caffeine is key, so are good deals on textbooks.

Shall learn how that works, whether S&#39;s have too much Dopamine and feel a need for more, or whether S. make them crave Dopamine to manage the lows, the rigidity, exhaustion, depression and anxiety.<br> Am wanting to intervene  before they get  locked into psych. ward again.  Am knowledgeable in  natural health matters and can help theoretically, b\u00fat not in how to deal with such a strong-minded one. Esp since having been sleep-deprived and traumatized for decades myself and not being thick-skinned and not deeply stable. I can somewhat s\u00fammon calm, warmth, groundedness for some time, but if abused and a lot of shouting and  abuse, I get shaky,  stressed out with symptoms from y Kidney system. Can&#39;t drink coffee, and was dissuaded to by Dr. <br>I&#39;ll see what line of action to go for, no coffee, which the poor system certainly needs, or let them keep a cup a day so as not to be too unhappy and revolt from natural anti-psychotic treatment. I hope to get help from above; would need to be much healthier myself. But can&#39;t see them destroy themselves, also with sugar, Coke and NO water drinking at all. I wonder that they are alive and functioning at all, but it might click and stop any time, or cause the outbreak of serious self-inflicted disease. Already happened, by the sound of symptom mentioning, but I mean: really bad. Even Sudden Adult death.  Because there is broken heart, depression, unemployment and being let down by professionals and struggled in isolation/loneliness for many years as well, which aggravates any state/effect of abuse, since it impairs the immune defense in a human being..<br>I dislike palying the police/ restricting role, would much rather stroke with the hairs to maintain good rapport. But on the higher, real plane, responsibiity id\u00b4s better and the right thing, I have to sacrifice.  I mu\u00edght find juste the right angle of approach. <br>Key is: to stay calm,<br>grounded, warm, understanding, non-judgmental, be as supportive as possible in other areas than the self-destructive behaviours,<br> addressing his own activities at intending to detoxify by sauna (not nearly efficient in a toxin case like his),<br>addressing also his own motivation, insight and attempts at dieting, although he did it by eating his own feces  in delusional state.<br>Even  using manipulation (? is it?) in the service of good, by reminding of his wish to be happy, to be there for the child, to make his hobby work, to see what good life may have in stall if he gives it a chance.  <br>Or simply ask him to  trust me and have a try at my method, to see how it works and go back to his own ways if it seems useless. I really need a month to stabilize and set a treatment&#39;s various fasetts, and to take care of my own illness as well, being in need of personal assistence really?! So... God help us both. it really helps doing a meaningful work helping someone else though. As long as he doesn&#39;t talk nastily to me, diminishing, being prejudiced etc. He doesn&#39;t know me, because we hardly were together, and it was always mostly me who paid real attention wanting to know, understand and help him. <br>I should have a very very hard time forgiving myself if he killed himself, died or got in worse trouble in some other way because I did not do what I could to help. I am planning to go there and stay with him, that being the best way to observe and learn as we go along, and getting well-needed distance from own dire situation as well.<br>I have learnt about solutions for being stuck in such bad life situations, and can also tell him that he can&#39;t get it before being re-hydrated, getting sleep, regular habits (calming for the body) .<br>The biggest challenge will probably be getting him onto a diet for the disease, and also sticking to it once I leave.  Wanting to pay for it too. It is convenient and makes one lazy to be on psych meds (=drugs), and it lulls and ulls the mind down, the I/spirit, weakens the will power and motivation. So awful. <br>I am working at staying inside myself, not feeling too responsible and not identifying too much, and not thinking myself indispensable.   <br>A good thing is that I am down in similarly bad level of health imbalance and help need, which can help him not reacting adversely out of primary shame and humiliation-thinking. Also my ability to understand, soothe and  validate his feelings. <br>What I find impossibly hard is to know how to respond to the delusions: I just can&#39;t bring myself to pretend to agree, like others do. It is convenient for oneself but being truthful is important , extra so for someone having lost touch with parts of reality. I am so grateful that I am now learning the art of listening without responding necessarily, or responding in a more general and ambiguous way, so as to not lie but not offend/awaken shame and feelings of abandonment, not being \u00fanderstood and supported.  by blunt truth. I have a few times, at least not spoken against, and that did not trigger his hurt hateful rage. but seemed to give some confidence/trust. Staying peaceful is important, his nervous system needs rest. I realise , the coffee craze is a kind of stress-blackout,  a loss of control where the mind in isolation is intermittently unable to hold a sensible thought and stick to it, ie the need for sleep and that coffee in a irritated, sick nervous system is. I&#39;ll keep jovial, reminding  of the need to rest and sleep in order to be  frisky to go about social life, hobby and feel joy with life. I just mostly need to find my own self-reliance, esteem, assurance, feel my worth. <br>Thanks for imaginary ears, I have no one to talk with and clear my thoughts.. Wish me luck and him healing.  &lt;3", "comment_date": "2019-02-08T19:26:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scxskjwk", "comment_text": "I get headaches after drinking coffee.

For many, it keeps us awake and moving through our busy days. But how does it work? What exactly does coffee do to your brain?<br><br>2-\u00a0Whenever you\u2019re awake, a chemical called adenosine slowly accumulates in your brain and this adenosine binds to receptors which slow down brain activity. Ultimately, the more adenosine there is, the more tired your brain feels. Which makes sense as the longer you\u2019re awake, the more fatigued you become. Conversely, while you sleep, the concentration of adenosine declines, gradually promoting wakefulness.<br><br>3 \u2013\u00a0But it turns out that the caffeine in your coffee is incredibly similar to adenosine in structure. The caffeine works its way through your bloodstream and into your brain where it starts to compete and combines with adenosine receptors. But because it\u2019s not adenosine, the sleepiness effect isn\u2019t felt. Adenosine can no longer bind, meaning its calming properties are diminished. Which is great for you when you\u2019re feeling tired.<br><br>4 \u2013\u00a0However, with long term use of caffeine, your brain responds by creating more adenosine receptors, which means more caffeine is required to elicit the same response. It also means that when you try to quit drinking coffee or miss your daily intake, you might experience some withdrawal symptoms and feel more tired than you would have before you ever drank coffee. But the caffeine doesn\u2019t stop there.<br><br>5 \u2013\u00a0It also stimulates the production of adrenaline \u2013 you know, the fight or flight hormone. This increases your heart rate, gets your blood pumping and even opens up your airways. Furthermore, it affects dopamine levels by preventing its reabsorption in the brain, which makes you feel happy. In fact, this is the exact same thing that cocaine does, just to a lesser degree. It\u2019s a drug after all.<br><br>6 \u2013\u00a0This dopamine stimulation is also the aspect of coffee that makes it moderately addictive. So, can you drink too much coffee? It turns out there is a lethal dose of caffeine, which is somewhere around 150 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of your body. This means if you weigh 70 kilograms, you require 14,000 milligrams of caffeine to overdose.<br><br>7 \u2013\u00a0Put into perspective, an average cup of coffee contains roughly 150 milligrams of caffeine. Meaning if you\u2019re 70 kilograms, approximately 70 cups of coffee would kill you. However, you would have to drink those cups all at once, making it effectively impossible to overdose on caffeine from coffee, since you wouldn\u2019t be able to physically fit that much in your stomach.<br><br>8 \u2013\u00a0You would also start experiencing mania and hallucinations before getting to this point. Caffeine also has a half-life of around 6 hours. So, if you drank a standard coffee with around 150 milligrams of caffeine, after about six hours, there would only be around 75 milligrams left in your system and you\u2019ll be feeling half of the effect.<br><br>9 \u2013\u00a0And 6 hours after that, you\u2019ll have 37.5 milligrams, leaving more room for adenosine to jump back into action, which is why you may reach for another cup throughout the day to remain that glorious alert and energetic feeling.

I&#39;ve stopped eating breakfast because it would make me sick and whenever I&#39;m driven to school I stop by Dunkins get a medium ice coffee. It gets me through the day but also makes me feel a bit sick at times. I often have to chug it down if a certain teacher will not allow me to drink it. It&#39;s very rare I eat lunch because the school food is absolutely disgusting. Sometimes my mom will be out doing errands and bring me home another medium iced coffee and I will drink that too, often times getting jitters. About a third of the nights at home my mom cooks (only things like spaghetti, tacos, an old family recipe, and meats with rice greens and or mashed potatoes - those nights are my favorite) we are very poor and my parents are often busy. I&#39;m never really hungry because my stomach is filled of liquid until it&#39;s too late at night to do anything about it. Writing this all down really shows me how terrible this habit might be.

I turned to my friend and said, &quot;I think were going to need an oven and fast.&quot; <br>He grabbed me with his soggy fingers and said.. &quot;Snap out of it, Man.&quot; <br>Then he proceeded to chant and walk in circles around me. <br>I looked down, My pants were still on fire, but by this time it had spread to my Uterus and three other ligaments. I was getting pretty agitated that no one seemed to care about my third degree burns, or my soon imminent death, but I went along with his plan still hoping he&#39;d manage to save me through his voo-doo witchcraft. <br>After I came out of my trance from the fire I noticed that I was now in the kitchen of my grandma&#39;s house baking a cake.. <br>I Screamed &quot;WHAT THE F***?&quot; <br>My Grandma ran in and slapped the s*** outta me for cursing. <br>Then she proceeded to say, &quot;I swear if you talk like that 5 more times, I&#39;ll beat the living s*** outta you.&quot; <br>I was quite confused as to what was going on and what I did to deserve this true life mad lib. I just stood there in silence with a look of uttermost confusion.. and I starred at the women who had once been a kind sweet old lady, who wouldn&#39;t even kill a baby piglet, now turned into this vicious beast of a monster with veins protruding from her neck like a porcupines quills on a midsummer day. <br>She gasped, and then with the blink of an eye turned back into the sweet old lady I had once known. <br>&quot;Would you like some cookies, dear?&quot; <br>&quot;Ummm Yes, grandma.&quot; <br>As she went to retrieve the cookies, I was planning my escape.. Looking around pondering what unimaginable thing would happen next if I stayed. As my grandma neared the corner with her plate of cookies, I ran to the door as fast as my burning legs would take me. <br>As I made my silent escape I heard grandma yell, &quot;You forgot your cookies dear&quot; <br>Little did she know I didn&#39;t give a s*** about those cookies. As I ran I thought about my previous life and how this whole day had been more interesting than my Whole entire life on earth had.. I began to ponder if this was karma kicking my a** for just sitting on the laptop all day typing short stories for little to no pay. When I decided to stop and catch my breath, I wiped the sweat from my face and looked up to see what else this new world had to offer. <br>Far off in the distance I could see a huge building, maybe a hotel or some sort of jail. I wasn&#39;t too sure.. but I marked that location off my list, the last thing I needed was to go to a jail and get killed by a bunch of mobsters.. I mean Hell my pants were already on Fire. <br>I decided to turn to my left and see what my next choice would be. <br>There were flying cantaloupes, rainbows and songs of happiness near by, I mean I was a little frightened by the flying fruit but I&#39;ll take this any day over Prison inmates. <br>I skipped closer and closer to the festivities and when I arrived I seen all my friends I had went to high school with there were holding hands and singing Kumbayah around the camp ice.. Yes It was a giant block of ice situated on three wood logs.. I felt much more comforted here than I did at my grandmas. I took a deep breath of relief and I thought Maybe, this day is getting better. I joined hands and with Germany and Tokyo and began to sing with everyone else, but as soon as I Belched out my voice changed to an annoying high pitched squeal.. Similar to ringing in your ears. <br>Everyone turned toward me and gave me the death stare and I knew I had screwed up once again, they all walked in slow motion towards me saying the same familiar chant I had heard earlier, before anyone could reach me I awoke in a frantic sweaty rush in my bed.. My legs were no longer on fire and I felt slightly normal again. I noticed that my mom, a preacher, and several other family members were standing around me sobbing and chanting.. I said. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; They informed me that I had been possessed by a spirit named Robert that liked to make people crazy by making there dreams seem similar to real life, only completely insane. They told me that I had been very lucky to be through such a traumatic experience and live to tell about it, without needing to be put in a psych ward. I turned to the preacher and said.
