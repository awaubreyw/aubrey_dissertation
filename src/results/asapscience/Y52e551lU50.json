I used to only drink Soda and milk for many years of my life (not during the same meals of course).

Though water being around also has other uses as well, especially if you want to clean something off quicklike, so even more reason to carry around water.<br><br>Here are some things I ran into for drinking 3-5 cans of Coca Cola a day:<br>1. You get a film built up on your tongue as well making it so everything does not taste as good.<br>2. Soda (or anything really acidic) is really bad if you want to do vocal work of any kind. So you get a scratchy throat muuuuch faster, and it&#39;s harder to do different sounds with your throat.<br>3. I was always tired.. It was so bad that I got detentions all the time for being late to school, or falling asleep in class. Sometimes I would start dreaming even in my favorite classes, it was just impossible to stay awake!. There were other reasons making me tired, but soda was one of the largest reasons why. Though it does take several weeks (sometimes a month or two) of not drinking soda to not feel tired due to not drinking soda.<br>4. Soda is really expensive! Especially if you compare it to water, which can be free a lot of the time.<br>5. Certain food combinations with soda do very strange things to you. Since I love yogurt, I had it with soda one time, and it felt like I could move my teeth around (but didn&#39;t hurt), it was very strange. I can only imagine what other strange stuff soda can do when combined with other foods in your stomach.<br><br>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other reasons I&#39;m not thinking of that happened to me, but that&#39;s just off the top of my head. Basically just do not drink soda.... at least regularly.

I&#39;m glad this video provided a case study and some facts on what effects you might get out of drinking only soda. I myself am not a scientist, but would have offered a sort of disclaimer in the description or in the video. A disclaimer or clause that stated how ones individual effects could be different from an others. Genetics plays a role in determining someones susceptibility to certain issues, either good or bad. I may not have noticed something indicating results may vary, or it may be common knowledge. The reason I bring this up is in my experience is someone who only drinks soda in addition to smoking cigarettes for at least 20 years completely contradicts the video. To the best of my knowledge has fine teeth, looks younger than those of their age group, is very slender and has no other health issues. I do believe that further down the road complications will arise, but I would include something stating that the outcome is subject to other external factors as well. The video is presented in a way to persuade the audience that the outcomes are certainties. I did hear the word &quot;can&quot; used twice and  &quot;may&quot; used once,  not counting the quotes of research data and an example. Overall solid job and keep the videos coming as it brings awareness to things people may overlook (2.7+mill views at my count).

A body can learn over years to work with what it&#39;s given (to some degree).  Consider the Japanese eating only fish and rice their whole lives with no change in diet.  Same amount, same times, etc.  They can live upwards of 100 years with obvious vitamin deficiency, perhaps only trace amounts.  There is something to be said on consistent diet, even if it&#39;s deficient.  I argue this because I&#39;ve seen empirical data in family members and in my travels.  Meanwhile, the &quot;food pyramid&quot; rotates on its axis every 20 years or so I&#39;ve noticed.  Health agencies aren&#39;t completely certain of short-term findings and studies.

I did not drink water, but did drink milk and sometimes (I am guessing when dehydration was really bad) chewed crushed ice. The addiction to caffeine has made quitting all together very difficult. <br>I was about 130 lbs (I stand 5&#39;3&quot;) when this trend started as a result of my employer allowing &#39;free&#39; fountain sodas but not the juices. So, I drank the free stuff. by the time I left that job I was about 160 lbs. Over the next 4 years I ballooned up to 235 lbs and was too heavy to do much physically. I was dehydrated even though I didn&#39;t know it and was plagued by UTIs.<br>Then I saw a photo of me, full body and wanted to cry. :( <br>The next day I bought my usual 12pk soda but this time bought a 6 pk WATER. If I wanted a soda I HAD to drink a water... the WHOLE bottle. No leaving a &#39;bit&#39; at the bottom of the bottle. This helped a lot!!!!<br>A week of this and I had already lost about 5#. Then I headed to the park down the road and at 4 am I was waddling (your kidding right? I did NOT walk or run at that size I was fooling only me.) I waddled as fast as I could and now and then I&#39;d jog a few steps. Eventually it was the mind game again. &quot;Run from 2nd base to 3rd and you can walk to Home&quot;  then it was run one base line walk the next until I was jogging the whole way around. <br>I would reward my self with a sneakers now and then but not every day. The protein was a little helpful, and I was actually starting to burn a lot more than I was eating. I was trading bowls of Capt Crunch for bowls of salad. And all treats had to be &#39;earned&#39;. It took about 5-6 months and I was down to about 150. <br>I did pretty good over the next couple of decades, though my fight to stay off the Pepsi was never over. At current I am back up to 220, mostly due to new job over the last 2 years that has me sitting all night at my computer and then me, sitting at my computer all day and sleeping as well. The Pepsi is back but I am also back on the mind game of a LITER of water to earn a 20 oz soda. I know I need to get up and MOVE. :( But alone  at 53 I find motivation lacking. Currently I am looking into walk and hike clubs around the city I live in and I must say there are more than I thought. Going through them I am sure I will find one or two to fit my needs. :) <br>I know that caffeine is really bad for you but when I try to go a whole day with NO soda, I will take a caffeine pill to keep the headaches away.", "comment_date": "2016-03-09T17:45:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xx_SarBear_xX Nirvana", "comment_text": "U don&#39;t actually need to drink eight glasses of water a day", "comment_date": "2016-03-09T07:43:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "QwertyuiopThePie", "comment_text": "In this comment section: Hordes of people bragging about how superior they are because they don&#39;t drink soda.", "comment_date": "2016-03-09T04:43:22Z", "likes_count": 197}, {"comment_by": "Leslie Corral", "comment_text": "shoot how can I loose all the air in my stomach in order to loose weight I am not fat but not skinny I am in the middle I am a 12 year old girl and I really want to become fit but hate eating vegetables plz help", "comment_date": "2016-03-09T02:34:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bonjour_01", "comment_text": "Okay Weight gain I don&#39;t think so i&#39;m skinny and I drink Tons of Mtn.Dew a DAY!!!", "comment_date": "2016-03-09T01:32:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bonjour_01", "comment_text": "Oh Oh No They Caught me   (I Only Drink Pop", "comment_date": "2016-03-09T01:30:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FreeRoamer", "comment_text": "there is also sodium benzoate in soda pop which reacts with vitamin C into benzene (which may cause cancer)!", "comment_date": "2016-03-08T21:51:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Candice Ballesteros", "comment_text": "And, I dont even drink 3 glasses of water a day", "comment_date": "2016-03-08T16:03:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Candice Ballesteros", "comment_text": "Well, there wasnt a day i didnt drink atleast 2 bottles of coke a day.", "comment_date": "2016-03-08T16:02:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MinecraftMarcus1", "comment_text": "Pretty gross but do one on what would happen to your feet if you never changed socks", "comment_date": "2016-03-08T04:37:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amanda Schmidt", "comment_text": "Havnt had soda since 2008 \ud83d\ude0c", "comment_date": "2016-03-07T17:35:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hung", "comment_text": "Soda ages?

Orange juice does have other micronutrients but that doesn&#39;t mean that sucking down loads of calories and sugar from 100% fruit juice is good for you though. While we&#39;re at it they have approximately similar pH levels. Besides that the idea of suggesting that anyone substitute soda and drink 8 glasses a day because that&#39;s the recommended amount of water is also outdated. There&#39;s no current medical evidence that we need 8 glasses of water to be healthy. Your body can extract water/hydration from many sources. You don&#39;t need to give your hyponatremia. Do yourself a favor. Eat a balanced diet. Eat a variety of nutritious foods, not too much, mostly fruits and vegetables and you will be fine. You can still drink some soda.
