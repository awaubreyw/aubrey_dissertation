The real reason poor posture feels good is your body adapted to want to be like that.

You will love them. When you exercise you make other muscles do work for those compensations so you may gain better posture but you wont love it cause your body is still compensating just the larger muscles are able take on other functions to some extent.

The reason why, she explained, that you need to have your back straight most of the time, is because if you are leaning forward, it puts stress on the spine, as all of those mechanisms are supposed to keep your head from falling off, and if you are slouching, all of that weight instead of being directly on top of your spine, is pulling your spine downward, which is not built for. Yes, changing around your position throughout the day is also optimal, which is why it&#39;s standing desk is typically suggested, because people tend to adjust their position more when they&#39;re standing, because they are proactively using more muscles than if they were sitting. I could also speak from experience, sitting in a slouching position really does hurt the spine, it feels comfortable at first for sure, but oh my gosh, after several hours of doing that for about a week? That&#39;s a road for pain. I&#39;ve actually been going through healing after being in bad posture while doing my art job, sitting down all day drawing everyday, because of my posture issues. The best way to medicate this, is not just to have proper posture most of the time, but also move around every once in awhile. Set up a timer for every 20 minutes, and then set up the timer for 5 minutes for your break. After the 5 minutes, do another 20 minutes, and do this repeatedly throughout the day. This will make you more efficient, in mind and body. It will also lead to less pain, since the human body was never designed to do one thing all day everyday.", "comment_date": "2022-02-06T02:49:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Hanson", "comment_text": "It&#39;s like anything in life.
