This is an example of the limitations of language.

The same with snakes. I&#39;ve kept many as pets, and while I wouldn&#39;t willingly go out and touch a dangerous (poisonous) one, I&#39;ve caught and moved many a black snake to a safer place. Now, the spiders are easily explained as I was never taught to fear them. The snakes, however, are not so clear as my mother didn&#39;t like them and my father was borderline phobic of them. So why am I not fearful/disgusted by them?
