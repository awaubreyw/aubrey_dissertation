Water is H2O, three specific atoms in one configuration. Think of it as a key. Where your body has a keyhole that H2O fits into, adding other things &quot;around&quot; it like salt (NaCl) does nothing to change it from being H2O. If it did, your key wouldn&#39;t fit that keyhole anymore.", "comment_date": "2012-09-09T18:08:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DaChallengeMe", "comment_text": "gayest voices ever", "comment_date": "2012-09-08T13:24:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "0xan4xan0", "comment_text": "Dat Lisp ", "comment_date": "2012-09-08T08:58:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cazyroz", "comment_text": "I have been wondering this ever since I started drinking coffee :)", "comment_date": "2012-08-30T11:49:00Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "senseiwaffle", "comment_text": "Well.
