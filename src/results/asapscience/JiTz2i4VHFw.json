I never really paid attention that our brain works in different ways which are called fast and slow. It was very interesting for me that the fully engagement of the slower thinking makes your brain turn almost colorblind. As you are concentrated to an object, which makes you think deeper, thus, your brain ignores other details around it. I did not notice this until after watching the video. In fact, when one sees an object, they can figure what the object is. Although for example the math problem, when you try to solve it, your brain travels from the fast thinking into slower thinking.

I indeed didn&#39;t notice the color change, but I never notice colors (unless they&#39;re pointed out or I intentionally focus on color for some other reason) because of my detail blindness. I did notice the numbers changed on the right in my peripheral vision but didn&#39;t bother considering the significance. I didn&#39;t notice the last one jumped to +3 until you were pointing out the color change.<br><br>I didn&#39;t consider 10\u00a2...

First I had to remember what story you were talking about, then I had to remember the question to figure out what you were asking exactly, then you said it was Noah so I couldn&#39;t keep thinking about it because you already gave me the answer. I believe there is a good chance I&#39;d have noticed it if given more than 1 second.

Sure I could see the context and figure out they meant B, it takes a moment but a very short one. Well actually if you hadn&#39;t pointed it out maybe I would have assumed it was a 13, I&#39;d have considered it could be B quick enough but it&#39;s not that unheard of for a code to contain letters and numbers and there was no real context given so I may have assumed it was a code rather than the first 3 letters of the alphabet and made the judgement that 13 was more likely than B. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever interpret 13 as B in that other context under any circumstances, I&#39;d just read 12 13 14 and not question it.<br><br>I didn&#39;t imagine anything about Ann because I was thinking about the letters and numbers still when you started talking about what I imagined about the phrase which I hadn&#39;t even read yet.

Also, I read his &quot;ABC&quot; as &quot;A13C&quot; and was quite confused! XD And I didn&#39;t picture a woman approaching a bank, my brain ignored that ( probably still hung up on the &quot;A13C&quot; and trying to figure out what the letters and numbers meant. ) I think if anything the central sentence was being analyzed for being an acronym or some sort of word puzzle. Also, to be fair I&#39;ve visited about as many bodies of flowing water as financial institutions, it&#39;s more like I&#39;ve just been taught to associate the financial institution with the word &quot;bank&quot;, rather than the edge of the river which probably would&#39;ve come to mind as &quot;shore&quot;. Also the priming bit was interesting... I don&#39;t think my brain is quite normal, though. This instance, and indeed most instances, of priming work on me just fine but it fails noticeably more often than for most. It&#39;s why I have difficulty picking up on context of a situation intuitively and often have to ask for repetition and why I need orders to be as direct, literal, and contextualized as possible. I&#39;ve genuinely done the wrong thing when told to do something because I failed to pick up on what I was being asked to do.", "comment_date": "2017-08-02T06:07:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Katelyn Dorry", "comment_text": "&quot;You&#39;ve likely visited more banks than rivers.&quot;<br><b>Lives in Minnesota</b><br><b>Nervous Laughter</b>", "comment_date": "2017-07-31T21:18:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Panda TM", "comment_text": "But I saw wash soup and eat soap", "comment_date": "2017-07-31T17:42:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ali Ahmed", "comment_text": "Do you need an ark?
