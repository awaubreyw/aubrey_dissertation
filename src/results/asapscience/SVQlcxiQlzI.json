I used to brag about it, that see I sleep very little, then one of my teachers in my med school showed a graph of sleep vs life expectancy. that graph shows that people who sleep less than 7.5 hours have less life expectancy but vice versa isn&#39;t true, that means people who sleep more than 8-9 hours too had less life expectancy. The graph was at a peak at 7.5-8 hours, my teacher said if you sleep less than 7.5 hours try sleeping 7.5 to 8 hours for a week it will do wonders for you. I tried and here I&#39;m writing my experience, so my brain functioning increased my focus increased dramatically and I was able to study for a longer period with full concentration and from the last 1years, I&#39;m sleeping 8 hours a day. I realised that when I was sleeping less I was far less productive than I&#39;m right now. if I would have started sleeping this way during high school, I would have gotten much better med school than the one I&#39;m right now....<br>Peace \u270c\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-07-10T10:12:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aziz Mand\u0131rac\u0131", "comment_text": "It is like pH meter :<br>0-7 feels like drank<br>7-8 ideal<br>8-14 feels like hibernation", "comment_date": "2021-07-01T20:00:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sana firdous", "comment_text": "Very nice thank you", "comment_date": "2021-07-01T16:48:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "just some person on YouTube", "comment_text": "9 hours dead", "comment_date": "2021-06-29T17:05:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "i like photography", "comment_text": "To everyone watching this video after 1:00AM: GO TO SLEEP", "comment_date": "2021-06-29T03:53:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mnotho Msweli", "comment_text": "When you have ADD the brain still shows you flames", "comment_date": "2021-06-28T19:09:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "drwilsonstoenailpolish", "comment_text": "None, sleep is for pussies", "comment_date": "2021-06-28T16:22:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "artphile", "comment_text": "Asoiaf was the least expected thing i would have ever believed to see in this vid.", "comment_date": "2021-06-28T06:51:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TilledRaptor 89", "comment_text": "Me up at 4 I the morning and having to get up at 10", "comment_date": "2021-06-26T07:59:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Short meditation \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "comment_text": "School: <b>since when do students need sleep?

We all know the feeling. Irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are, you didn\u2019t sleep enough last night. Or the past few nights, but what exactly is enough sleep and more importantly, can you ever catch up on it? While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it\u2019s necessary to function efficiently and productively.<br><br>2 \u2013 After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night by assigning groups of people to 4, 6 and 8 hours of sleep over extended periods of time. After 14 days, those with 8 hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses or cognitive issues. However, those with 6 or 4 hours of sleep showed a steady decline.<br><br>3 \u2013 In fact, after only two weeks, the 6-hour group showed a similar reaction to a person with the blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The 4 hour sleepers suffered even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of levelling off. Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as Sleep Debt.<br><br>4 \u2013 So can we recover from it? After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more nights of quality sleep. On the time scale of months to years, it\u2019s unknown whether brain function can be fully repaired or if it causes permanent damage.<br><br>5 \u2013 Paradoxically, with chronic sleep deprivation, your sleepiness, or how tired you feel does eventually level off, meaning that you become less and less aware of your objective impairment over time. So how long should you sleep? Most studies tend to show that 7 to 8 hours is the average ideal for humans. Apart from the cognitive issues, individuals who consistently sleep less than 7 hours a night have an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes.<br><br>6 \u2013 Not to mention, a 12% higher risk of death. On the flipside, studies have shown that while sleeping more than 8 hours does not impair brain function, it also carries an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes and a 30% increased risk of mortality. So, too much sleep may also be a bad thing. But variation most certainly exists and our genetics play a large role.<br><br>7 \u2013 In fact, individuals genuinely unaffected by only 6 hours of sleep were found to have a mutation of a specific gene. When scientists genetically engineered mice to express this gene, they were able to stay awake for an extra 1.2 hours than normal mice. It turns out, these short sleepers have more biologically intense sleep sessions than the average person.<br><br>8 \u2013 Ultimately, while it\u2019s important to know the ideal average of 7-8 hours exists, let your body and brain help you figure out its own needs. After all, no one shoe size fits all.

the variation in concentration of the original protein or it&#39;s absence in favor of a different protein.<br><br>See the problem? if by regulating the concentration of one protein you could just

We all know the feeling. Irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are, you didn\u2019t sleep enough last night. Or the past few nights, but what exactly is enough sleep and more importantly, can you ever catch up on it? While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it\u2019s necessary to function efficiently and productively.<br><br>2 \u2013\u00a0After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night by assigning groups of people to 4, 6 and 8 hours of sleep over extended periods of time. After 14 days, those with 8 hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses or cognitive issues. However, those with 6 or 4 hours of sleep showed a steady decline.<br><br>3 \u2013\u00a0In fact, after only two weeks, the 6-hour group showed a similar reaction to a person with the blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The 4 hour sleepers suffered even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of levelling off. Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as Sleep Debt.<br><br>4 \u2013\u00a0So can we recover from it? After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more nights of quality sleep. On the time scale of months to years, it\u2019s unknown whether brain function can be fully repaired or if it causes permanent damage.<br><br>5 \u2013\u00a0Paradoxically, with chronic sleep deprivation, your sleepiness, or how tired you feel does eventually level off, meaning that you become less and less aware of your objective impairment over time. So how long should you sleep? Most studies tend to show that 7 to 8 hours is the average ideal for humans. Apart from the cognitive issues, individuals who consistently sleep less than 7 hours a night have an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes.<br><br>6 \u2013\u00a0Not to mention, a 12% higher risk of death. On the flipside, studies have shown that while sleeping more than 8 hours does not impair brain function, it also carries an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes and a 30% increased risk of mortality. So, too much sleep may also be a bad thing. But variation most certainly exists and our genetics play a large role.<br><br>7 \u2013\u00a0In fact, individuals genuinely unaffected by only 6 hours of sleep were found to have a mutation of a specific gene. When scientists genetically engineered mice to express this gene, they were able to stay awake for an extra 1.2 hours than normal mice. It turns out, these short sleepers have more biologically intense sleep sessions than the average person.<br><br>8 \u2013\u00a0Ultimately, while it\u2019s important to know the ideal average of 7-8 hours exists, let your body and brain help you figure out its own needs. After all, no one shoe size fits all.

However, the amount of sleep itself doesnt need to be high. There are sleep rhythms that maximize the REM phases while minimizing the time wasted sleeping. You can have as little as 2 hours of sleep a day and still be healthy. At least there is no evidence to assume it is unhealthy.

Now it&#39;s ten. Ten is about the time you head into bed and with today&#39;s society you spend about an hour on your phone/laptop again trying to calm your stress levels from the long day. Now you exhausted and decide to read a good book until you finally pass out at 12. Then you have to be awake again at 5am to get ready in time to catch your bus. This gives you a grand total of 5 hours of sleep. Let&#39;s assume you&#39;re doing this 6-12th grades.

I liked the part that where it talked about how the people who get only six hours of sleep a night tend to be able to stay up longer because I find this totally true. I find myself getting tired faster on the nights I get a good amount of sleep than on the nights I only get a few hours of sleep. When it comes to how much sleep you get does that also depend on the hours at night your sleep? Do you get the same effect sleeping from 10pm to 6am as you would sleeping from 3am to 11am? I have heard that that going to bed late and sleeping in late can also be bad for your body, but if you still get the same about of hours of sleep how can it be different?", "comment_date": "2015-12-09T08:28:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jennifer Winchell", "comment_text": "I know that it is important to get 7-8 hours of sleep, but there are very few people I know that actually get that much.

Coming from experience with this I found that sleeping 7-8 hours a night I was more alert and awake for classes,work, and etc. When I was given 4-6 hours of sleep I felt very weak and no energy.

When we are doing tests, or even focused on a project that&#39;s the next day, it&#39;s all on our mind and you get less sleep thinking about it. I know education is important to many, but I still think it is a little too strict to even have Math as a first period for some. Having Math for a first class can usually effect your brain, and even your understanding of what your teacher explains. Many people are constantly going to bed at a time we are suppose to be sleeping, and it&#39;s all about education. Even though it is summer break for many, I just want to address that getting sleep is very important and even if you have tests for school or projects the next day.

Eat more fruits and veggies and less junk food like potato chips and soda. That should alone get you a better sleep because your body has enough vitamins and nutrients to function properly which includes shutting down and having enough energy to wake up in the morning. You could also try allowing your body to shut down 1-2 HOURS before your ideal sleeping time. You can figure that out by what time you want to wake up in the morning. Try to match that out so that you are getting at least eight solid hours of sleep for example if you want to wake up at 7am start winding down for bed at 9pm aiming to be in bed and asleep by 11pm. Some winding down activities you may want to try are; Having a nice hot bath or shower, staying away from electronic devices such as a cell phone or television and instead read a book or do art or knit. You could also do other activities such as yoga or meditation. Try to resist eating anything heavy in the hour before you plan to be in bed but do make sure you have been well fed before you go to sleep because this could result in needing to wake up in the night and interrupting your sleep cycle. Also make sure you have gone to the toilet before you go to bed. It may not cause you to wet the bed but it might also result in waking in the night and also interrupting your sleeping cycle. try to resist doing anything that would cause stress or unease because this can lead to feeling unrested when it is time to wake up. Try to reduce the amount of alcohol or drugs that you consume. You may even want to stop it all together. Especially if you frequently smoke or use tobacco. Believe it or not but STOP DRINKING MORNING COFFEE! It is NOT good for you! It is absolutely terrible for your body to rely on a substance to keep you going throughout the day especially if it&#39;s a caffeinated one! You don&#39;t need it and your screwing up your whole system by telling yourself that you do. You don&#39;t need caffeine! Caffeine may be part of what is causing your sleeping issues! For those who are afraid of the dark (myself included) even though it may be scary DON&#39;T leave the light on at night! This may be what is causing your sleeping problems. Your body needs a good sleep and that may not be achievable if you are constantly in the light. Last but not least try taking Melatonin. For those who have never heard of it Melatonin in a substance in your body that helps shut the body down and prepare it for sleep and wake. Many people who have sleeping issues (including myself) have those issues because they have a lack of melatonin in their body so the easy fix to that is purchasing some from your local drugstore and taking it about a half an hour before you wish to sleep. If you have tried all of these things and nothing has worked consult a doctor. You may need therapy to solve whatever is preventing you from getting the amount of sleep that you need. Also you may be low on iron which can lead to serious issues so take care of your body and ensure you&#39;re letting your body get what it needs to stay healthy.

A wider survey of studies shows this is probably putting the cart in front of the horse. It is more likely that you already have those health issues or are in the developing stages of the disease and you are sleeping more because your body is trying to heal itself. Your body does almost all of its healing and growth work while you are asleep. That&#39;s why if you&#39;re seriously injured or sick, your body wants to sleep all the time. So if you&#39;re sleeping more than 8 hours and are frequently fatigued but aren&#39;t sick (yet), the culprit is probably a combination of overworking, chronic stress, and malnutrition - all of which are <b>known</b> causes of the same diseases mentioned in the video above.", "comment_date": "2014-12-04T09:16:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UNCUT", "comment_text": "weirdly enough I only ever get 6 hours of sleep.

The burden of proof or onus ( probandi) is on the one asserting a claim. You can&#39;t prove a negative in the field of logic. One person on here said in response to the many who suffer from insomnia that God has said in the bible that, and I am paraphrasing, god realizes we humans need rest and if you have faith he will provide that. REALLY? So I asked her then what is god doing? There are many people suffering all sorts of parasomnias on this YouTube comment section. Either he doesn&#39;t care to give them rest or does not have the power to do anything about it. She quotes a bible verse from Corinthians I believe. So I challenged her based on the obvious fact that people are suffering from sleep disturbances and have been for quite a while. So where is gods help? She is putting forth a positive argument. God exists-He says you need rest-he will provide that rest. The opposite position is that perhaps god does not exist. This is the negative. You cannot prove a negative. The onus is on the one asserting the notion of gods existence. Have you been suffering from insomnia or other sleep disturbances? If so. The first reply from Ms. Johnson suggests believing in god will take care of that. Has it? Maybe you just don&#39;t believe enough! I would go see someone with a Scientific approach. Say an MD with a specialty in Sleep Disorders. Or you could just keep praying to a god that may or may not exist. She never gave me any proof. I guess I need Faith. But Faith is the belief in something without evidence. That doesn&#39;t make me feel much better. Good luck to you. Hope you get some rest. BTW. I am not an atheist. I am agnostic. I don&#39;t have an answer as to gods existence. I just don&#39;t know. But it&#39;s not my responsibility to prove he doesn&#39;t exist. It was Ms. Johnson&#39;s ( after my reply to her) to prove that. She didn&#39;t respond. I subscribed to her. By the looks of it I am surprised she is religious. She has many song lyrics posted that are misogynistic and highly promiscuous. I have no problem with that. I don&#39;t judge. In fact I like some of the same musical talents as she does.

No little red &quot;standby&quot; lights, no street lights (black out blinds) etc. Reduce sound as much as possible too.. don&#39;t have a computer sitting idle in your room with that buzzing fan noise or external HDDs spinning up etc. Kill sound as much as possible.. get ear plugs to drown out noisy neighbors or house mates.<br><br>Also important is stop eating at least 3-4 hours before you intend to sleep. I also stop drinking anything at the same time, but I always leave a glass of water beside the bed in case I wake up thirsty.<br><br>A good way to help yourself drift off is to take a bath before u intend to sleep.

I find it helps with the quality of sleep :-) Caffeine doesn&#39;t stop me from sleeping but it definitely affects the quality of my sleep.\u00a0<br><br>As for waking up in the morning.. this is one drawback of sleeping in complete darkness.. even after 8 hours u can feel crappy but the trick is to expose yourself to blue light.

In this case, that there is a God or a higher power. <br>Proving a negative is NEVER the responsibility of the one that holds that belief. <br>     This is a fundamental tenant of any entry level college course in Logic. <br>     For example, suppose you are a doctor and you believe there is a new more terrifying form of HEPATITIS. Let&#39;s call it Hepatitis Z.  <br>You have seen the signs and symptoms and the significant differences in this form of Hepatitis in many many recent patients of yours confined to a certain geographical area. You see the disease affecting ONLY the LIVER.               Another doctor has seen the same signs and symptoms in several of his/her patients in this same confined geographical area. However, he doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s a different form of HEPATITIS. This doctor believes it&#39;s a different strain of HEPATITIS C but it is affecting multiple organ systems NOT JUST THE LIVER. <br>     IN THIS HYPOTHETICAL It is the doctor who is attempting to prove the POSITIVE, as in this case, of a totally new disease. In this hypothetical- HEPATITIS Z. <br>     I respect your faith and I am proud we live where you can worship freely. However, I find it is very common when Christians or any religious people are unable to explain very important pillars that support their faith that they basically realize they cannot prove it and then place the burden of proof on the wrong party in this philosophical dilemma. <br>     Thanks for listening to my comment.

It seems those of the religious persuasion are so eager to give knee-jerk explanations based on that &quot;magical book&quot; the bible ! I believe your point was simply that God said you need to rest and when your body needs rest God will provide you with needed rest. The problem is he/she doesn&#39;t always provide. There are all sorts of parasomnias ( scientific medical conditions) : Insomnia, night terrors, nightmares, narcolepsy, interrupted REM sleep, no REM sleep, etc. Just to mention a few. If you read some of the other posts you see that many People are troubled by all sorts of sleep issues and it doesn&#39;t seem God has stepped in just yet. <br>There&#39;s just one thing that bothers me about &quot; FAITH &quot;. The belief without proof is the definition of faith. And to answer serious questions such as these asked by many suffering from sleep issues seems a bit over-simplistic. Believers are quick to say  &quot;Jesus is so loving and wonderful&quot;  when a good thing happens and you then rejoice in the word of God. But as soon as a problem persists or no one can find relief the common retort is well &quot;GOD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS !&quot;  <br>     I apologize for coming off disrespectful to your faith. Honestly, I don&#39;t mean it as it sounds. I am agnostic. I don&#39;t know what the ultimate answer is. Actually 50% of the time I do Believe in a God and the other 50% I simply do not. I know my post seems a gross over-reaction and over emotional. But we live in a world where extreme suffering occurs every second. Murder, rape, terrorism, racism, sexism... The same solutions pop up in those discussions here on YOUTUBE.  Such as &quot; Trust God&quot; &quot;Have Faith&quot;. I am tired of those answers. Now I know we are talking about silly little sleeping bullshit. But when religion or a religious reaction is posted I want to discuss ITS RELEVANCE. <br>     Ms. Johnson. Please accept my apologies if I offended you. I respect your decision to believe in God and whatever your religious convictions are. I may be the wrong one here.

This allows me to stay awake for a whooping 20 hours a day WITHOUT feeling tired or restless. The naps automatically put me into REM sleep (as the video said), and then the 3 hours core sleep is REM sleep also. You only need 4 hours of REM sleep to be fully recovered, and when you finish your REM sleep, you are actually getting tired WHILE you sleep, hence why you wake up sometimes and youre still tired after like a 10 hr sleep. If i sleep 8 hours out of a 24 hour day, then Ive slept 1/3 of the day. if i continue that routine throughout my life, then when Im 60, I will only have been awake for 40 years (60*1/3= 40).
