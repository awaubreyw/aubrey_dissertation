Don&#39;t listen to those who are calling this &#39;propaganda&#39;, or any other xenophobic bullshit people are spouting on about. If the people that commented those things had the same thing happen to them, they would view the issue VERY differently. People should consider Rawls&#39; thought experiment, the &#39;veil of ignorance&#39;:<br><br>People making political decisions imagine that they know nothing about the particular talents, abilities, tastes, social class, and positions they will have within a social order. When such parties are selecting the principles for distribution of rights, positions, and resources in the society in which they will live, this &quot;veil of ignorance&quot; prevents them from knowing who will receive a given distribution of rights, positions, and resources in that society. For example, for a proposed society in which 50% of the population is kept in slavery, it follows that on entering the new society there is a 50% likelihood that the participant would be a slave. The idea is that parties subject to the veil of ignorance will make choices based upon moral considerations, since they will not be able to make choices based on their own self- or class-interest - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance</a>", "comment_date": "2017-07-08T12:12:59Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "sarty", "comment_text": "There is a lot of hatred and fear in these comments.

Although Manus is now shutting down, the lives of those still there may take a turn for the worst, more so than now. Nauru is set to stay and so too are the many still trapped there, unsure of the future. There was one small victory, though, the Australian government has agreed to pay $70 million in compensation to the refugees on Manus in a class action (although they still deny that any physical or psychological abuse had occurred).

I really like the majority of this channel&#39;s scientific content. That&#39;s what I subscribed for, not this. You have another channel for this, Greg and Mitch (previously AsapThought), where you answer more varied kinds of questions, including humanitarian ones. I was actually looking forward to the actual science behind building a refugee camp. Breaking down the materials, the costs, how much time it takes to build, the population it could support, and other stats is what I expected, yet you let me and other fans of yours who were legitimately interested in the science behind this topic down. <br><br>As if that wasn&#39;t enough, what you put out instead of a scientific video was a left-leaning propaganda piece. Normally, I would be hesitant to label anyone&#39;s opinions &quot;propaganda&quot;, but you made it very obvious. You are clearly biased towards refugees here. Now, you have a right to your opinions. I&#39;m not bashing you for having an opinion or for exercising free speech, but I came here for facts. Facts aren&#39;t biased. They tell the truth and leave it up to those who learn the information to come to their own conclusions. We only got facts in the intro, and then we got a few facts about the specific camp you were in throughout the video. If this had been a factual video on refugees and their lives that utilized the camp in Lesvos as a case study without clearly trying to push a political agenda, I probably would have been okay with that. I still would have preferred the science, but I would not be turned off by a video like that.<br><br>I don&#39;t care about your political views, and none of my political views are the reason why I do not like this video. Regardless of whether or not I agree with you, I do not want non-scientific, suggestive material from you guys. Give me the facts and let me come to my own conclusions. I may have been more forgiving if you didn&#39;t title the video the way you did and declared it a special video, but in the video itself you stated, and I quote, &quot;We came here to talk about the actual logistics of building a refugee camp, but you are just consistently meeting people and talking to people and realizing the humanity of it all.&quot; You ignored your goal of educating your audience in an unbiased fashion on a topic in order to push your opinions, and that makes me wary of continuing to subscribe to you.

So here&#39;s a short world history lesson on some key events in history that inevitably led to this... for those who bother to read... :) <br><br>1. Europeans introduced guns and firearms to Africa, leading to increased violence and bloodshed between African empires. This was done in exchange for free labour/slave (aka the Atlantic slave trade) who were usually criminals or people from an enemy tribe. This gave power to a few, inevitably leading to corruption which continues today. Much of Africa was also colonized...<br><br>2. The Atlantic Slave trade was an exploitation of Africans for personal monetary gains. This allowed all those European empires (British, Dutch, Portuguese, French, etc.) to become what they were. Same goes to the rapid growth of the US...<br><br>3. Following the World War I &amp; I was the Cold War. Even though the US and USSR did not fight up front. They fought in proxy wars (i.e. Vietnam, Korea and Afghanistan) After the USSR invaded Afghanistan, the US basically funded what would become the Taliban... which in turn caused the Sept 11 attacks...<br><br>4. In 2003, the US and the UK led the invasion of Iraq to disarm it of &#39;weapons of mass destruction&#39; (WMDs), to end Suddam Hussein&#39;s support for terrorism and free the Iraqi people. They invaded and left Iran in a worse state prior to the invasion. Even though Iraq was going to fail and a revolt was going to happen sooner or later under the constant suppression of Hussein. The invasion was uncalled for. They ultimately did not find the so called WMDs and left the country in a worse state than before. The new government was much more incapable of controlling and administrating the region. The US and the UK undoubtedly profited from the war with the oil from Iran.(Similar to how the West profited from the slave trade) Some discontent by the western invasion of Iraq and destruction of their way of life ultimately went on to form other terrorist groups &#39;to seek revenge&#39; on the West. One of which ultimately became ISIS... The invasion also destabilized the region... <br><br>5. ... which in a way contributed to the Arab Spring. The Civil War in many African and Middle Eastern countries led many to be displaced and flee their homes. ISIS then seized the opportunity of the ongoing civil war in Iraq to occupy a large part of Iraqi territory. They also seized the chance of the Syrian Civil War to invade into Syria and capture a large part of her too. The result was even more people displaced and fleeing from war and destability in the region. <br><br>In a way, all the atrocities that the US and Europe committed in the past has added up into this refugee crisis. Isn&#39;t it weird how the world works and all these events are linked...?<br><br>If you had bothered to read this far and this changed your view about refugees and the refugee crisis.<br>Please make an informed decision/comment :)<br>Feel free to comment about any factual errors.", "comment_date": "2017-06-20T16:39:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ayushman Thapa", "comment_text": "&quot;A bird in a golden cage is not happy.

On the altar of socialism, everything is being offered - freedom of speech, the secular state, bodily integrity, equality of men and women, freedom of sexual preference, financially sustainable public finances (not that the state would not manage to bankrupt itself otherwise, but slower), up to and  including civilization itself. Europe gains nothing from it on a net basis, only huge welfare outflows, cultural degneration and crime. If you want to help these people, use your own money to help them in the climate and culture where they come from, which is a much more efficient use of resources and actually helps all involved instead of this destructive virtue signalling - the real refugees do not have the funds to leave their terrible local circumstances.
