Embryo selection seems like a given to remove known bad genes from the gene pool, until genetic editing becomes more reliable and then we could strengthen existing traits and add new traits. Looking at the bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, we could one day make ourselves resistant to cold, radiation, acid, dehydration, even the vacuum of space. Looking at other members of the Deinococcales family, they have resistance to heat, which would be very helpful for growing crops in the desert. Some scientists have proposed that life on Earth may have been seeded by some of these bacteria, the theory known as panspermia, as they have been proven to be able to live on the outside of the International Space Station.", "comment_date": "2022-04-25T02:48:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emmanuel Joshua D.

Human technology goes through phases. For example, ancient people 2000 years ago in Greece had things like sidewalks, traffic, plumbing (which allowed them to make their own version of internal heating and even early flushing toilets), theatrical special effects, and even geared machinery. However, in spite of all that technology, they still fell and the technology was lost--some of it forever. Mankind had to start over. This has happened in every society where technology advances (to include ancient Egypt and ancient Rome). The people either A) disappear off the face of the planet; B) are conquered by an oppressive government and all technology stops and regresses; or C) their world is destroyed and they are scattered to the winds and/or have to rebuild from scratch elsewhere without the knowledge of how their technology was created in order to reproduce it. It&#39;s sad that some of these technologies are so advanced that modern scientists can&#39;t figure out how they were created, and some go as far to insult the intelligence of the past by saying that it must have been &quot;aliens.&quot;<br><br>One of two things usually happens to create this. Sometimes, like with the people of Pompeii or those who were struck by debilitating disease, nature strikes and wipes them out--or nearly completely. Other times you see that as technology grows, corruption, loose morals, and wasteful living grow alongside it, thus opening them up for conflict whether with rivaling political ideologies internally or by lowering their defenses against outside forces that use the opportunity to attack. <br><br>Today, everyday people who use these technologies call themselves &quot;advanced&quot; when the average person is actually pretty uneducated and knows nothing about how it works or how to recreate it. They&#39;re taking credit for someone else&#39;s genius. How many people do you know can create their own computer from scratch at home? You can probably think of a couple, but here&#39;s another question--can they make all the parts themselves? If the supply, demand, and resources for them has ceased, they may find it nearly impossible. Mass production would be out of the question. That&#39;s assuming you still even have power anymore, depending on how bad the regression is. Lack of knowledge and resources is the problem many ancient people faced when rebuilding. <br><br>Think it can&#39;t happen today? One half of Korea is extremely advanced. In the other half of Korea, most civilians don&#39;t even have power and could executed for killing a draft animal to eat. That&#39;s just the difference in politics. Here&#39;s a better example: Iran was an up-and-coming country only about 40 years ago (Google 1970s Iran). In less than 20 years, they lost it all and regressed centuries in one fell swoop. Only a few remnants of a different era lingered behind in the aftermath.<br><br>Even today, look at the people who are using the technology. Just like in ancient days, emphasis on comfort and wasteful lifestyles are already on the rise in &quot;developed&quot; nations.  People are becoming aggressive towards their OWN citizens, they&#39;re becoming selfish and narcissistic, and make major life choices on how easy or convenient to their everyday lifestyle something is. They let raw emotion and impulse guide their immediate words and actions without thought of consequences or respect of authority. That is the perfect foundation for man-made tragedy mentioned above--and if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, the United States sits on a mega volcano that probably won&#39;t stay sleeping for another 1000 years. If that volcano goes off, there will certainly be survivors--but it will destroy the nation and affect many others. The world market would be destroyed in an instant. Just like before, people would have to go into survivor mode and do what they can to pick up the pieces--and there will be technological losses. <br><br>History goes up and down. We&#39;re on the up swing of technology right now. We&#39;re probably heading for a down swing. You&#39;re more likely to see that in 1000 years, technology is more like a strange mix of current or alternative technology (new technology that replaces the roll of previous ones), a couple minor new technologies, and some that we would consider archaic technology by today&#39;s standards.

All agree that he suffered one of the most gruelling and painful forms of capital punishment ever devised by man. Here is a brief summary of some of the things we know about his last hours from history, archaeology and medicine\u2026 <br><br>Severe stress, even before the abuse began <br>Jesus had the weight of the world on his shoulders. Even before the crucifixion began, he clearly had physical symptoms associated with severe stress. The night before the execution, his disciples reported seeing Jesus in \u201cagony\u201d on the Mount of Olives. Not only did he not sleep all night, but he seems to have been sweating profusely. So great was the stress that tiny blood vessels were rupturing in his sweat glands and emitting as great red drops that fell to the ground (see Luke <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs1uud8HiCQ&amp;t=22m44s\">22:44</a>). This symptom of severe stress is called hematohidrosis.<br> Jesus was physically exhausted and in danger of going into shock unless he received fluids (which he apparently did not). This is the man that the Roman soldiers tortured. <br><br>Torture by beating with Roman scourges <br> Having previously been beaten by the Jews, it was now the Romans\u2019 turn. The beatings administered by Roman soldiers are well known to be very bloody, leaving lacerations all over the body. Romans designed their whips to cut the flesh from their victim\u2019s bodies. These beatings were designed to be painful to the extreme. It would also cause a fluid build up around his lungs. In addition, a crown of thorns was forced into his scalp which was capable of severely irritating major nerves in his head, causing increasing and excruciating pain, as the hours wore on. <br>In Christ\u2019s severely stressed condition, these beatings were easily enough to kill him. His body was horribly bruised, cut and bleeding. Having had no nourishment for many hours, and having lost fluids through profuse sweating and much bleeding, Jesus would have been severely dehydrated. This brutal torture would certainly be sending him into what doctors call \u201cshock,\u201d and shock kills. <br>In addition, Jesus was forced to carry the the wooden beam on which he would die. Imagine the effect of carrying a heavy weight if you were in that condition. <br><br>Crucifixion <br>Hung completely naked before the crowd, the pain and damage caused by crucifixion were designed to be so devilishly intense that one would continually long for death, but could linger for days with no relief. <br>According to Dr. Frederick Zugibe, piercing of the median nerve of the hands with a nail can cause pain so incredible that even morphine won\u2019t help, \u201csevere, excruciating, burning pain, like lightning bolts traversing the arm into the spinal cord.\u201d Rupturing the foot\u2019s plantar nerve with a nail would have a similarly horrible effect. <br>Furthermore, the position of the body on a cross is designed to make it extremely difficult to breathe. <br>Frederick Farrar described the intended, torturous effect: \u201cFor indeed a death by crucifixion seems to include all that pain and death can have of horrible and ghastly\u2014dizziness, cramp, thirst, starvation, sleeplessness, traumatic fever, tetanus, shame, publicity of shame, long continuance of torment, horror of anticipation, mortification of untended wounds\u2014all intensified just up to the point at which they can be endured at all, but all stopping just short of the point which would give to the suffer the relief of unconsciousness.\u201d <br>One doctor has called it \u201ca symphony of pain\u201d produced by every movement, with every breath; even a slight breeze on his skin could bring screaming pain at this point. <br>Medical examiner, Dr. Frederick Zugibe, believes Christ died from shock due to loss of blood and fluid, plus traumatic shock from his injuries, plus cardiogenic shock causing Christ\u2019s heart to fail. <br><br>At the ninth hour (the time at which a sacrificial lamb was killed everyday in the Jewish temple), Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, \u201cEloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\u201d which is translated,\u201cMy God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?\u201d and soon died, after saying \u201cIt is finished.\u201d At about this moment is probably the time when the temple\u2019s priestly ram\u2019s horn would have been blown that day, announcing that the priests had completed the sacrifice of the lamb for the sins of Israel. Also at that moment, the great, thick curtain that closed the Holy of Holies room from view, ripped open from top to bottom. \u2014Mark <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs1uud8HiCQ&amp;t=15m34s\">15:34</a> and Matthew <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs1uud8HiCQ&amp;t=27m46s\">27:46</a> <br><br>James Thompson believed that Jesus did not die from exhaustion, the beatings or the 3 hours of crucifixion, but that he died from agony of mind producing rupture of the heart. His evidence comes from what happened when the Roman soldier pierced Christ\u2019s left side. The spear released a sudden flow of blood and water (John <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs1uud8HiCQ&amp;t=19m34s\">19:34</a>). Not only does this prove that Jesus was already dead when pierced, but Thompson believes it is also evidence of cardiac rupture. Respected physiologist Samuel Houghton believed that only the combination of crucifixion and rupture of the heart could produce this result. <br>There is no question that it was painful beyond words. <br>Biblically, it is clear that Jesus chose and willed His moment of death. That moment was induced not by pain, emotional stress, heart attack, or any other, but by His will. Though fully human, He is also fully divine. As God, He could not die from external sources, but only of His own volition and will. <br>Near the end, a criminal beside him mocked, \u201cIf you are the Christ, save yourself and us.\u201d Little did this sinner know that the man he was speaking to hung there voluntarily. He was speaking to our Creator, capable of releasing all the power in the universe and beyond, and easily saving himself.

Often the messages never reached their destination. We understand almost anything in nature. We can tell how far stars are away from earth by just looking through a giant telescope that we assembled in space. We can fly to places in the world within 15 hours, where 100 years ago it took years to get to. We can predict the weather. We can tell how old a lake is, by digging in its ground, looking for leaves that fell into the lake many years ago. A cellphone from today has more calculating power than the NASA during Apollo 7 (Moonlanding).<br>50 years ago, 4 Megabyte storage capacity weighted around 20 tons. Today there are storage cards that weight around 4 gramm and their capacity is 512 Gigabyte. Thats around 128000 times more.<br>The average lifespan of a human during the black death was 30 years. Today the average lifespan in e.g. Germany is 82 years. <br><br>Just thinking about the progress that is happening right now all over the world blows my mind!", "comment_date": "2017-01-06T17:05:35Z", "likes_count": 106}, {"comment_by": "SquidCake", "comment_text": "Or, everybody will die.

I can answer that with one word, No. Because anyone who seeks the truth will learn we&#39;ve been lied to. The is globe has been indoctrinated sense childhood. Understand me just saying this will have most of you immediately deny the thought without consideration of reality and presumably call me stupid for raising the idea your world is false. There&#39;s nothing wrong with questioning science.. That&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to about, not dogmatic beliefs. Evolution isn&#39;t &quot;fact&quot;. what proof do you think exists? Here&#39;s a wide spreading reality with a preponderance of evidence that is prooving everyday as fact, the Earth is Flat. No spinning globe=no gravity= no evolution.

Beneficial mutations rarely hold if they don&#39;t give the creature a better chance of surviving, which means that it must have a higher survival rate than its predecessor. Again, that means that those without the mutations have to be less likely to survive, and unable to reproduce before death. The only way evolution can work on a large scale, like with 7-15 billion people, is if the species that lacks the mutation that protects them from any given danger, begins to go extinct, giving way for the new, genetically well adapted species to take hold.

If the part about trans humanism is true that is unbelievable with the amount of change it is going to make. Right now people may believe that having little robots in our body is not possible, but the way technology is growing now, anything is possible. It major thing that shocked me that the robots will be able to do is fight cancer. That individually, will impact the world in a tremendous way. It\u2019s sad to say but so many people have been loosing their life to cancer, it seems like more and more are getting diagnosed each day. Not only would it make people healthier, but also many people will be more relieved knowing that there is a cure in the world because that is what everyone has been waiting for. <br>     All of these evolutions are not only changing out surroundings, but also the health of our own bodies.

I&#39;m atheists, that means I&#39;m smart!&quot; Well let&#39;s see spaghetti is an inanimate food object, we can make experiments testing if spaghetti can have physical attributes that would associate it as being a monster.

But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll just find a way to sustain yourself by meeting up with other athiests, searching up sites on the Internet to find people like you, that will encourage you to stick to atheism!
