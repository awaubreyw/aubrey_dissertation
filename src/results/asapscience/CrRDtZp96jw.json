As the ice melts the Albedo effect takes place, that means that the ice melts exposing the dark blue water witch absorbs more heat and causing more melting and that\u2019s one big reason why the arctic is warming twice as fast the rest of the globe. Another thing that\u2019s bad is obliviously a warmer arctic means ice melt thus higher sea levels. Earths has already warmed 1C since 1880. But another degree of warming (witch is accepted by 2050) is just enough to melt all of Greenland\u2019s glaciers. Off course all that melting won\u2019t be immediate however it would melt that much over the course of centuries. But don\u2019t have to see centuries for the waters to rise. Sea levels could rise 1-3 meters or 3-9 feet by 2100. That\u2019s enough to flood major cities like New York, London, Miami, Tokyo and much more. Displaying millions even billions. A warmer arctic also means a weaker polar vortex and a slower wavy jet stream. See the jet stream is strong due to big temperature differences, but as the arctic warms so fast, theirs less of a temperature difference so the jet stream becomes wavier, slower, and further south. This means more extreme weather, like droughts, floods, and storms. That couple with the overall Earths temperature being hotter and heat waves will be much more worst. But a weaker, slower, further south, each jet stream could cause a peace of the polar vortex slip south and cause more extreme cold in mid latitudes in some cases. While it\u2019s unknown if they will be more frequent or not especially because global winters a warming really fast, but definitely something possible. And remember the impacts of global warming all start in the arctic, what happens in the arctic dose not stay in the arctic. And as our planet becomes much hotter due to human activity, the North and South Pole will continue to melt and cause extreme weather and other types disasters around the world. One way to fix it is by reducing our carbon footprint and plant more trees, trillions of them. Our planet has seen major climate extremes in the past, but the current Human Caused Hololence warming is much faster than anything Earth has seen before.", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T21:13:42Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "It'z \u0164wi\u0142yYT", "comment_text": "Quick question,  can a 11 year old sing this petition?", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T09:56:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "salalal", "comment_text": "Why do both look like they are about to cry? <br><br>Ok c\u2019mon why wouldn\u2019t you be about to cry?", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T10:37:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "THE DESTROYER", "comment_text": "They would trade life&#39;s for oil why?

The papers that took NO position are still massively relevant to answering the question *&quot;How many scientific studies/papers we sampled endorsed the THEORY of AGW&quot;*. Nevertheless, even throwing out the papers that took no position, we can see that 73.23% of the papers counted as endorsing the THEORY of AGW were &quot;implicit&quot; (see below).<br><br>100%    3974 Took a position (explicit OR implicit, excludes Category 4))<br>1.61%   64  1, Explicitly endorses and quantifies AGW as 50+% <br>23.20% 922  2, Explicitly endorses but does not quantify or minimise<br>*73.23% 2910 3, Implicitly endorses AGW without minimising it *<br>1.36% 54  5, Implicitly minimizes/rejects AGW<br>0.38% 15  6, Explicitly minimizes/rejects AGW but does not quantify<br>0.23% 9  7, Explicitly minimizes/rejects AGW as less than 50%<br><br>\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4: \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde9\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udff3\ud835\udfef% \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf3 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddec \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf3 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddda\ud835\uddea \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 &quot;\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01&quot;, \ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\udde3\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde3\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddde \ud835\udde1\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde1 \ud835\uddef\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf8 \ud835\uddee\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfa \ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddec \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf3 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddda\ud835\uddea \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude06\ud835\ude04\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude06.", "comment_date": "2020-02-10T00:10:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "HARSHADA KALSEKAR", "comment_text": "I thank you for awaring me", "comment_date": "2020-02-08T04:49:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aya sader", "comment_text": "SAVE THE ARCTIC", "comment_date": "2020-02-07T10:39:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cannabot", "comment_text": "That&#39;s crazy were hurting them more than we need to we are doing this for basic fun.

I\u2019m ashamed to say that my ancestors came along from Europe, slaughtered all the natives, and then later in the 1900s took these group of people away from their lifestyle, force them into residential schools, where unspeakable acts of sexual psychological and physical abuse were common place, and where they were punished if they spoke to their own language!\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 These people are literally starving to death living in shocks in a place where it gets to -40\u00b0C, with no indoor plumbing or electricity in some cases. Yet in the south of our country we live in one of the best and highest rated standards of living in the world, how in the hell is this even allowed? I have no words to express my anger and my shame that my government of the country that I love is capable of voicing these beautiful people to live in such catastrophic conditions. This is got one more example of The wealthy shitting all over the poor, and keeping it a secret to the rest of the country. This is not a democratic country, although they lie and say it is, this is dictatorship cloaked in a democracy, I honestly had no idea things were that bad for them, and our media never ever shows us in the self what\u2019s going on that far up north. But now that I know I\u2019m mad as hell, and I\u2019m never one to be quiet when I see such an injustice happening in my own country. Rest assured, I am going to do everything within my power as a Canadian citizen to attack my government until they finally open their eyes, and their wallets, and give these poor people the exact same quality of life that we enjoy here in the south. Until that is accomplished I am ashamed to be a Canadian citizen, and it tears me apart inside, because I did love my country open till a few minutes ago. I cannot believe this is happening, that I\u2019m 49 years old, lived here my whole life in Toronto, and have never Heard of this before, I am so angry I literally cannot speak anymore, I am however going to be speaking a lot more and a lot louder, until these people are given everything that was taken from them, and then given the lifestyle they choose to live, along with all the infrastructure that we take for granted in the south!!! And here I thought Justin Trudeau was a great leader, I am so devastatingly disappointed and beyond furious at him and our government for sitting on there pretty asses, not to mention there six figures a year salary, while these poor people starve to death in abject poverty that you would expect to see in a Third World country. I am but one man, I\u2019m nobody special, I\u2019m just your average citizen, but no longer, my true name is Eric, expect to be hearing it in the very near future, because I absolutely refuse to allow this to continue as long as I\u2019m alive, and I have no plans of going anytime soon. I will not permit this out rage to continue, and while I myself live on long-term disability because of my ill health, there\u2019s nothing wrong with my mind, and thanks to the Internet I have access to everything I need to turn things around. So please join me in attacking our governments. Not physically, but intellectually and financially. Never underestimate the power of one person. One person can make the difference between Trump or Obama, and this particular one person absolutely refuses to allow my government to turn a blind eye to people living in such horrible conditions in my country. If anything it\u2019s not even my country, it\u2019s theirs!!!! They were here thousands of years before my ancestors came, and are the only true real Canadians, along with the native North Americans. I\u2019ve always despised our society for praising the wealthy and punishing the poor, but now they\u2019ve gone to far, I wish I would\u2019ve known about this much sooner, because I will not stop until every last person living there is loud the lifestyle that we all take for granted. Be ready for a big change in the future, I am not shy with my opinions or my beliefs, nothing or nobody can silence me.... every Canadian citizen should be just as outraged as I am, and if you\u2019re not then you do not deserve to live in this country or this planet. We are all brothers and sisters, regardless of where we came from, we all deserve the exact same things in life, nobody is better than anybody else because they have money, money is irrelevant!!!! It\u2019s time we sent a message loud and clear to those rich pricks that control everything, that we will not stand for this any longer. To be honest I\u2019m not quite sure how I will start this campaign, but one way or the other I will start it, and I will not stop until every price tag in every grocery store is the same as it is here in Toronto, and every home that these people live in is as comfortable as the ones we live in. They pay just as much tax as we do, which they shouldn\u2019t have to to begin with, being native citizens! How in the hell can they justify charging $16 for a bag of lettuce in a community where most people are out of work because the climate has been so drastically changed they can no longer sustain their lifestyle like they used to?

As far as I know we don&#39;t have an alternative as effective. I wish oil companies would regulate oil use because it&#39;s such a rare resource and there is no reason to destroy the environment to retrieve it. Which then goes back to the boycotting thing. The government&#39;s don&#39;t pay these corporations, the people do. If people stop buying a product then the company stops receiving money. It&#39;s a good way to look at our drug problem. It&#39;s not the other countries, it&#39;s the people. If the drug lords made no money over here why would they sell it. Well they wouldn&#39;t. So save money buy a Tesla or install solar panels, install a grey water system in your house, buy home grown food and less meat. Now meat is definitely good and shouldn&#39;t go away. But the excess amounts of animals it takes to produce it adds an unprecedented amount of carbon dioxide and since we are all carbon based life forms, when we die we release carbon dioxide and animals are the same way. So even killing these animals that are bread for food is damaging to the environment. And my last thing. petitions are great. But the amount of following you need is ginormous. surprisingly people are willing to change their eating and hoping style than sign a petition. Now if you have a cause and a petition for it or you like a cause with a petition, sign it, maybe it will do some good.

Years ago, and most people don&#39;t know this because it&#39;s way before their time, scientists were baffled as to why the polar ice caps on Mars were shrinking at an alarming rate. It was also on the cover of a popular science magazine. Clearly it was not due to &quot;man&quot;. Years later the polar caps began to grow in size again. The fact of that matter is, we have no idea what &quot;normal&quot; is, because we have not been on this planet long enough to see how the polar caps changed in size over the past 4.5 billion years. The Earth does, and always will go through climate cycles primarily due to solar activity. You can be 100% assured, that in the past we have had just as extreme or worse weather, earthquakes, floods, droughts, fires, and hurricanes. The weather data we have, only amounts to .0001%.

I mean it looks like the company went in, is potentially damaging the environment and disturbing hunting traditions, and not hiring anyone or paying anything in return, which is absurd.  Of course, then a lady comes on making suspicious arguments about 10 minutes in.  Truly, uh, global warming is good for Canada in general.  It&#39;s good for Russia and Canada and for Northern Europe and probably most of the US, lol.  I mean, it&#39;ll change the ecosystem, some stuff will extinct, stuff will change some, but agriculture will improve notably in these region as I understand it, even if it has to adapt new species.  Also, if they&#39;re making money, in large amounts, it could well serve their children in that way too.  And then the question of conflict, well, Canadian oil is guilt free in that regard, Canadian oil seems like something that reduces conflict in the developed world, and stops fueling certain objectionable behavior world wide.  Whilst it&#39;s a bit short sighted to overlook the plight of the countries where oil revenues fall, I still call this a strong net in favor of Canadian oil as far as conflict resolution is concerned.<br><br>We&#39;ve been hearing a lot about the water rising.  Okay, come on guys, poor people move as the water rises, and rich people own all the good stuff there anyway, and so they&#39;re super bothered by the losses.

To me it&#39;s hard to see it likely that megacities would be wholly ceded to the ocean, perhaps they would be built up and made more exclusive seems more likely, lol, whilst other people will have to move inland to the new ocean front, but this will take places over several generations.<br><br>Just throwing a wrench into some of these cogs we see here.", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T03:05:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Galactic Gaming", "comment_text": "R.I.P gas prices", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T03:05:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joey Nguyen", "comment_text": "Is no one gonna talk about Nanny Mcfucking phee being in this video that&#39;s actually awesome", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T03:03:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Minhaz Noor Chowdhury", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRDtZp96jw&amp;t=10m19s\">10:19</a> I&#39;m from Bangladesh \ud83d\ude2a<br>This whole situation is very unfair.

I mean, I understand this is more about protecting wildlife but this entire video made it sound like it&#39;s about climate change and there&#39;s just something about this video that doesn&#39;t quite seem logical to me. I&#39;ve also read the webpage and well... I&#39;m sorry to break the ice, but the technology for renewables just isn&#39;t going to cut it.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong: I really hope that one day renewables can completely replace oil and natural gasses, but I personally don&#39;t think that day is coming in the next decade. There&#39;s just too many variables in renewables and a lot of engineering problems that still need to be solved. Just, I challenge everyone that&#39;s reading this to name one renewable energy that&#39;s without a fatal flaw. (As in, will be able to totally replace fossil fuels today, ignoring the politics and even economic part of this equation.) In the meantime, we&#39;ll have to keep looking for new reservoirs of oil to keep the globe alive and functioning. Is there seriously no compromise to this? Like, can the oil companies use a different technology? Or maybe blast in frequencies that the marine life can&#39;t hear?<br><br>Though I suppose Las Vegas is pulling it off pretty well from renewables, so hopefully the rest of the world could catch up.<br><br>Thanks to anyone that actually read through this! I&#39;m really open to be able to have a good conversation, and please point out if I&#39;m just wrong on anything in the post.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Here&#39;s my list of possible renewable energies:<br><br>Solar and wind: When there&#39;s no sun or no wind, there&#39;s no electricity to be used (Our best battery technology can&#39;t store that much energy). Also I just wanted question something: Do the people in the arctic think they could live off solar when they&#39;re the ones with the least solar energy?... Solar cell efficiencies are really low. Here&#39;s the chart that a lot of people reference: (keep in mind this is the best research cell efficiencies) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell_efficiency#/media/File:PVeff(rev160812).jpg\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell_efficiency#/media/File:PVeff(rev160812).jpg</a><br><br>&lt;side_note&gt;<br>I mean, honestly, if I were the government I&#39;d just provide them with the best solar technology we&#39;ve got and see if they last even a year. And if they do, great! We&#39;re out! But we&#39;re also not providing you with anything else. And that&#39;s probably what you&#39;d want... No interference! I suppose this is why I&#39;m a science major and not a political scientist.<br>&lt;/side_note&gt;<br><br>Nuclear: The public&#39;s all up against it worried about nuclear catastrophes, also nuclear waste is a genuine concern. This might actually be the first legit thing we can get from science, although society&#39;s pretty against it...<br><br>Hydro &amp; tidal: There&#39;s just not enough (I think, I don&#39;t know a lot about this yet, but I will learn more during this semester!): this can be a really good supplement, but maybe if we put dams in all the rivers in the world it would work?

In fact, if you go back 500 million years, the carbon dioxide content was 5,000 parts per million. Much, much higher than it was today.
