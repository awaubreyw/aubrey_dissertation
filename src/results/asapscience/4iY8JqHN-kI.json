Celebrities sometimes use Retroreflective clothing to wash out photographs taken by the paparazzi with flash as the light from the flash bounces directly back to the camera. Also, Disney and similar theme parks are trying to use retroreflective surfaces to create illusions of holograms floating in space. Its complicated to explain without visuals, but it uses the Pepper&#39;s Ghost effect with a retroreflective surface to bounce the image back to appear floating in front of the reflection surface versus behind it. Imagine if the Haunted Mansion ghosts weren&#39;t some distance away from you in a scene, but in front of you floating with no scenery or elements around it. You can test this using 3D rendering software and it actually works, except the only downside at the moment is the quality of the image is dependent on the density of the retroreflective material.
