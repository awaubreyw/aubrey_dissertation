By comparing the differences between the measured model and the 3D model, I would be able to determine if the parts our shop made were within tolerance and able to ship out to our customers. The retroreflector spheres were 1.5&quot; inches in diameter and cost $2,500 dollars apiece, and I have no idea how they cut the flat surfaces inside to have the edges meet up as perfectly as they did and polish them as perfectly as they did, it looked like it was made from three precision ground and polished individual pieces then bonded together but they were cut from a solid ball bearing.

Celebrities sometimes use Retroreflective clothing to wash out photographs taken by the paparazzi with flash as the light from the flash bounces directly back to the camera. Also, Disney and similar theme parks are trying to use retroreflective surfaces to create illusions of holograms floating in space. Its complicated to explain without visuals, but it uses the Pepper&#39;s Ghost effect with a retroreflective surface to bounce the image back to appear floating in front of the reflection surface versus behind it. Imagine if the Haunted Mansion ghosts weren&#39;t some distance away from you in a scene, but in front of you floating with no scenery or elements around it. You can test this using 3D rendering software and it actually works, except the only downside at the moment is the quality of the image is dependent on the density of the retroreflective material.
