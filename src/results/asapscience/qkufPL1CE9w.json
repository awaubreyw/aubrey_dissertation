So do I still get all the bonuses of having red hair or no? I\u2019ve always had a kind of high pain tolerance and sensitivity to light (though my dad\u2019s was higher to both) but they were never crazy haha. Just curious since you said it was something that occurs when you have the allele for red hair (which I don\u2019t have now that I\u2019m blonde?)", "comment_date": "2022-01-26T01:06:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moorgan P\u00e5l Windan Hart", "comment_text": "Thank you! I love learning, but especially when it\u2019s something that directly applies to me. I don\u2019t know how or why but I definitely have that albino Irish skin (literally never tans; just turns red then mutates into cancer), and always had that decreased sensitivity exactly like you described. Doctors checked me for a pain disorder but determined I\u2019m just \u201con the far end of the tactile sensation spectrum,\u201d because I can feel pain it\u2019s just significantly reduced.\u00a0<br><br>Oddness \u2014&gt;<br><br>The reason it\u2019s a bit odd in my case is because I\u2019m of aboriginal American and African descent; although tons of European mixed in there as well like most Americans (of all skin tones). I don\u2019t have red hair though, so I\u2019d guess the 2 aren\u2019t dependent. On the other hand I have (naturally) multicolored hair (and skin, and eyes), so maybe it\u2019s some unique mutation I have or something.\u00a0<br><br>Details \u2014&gt;<br><br>My facial/body hair grows in in a range of blonde to red or auburn (your beard is brown compared to how mine usually looks), although my head hair is a single patch of always black hair and the rest a fluctuating range of sandy brown to a dark auburn/brown. I\u2019m never exposed to sunlight as I\u2019ve had skin cancer multiple times (before even reaching 30), and if I have to go out in the sun I completely cover up from head to toe; hats and all. So that\u2019s at least not the only factor contributing to my hair color changing (and the black patch never lightens).\u00a0<br><br>When I bleached my hair as a kid the brown part turned completely blonde, but the black patch just became that same color of orange someone with naturally African hair gets when they bleach it.\u00a0Oddly enough the skin below the black patch of hair is as pale as most of my skin, but I have a few patches of dark brown skin across my body that matches the skin tone of my darker cousin and my body hair does grow in black, thicker, and longer in those places like theirs too. As a small child I would get freckles on my pale skin that would come and go, but then never again other than 1 time when I was 18 and got lost on a hike severely burning my arms which after the redness retreated left permanent freckles and a couple concerning (but proved non-cancerous) new moles that were removed.<br><br>My mom\u2019s always been light skinned (with dark auburn hair), but not colorless like me. Although I did have a great-grandfather on her side that had the skin like I do as well as reddish white hair (he died about mid-life of skin cancer), and my biodad is white-American of mostly Irish and German descent.\u00a0My mother has the same weird eyes I do though, so I definitely know where I got those from. She\u2019s the only one though, as the rest of her family have brown eyes.\u00a0<br><br>My eyes were blue when I was born, but darkened into brown as I got older, then lightened back to blue, then darkened to a green, kept going, and just never really settled.\u00a0Like my mom my eye color still fluctuates between a pale light blue and brown, although as I get older (as it\u2019s been with her) it sits more often on the cooler end of the spectrum. The changes occur over weeks or longer as melanin builds up or breaks down, so it\u2019s not something that makes me really stand out in public or anything. It\u2019s also not dependent on the hair color fluctuations; the 2 seem to change at different random rates. <br><br>They can even be slightly different colors, where one is more blue and the other more green (that can make me stick out; but rarely happens), or one a lighter brown, but never far off from one another. Sometimes they even look a gold/amber/yellow color; depending on how the pattern changes.\u00a0Unlike the color the patten changes fast enough that one could see it, rarely changing significantly at a rate faster than over a day though.\u00a0<br><br>It\u2019s a bit of a subtle feature as far as looks go though. So one would have to like stare an inch away from my eye for several minutes to an hour to be convinced (as some friends/acquaintances have done), unless they were particularly observant. I almost never mention it in person, but I have had a few friends that were known for having an eye for details where I\u2019d hang out with them every couple weeks and that was enough for them to notice the change in color and pattern; then they tell other people and those people want to see.", "comment_date": "2022-01-25T23:08:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gustavo Borealis", "comment_text": "What could be an explanation for me having reddish copperish hair when I was a toddler but it then darkening to the point I had brown hair in elementary school and now have practically black hair?", "comment_date": "2022-01-25T21:10:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarcastic Syringe2020", "comment_text": "Proof that redheads don\u2019t have souls", "comment_date": "2022-01-25T18:03:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Txrtle", "comment_text": "I\u2019m ginger and I feel pain", "comment_date": "2022-01-25T17:03:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "max dilcon", "comment_text": "I\u2019m a red head, definitely feel pain", "comment_date": "2022-01-25T14:13:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AllTheGoodUsernamesWereTaken", "comment_text": "Wait greg is a redhead?

I was a bit confused by this, because, as far as I could tell, I wasn&#39;t in enough pain to need medication, so I said no, I&#39;m fine thanks. &quot;It&#39;s okay to need painkillers, you know - don&#39;t think you need to be brave and tough it out,&quot; he said. I assured him I wasn&#39;t doing that. He pointed to the heart monitor I was attached to, and explained that he could tell I was in pain because my pulse and heart rate were racing, and that was typical of someone with my condition who was in a lot of pain. Well then I was REALLY confused, and found myself scrutinising my senses and thinking &quot;AM I in pain then? I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m in painkiller-worthy pain, but maybe I&#39;m just being unobservant...&quot; (I also had a temperature of 105, so it was possible my brain wasn&#39;t firing on all cylinders.)
