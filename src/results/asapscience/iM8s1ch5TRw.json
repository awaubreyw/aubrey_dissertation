We&#39;re trying to remove the connotation <b>first</b> by telling people that they <b>should</b> eat insects. And people start advertising their food with <b>insects</b> as the main selling point.<br><br>But no, IT&#39;S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. Culture shock doesn&#39;t subside overnight. It could last for *years or even decades*. Especially if people feel like you&#39;re shoving your entomophagy down their throats. Telling some people to eat insects in a controlled environment such as a studio would be much easier, but I wouldn&#39;t say the same for the general audience.<br><br>I think, for the general population, it&#39;s better for them to NOT realise that what they&#39;re eating are in fact, insects. Same with cheese and yoghurts, we eat them since we were young and none of us are the wiser. Only when we grow older we realise that those are basically spoiled milk with molds. But since it&#39;s already normal for us to eat them, and everyone seems to eat them in a daily basis, we don&#39;t have any problem with those.<br><br>Applying that logic to our insect-normalisation campaign, we should just advertise them the same as other protein sources, simply as just a &quot;High-Quality Protein&quot; and whatnot until it has became the norm. And after that it would be optional to just let the masses know that the main ingredients are insects.<br><br>Here&#39;s a little trivia: some protein shake companies are actually have incorporated crickets as their ingredients for protein. Do the majority of the public aware of that? No. Would they stop consuming the protein shake after they&#39;re informed?

Meat is not, never will be and never has been a &quot;vital&quot; food. It is an addicting practice that only serves to cause mild retardation in human physiology and in microscopic levels. Likewise yoghurt is also not nutritious, it contains galactose, caso-morphins (basically morphine), casein (the main protein, which is barely digestible and causes rapid growth of abnormalities-&gt; cancer), the calcium is barely absorbed.  since it is not conveniently in trapped in a leaf, we piss out most of it. To deal with the dropped ph levels in the stomach, the human body needs calcium to neutralize the casein digestion. But milk contains calcium, so it&#39;s a win-win, right? It turns out that humans are laughably incompetent at digesting calcium from milk. In the long run, consuming a lot of these substances causes considerably higher ph and calcium deficiency. This is not exclusive to milk. Digesting meat and high amounts of animal protein causes more damage, because of the steady decline in calcium and inefficiency to digest animal cells.<br>High amounts of protein are even hurtful, vegan or omnivore. A high amount of protein even as vegans also causes a more prominent risk for disease because of the lower ph (even though a vegan diet causes considerably lower risks) <br><br>Furthermore, there is a grave misconception of what exactly humans/cro-magnons/homo-sapiens have evolved to digest most efficiently. It is not meat, if it was then there wouldn&#39;t be countries filled with fat people, in other words, we would have developed more efficient fat digestion. But the human ability for fat digestion is laughable, and poor at most. The staple for human food is starch (rice, potato,corn, all kinds of grains and lentils) and fruit and vegetables on top of that, with the addition of nuts and seeds. The complex carbohydrate, starch, is by far the best fuel for humans. <br><br>I hate people so much, why can&#39;t everybody just do research instead of listening to the inhumane monsters selling the products that are causing most of the diseases. <br>It&#39;s fascist and retarding.
