Below is the neuroscience behind this simple idea, which can be simply tested if one gives this slight modification of positive thinking a try.<br><br>And it all has to do with the neuroscience of pleasure. Unlike other functions in the brain, from perception to thinking, the neural source of our pleasures are localized in the brain as specialized groups of nerve cells or \u2018nuclei\u2019, or \u2018hot spots\u2019, located in the mid-brain. These nuclei receive inputs from different sources in the nervous system, from proprioceptive stimuli (neuro-muscular activity) to interoceptive stimuli (satiation and deprivation) to cognitive stimuli (novel positive or negative means-end expectancies), and all modulate the activity of these nuclei which release or inhibit endogenous opioids, and elicit the rainbow of pleasures which mark our day. <br>For example, relaxation induces opioid activity and is pleasurable, but tension inhibits it and it is painful. Similarly, satiation inhibits our pleasure when we eat, and deprivation or hunger increases it. Finally, positive novel means-ends expectancies enhance our pleasures, and negative expectancies inhibit them. For our sensory pleasures (eating, drinking), watching an exciting movie makes popcorn taste better than when watching a dull or depressing movie. This also applies to when we are relaxed, as thinking or performing meaningful activity (Meaning would be defined as anticipated or current behavior that has branching novel positive implications, such as creating art, doing good deeds or productive work), and is reflected in \u2018flow\u2019 or \u2018peak\u2019 experiences when we are engaging in highly meaningful behavior while relaxed. <br><br>But again, don\u2019t mind this verbiage, just prove it to yourself<br>Just get relaxed using a relaxation protocol such as progressive muscle relaxation, eyes closed rest, or mindfulness, and then follow it by exclusively attending to or performing meaningful activity, or in other words, positive thinking, and avoiding all meaningless activity or \u2018distraction\u2019. Keep it up and you will not only stay relaxed, but continue so with a greater sense of wellbeing or pleasure. The attribution of affective value to meaningful behavior makes the latter seem \u2018autotelic\u2019, or reinforcing in itself, and the resultant persistent attention to meaning crowds out the occasions we might have spent dwelling on other unmeaningful worries and concerns.<br><br>References:<br><br>Rauwolf, P., et al.

It would be similar to changing out old spark plugs and cables in your car. The car might run better after they&#39;re changed but the engine(muscle) size is still the same. For muscle to grow it seems to need physiological stress, which your muscles adapt to by getting bigger and simply imaging doing something doesn&#39;t cause physiological stress.<br><br>What the video really highlights is along the lines of what you&#39;d learn in a sport psychology course, called imagery. You imagine yourself doing a task that requires a relatively high level of skill. By imaging yourself doing it you strengthen the neural pathways that you use when performing the skill which then helps you perform the skill. <br><br>A lot of pro athletes aren&#39;t pros because of their levels of fitness, some sports are more physical than others. Obviously golf is a sport where someone could greatly benefit from imagery, whereas if you&#39;re a linebacker on an american football team, you&#39;d probably be better off spending time in the gym rather than practicing imagery.
