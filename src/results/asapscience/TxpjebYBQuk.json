I would only purchase food that didn&#39;t have plastic as part of its packaging (I allowed myself to consume anything I currently had in the pantry regardless of the packaging though, as a disclaimer.) It was sometimes tricky--and I unwittingly flubbed a couple times--but it was not at all impossible! I was able to get a lot from the bulk section of Whole Foods, which, while being a little more expensive, was about the same price as when I would go to the grocery store and get a bunch of processed food in addition to the stuff I actually needed. I got creative: at one point I used an old bag for rice cakes to fill up with bulk coffee. I&#39;ve already been low-waste for a while, but this helped further wake up my senses and really look with scrutiny at where the plastic (and waste in general) still was in my life. I&#39;ve also been vegan for environmental reasons for almost 5 years, and I kind of equate the responses to criticisms of both practices: I&#39;ve simply become aware of these damaging things in my life, and realizing where it&#39;s possible for me to cut them out. I don&#39;t see it as a huge sacrifice. I just see plastic and animal products now as something I personally can, in most situations, choose whether or not to purchase and partake in. They&#39;re not something I&#39;m depriving myself of; they&#39;re something I&#39;m deciding I don&#39;t want in my life. I think there are a lot more people capable of having this mindset than they let themselves believe, as we thrive off the complacency, ease, and chosen ignorance of our present society. For anyone terrified of climate change, of plastic in the ocean, I highly encourage you to stop passively letting capitalism happen to you and start actively deciding on what you consume--you can start with something as small as a plastic-free or vegan week or day!", "comment_date": "2019-12-02T03:22:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sofia biron", "comment_text": "do a your brain on ketamine", "comment_date": "2019-12-02T01:19:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Bowman", "comment_text": "I love the new channel format.

They have people sign on to two different levels of the challenge. One is to cut out the Big 4: bags, takeaway cups, straws and bottles. The amped up version is to cut out ALL single use plastic for the month. I figured since I had already pretty much eliminated the Big 4 I would go all in.<br><br><br>This was SO HARD! As you guys noticed, grocery shopping is a nightmare. Not only is it the plastic you can see, but it&#39;s the box of crackers or cookies with a plastic sleeve inside it or things wrapped individually inside a package that wasn&#39;t obvious from the outside. One thing it did do was push me towards healthier choices. It&#39;s much easier to buy fruit and veg without plastic than most other things... except when it isn&#39;t. Things like strawberries and grapes are nearly always in plastic, so they&#39;re gone now.<br><br><br>At the end of that month, I had a couple dozen items I hadn&#39;t managed to avoid, but on the whole I did pretty well. I had thought after the month was over I would be relieved to be able to shop more easily, but I found I couldn&#39;t unsee the plastic. There are products I just won&#39;t buy anymore. There are things that if I&#39;m going to have them, I will make them from scratch. And there are other things that I worry less about. I spent a lot of time feeling anxious over yogurt containers, but when I really look at it, I use them as poor man&#39;s tupperware all the time. My freezer is full of containers with soups and other leftovers stored in sour cream and yogurt containers. So when there is something I want that must be in plastic, if the container it comes in is useful to me, I don&#39;t feel too badly about using it. I allow a few other exceptions to my no plastic rule. If something is local and comes in plastic vs something that has been shipped from halfway across the continent, I will take the local thing. Supporting local and decreasing the distance things I consume have to travel is more significant than the wrapping it&#39;s in, within reason.<br><br><br>This past summer, I figured I would try Plastic Free July to check in on where I stood, and it was shocking how easy it was this time around. So many of the changes I made the first time around were things I continued to do. There were a few things that had crept back into my life after a couple years, but it was pretty simple to cut them out again. In the end, the hardest thing was deciding to try. I spent a month agonizing over every purchase I made, and the months that followed figuring out what would practically fit into my life, and found once the change was made, it was lasting.<br><br><br>Good job on this project guys. I know it can be tough to be visible doing things like this, but so much of change is awareness. I talked about my plastic project a lot, and it has lead to my friends making changes, not because I told them to, but because they are aware there are choices to be made.", "comment_date": "2019-11-28T17:28:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mando Man", "comment_text": "It&#39;s been 5 months since a good video so I&#39;m unsubscribing", "comment_date": "2019-11-28T17:26:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "letitsnow4xmas", "comment_text": "I like the new format!! so much more personable", "comment_date": "2019-11-28T17:21:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anisha Jain", "comment_text": "I admire you guys even more now.", "comment_date": "2019-11-28T17:14:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chocolates after dark", "comment_text": "I still think they&#39;re missing the biggest R in those 6 Rs...the 7th R: eating the Rich.
