We realize that X affects us negatively, but we continue doing it. A question arises here: why? <br>The answer is the following when we do certain activities repetitively every day, our nerve cells create that familiar pat. Whenever the &quot;click&quot; comes that reminds us about that certain action, we immediately take the &quot;familiar road&quot;. Unfortunately, in this way, we also create our negative habits such as smoking, sleeping late, overusing social media, staying in a toxic relationship, etc. From my personal experience, I understood that the &quot;replacement&quot; technique works. Whenever we remove something from our life, we leave an empty place. The important thing here is to fill that open place with something much healthier and pleasurable. For example, suppose I am a coffeeholic, and whenever I want to drink a coffee, I stop for a second, revise the negative consequences of drinking coffee and then I turn towards my again lovely bananas juice. Firstly, it takes time to adapt to the new habit and list why you should not drink coffee. It might seem complicated initially, but once you figure it out, you are going to make it a habit.", "comment_date": "2022-02-21T20:46:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ceraxoyts", "comment_text": "My habit is like sipping my bottom lips for more then 12 hours like a bite lip but it\u2019s a addiction LOLL", "comment_date": "2022-02-19T19:35:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AISHA TURABI", "comment_text": "in the book atomic habits by James Clear it says the 4 steps of habits are cue, craving, response  and reward", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T11:46:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lolotron", "comment_text": "bro i am sorry to say this, but you two make a great couple lol", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:49:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lynn van der Mijden", "comment_text": "This might be the first thing that works", "comment_date": "2022-01-30T22:07:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JaseplaysHorror", "comment_text": "I have a whistling habit", "comment_date": "2022-01-20T06:43:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meow", "comment_text": "Thanks I will try to break my habit", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T13:11:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Encouraging Community", "comment_text": "intersting information !!", "comment_date": "2022-01-09T07:54:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Star Platinum", "comment_text": "I just realized <br>Watching JoJo is my habit", "comment_date": "2022-01-08T18:47:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Star Platinum", "comment_text": "I want to stop sinning", "comment_date": "2022-01-08T18:46:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drilonsylejma1", "comment_text": "My worst habit is daydreaming<br>I want to stop it forever and focus on my real life \ud83d\ude4f", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T10:57:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Avery Johnson", "comment_text": "I\u2019m getting in the habit of staying up all night watching all of The Hunger Games movies.

I used to be a habitual nail biter, and like they said i did it mostly out of boredom. I tend to fidget, even if im listening to or watching something that isnt boring i have to be doing something with my hands as well. This lead to me developing a habit of biting my nails. Initially this was fine, it wasnt particularly damaging. It meant i had kinda ugly nails but I&#39;ve always been a bit of a tomboy so i never really cared. However the habit got worse, my nails became short enough that biting them was causing me pain and eventually they became so short that i couldnt even reach them with my teeth and i would bite off bits of the skin around the nails. At one point i was using a pair of scissors to cut away the skin of my fingers, just to have something to do with my hands! The urge became so powerful that i didnt care that it hurt, that my fingers were a mess or that my peers were disturbed and concerned by my behaviour. Well i suppose i did care, i recognised that i needed to break the habit and tried several times but always came back to nail biting when nervous or bored. Two things allowed me to break the habit. 1. I had braces put on my teeth, these made it much harder to bite my nails. Though i still could and did, it just took more effort. 2. I recognised what was causing the nail biting and searched for an appropriate alternative that would still quell the urge. I eventually settled on using a tool or my own nails to remove dirt from under the nail without damaging it or the skin around it. I&#39;ll admit that this isnt that effective at removing any dirt however it gives me something to do with my hands. Now my nails are very long and healthy and have been for months, last Christmas my friends and family rewarded my efforts by buying me nail polish and maintenance kits for gifts.", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T11:29:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stee", "comment_text": "If you like it then it is not bad!", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T09:25:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wvy", "comment_text": "my body is craving a nicotine buzz wtf do i replace that with LOL", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T08:46:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joy Cheng", "comment_text": "Why do people bite their nails?", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T08:36:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "squashy animates", "comment_text": "When is the world going to end ? \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T07:13:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jose Valenzinho", "comment_text": "I bite my nails but only when I\u2019m driving or watching TV  I don\u2019t know how to make it stop \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T06:51:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Mister", "comment_text": "43 on trending!", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T06:50:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BasicSnooze", "comment_text": "Bad habit is masturbation", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T06:21:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fernie Jasmine Abdul Ghani.", "comment_text": "I was bitting my nails and did not realise until he said bitting your nails", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T06:20:11Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Allen Bao", "comment_text": "Bored: All of my classes", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T05:46:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erick Hines", "comment_text": "Cold Turkey \ud83e\udd83", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T05:40:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alyssa Papke", "comment_text": "How do I create a habit?

With this essay, I am not singling out the adherents of Islam - to which I ascribe - but rather I am writing this essay to every man and woman throughout the whole world.<br><br>I ask Allah that He facilitates tat this essay reaches every ear, falls under the sight of every eye, and is understood by every heart...<br><br>Muhammad the son of `Abdullah is Allah&#39;s Prophet and the Final Messenger Sent by Allah to the Inhabitants of Earth.<br><br>My brothers and sisters everywhere! You should know that the Messenger, Muhammad the son of `Abdullah (may Allah&#39;s blessings and peace be upon him) is Allah&#39;s Messenger in reality and truth. The evidences that show his veracity are abundant. None but an infidel, who out of arrogance alone, could deny these signs.<br><br>Among these proofs:<br><br>1. Muhammad (may Allah&#39;s blessings and peace be upon him) was raised illiterate, unable to read or write, and remained like that till his death. Among all his people, he was known as being truthful and trustworthy. Before receiving revelation, he had no prior knowledge of Religion or any previously sent Message. He remained like that for his first forty years. Revelation then came to Muhammad with the Koran that we now have between our hands. This Koran mentioned most of the accounts found in the previous scriptures, telling us about these events in the greatest detail as if he witnessed them. These accounts came precisely as they were found in the Torah sent down to Moses and in the Gospel sent down to Jesus. Neither the Jews or Christians were able to belie him regarding anything that he said.<br><br>2. Muhammad (may Allah&#39;s blessings and peace be upon him) also foretold of everything that would occur to him and his community after him, pertaining to victory, the removal of the tyrannical kingdoms of Chosroes [the royal title for the Zoroastrian kings of Persia] and Caesar, and the establishment of the religion of Islam throughout the earth. These events occurred exactly as Muhammad foretold, as if he was reading the future from an open book.<br><br>3. Muhammad (may Allah&#39;s blessings and peace be upon him) also brought an Arabic Koran that is the peak of eloquence and clarity. The Koran challenged those eloquent and fluent Arabs of his time, who initially belied him, to bring forth a single chapter like the Koran. The eloquent Arabs of his day were unable to contest this Koran.<br><br>Indeed, till our day, none has ever dared to claim that he has been able to compose words that equal-or even approach-the order, grace, beauty, and splendor of this Glorious Koran.<br><br>4. The life history of this Noble Prophet was a perfect example of being upright, merciful, compassionate, truthful, brave, generous, distant from all evil character, and ascetic in all worldly matters, while striving solely for the reward of the Hereafter. Moreover, in all his actions and dealings, he was ever mindful and fearful of Allah.<br><br>5. Allah instilled great love for Muhammad (may Allah&#39;s blessings and peace be upon him) in the hearts of all who believed in and met him. This love reached such a degree that any of his companions would willingly sacrifice his (or her) self, mother or father for him.<br><br>Till today, those who believe in Muhammad honor and love him. Anyone of those who believe in him would ransom his own family and wealth to see him, even if but once.<br><br>6. All of history has not preserved the biography of any person in the manner it has preserved the life of Muhammad, who is the most influential human in history.<br><br>Nor has the entire earth known of anyone whom every morning and evening, and many times thereafter throughout the day, is thought of by those who believe in him. Upon remembering Muhammad, the believers in him will greet him and ask Allah to bless him. They do such with full hearts and true love for him.<br><br>7. Nor has there every been a man on earth whom is still followed in all his doings by those who believe in him.<br><br>Those who believe in Muhammad, sleep in the manner he slept; purify themselves (through ablution and ritual washing) in the manner he purified himself; and adhere to his practice in the way they eat, drink, and clothe themselves.<br><br>Indeed in all aspects of their lives, the believers in Muhammad adhere to the teachings he spread among them and the path that he traveled upon during his life.<br><br>During every generation, from his day till our time, the believers in this Noble Prophet have fully adhered to his teachings. With some, this has reached the degree that they desire to follow and adhere to the Prophet&#39;s way in his personal matters regarding which Allah has not sought of them to adhere to in worship. For example, some will only eat those specific foods or only wear those specific garments that the Messenger liked.<br><br>Let alone all that, all those who believe in Muhammad repeat those praises of Allah, special prayers, and invocations that he would say during each of his actions during day and night, like: what he would say when he greeted people, upon entering and leaving the house, entering and leaving the mosque, entering and leaving the bathroom, going to sleep and awaking from sleep, observing the new crescent, observing the new fruit on trees, eating, drinking, dressing, riding, traveling and returning from travel, etc.<br><br>Let alone all that, all those who believe in Muhammad fully perform-even to the minute detail-every act of worship-like prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage-as this Noble Messenger (may Allah&#39;s blessings and peace be upon him) taught and as he himself performed.<br><br>All of this allows those who believe in him, to live their lives in all aspects with this Noble Messenger as their example, as if he was standing before them, for them to follow in all their doings.<br><br>8. There has never been nor will there ever be a man anywhere upon this earth who has received such love, respect, honor, and obedience in all matters-small and large alike-as has this Noble Prophet.<br><br>9. Since his day, in every region of the earth and during every period, this Noble Prophet has been followed by individuals from all races, colors and peoples. Many of those who followed him were previously Christians, Jews, pagans, idolaters, or without any religion. Among those who chose to follow him, were those who were known for their sound judgment, wisdom, reflection, and foresight. They chose to follow this Noble Prophet after they witnessed the signs of his truthfulness and the evidences of his miracles. They did not choose to follow Muhammad out of compulsion or coercion or because they had adopted the ways of their fathers and mothers.<br><br>Indeed many of the followers of this Prophet (may Allah&#39;s blessings peace be upon him), chose to follow him during the time when Islam was weak, when there were few Muslims, and when there was severe persecution of his followers on earth. Most people who have followed this Prophet (may Allah&#39;s blessings and peace be upon him) have done so not to acquire some material benefits. Indeed many of his followers have suffered the greatest forms of harm and persecution as a result of following this Prophet. Despite all this harm and persecution, this did not turn them back from his religion.<br><br>My brethren! All of this clearly indicates to anyone possessing any sense, that this Prophet was truly and really Allah&#39;s messenger and that he was not just a man who claimed prophethood or spoke about Allah without knowledge.<br><br>10. With all this, Muhammad came with a great religion in its credal and legal make-up.<br><br>Muhammad described Allah with qualities of complete perfection, and at the same time in a manner that is free of ascribing to Him any imperfection. Neither the philosophers or the wise could ever describe Allah like such. Indeed it is impossible to imagine that any human mind could conceive of an existing being that possesses such complete ability, knowledge, and greatness; Who has subdued the creation; Who has encompassed everything in the universe, small or large; and Who possesses such perfect mercy.<br><br>Nor is it in the ability of any human being to place a perfect law based upon justice, equality, mercy and objectivity for all human activity on earth like the laws that Muhammad brought for all spheres of human activity - like buying and selling, marriage and divorce, renting, testimony, custody, and all other contracts that are necessary to uphold life and civilization on earth.<br><br>11. It is impossible that any person conceive wisdom,, morals, good manners, nobleness of characters as what this honorable Prophet (may Allah&#39;s blessings and peace be upon him) brought.<br><br>In a full and complete manner, Muhammad spread a teaching regarding character and manners toward one&#39; parents, relatives, fiends, family, humanity, animals, plants and inanimate objects. It is impossible for the human mind alone to grasp all of that teaching or come with a similar teaching.<br><br>All of that unequivocally indicates that this Messenger did not bring an) of this religion from his own accord, but that it was rather a teaching and inspiration that he received from the One Who created the earth and the high heavens above and created this universe in its miraculous architecture and perfection.<br><br>12. The legal and credal make-up of the religion that the Messenger, Muhammad, (may Allah&#39;s blessings and peace be upon him) brought resembles the engineering of the heavens and the earth. All of that indicates that He who created the heavens and the earth is the One Who sent down this great law and upright religion.<br><br>The degree of inimitability of the Divine law that was sent down upon Muhammad is to the same degree of inimitability of the Divine creation of the heavens and earth. For just as humanity cannot create this universe, in the same manner humanity cannot bring forth a law like Allah&#39;s law that He sent down upon His servant and messenger Muhammad (may Allah&#39;s blessings and peace be upon him).", "comment_date": "2018-03-28T07:41:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Swagat Malla", "comment_text": "I am breaking the habit tonight.", "comment_date": "2018-03-28T07:38:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pisacenere", "comment_text": "I grave sigarette so?", "comment_date": "2018-03-28T07:30:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Cure For Happiness", "comment_text": "Nice voicecrack <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrwd2_UkmNw&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a>", "comment_date": "2018-03-28T07:23:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KaileX", "comment_text": "I eat late at night and don&#39;t want to stop, but habit that i want to stop is chewing ropes on hoodies (god this habit is weird).", "comment_date": "2018-03-28T07:22:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rushikesh Dhoran", "comment_text": "Summary of Power Of Habit", "comment_date": "2018-03-28T07:12:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DjOzKid", "comment_text": "From one who drinks and smokes to much, I agree with this, I know that the cue is.
