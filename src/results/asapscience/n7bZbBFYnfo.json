I don&#39;t follow the trends or anything and don&#39;t really use social media. I have completely stopped listening to my favorite channels on the radio because <b>ANGER WARNING</b> I personally HATE the music that is popular now. Too much auto tune and rap if you ask me. Even though I don&#39;t do trends I am still affected by society. Sometimes I look in the mirror and think &quot;God I&#39;m really fat, I need to lose weight!&quot; When in actuality I am pretty normal. Most of my friends are so skinny I can see their bones. In fact one of my friends who I always thought was of the ideal weight is actually UNDERWEIGHT. That just goes to show how much society has shamed us. When I think pretty I think skinny girls with perfect flowy hair. Which is basically the opposite of me. It&#39;s just sad.

I think I&#39;ve spilled maybe once, right at the very beginning. Do it over the stool and flush it down.<br>-You can keep them in for so long. When in a pinch, I kept mine in for 24+ hours and not one leak.<br>-There is SIGNIFICANTLY less odor when you use a cup.<br>-At least in my experience, and I&#39;ve heard from several other users, your period becomes lighter and doesn&#39;t last as long.<br>-You can be active in these suckers. I play volleyball and do track and field (I do jumps and sprinting, so very active) and I don&#39;t have any leaking issues.<br>-There&#39;s no crinkling of tampon/pad wrappers in the bathroom.

First off, I agree with many of you who have also commented that the luxury tax on tampons is ridiculous. Feminine hygiene is not a luxury and the products to help keep yourself clean should not be taxed as such. This can only lead to poor financial outcomes or, even worse, poor health outcomes. Some women being able to afford fewer tampons than are necessary could potentially lead to longer times between changing them out by necessity. This could potentially lead to higher incidence of toxic shock syndrome. Alternative products like menstrual cups seem like a decent way to help alleviate some of this issue. Additionally, as the video mentions, there are several benefits to using menstrual cups. Having the blood available for at home medical tests could help increase overall health awareness for many individuals. This awareness could help to detect certain conditions very earl on in their progression. In addition, this would be a MUCH easier and ethical way to collect stem cells. There is no harm involved, donating the sample would be completely voluntary, the samples could potentially bring a minor source of income to low income families, and this could prevent harvesting stem cells from other, more painful methods.", "comment_date": "2016-10-12T19:54:28Z", "likes_count": 490}, {"comment_by": "Obunky", "comment_text": "my dog has a period", "comment_date": "2016-10-12T18:54:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isabella Blu", "comment_text": "Why is everyone so put off by menstrual cups??

Looking up information about them is crucial. They come in different sizes for everyone and the size and fit is super important to keep it from leaking. Learn the different folding methods so that you can find one that works for you! (I prefer the triangle/7 fold but that&#39;s just me) The idea of emptying and washing it out seems gross to some, but it&#39;s really not. They are made of medical grade silicone so they don&#39;t absorb anything and keep their shape. Also no smell! At all! Taking it out can be tricky at first and getting it to open all the way might be as well, but again look up videos and look up information! You&#39;ll be glad you did. Once you get the hang of it you&#39;ll never want to go back! Trust me an exskeptic. You will be happy once you find the right type for you. You&#39;ll never want to go back! Love love love my cup!

So stop saying its taboo like its a big sexist thing because its really not. Also get over yourself with the tampon tax bollocks so if you spend $100 a year and its a 5% tax so you spend $5 more a year than you would with no tax working out as ( even giving the highest possible range for years menstruating) $225 dollars more spent over your lifetime. Just to put this in to perspective the average male needs to eat 1.25x more food than the average woman so assuming a very low spend of $20 for a woman a week on food  ( realistically its way more)  a man would spend $5 more a week than a woman.
