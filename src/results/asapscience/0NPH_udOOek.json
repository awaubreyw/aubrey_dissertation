When you can&#39;t see the dot, there&#39;s a bump beside the iris where it reflects your line of site and instead mirrors what&#39;s surrounding it (white).  Because of the excursiveness of these bumps, our brain has learned not to completely trust them and auto fill information even if it&#39;s not true.
