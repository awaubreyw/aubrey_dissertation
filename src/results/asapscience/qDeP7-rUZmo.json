We dont really care about those because those are huge in comparison to virus droplets, and masks have pretty small holes (except around the edges) but not as small as a virus. And we have no clue how many smaller droplets hit either dish because we arent testing for smaller droplets we are testing for how many large droplets got through, because those are the only ones that grow.

Because 95&amp; of all aerosolized viral particles are less than .5 microns.  99% of aerosolized viral particles are under .9 microns.

Unfortunately humans live on earth and not a petri dish or sterile operating room.   The truth is  a mask can only DELAY transmission even in a sterile environment.   That is why they are great for operating rooms and petri dishes.  In an operating room where everything is sterile then yes it is great cause you can delay transmission long enough to do the operation.   And sure you breath in front of a petri dish with a mask on but you only did it for a COUPLE MINUTES.   But a couple minutes is only a microsecond compared to wearing a mask for a year and breathing on the petri dish.    But for long term use in an NON sterile environment they are ineffective.  Yes they can DELAY transmission.   But they could never STOP transmission.   You can not stop a virus.  Just like you can not stop the flu.  If you locked yourself in a STERILE room and you had covid and you wore a mask the whole time.  After a WEEK the petri dish would still be COVERED in covid and the whole room would be covered in covid.    THAT IS A FACT.   You can only DELAY the transmission.    And the cdc  and news and everybody has proven this pandemic is no more deadly than the flu.  When i say they i mean the cdc and the news.   (1) THEY admit the age average dead of covid is higher than the OVERALL average age of dead in every state and country.  That means you have a better chance of dying of old age than you do from covid.     (2)    THEY admit the covid deaths reported ARE NOT people who died from covid but are people who died who happen to have covid.   Some of those did die of covid.   But keep in mind a half a million people every year die of the flu.  Cause they are just old or have a lot of medical problems already.    And if you watched the news during the pandemic that is why they ONLY reported deaths of people in hospices or people who already lived an entire life span.   IF THERE IS ONE THING I KNOW FOR SURE  If there was a DEADLY pandemic then people dying in hospices would not be the focal point.  If you are in a hospice then you were already going to dye within 3 or 4 weeks OR LESS weather you had covid or not.   That is actually the definition of a hospice.   So why would the news even mention those deaths if healthy people were dying?????????????   It only makes sense to report hospice deaths if they are the only deaths.   Oh yeah and they reported deaths of people who lived an entire life span and people who had 3 types of cancer already.    But that is the same as the flu.       THAT IS FOR SURE.   RIGHT?????????????   (3)  If you look at the age groups of people dying of covid that are issued by each country it looks no more different than the death rates of the common flu.   I just think people do not realize how many people dye every year of the common flu.   WHICH AGAIN IS  ABOUT HALF A MILLION EVERY YEAR.  And if you do like the CDC and you test every one who dies and see if they had the  flu virus....sick or not from it...........if you counted all those deaths as flu deaths yeah you could inflate it to the same number of deaths the cdc has done with covid deaths,     WHY WONT PEOPLE JUST LOOK AT THE FACTS", "comment_date": "2021-08-03T17:26:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Dick", "comment_text": "You tested growing BACTERIA (bigger)....Nothing to do w/ virus (smaller) <b>shrug</b><br><br>Now, test those masks w/ 2, 4, 6, 8+ hrs. of use.", "comment_date": "2021-08-02T20:48:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Z", "comment_text": "Well, you have definitively proven that masks reduce viral load on petry dishes two feet in front of your face, almost certainly by REDIRECTING the air flow.

So you are MORE likely to spread viruses to more people the longer you have it.

Also, the &#39;new&#39; Virus kills less than the flu according to official figures, so why do this in the first place? Just one more thing. All the idiots say &#39;I wear my mask to protect you&#39;. So it only traps the virus when you breathe but not when someone else breathes? That&#39;s like saying &#39;I wear my sunscreen so you don&#39;t get sunburned&#39; instead of making masks mandatory, let&#39;s make vit D mandatory because vit D can be processed into zinc, which is essential for fighting viral infections. So get some sunlight everyday, and maybe go for a jog with someone without masks or social distancing to help build your immune system so it has a stronger response to the &#39;new&#39; Virus. Also, citric acid is a good boost for your immune system, so eat oranges. That&#39;s the advice that has worked for tens of thousands of years, and it won&#39;t change any time soon.

More and more data shows that it is not the droplets infecting people but the smallest particles of aerosols which are much smaller than the masks can handle including individual floating particles of the virus. The issue is not how many droplets can a mask stop but how many virus particles it doesn&#39;t stop and with the increase in infections worldwide it seems that the virus doesn&#39;t care about your home made mask or even the standard medical mask. N95 mask (designation) stops 95% particles but that would be mostly bacteria not viruses and it could mean 99% of viruses passing through the filter. N100 masks are supposed to filter over 99% particles but again it doesn&#39;t mean it stops any viruses. As a matter of fact both N95 and N99 packaging states that these are not designed to prevent viral infections. So the problem with the masks that the government mandate people to wear, including home made masks, is that these are mostly useless against viruses and give people false sense of security.

But i have a couple concerns with it. So as the woman stated in your video you cannot see covid appear on this test because it is so tiny. A virus is submicroscopic so thats incredibly small. She also stated that this test is for fungi and bacteria (microbes), which a virus is neither of those. A virus is a virus so if the test is to show fungi and bacteria i dnt understand how its suppose to support proof for covid.  Also if you go outside when it is very cold out so you can see the water vapor of your breath you can do it with a mask on and watch it pass right through the mask. So clearly if you say water vapor carries it and it is submicroscopic covid can get through as well. Have you seen the experiment done with a co2 detector. OSHA has guidelines for c02 levels and toxicity for indoor buildings. They state that 5000+ ppm is very dangerous for human health thats why there is regulations. When this test on the mask was conducted within a minute or 2 the c02 levels within the mask went above 5000 ppm some even doubled. So im sure the mask helps a certain percentage, which i would say very low percentage of vapor gets stopped cause people dont just spit when speaking. So the question shouldn&#39;t be do the masks stop vapor it should be do the cons out-way the benefits. I would say yes considering that you have reached high levels of toxicity for long periods of time, your blood oxygen goes down and you c02 goes up from lack of fresh air flow,  that stresses out the body causing a rise in cortisol which suppresses your immune system. What if people are having panic attacks causing adrenaline to flow that will suppress your immune system to conserve energy for your limbs, which means your immune system is not doing its job.

If you\u2019re working with fumes and aerosol chemicals and you give your  employees the wrong masks and they get sick, you can be sued.<br><br>N95 masks: are designed for CONTAMINATED environments. That means when  you exhale through N95 the design is that you are exhaling into  contamination. The exhale from N95 masks are vented to breath straight  out without filtration. They don\u2019t filter the air on the way out. They  don\u2019t need to.<br>Conclusion: if you\u2019re in Target and the guy with Covid has a N95 mask,  his covid breath is unfiltered being exhaled into Target (because it was  designed for already contaminated environments, it\u2019s not filtering your  air on the way out).<br><br>Surgical Mask: these masks were designed and approved for STERILE  environments. The amount of particles and contaminants in the outside  and indoor environments where people are, are CLOGGING these masks very,  VERY quickly. The moisture from your breath combined with the clogged  mask will render it \u201cuseless\u201d IF you come in contact with Covid and your  mask traps it, YOU become a walking virus dispenser. Everytime you put  your mask on you are breathing the germs from EVERYWHERE you went. They  should be changed or thrown out every \u201c20-30 minutes in a non sterile  environment.\u201d<br><br>Cloth masks: I can\u2019t even believe I\u2019m having to explain this, but here  it goes. Today, three people pointed to their masks as they walked by  me entering Lowe\u2019s. They said \u201cya gotta wear your mask BRO\u201d I said very  clearly \u201cthose masks don\u2019t work bro, in fact they MAKE you sicker\u201d they  \u201cpshh\u2019d\u201d me. By now hopefully you all know CLOTH masks do not filter  anything. You mean the American flag one my aunt made? Yes. The one with  sunflowers that looks so cute? Yes. The bandanna, the cut up t-shirt,  the scarf ALL of them offer NO FILTERING whatsoever. As you exhale, you  are ridding your lungs of contaminants and carbon dioxide. Cloth masks  trap this carbon dioxide the best. It actually risks your health, rather  than protect it. The moisture caught in these masks can become mildew  ridden over night. Dry coughing, enhanced allergies, sore throat are all  symptoms of a micro-mold in your mask.<br>Ultimate Answer:<br>N95 blows the virus into the air from a contaminated person.<br>The surgical mask is not designed for the outside world and will not  filter the virus upon inhaling through it. It\u2019s filtration works on the  exhale, (Like a vacuum bag, it only works one way) but likely stops  after 20 minutes, rendering it useless outside of a STERILE ENVIRONMENT (correct Becky, they don\u2019t work in a bar, not even a little bit).<br>Cloth masks are WORSE than none. It\u2019s equivalent to using a chain link fence to stop mosquitos.<br><br>The CDC wants us to keep wearing masks. The masks don\u2019t work. They\u2019re being used to provide false comfort and push forward a specific agenda. For the love of God, research each mask\u2019s designed use and purpose, I bet you will find NONE are used in the way of \u201cviral defense.\u201d<br>Just like EVERY Flu season kids, wash your hands. Sanitize your hands. Don\u2019t touch stuff. Sanitize your phone. Don\u2019t touch people. And keep your distance. Why? Because your breath stinks, your deodorant is failing, your shoes are old and stink, that shirts not clean, &amp; I like my space. Trust me I can hear you from here. Lots of reasons to keep your distance and work on body hygiene. But trust me, the masks do  not work.<br><br>*Occupational Safety &amp; Hazard Association sited.<br>The top American organization for safety.<br>They regulate and educate asbestos workers, surgical rooms, you name it.<br>I know, facts suck. They throw a wrench into the perfectly (seeming) packaged pill you are willingly swallowing.

If your mask gives you security, by all means wear it.

Hospitals refuse to prescribe the proven cure in order to get big money from the federal government and states get big money for reporting positives causing the over-testing with a bogus test whose inventor stated multiple times on video that this test cannot be used to detect the infection of any germ because of the amplification process yet we still use it ignoring this fact causing incredible amounts of false positives of thousands of people who have never been infected with COVID. To focus on the mask&#39;s effectiveness gives credence to a harmless germ that would no longer exist if everyone were given hydroxychloroquine with zink early on in the onset of their suspected infection yet for this very reason this drug is blocked by the corrupt leaders of medicine working for corporations that own hospitals by their threats to fire doctors willing to prescribe this absolute cure. That is why only hospital doctors refuse this cure and all the outpatient doctors across the nation definitely do prescribe this cure with proven results such as:  <br>Dr. Zelenko in NY State over 2200 COVID patients treated and only 2 were ever hospitalized all age brackets. <br>DR Tyson over 1500 covid patients treated with only 4 hospitalizations no deaths all age brackets <br>And this list of outpatient doctors unbeholden to hospitals threatening their careers goes on and on with doctors who have treated over 4 or 5 hundred patients with COVID - no death all age brackets elite medical hospital corporate owned doctors&quot; for greater profits.

Even before this, it was common sense not to do so, and maybe you could argue the reason for the mask in this instance is for those who cannot stop themselves from coughing and sneezing. However, the debate here is about aerosol transmission, i.e. people JUST BREATHING mask versus no mask. And on that question, the evidence is NOT persuasive that masks (except maybe N95) protects. Also, although there are now studies saying masks may work, prior to that point - and all of scientific research history up to only very recently - ALL meta-analyses found weak to NO evidence for the efficacy of masks.

I encourage each one to check their respective states laws on if their Governor has the power and authority to mandate the wearing of face mask in public. For those living outside America, I encourage you to check to see if those imposing mandatory wearing of face mask have that authority. If not, they need to be put in their place and held accountable.\r<br><br>One last point. In my opinion: Any doctor, hospital or anyone in the medical industry or law enforcement field who says a person must wear a face mask is coming against the directive/oath that doctors take which is to do no harm. When they say people must wear a face mask, they are putting people in harm\u2019s way and thus nullifying their position as a doctor. They go from being a doctor to being a quack/fake doctor. Real doctors will not put people in harm\u2019s way. They are to do no harm. Do we see a problem here? This also applies to law enforcement officers.\r<br><br>So, we need to tell those who are insistent on wearing a face mask and ask them, &quot;Do you have faith in the mask you are wearing to protect you from the virus? If not, why are you wearing a face mask, and why do you expect others to wear what you obviously have no faith in to keep you safe?&quot;\r<br><br>I am One Crying In The Wilderness!\r<br>Eddie Rogers, Minister, D.D.\r<br><a href=\"https://www.truenews4u.com/\">https://www.truenews4u.com/</a>", "comment_date": "2020-08-28T12:57:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Centauri A", "comment_text": "&quot;I live in a FREE COUNTRY!&quot; <br><br><br><br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll wake up in a NOT SO FREE HOSPITAL.&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-08-28T02:31:03Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Robert W.

Where breath vapor goes, so goes virus particles. The other really big problem with this, and similar demonstrations is that you are supporting the theory that masks quell the spread of virus because of their ability to catch water droplets....but you&#39;ve only tested the action of &quot;wearing&quot; the mask. People do lots of other things with masks too. They slide them down on their neck. they touch them ( which the CDC says you cant do, or its contaminated), they wad them up and put them in their pocket. The same pocket that has feces infested dollar bills and a phone...oh and now whatever was on the mask is on the phone too. But even the &quot;wearing&quot; part of the mask poses problems that this demonstration didn&#39;t resolve.

So you have this replenishing concentrated cesspool of flu/Covid/ Cold/TB and whatever else your body is fighting...sitting right there on your face...all day long...even when you eat, its still there, and your touching it itching and all that.. So looking at the whole exercise of wearing a mask....for the one good thing we are accomplishing, we are doing several other things that completely negate that effort. In the end, those droplets and the microscopic material contained therein, found their way out into public surfaces anyway. It seems to me that there is the potential that Mask wearers could actually be spreading sickness at a greater rate than non mask wearers. ...but...I suppose we should do real microbiology to determine that, which I suspect would include swabbing of everywhere the mask touches.

I worked in healthcare for 20 years, and there are strict annual mask protocols and fit testing requirements that has to take place for protection from viruses, that is why an N95 mask is required for viruses, as well as a negative pressure rooms, to protect the caregiver.

You do not clean it enough (or use a fresh mask every time you wear a mask which is required per the CDC), you do not wash your hand enough, you touch things and adjust the mask, you eat and drink and pull the mask down... you take the mask off to talk on the phone, then infect your phone, and then touch your face, then infect your mask then put the mask right back up to your mouth.  I go in a restaurant with a mask on, I sit down take the mask off, I eat, put the mask back on go the the bathroom wash my hands, come back to the table, take my mask off set it on the table... so I can only get COVID when I am not eating?

CRT of N95 vs surgical mask in health care workers (Respect Trial) [Radonovich 2019]. Large pragmatic trial in health care works. Low risk of bias. The trial reported a non-significant finding which it interpreted as \u201cno significant difference\u201d. However, despite being non-significant, the confidence interval for the primary outcome rules out anything but a small possibility of any clinically important benefit of the N95 respirator. Again, authors have mis interpreted the statistical finding (OR 1.18 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.45). The evidence from this trial in fact supports more that the N95 respirator might be associated with a small amount of harm. Compliance was high. Therefore, this \u201csurprising finding\u201d of increase risk of the N95 mask (when it is known to perform much better in controlled settings) might be attributable to risk compensation.\r<br>\r<br>2. CRT of surgical vs cloth masks in health care workers in LMIC. [MacLntyre 2015] well conducted low risk of bias. Overwhelmingly suggests harm as opposed to benefit (RR=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07). The authors conclude this increased risk is likely to be due to the penetration of cloth marks with disease particulates.\r<br>\r<br>Conclusion: The evidence from pragmatic trials (people wearing masks in everyday settings) suggests wearing of facemasks both induces risk compensation behavior and increased virus spreading from poor mask quality.\r<br>\r<br>References\r<br>\r<br>[Leung 2020] Leung, N.H.L., Chu, D.K.W., Shiu, E.Y.C. et al.

Here&#39;s why: The NO MASK results are what would sit inside your mask throughout your day. Furthermore, humidity and heat will be present to help bacteria grow or in the incident of virus, build up particles in your mask. I have seen very few people who can keep their hands OFF their face and mask, and they are touching everything. The next person touches everything, then touches their face and mask constantly. All of this with increased humidity in the perfect incubating environment, which is the space between your face and mask. Lab tests are great, they show one aspect of something, but they do not paint the whole picture, which is why NIH over 2 years ago had a peer reviewed study that stated such. However, politics had to intervene. The best answer is social distancing and carry hand sanitizer with you. If you have to be out and about with a cough/cold, etc then wear a mask and follow the other guidelines as well.

Then I would like to see the experiment repeated with masks that have been used for varying lengths of time (without being washed) to see if the masks ever saturate and begin to become &quot;leaky.&quot; Test this for masks that seal your face (like n95 masks) and others that don&#39;t seal your face (homemade masks, surgical masks, etc.)<br><br>After seeing these results if they prove a lack of viral spread I will be convinced about masks slowing/stopping coronavirus spread. Otherwise I&#39;m going to assume the 0.3 micron rating assigned to n95 are ineffective in order to prevent myself from developing a false sense of security (if people get a false sense of security and wear masks that are potentially ineffective the rate of spread will increase as people go out more thinking they are safe). This could be critical for any form of virus, not just conra type viruses.<br><br>Even after all this, unless serious measures (like requiring disposable gloves in high contact/trace contact areas like gas pumps) begin to be taken I will continue to believe the majority of these public requirements are more focused on propaganda than actually slowing/stopping the spread.<br><br>Even after all this the viruses second wave death rate is only slightly greater than the common flu even without a vaccine, so taking these drastic measures seems unnecessary. After discounting the deaths from people that were practically on their deathbeds from serious co-morbidities, medical fraud, and averaging the first wave data with current and future data it is probable the death rate will be 0.3%-0.4% or less. The number of people that are postponing elective surgeries and may die as a direct result alone could end up being more deadly than SARS COVID 2. The cherry on top is what will happen if there is a prolonged world-wide supply chain halt. If enough big businesses and or small businesses that contract with larger businesses to provide raw materials shut down the level of strife will be unimaginable. Unsurprisingly an economy doesn&#39;t restart very quickly after it&#39;s derailed. It&#39;s taken more than a century for supply lines to develop to the point they have today.

Buy a bit of PVC pipe that fits over the petri dishes and smooth one side then on the other side cut chunks out of the other side to create crenelations or means for air to escape at the ends when the pipe is held against a surface. Put the petri dishes on the table and then place the sterilized pipe over it with the crenelations on the bottom and blow through it. Repeat the same experiment with a mask on. If you wanted you could even use adapters to have the start of the PVC pipe match the shape of your head so that all of the gaps around the masks are inside the test area and will have the air directed towards the sample dishes. This would test how much is coming around the outer edges of the mask however like in my other comment even if the masks are just 1% effective when you are dealing with numbers like 100,000 people getting infected then if everyone wears masks we can save 1,000 people!

You can do a really fun, cheap, and easy experiment to show how masks work by trying to vape through a mask. You can visibly see how something like 5-10 microns in size is affected by a mask. Meanwhile SARSCOV2 is like .07 microns. Masks are a PR trick. When someone sees someone in a mask, they will be psychologically affected and try and be more careful. Cloth masks are based off of a 100 year old technology that didn&#39;t work then, and doesn&#39;t work now.
