Yes, you could totally have the long allele and have the gene to per say \u201ccheat\u201d but what if you never do and still possess this characteristic? Will it eventually revolutionize into the smaller allele once passed down through generations? Cause if it does not and continually gets passed down from generation to generation then I am a little more skeptical towards the facts behind this. Although there is a 50% chance that the person could cheat whoever has the longer allele, will it eventually go down in percentage if they do not succumb to the pleasures that they are feeling?<br> I agree with the idea that a cheater could have cheated though due to emotional history and the way they were brought up.

Polyamory is the route of our relationships and is also evidenced in one of our most closest relatives, the bonobo chimp. If you look at sexual selection it mostly occurs at a sexual level (there are actually different kinds of sperms!). Look at the male to female size ratio of humans, compared to other monogamous relatives (gorilla) and you see ours is closer to a mixed relationship origin than purely monogamous. There&#39;s much more evidence which is in favour of polygamous origins making it harder to disprove.<br><br>Changes in culture, lifestyle and politics have created, reinforced and maintained a predominance of monogamous relationships. <br><br>Cheating is a construct created through monogamy - it&#39;s a social construct but it is real (maintained in the concept of monogamy if that makes sense). There are  negative emotions, connotations and effects that occur from promiscuous behavior (cheating) within a monogamous structure. <br><br>My problem with this video is that it suggests monogamy is biologically determined and doesn&#39;t seem to mention any other factors like cultural, political or epistemological evidence, and goes straight for  biological studies that don&#39;t seem to have Ultimate causation, remaining at a proximate level of research. the biology involved is a integral part of a larger theory of sexual relationships.

I believe we are designed to stay with a partner for a long amount of time (partners that we bare children with) however not all of our lives. It makes more sense for humans to stay with the mother of our offspring for perhaps 10-20 years at the VERY maximum, giving it plenty of time for the mother to nurture the children and father to provide, but once the child is grown up, what&#39;s the point of staying? It makes for sense for a survival and evolutionary stand point for the father after that time to move on to create more offspring with another female to maximise population.<br>Btw I don&#39;t agree with cheating and I think we should try to become monogamous, however I don&#39;t fully believe it is in our DNA<br>Also I don&#39;t think that mother should be the nurturer while the father goes off and hunts, I believe we&#39;ve progressed far from that as a species", "comment_date": "2015-10-30T00:06:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shawn Bury", "comment_text": "Sooo, what you&#39;re saying is that if I cheat I&#39;m doing science?", "comment_date": "2015-10-30T00:05:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hackyeah", "comment_text": "whatt happennds when you die?", "comment_date": "2015-10-30T00:00:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mruybkye", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqQf4Sg1g9w&amp;t=2m13s\">2:13</a> I respect you, this channel, and your sexuality, but good god I could sense the saltiness in your voice and it wasn&#39;t like you xD", "comment_date": "2015-10-29T23:52:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Armando Macias", "comment_text": "The Thumbnail", "comment_date": "2015-10-29T23:52:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saatana L", "comment_text": "Selv\u00e4sti ASAPScience on rasisti.
