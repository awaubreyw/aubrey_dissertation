I have been watching your videos for a few years now and really enjoy them. However, here is some constructive criticism: The Vagus nerve is a parasympatic nerve. The &quot;fight or flight&quot; response is triggered by the sympatic nervous system, not the parasymatic one. Activity of the Vagus nerve would for example lower the heart rate, not raise it. (However suppression/lowered activity of the vagal heart innervation during &quot;fight or flight&quot; situations can &quot;support&quot; (or at least not counteract) the higher heart rate (+ further responses to fear/stress) which are activated by the sympatic nerves. In this way the Vagus does in some way, if you want, play a role in &quot;fight or flight&quot; as you call it.)<br>You should maybe make an annotation to correct that... I guess it doesn&#39;t really make a difference to the topic of the video, but it&#39;s still misinformation. <br>Also, technically, the enteric nervous system is not really scientifically called a second brain as far as I know...!? But I see how that makes for a great title ;) And I completely agree that the connections between brain and intestines are fascinating, especially how ours bowel bacteria may influence our behaviours. <br>As this is something that has still not been fully understood/unravelled by science, I am excited to see what we will find out about it in the future :) Greetings from Germany", "comment_date": "2016-09-30T00:38:49Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Trevor Williams", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t like the new sound track.....", "comment_date": "2016-09-30T00:37:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Hammond", "comment_text": "Wow.
