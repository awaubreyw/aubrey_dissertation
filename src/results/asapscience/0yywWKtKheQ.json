The real question has always been &quot;do we, as human beings, wish to survive?&quot; Because, yes, although the planet will be fine regardless, <i>we might not be,</i> nor will a plethora of lifeforms that are being adversely affected by our behaviour. We and many other lifeforms may not be here any longer if the planet becomes inhospitable to us.

Capitalism is an unsustainable system in the long run, as you cannot have continued growth, more and more profit, production and consumption within a finite system. There will be a tipping point and either we will slowly adapt or change the system to meet our changing reality, or we will remain in denial and it will inevitably collapse under its own weight, be it through wars or revolutions, etc. This cannot continue forever.

But if the Atlantic Conveyor ends, which is closer and closer to happening, then not only will oceans stop rising, the ice caps will start to increase and we will enter a new Ice Age. The last this happened, when so much freshwater entered the ocean was when several meteors struck North America 12,800 years ago. <br><br>We know of at least two, possibly three strikes, possibly more. One hit central Manitoba, vaporizing billions of gallons of water trapped in the Laurentide Glacier (hence no crater), but the cores from the event show a meteor strike event. This massive event flooded the ocean and shut down the Atlantic Conveyor for 1200-1300 years. We entered the Younger Dryas. Meanwhile, Dr Anonio Zamora, a geophysicist, documents a second strike hitting the south part of Saginaw Bay. According to Zamora, the impact would have vaporized all like within a 1200 kilometer radius. There is a burn layer in the soil, that shows megafauna below that carbon layer, yet above, all the megafauna vanished. <br><br>Antonio Zamora narrates one impact site that white the south shore of Saginaw Bay, here: <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npXY8mu2hhU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npXY8mu2hhU</a><br><br>It is the collapse of the Atlantic Conveyor that will keep this massive flooding from happening.

I say we use a gravity tractor to coax Mars into earth&#39;s orbit, build factories on its surface to produce the appropriate atmosphere suitable for life, while growing genetically modified plants that can survive the early stages of a newborn life sustaining planet. While we wait, we must also produce genetically modified humans capable of living the majority of life at sea, a bit like the mariner in Waterworld. After a few hundred years, their dna would be so different, that mating between humans and mariners would produce sterile hybrids. That is when a small percentage of humans will begin migrating to Mars, along with DNA from humans around the world to ensure genetic diversity on the new planet. After a few successful generations on Mars, the change in gravity will begin to alter their appearance so much that the remaining humans on earth will begin to regard them as an entirely different species, even though mating between the Martian and Earth inhabitants produces offspring capable of continuing the original human gene. The Martians will begin to grow as a race, while their strict educational standards and barely inhabitable harsh climate will force nearly everyone to excel in intelligence as their key to continuing their existence: In order to have children the Martians establish a grading system based on IQ and overall health. Those with a grade below a certain level are sterilized by the leaders. Fast forward a couple thousand years. Mars and Earth are at war. They&#39;re still capable of inter-breeding, but their lives have pitted them against each other. Both planets limited resources have forced them to start trading with each other to survive, but the Martians launched a surprise attack in hopes of taking control of Earth.

Switch your search engine to Ecosia. It&#39;s a search engine that plants trees in exchange for something you do everyday. It gives 80% of its profits to tree planting. It won&#39;t require anything on your behalf, just a simple switch.<br><br>2. Reduce milk and meat consumption. By simply reducing the amount of such products you consume, you could have a huge impact on the environment without an impact on your health. Instead of, say, eating meat 3 times a weak, try to bring it to 3 times a fortnight. By just this, you would offset carbon emission by a HUGE amount.<br><br>3. Take some action. Switch off that light in the kitchen. Turn off the tap while brushing. Simple, household saving, will also have an impact on the global Carbon emissions.<br><br>4. Reduce air travel. There are many places to visit in your own homestate. Instead of going somewhere exotic, give your closer cities a chance. Prefer car or train for the required travel.<br><br>5. Start taking public transport. The simplest way is to do this. Instead of needlessly traveling by car just to buy some small items, try using public transport or walking/cycling.<br><br><br>And remember the Butterfly Effect. Everything has an impact.
