That of course depends on the psychology of the individual or group of individuals concerned. For example it can be very difficult (though not impossible) to help people reevaluate their deeply held opinions ....erm? whoops, deeply held beliefs. And quite often those in opposition to any particular beliefs use sound byte words which they themselves don&#39;t comprehend on a practical level. A typical argument would be &quot;your delusional&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; for believing that nonsense. <br>Whilst it&#39;s a fact that understanding can lead to a more accurate perception of reality, there is no such thing as a non-delusional human (of course there is a large variance in human delusion). Delusions and illusions are evolution&#39;s answer (consciousness tool box) that enable a conscious animal to navigate the environment it exists within ( A reality that no human has the perception to 100% comprehend , 100% of the time (humans are not deities. the god delusion being one major component of huge misunderstandings of reality). <br><br>A narrative to focus the point:<br><br>Many very young western children are encouraged by there peers (parents, relatives etc) to believe in father Christmas. These children ,on average, are more happy at that particular time of year than those whom don&#39;t believe in father Christmas due to the &quot;magic&quot; they imagine in their own subjective minds (though it could be argued that the happiness is predominantly because children, like there peers, like getting lots of new stuff at Christmas time) . Thus it could be suggested that the father Christmas delusion/belief is a healthy belief when compared to a more sinister form of belief.<br>Of course all these children eventually lose their faith in father Christmas, some completely and some transition towards a more &quot;mature&quot; belief like Christianity with sadly it&#39;s more &quot;sinister&quot; (and unhealthier) psychology undercurrents preached by some believers. e.g. Hell and original Sin.   <br><br>The point being is that delusion in it&#39;s self is neither good or bad ( healthy or pathological). It&#39;s the behavior that delusions can encourage/motivate that maybe beneficial/or not, to the organism (inc human) , the population of organisms or the genes (quite often the behavior is for the benefit of the genes).  There are some minds that need changing (or restricting from imposing there ill actions on society)  as they pose a real threat to humanity. However, there are many delusional minds that are not threats ( well at least not threatening on a inter-species/inter-human population scale,  not so much on a ecological scale, as we are going to realise, I hope!, sooner rather than the worse scenarios that will come later if we don&#39;t ) , in fact there happy delusions can be beneficial to a culture depending on the cultural context (e.g.  delusions are what the scientific method mitigates to some degree or another in order to focus on inquiring more robust  facts. Delusions ( day dreaming etc)  can be dangerous whilst driving/handling machinery thus a more objective concentration on the practical task at hand is needed). <br><br>My favorite delusion of all is conscious awareness &gt;&gt;&gt; ( &quot;It&quot; of course exists unless your a tree or a rock. Though plants react biologically to there environment which is why  consciousness evolved in the first instance (cite lots of biological research here ) &gt;&gt;&gt; That for many producers a delusion  that conscious minds are what it takes to make something that in retrospect looks like (on the surface)  has been designed by a &quot; intelligent creator&quot; (intelligent design). Billions fall for this delusion and will continue to do so unless they study the process of evolution at a level in which they comprehend Algorithms. Of course if a individual has no decent concept of evolution (which all the empirical evidenced points &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; towards being a robust scientific theory (like cell theory. And many have tried to find scientific ways to disprove evolution) then they will merely think &quot; human creates stuff, therefore something created human, therefore god made humans&quot;. The  anthropocentric way of comprehending reality (human first inc human belief systems) has been shown time and time again to be incorrect.e.g. The Earth isn&#39;t in the centre of the solar system and a deity isn&#39;t in the center (or anywhere else) of our existence ( unless? anybody have a comprehensible unless?). And as the gaps in our scientific knowledge become increasingly smaller it will actually do humans a hell of a lot of good to drop the competitive driven ego&#39;s ( at least where cooperation is the winning strategy). <br><br>The distance future for humans is unforeseeable. Though it&#39;s predictable and science can (has already on average) make &quot;it&quot; a more safer enjoyable place to be. Slightly ignoring the terrible offshoots of science like the Atom bomb. BUT, give a axe ( a tool like science) to a wise person and this person will leave the tree standing, unless it&#39;s harvested in a sustainable method, give a axe to a psychologically unstable person or nation or group of nations and .......?. substitute the axe for the energy discovered by splitting the atom. Ok, I&#39;ll quit now before I go off any various tangents, one of which would of been a narrative about how an effective way to comprehend something is to break it than try to fix it. Though, this method won&#39;&#39;t work with the planets ecosystem for pretty obvious reasons. So don&#39;t &quot;fix&quot; that which wasn&#39;t broken before humans started to seriously &quot;modify&quot; it ( break it in tiny steps over time due to a lack of the big picture and a comprehensive ecosystem health plan.e.g. The study of ecology etc)", "comment_date": "2018-09-21T21:17:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "E.

There&#39;s a sideways S-shaped tube in the toilet that connects from the bowl to some pipes leading to your septic tank. The reason it&#39;s S-shaped is so that water doesn&#39;t flow down into the pipes, keeping it at a certain leve where the water sits just below the curve of the S. When you flush the toilet, you bring in a large amount of new, usually clean, water from the water tank. The new water causes the total water level to rise, which means the water can now go past the sideways S-shaped tube. Basically, the new water forces the old water past the S-shape. As for zippers, they&#39;re simple. Every single tooth on a zipper is basically a hook. Each hook stacks up on top of the other tooth on the other side of the zipper, but only when they enter each other at a specific angle. That&#39;s what the zip thing is for. It basically guides the teeth to stack on top of each other at their specific angle, and unstacks them at another specific angle.

Because Vox has a racially and culturally diverse crew reporting on issues they cared about personally, it striked her as odd that people were convinced that Vox has an agenda. Nobody at Vox is forced to report in a way that pushes a certain political view. But she also talked about how the crew felt like close friends with similar interest in social issues. The problem I think is that they might have different backgrounds, but too similar world views.

The flapper doesn&#39;t close until water has drained from the tank. This water flows into the toilet bowl which also has smaller inlets for turbulence.

We disagree on the process, and not the final outcome. Like we disagree that climate change is natural, or it is man produced, or maybe there was a lack of choices available. Maybe climate change is natural but sped up by man. But having more than one question and answer to a survey is also a form of bad statistics. Another question is, if humans are natural, even if we have caused climate change, doesn&#39;t that still mean climate change is natural? Lol<br>Everyone thought the Earth was flat for the longest time, and scientists like to change the definition of what a planet is, so plutos status is always in limbo. The fact is that we are always evolving and we tend to change definitions and labels. What about the people who grew up being taught that Pluto is a planet and suddenly scientists change the definition of a planet and change plutos status to a non-planet? And then we recently discover another celestial body beyond Pluto and now is Pluto a planet again?

Of course there are and hundreds of thousands of cases and you talk Bullshit like that and present it as &quot;science&quot; and &quot;facts&quot;? Did you miss &quot;Vaxxed&quot; and industry independent lectures from real doctors which noticed all this shit and stopped it? Gosh, I wish you would understand german, I could show you soo much... How about showing me and industry independent study that this whole vaccination THEORY actually works. Measuring &quot;Anti-Bodys&quot; doesn&#39;t prove shit, it only says that the body came in contact with those toxins and genetically modified pathogens. And the industry &quot;fact&quot;, or should I better say LIE, that vaccinations stopped major diseases, especially here in good old Europe, is just utter nonsense and not true at all. The beginning of vaccinations was after the numbers were already rapidly falling (because of the growing living standard in like food and hygene). Ah and what about this serious, serious, serious &quot;pandemic&quot; of Ebola? Ah, I know the vaccines saved us from dying all over the world. I hope you even know how a true pandemic is characterized, to call &quot;Ebola&quot; a pandemic is hilarious on it&#39;s own. Thank god the healing pharmaindustry has the cure for us all like &quot;curing&quot; all our top 10 killing diseases with just pills and radiation. Finally most americans pop more than 3 pills and get healthier by the days! :D The pharma is great in emergency situations and operations (allthough most are unnecessary) that&#39;s it. Everything else is supressing and hiding  symptoms with pills, unnecessary operations and radiation, than curing the real cause of the disease/problem, which is basically just stress, bad food, lazyness and a lack of sleep and detoxification. If i stepped into a nail, I should remove the nail and not pop painkillers for the rest of my life. The pharma mafia has always &quot;against&quot; something (like high cholesterol or blood sugar), never with or for the body. The doctor should only get money, if he cured you, like in old china.

Are you really just going to repeat the generic propaganda that you usually come up with from your group think? I expect that I still have false beliefs, and try to watch out for opportunities to learn more from others that I talk about? I put questions in their minds. I spent about an hour each with a few mormons that approached me about god. I then managed to have them question their beliefs.

Until a few years later, I didn&#39;t believe in the CO2 global warming theory, because all I heard was explanations from people who didn&#39;t understand it. Whenever I would question it, I would be labeled as a science denier. But hey, I didn&#39;t understand it, and questioning it is how you learn, right? So for those years, I thought it was just political, because that&#39;s how it seemed. Scientists aren&#39;t immune to politics, especially if there is financial support behind one outcome. Now, I am unsure about it, and that&#39;s fine for me, until I take some time to understand it. In this case, I leave it to those that study it in depth. I no longer question anyone to learn, and I&#39;ve been put off from learning about it. It&#39;s probably one of those things I have a bias towards.<br>But the reason why my beliefs were muddled, was because of all the people spreading the gospel of global warming without knowing shit.

The emotional argument is how to convince emotional people. You have to directly find a way to better their own life (and your own?). Too many people talk about things, which people can not link to their own day to day life and their own problems (in the short term).If they can&#39;t link to their own life, they&#39;ll assume negatively about yours - because they&#39;ll assume you&#39;re profiting without telling them how (they&#39;ll believe you are being greedy concealing information). Politics seemed too disconnected. Only now with Trump &amp; Theresa May, people are starting to actually think far more, as the level of political conversation has matched/clashes with what they were already thinking. We can also expose them to the dangers of their own ideology/weak solutions via linking to real world examples (videos) of other places in the world which aren&#39;t so dandy. An example being New Delhi, where air pollution has gotten so bad on the roads, that it&#39;s like smoking 43 cigarettes a day (Example of how privatisation has failed: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCWorld/status/928257210488180736\">https://twitter.com/BBCWorld/status/928257210488180736</a> ). Even without mentioning the trigger word &#39;climate change&#39; - it still gets people to worry about the problems of air pollution and how to go about solving it. This in affect helps deal with climate change - just getting them to accept this fact (video evidence) will stir their mind and is more likely to convince. Take them on a holiday to there if you must - to make them see the reality with their own two eyes (becomes a part of their reality once they physically see it).<br>Expose them to problems. Hear them come up with solutions. If they can&#39;t, you just suggest a couple of your own to see what they think. I try to suggest very conservative views, just to find out how &#39;low&#39; they&#39;re willing to go. Once that understanding is set, then we can work on improving their train of thoughts - so both of your agreed solutions increases standard of living for, hopefully, most humans being (and obviously yourselves).", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T04:30:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr.Fan2049", "comment_text": "Hmmmm, yess, I will change their mind with communism!!<br>Hue hue hue hue hue hue hue hue", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T04:27:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "h", "comment_text": "people don&#39;t get convinced bc we r stupid. wen u r proved wrong, we feel like we should defend our dumbass pride coz we r more emotional than logical. point is, humans suck in logical situations like arguments.", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T04:27:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ken Scherer", "comment_text": "Are you showing bias @ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEWLY3mdk8E&amp;t=1m24s\">1:24</a> against the &quot;I knew it!&quot; &quot;Better than before&quot; Deniers by making their faces look sinister?
