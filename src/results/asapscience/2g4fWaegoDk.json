In most cases they could do away with the door all together and just have the maze entrances like many sports areas have. This way you don&#39;t have to put your hands on that door handle when you&#39;re leaving. I remember the middle school I went to years back built in 1984 had this. My high school didn&#39;t and they would lock some of the restrooms.

Even if dryers can in theory consume less energy than the paper toils, isn&#39;t better for the environment that we use more paper? I know, it sounds stupid until you realize that 97% of the paper that we use comes from reforested trees.<br><br>The more paper you consume the more reforested areas they might have to have in order to produce more paper. A tree like eucalyptus needs 9 years to grow and in that period while it&#39;s waiting to be harvested it stays absorbing carbon from the environment, making oxygen and latter when the paper toil gets to a landfill, that carbon is trapped for at least 50 years, until it decomposes enough where it turn into methane gas and can be reused to produce electricity.\u00a0<br><br>Meanwhile dryers use electricity that&#39;s never recycled back, and this electricity might come from coal, fossil fuels. If you are lucky it can come from nuclear energy or other non carbon emitting energy sources, but the more clean energy we consume, the less it remains to power other things that otherwise will do consume non clean energy.\u00a0<br><br>I suspect, even I didn&#39;t really did the calculation, that even the total amount of energy used to harvest/transform trees into paper is much bigger than the energy used by 2000 W dryer to dry your hands, in the end lots of the energy used to produce paper come from the trees itself (the process is complicated, but 65% of the energy to produce paper can come from the black liquor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_liquor\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_liquor</a> ) maybe in the the end the difference isn&#39;t that big at all, while dryers don&#39;t contribute to absorb carbon in no way. \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>So in summary a dryer perhaps could be worst to the environment than paper toils. And cutting trees to make paper isn&#39;t that bad considering that it will lead to more reforestation.\u00a0<br><br>To be honest, I don&#39;t really know the answer to that.
