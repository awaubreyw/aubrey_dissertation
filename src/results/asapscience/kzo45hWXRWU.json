There is really no illusion here, both answers are correct because it is the question that is asked very wrongly. The question is asking whether the note moved from high to low or from low to high, which creates a presumption that there is only one note that is moving. But if you listen carefully, maybe you could make out that two notes are played simultaneously each time. The intervals are both octaves (latter one is double octave), and they move in contrary motion to each other by the same interval (half of an octave), so it can be potentially difficult for an average individual to hear. If you have a piano or keyboard, or you could perhaps make use of some digital piano, play the notes C3 and C4 at the same time, then F#2 and F#4 at the same time. Sounds the same as the illusion audio, right? Because that is what is played. The C3 voice goes down to F#2, and C4 voice goes up to F#4.

After a while of this I\u00a0started hearing something very different, and I couldn&#39;t believe my ears, or that the same sounds were continuing to be played. Now it sounded like a\u00a0tone of one identical pitch was being repeatedly played, without any of the previous ups or downs. It&#39;s as if my brain was no longer bothering to\u00a0map a series of triangles (or peaks and valleys) but\u00a0two flat lines: \u00a0,\u00a0\u00a0 ,\u00a0\u00a0 ,\u00a0\u00a0 ,\u00a0 and \u00a0&#39;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &#39;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &#39;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &#39;\u00a0 alongside each other\u00a0simultaneously, sounding like one.\u00a0 This isn&#39;t an illusion exactly, but possibly a\u00a0more efficient way of plotting sound events.

I don&#39;t think the powers of audition are as cool as those of vision, but these were neat.<br><br>Obviously vision will have an impact on what you hear. That&#39;s why I try to make sure I enunciate properly (as posh as that may sound :P).<br>I don&#39;t really mix up consonant sounds. Spanish/English for example, the Spanish v and English b can sorta sound the same. It never confuses anyone because of the context, but the same principle applies. Two sounds <i>can</i> sound the same, so <b>they might as well be the same sound</b>; the experiment in the video is pretty much what happens whether the sound [clip] is the same or not.<br>I do mix up vowel sounds though. I can pronounce &quot;bag&quot; as either &quot;beg&quot; or a hybrid of the two &quot;Ba-eg.&quot; I add more sounds and change the stress of the word or no real reason and I notice it but don&#39;t change it.<br><br>The second one was the least impressive, actually (edited post). The sound does not affect vision as much, perhaps because people rely more on vision than sounds in small environments (as opposed to a loud crash of rubble). It&#39;s kind of like a mouse click. You get two clicks (hold and release) but one input; it&#39;s not liked you pressed twice. It was essentially a signal sound. It might be different with other situations, but this one was kind of weak.<br><br>The third one was kinda weird. I don&#39;t know if this has to do with &quot;left and right brain&quot; mechanics but I kinda immediately picked up two different ways to hear it. I listened again to try and isolate the two sounds for each sound clip. Then it was explained that there were actually two frequencies so all was well.<br>If it makes any difference, the most powerful changes I heard my first time listening were:<br>1. High, Low<br>2. High, Low<br>3. Low, High<br>4. Low, High<br><br>The last one kinda threw me for a loop. I hear two frequencies increasing (low and high) and after a while you start to think and the chain is broken temporarily. I feel that there are multiple frequencies though, some of which don&#39;t increase (the lowest ones). It may be all in my head though, trying to find what isn&#39;t there.<br><br><b>ALSO</b> has anyone ever listened to a song but sometimes it sounds slow and sometimes it sounds fast even though it&#39;s the same sound clip? Does that have to do with how awake and alert you are? I&#39;m surprised it wasn&#39;t mentioned in the video.

ALSO, I know how high the frequencies of notes are. Middle C, just letting you know, is C4. Okay, so the first tri tone pitch was actually a combination of two notes. They sound a like because they&#39;re either an octave or two octaves apart. The first pair of TWO notes were (C3 and C5) to (F-sharp 3 and F-sharp 5) QUICK NOTE! If I just say the letter name without -sharp or -flat, it&#39;s natural. The LOWER octave notes are going DOWN, while the UPPER octave notes are going UP. To be exact, the lower octave notes went DOWN by 3 whole steps (C3 to F-sharp 3), and the upper octaves went UP by 3 whole steps. (C5 to F-sharp 5). Okay, so here&#39;s the others. (#2) (B-flat 3 and B-flat 4) to (E3 and E5) The LOWER octaves are going DOWN and the UPPER octaves are going UP. I HOPE THIS MAKES SENSE TO YOU!!!!!! XD (#3) (D3 and D5) to (G-sharp 3 and G-sharp 4) This time, the LOWER went UP while UPPER went DOWN. (#4) (F3 and F4) to (B2 and B4) LOWER went DOWN while UPPER went UP. For me, I TRUST MY EARS WHEN IT COMES TO PITCHES AND FREQUENCIES!!!!!)<br><br>What&#39;s really amazing is that the higher octave notes tends to sound LOUDER than the lower notes. In Orchestra, the Basses are the foundation of the orchestra. We feel the bass, but we don&#39;t really hear the notes. So, through that long and maybe confusing paragraph, by listening to the upper octaves, you might say (#1) went up, (#2) went up, (#3) went down, and (#4) went up. If you focus more on the lower octave notes, you could say that (#1) went down, (#2) went down, (#3) went up, and (#4) went down.<br><br>The last thing on the video with the red ball, going up, like I said, we tend to listen to the higher notes because they stand out compared to the lower frequency notes, even though they are the same NOTES, the FREQUENCIES are different.

Whether we hear the fundamental note or the exaggerated overtone probably has to do with what kind of music we are exposed to.
