Turn on a humidifier and use a barometer to keep humidity around 45-50. Use a space heater instead of central and layer your clothing.<br><br>3) When allergy season is in, cover your mouth and nose with a paper towel when walking from house to car and vice versa (especially if someone is cutting grass). If exposed to grass mold, dust, etc., do a sinus irrigation as soon as possible. Use anti-allergens on bed linens. Vacuum and dust regularly.<br><br>4) Keep hand sanitizer in your car and use it if you have to touch public doors, shopping carts, etc. Don\u2019t touch your face!

It would be great if you could make a video on these and let me know the answers. I know this message is too long and thank you in advance for your time in reading through this.<br><br>1.\u00a0 I&#39;ve always wondered on how the brain actually stores information? I mean like a computer does it store info bits, where 1s and 0s are made up two types of chemicals. If so, how can it store an image with a irregular shape, [Some people have good memory of what they see, don&#39;t they?]. And how does our brain store the billions of colors it sees everyday and still remember the color or the shape of your favorite item or the smell of the rose that you haven&#39;t smelt for ages, or the pain of having your hand cut by a blade, or the soft silky texture of your carpet or even the tune of a song that you just heard once but got stuck in your head. I mean all these can not just be chemical 1s and 0s. and if each color, shape, smell is coded by a unique chemical then how are combinations of them or just irregularities in them remembered by our brain?<br><br>2. How are just a bunch of atoms which make up our body perform calculus, division, complex maths, physics and also perceive pain, happiness and so on... I know that there are chemical receptors and hormones involved in the perception of feelings, but those are just a bunch of atoms and how are they able to bring about so many complex things that we can not artificially induce. Our brain just like air is just made of atoms, but it is also the &quot;most complex computer in the world&quot;. So, can we actually assemble a fully working human baby just by combining atoms in the right proportion step by step first forming the DNA, then the cell organelles and then multiply it, provide different environments or hormones to it to specialize it to form neurons or cardiac muscles? and then arrange it to form a working human who will grow up to be just like us and have memory just like us?<br><br>3. How is light both a particle and a wave? In an Electromagnetic wave, the magnetic and electrical field are perpendicular to each other. So, does the particle form of light exist when the electrical and magnetic fields coincide? or does the photon just moove up and down along with its rectilinear propagation, making it a wave?<br><br>4. If we are on the look-out for planets with extra-terrestrial organisms beyond our solar system, then won&#39;t we be too late? Since the light takes at least few thousand years to reach us, won&#39;t we currently be receiving light from 1015 A.D.? And if the system was a million light-years away, then won&#39;t we be receiving light from a million years ago? If so, then we may not know the current status of the planet we are looking at. I mean it may have been sucked into a black hole a few thousand years ago when we are still looking at light from a billion years ago... So, isn&#39;t hunting for planets which support extra-terrestrial life futile? We may never know the current status of the planet or the organisms living on it right? So, we may dessert our resource-drained planet one day thinking that there is a planet out there that can support life, but we end up seeing just a black hole and with no resources to return. That would be the end of us...<br><br>5. Finally, how does our body now when to die? Does our brain send a unique chemical hormone that is released during death so that out organs stop functioning? If so, then how does our brain know when to die? Is is something to do with DNA which contains information on when to die? Or does our body just die? There have been cases where people know they are about to die that day, or cases where they sub-consciously do things without enthusiasm the whole day and die that night or the next day, or cases where they get last minute wishes before they die. So maybe one-time-use hormones act in this case?<br><br>I would like to know answers to these questions.
