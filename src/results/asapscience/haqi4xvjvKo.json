The vape shop taking care not to use harmful chemicals plus getting to zero nicotine greatly reduces many health issues with vaping.  The biggest issue is people not being educated about this stuff. The worst of all vape products is the random brands you get for gas stations, convenient stores, grocery stores, etc. They could care less what&#39;s in their product.

Every month I bought a juice with a lower nicotine level. Right now I&#39;m using 6mg and by the end of this year I&#39;ll be nicotine free. What people fail to realise about vaping is that it&#39;s a tool, not a toy. Vaping was originally designed as an alternative to smoking but eventually people saw it as a way to quit smoking for good. Mainly because with vaping, people have direct control over how much nicotine they put in their vaporisers. Hence, it smoothes the quitting process to the point it just feels like drinking a glass of lemonade or chewing some gum. I personally love fruit and menthol flavors because it tastes better obviously and the added benefit is that it dissociates the nicotine high from cigarette smoke taste. I&#39;ve been smoke free for well over a year thanks to vaping and in the next couple of months I will be nicotine free. I hope my story has inspired those reading it.

I&#39;m smoke free to the grave! btw, I never stepped down nicotine while vaping as you might think I had to have. 18mg all the way!!!", "comment_date": "2021-12-06T13:03:52Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "Holy Cow", "comment_text": "Funny how the vid is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> long", "comment_date": "2021-12-06T12:59:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FakeEx\u00f8tic Shorts", "comment_text": "Hmm", "comment_date": "2021-12-06T12:05:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kisame Hoshigaki", "comment_text": "The fact that the time of this video fits it. 420: wee-", "comment_date": "2021-12-06T09:22:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just Some Kitten With a Gun", "comment_text": "I&#39;m so sick of propaganda pushing &quot;popcorn lung.&quot; I&#39;ve had smokers tell me I will end up getting it.

Thus there is a reason I compared my story to your bullshit story.  Of course those workers developed popcorn lung based on how much exposure they had.  It&#39;s the same as trying to drink a gallon of water every hour.  Of course you&#39;re going to get hyponatremia.  Your body can&#39;t process that much in such a short period of time.  Since we have ZERO cases of smokers getting popcorn lung which has more diacetyl than vape pens do, we can safely assume that a product that has even less, is safe from popcorn lung.

It was the first main pesticide and before Americans knew it wasn\u2019t fit for human inhalation, it was spraying in masses. They resulted in the decrease in population of many different species. Bald eagles were put on the endangered list because the DDT caused the female eagles to somehow lay eggs with abnormally thin egg shells.

So what does science have to say about this technology? Is vaping actually good for you?\r<br>\r<br>When smoking normally, the heat from fire causes substances to change from a solid state to a vapor. In cigarettes, this releases nicotine which is absorbed into your bloodstream through the lungs, causing increased heart rate, constricted blood vessels, a release of dopamine in the brain, and feelings of alertness. But because nicotine is a stimulant, once it\u2019s no longer present, you crash and crave more, which ultimately leads to addiction in many people. In the case of marijuana, the active component Tetrahydrocannabinol (aka THC) is aerosolized and follows the same pathway into your body, but with different effects.\r<br>\r<br>Smoking only takes six seconds for the active compounds to reach your nervous system. This smoke consist of partially burned particles, which creates tar in your body, has cancer causing effects, blackens teeth and destroys taste buds. This is where vaping comes in. If you can heat the active components enough to become aerosolized without starting a combustion reaction with the other compounds, then you theoretically get fast effects without the damage of smoke inhalation.\r<br>\r<br>Vaping typically involves a glass or metal chamber which has an electrical current passing through it. This way, it can be heated to a controlled temperature, creating a vapor with minimal combustion, meaning you inhale much less smoke. For marijuana users, vaporizers have become popular as the plant material can be heated to a specific temperature \u2014 usually between 185 and 210 degrees Celsius \u2014 allowing just the THC containing vapor to be extracted. For e-cigarettes, using a liquid solution instead of dried tobacco, has become popular; this e-liquid contains water, nicotine, a base and occasionally flavourings, and vaporizes at a much lower temperature. But this is where things get tricky.\r<br>\r<br>The \u201ce-liquid\u201d contains a base similar to that used in cosmetics and food which helps maintain moisture without creating sogginess. One common base called propylene glycol, which is also used in theatrical smoke, is known to cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory infections.\r<br>\r<br>SO WHAT HAPPENS AFTER PROLONGED USE OF E-CIGARETTES?\r<br>Scientists are still studying these effects, and even though in America the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given the seal of approval, much is still unknown.\r<br>\r<br>E-liquid can also differ greatly between manufacturers with barely any regulation for additives. Some have been found to contain diacetyl, a chemical that is known to give butter its \u201cbuttery\u201d taste. Inhalation of this chemical can lead to scarring in the lungs known as \u201cpopcorn lung,\u201d named after hundreds of workers who inhaled the chemical in a microwaveable popcorn factory and suffered irreversible lung damage. This is an example of how the lack of quality control in e-cigarettes should be a significant concern.\r<br>\r<br>But, current evidence does indicate that vaporizers administer nicotine with far less adverse effects due to decreased carcinogenic products and smoke inhalation. But less harmful does not mean safe. E-cigarettes with added flavouring (such as blueberry or grape) have been found to contain other harmful chemicals.\r<br>\r<br>IS SECOND-HAND SMOKE STILL AN ISSUE WITH E-CIGARETTES?\r<br>The answer is yes. Exhaled particles from vaporizers known as \u201cultra-fine particles\u201d are known to affect pulmonary health. Others are worried that because these \u201ce-cigs\u201d are deemed healthier that they are becoming more appealing for young people. A study reported that continued use of e-cigarettes for teens in grades 6 to 12 had increased from 6% to 20% over three years.\r<br>\r<br>On the other hand, much of the information we have on the adverse effects of smoking comes from long-term studies, with cancers appearing much later life. Since vaporizer use is relatively new we simply don\u2019t have the same access to longitudinal studies. So we\u2019ll wait to see!", "comment_date": "2019-01-12T14:41:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mi amore Cadenza", "comment_text": "There\u2019s no water in juicen", "comment_date": "2019-01-11T12:07:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "s clacker", "comment_text": "Weed is the shit bro", "comment_date": "2019-01-11T00:56:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Car", "comment_text": "0 mg", "comment_date": "2019-01-08T05:24:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate DS", "comment_text": "What a tittle", "comment_date": "2019-01-07T04:48:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A puglife And more", "comment_text": "People call it Thc and I call it<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>THIC", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T17:14:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Galitev", "comment_text": "Both are bad.", "comment_date": "2019-01-03T03:07:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andy Narvaez", "comment_text": "b", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T20:24:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": ":\\", "comment_text": "What about non alcoholic vape is it haram", "comment_date": "2018-12-28T01:44:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Skyes", "comment_text": "Video ended at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> lol", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T18:46:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Oliver Cromwell", "comment_text": "Brilliant idea:<br>Vapes but it\u2019s just a chocolate bar", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T17:37:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tiber Septim", "comment_text": "so we gonna ignore this mans voice crack at round <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=0m40s\">0:40</a>", "comment_date": "2018-12-26T15:51:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Pisciarino", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=0m13s\">0:13</a> Smoking, crashing, addiction<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=0m48s\">0:48</a> 6 seconds for compounds to reach nervous system<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=1m07s\">1:07</a> Vaping<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=2m00s\">2:00</a> E-Liquid<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=3m20s\">3:20</a> Vaping on the rise", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T20:58:52Z", "likes_count": 101}, {"comment_by": "Satwati Das", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/9BBs35YUMJk\">https://youtu.be/9BBs35YUMJk</a>", "comment_date": "2018-12-22T05:56:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lo m\u00e1s interesante", "comment_text": "excellent explanation I combine it with this product and it gives me good results<br><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2BzSswC\">https://bit.ly/2BzSswC</a>", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T19:39:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Starcher", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> minutes long<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This man is a legend", "comment_date": "2018-12-18T00:25:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JamesJunk", "comment_text": "There&#39;s one thing we know, both are not good for you.", "comment_date": "2018-12-17T07:22:13Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Emilva James", "comment_text": "Y&#39;all ova here taking drugs.

That Little Debbie snack cake or that Coke you had the other day damaged your body worse than several years of vaping. All of you need to think logically and come to an educated conclusion instead of forming a conclusion based on stigma and bias. Honestly, I think 0 mg nicotine vapes should be available to purchase for age 13+. Its completely harmless and it keeps them off of harder drugs. And no, dont even try to pull the &quot;gateway&quot; card because the whole gateway theory is complete bullshit. It was started as propaganda to keep people from using cannabis.

The fact that they have made it illegal for vape companies to advertise that it is safer than smoking cigarettes is proof enough that it is the largest healthcare conspiracy that our country had even seen. Big tobacco feeds the healthcare industry patients, the healthcare industry profits from insurance and tax dollars, they do not want a safer smoking alternative.

Also saying that it&#39;s not regulated is wrong, a lot of safety precaution goes into these devices so they don&#39;t blow up, or anything of the sort, the FDA is actually regulating e juice a lot as well, that&#39;s why vape shops can&#39;t sell higher nicotine then 1.2 in my state, honestly the FDA is probably just mad that there is a cheaper alternative to smoking now because they have made so much money from the tobacco industry.", "comment_date": "2018-05-16T00:10:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AndrewMarbleRacing", "comment_text": "Isn&#39;t getting water in your lungs how you drown and die?", "comment_date": "2018-05-15T18:22:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evan Diaz", "comment_text": "We\u2019re talking about drugs look at the end of the video time", "comment_date": "2018-05-15T05:21:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Dolan", "comment_text": "Love how the video is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> long", "comment_date": "2018-05-14T23:37:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "koko", "comment_text": "Smoke cigars or cigarettes....vaping sucks...", "comment_date": "2018-05-14T21:18:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Bananaman", "comment_text": "Lemme hit that juul", "comment_date": "2018-05-14T21:02:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "McKinlee Noble", "comment_text": "Not all vapes have nicotine in some have water and flavoring", "comment_date": "2018-05-13T21:09:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "{Natasha Hepworth}", "comment_text": "Im sorry, but while it&#39;s your choice to smoke or vape, it isn&#39;t my choice  to breath it all in.

Also Dyacydl has been banned from being used in vape juice by the FDA itself to prevent popcorn lung. While it is true we dont know for sure the long term effects, vaping is actually shown to also decrease the amount of tar in your lungs from smoking by using 2 of the main 3 components of the juice (Propoline Glycol and Vegetable Glycerin) to break up the tar enough so that the body can dispose of it naturally to the best of its ability. Vaping may not be for everyone and it may not be as healthy as some make it out to be, however according to a UK study it is actually approximately 99% better for you than smoking cigarettes.

Been vaping for roughly a year now and almost all of the adverse affects of smoking have completely vanished. I remember shortly after transitioning I developed this horrible cough (this is common) and my body cleared itself of about 2 liters of brown sludge from my time smoking. It&#39;s like I&#39;m able to breathe again (not to mention I&#39;m saving roughly $6,000 a year). Do REAL research. Smoking corporations like Marlboro have an incredibly vested interested in condemning vaping and scaring people away from it. Numerous studies advertising the harmful effects of vaping have been found to be fake or completed under super suspicious circumstances (for example the &#39;popcorn lung&#39; myth condemns e liquid for using a substance that is at least 100X more active in cigarettes and to this day rarely actually seen in recent liquid brands). Scientists can be bought- so can the media.

The withdrawal was rough, but after about a month or so I felt pretty comfortable as a non-smoker. About 2 months ago, I relapsed due to stress, and decided to switch to a vapor device since it seemed \u201cless dangerous\u201d than actual cigarettes. However, I found I was using the device MUCH more frequently than when I used to smoke, and since there is substantially more nicotine in vapor juice than in cigarettes, I needed a much larger amount of nicotine to get buzzed. I also started to notice that I had increased heart rate, constricted breathing, and other adverse side-effects from vaping. So I decided to quit cold turkey again, and that was SIGNIFICANTLY worse than the first time. My physical dependency on nicotine was much higher than before, and I had an episode where my heart was beating so fast/hard that I thought I was having a heart attack (I\u2019m only 19 years old). Long story short, e-cigs are much more dangerous than actual cigs because they\u2019re more convenient, more addictive, and seemingly \u201csafe.\u201d It\u2019s sad to me to see teenagers getting into this stuff, because I know they\u2019re heading down the exact same path I did.

It is &quot;harm reduction&quot; though, not that there&#39;s much harm at all.<br><br>Next was secondhand vapour.. studies have shown that no harmful chemicals are detected in the air even when they&#39;re measuring an actual vape cloud. Not even nicotine was picked up in a vape shop setting with visible clouds (not that everyone uses nicotine). To pick up nicotine you need a veryyy small room!<br><br>Another study just recently released in Australia showed long term effects of vaping every day all day with nicotine, where they followed vapers for 3.5 years, and found NO negative health effects at all.<br><br>Now some people can be allergic to some of the base ingredients, and PG isn&#39;t recommended for pregnant women, so keep that in mind.<br><br>I dunno what that school statistic was.. but in the UK, the number of teens who are picking up vaping not because they are quiting cigarettes, scientists said is so miniscule that it&#39;s statistically too difficult to even track.<br>AND, who cares anyway. Eating a cupcake with sugar in it is FAR worse, look at the evidence and update this video please.<br><br>Also nicotine is blown out of the water.. the other chemicals in cigarettes are far more difficult to quit than nicotine. Nicotine is more on par with caffeine in reality, as far as health effects as far as I&#39;m aware. Vapers don&#39;t find it that difficult to cut down either.. they all do it.<br><br>This video was really bad... very damaging, and it&#39;s just keeping people on the cigarettes.

Also since the diacetyl scare, most e-juice companies have eliminated it from their products and even before that, not all e-juice companies used it in the first place, and it was only found in certain flavors of others. E-cigs have the potential to get people off of smoking cigarettes, which are more harmful according to every scientific study I&#39;ve came across.

I just checked your sources (and their sources), and they refer not to a published paper, but to a safety sheet about propylene glycol. So I checked several (7) of these safety sheets and... you got the only safety sheet mentioning possible infection, the others either state there is &#39;low effect&#39; on the lungs on inhalation, even on long-term exposure (2), or just mention that the substance could cause temporary irritations of the respiratory tract (4). Also would appreciate if you used actual scientific papers that have been peer-reviewed. If I sell stuff and don&#39;t know much about it (and am too lazy to read into), I&#39;m much more likely to just write that it COULD cause all sorts of stuff. These safety sheets are not peer-reviewed, and don&#39;t have to be based on studies and follow a &#39;better safe than sorry&#39; policy. <br>Also: so you found a manufacturer that puts diacetyl in their vape-juice... was the dose high enough to cause lung-damage? How many manufacturers did this? I couldn&#39;t find your source for this, only found an article on &#39;http://www.ecigarette-research.org&#39; stating that their diacetyl study is sometimes used in the wrong way: failing to mention the low doses in e-cigs and failing to mention that normal cigarettes contain FAR more diacetyl (100 times more), when smoked.", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T09:54:00Z", "likes_count": 153}, {"comment_by": "Squishiiie", "comment_text": "Actually not all vape juice has Nicotine like if you smoke 0s there is no nicotine", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T08:49:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kamari King", "comment_text": "I thought THC was thic thic thic, I been watching too much Dashie", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T08:42:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just Digital", "comment_text": "We&#39;ll wait to see if vapers die*", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T07:07:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Commander Shepard", "comment_text": "If you own a subaru, you are OBLIGATED to vape.", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T05:08:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xaddre", "comment_text": "The video is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> mins long lol", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T04:27:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HenryBoBenry", "comment_text": "I love how the video is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> long", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T03:04:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dzhaner K", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a>?", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T22:28:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "33 Tran Nguyen Duc Nghia", "comment_text": "C\u00f3 ai VN ko ??", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T11:29:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Legitnespro\u30c4", "comment_text": "Bruh <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a>\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T10:07:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BeastlyDoote", "comment_text": "Funny thing is, is that the video is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> exactly", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T10:02:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Coroime", "comment_text": "one gives you cancer, one doesnt", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T08:05:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noemi Sanchez vlogs", "comment_text": "Hahah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> seconds", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T06:50:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "savannah j", "comment_text": "To me vaping is not that bad", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T06:46:06Z", "likes_count": 29}, {"comment_by": "Zoxxies", "comment_text": "Lol <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> minuets long", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T06:32:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Duke Dumlao", "comment_text": "Its vqpe", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T01:55:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony_IsLit", "comment_text": "I seriously don&#39;t get what people are saying about it ending at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a><br>Help?", "comment_date": "2017-11-22T23:24:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackson Field", "comment_text": "I just want to know if It&#39;s okay to smoke e ciggs", "comment_date": "2017-11-22T22:12:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PlUSHTALE 2D5", "comment_text": "H2o ha!

In e-liquid, you essentially have only a few ingredients like they said in the video. You have your nicotine in various strengths, your flavoring (which is quite literally the exact same kind of artificial flavoring they use to make candy), often water, and your base. Your base is made up of a combination of vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol (which are again both typically used in food production). The video states that diacetyl is often used in the base, but that&#39;s pretty far from the truth. It&#39;s long been known by the industry and consumers alike that diacetyl is incredibly harmful when inhaled, so no e-liquid manufacturer in their right mind actually still puts it in their product. The only time you really run the risk of finding harmful chemicals like that in your liquid is going to be in the extremely low quality liquids you find at gas stations or flea markets. If you buy liquid manufactured by a  reputable company at a vape shop I can promise that won&#39;t be an issue. If you don&#39;t believe me then check the labels on the e-liquid you see there. The FDA legally requires manufacturers to list what&#39;s in every bottle sold commercially across the United States. If you&#39;re worried about propylene glycol inhalation there are many many liquids out there that use 100% vegetable glycerin as a base, which hasn&#39;t shown to be harmful when inhaled. Of course, vaping is still a fairly new idea and we have much less data on the longterm effects of using e-cigarettes compared to conventional ways of smoking. That being said though, all signs still point to vaping being a much, much safer way to consume nicotine than to smoke cigarettes, and studies have been able to prove that e-cigarettes are the most effective way to quit consuming nicotine altogether. <br><br>Sorry for the long post, but I imagine many people out there are watching this video because they&#39;re thinking about getting away from cigarettes, and I can see how the information presented here might be misunderstood and make some people feel like vaping really isn&#39;t much less dangerous than smoking.", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T01:14:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AirOpal", "comment_text": "<b>THC</b>", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T01:07:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yahaira", "comment_text": "So just answer yes or no because I&#39;m not waiting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> (hue hue hue:3) minutes just to get the answer is vaping bad for you or not?", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T01:06:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wesley Nodine", "comment_text": "The video  is 420 min lol", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T01:02:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ted Martin", "comment_text": "420 lol", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T00:56:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Epikderpywhale", "comment_text": "4 minutes and 20 seconds... \ud83d\udc40", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T00:55:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MaSoy Sauce", "comment_text": "of course the video is 4 minutes and 20 seconds", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T00:27:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jan", "comment_text": "Did anyone notice that the time of the video is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a>", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T00:27:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SevenS", "comment_text": "The diacetyl that gives popcorn lung is a powded state the e liquid is a liquid state so it will not give popcorn lung it has been debunked multiple times", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T00:16:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BigE", "comment_text": "The video is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> (insert joke) (insert what <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> means)", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T00:15:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isaac", "comment_text": "So it&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> long. -_- Well done.", "comment_date": "2017-11-01T23:14:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bl4ckH4t 2", "comment_text": "And the video ends in 420 of course", "comment_date": "2017-11-01T23:08:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arkadius", "comment_text": "Are there really teens in grade 6?<br>I turned 13 half a month ago and I&#39;m in grade 8", "comment_date": "2017-11-01T23:05:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kim Nguyen", "comment_text": "Why is everyone in the comments talking about the length of the video?<br>I don\u2019t get it...", "comment_date": "2017-11-01T23:03:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beau B", "comment_text": "Heh <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a>", "comment_date": "2017-11-01T22:59:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oswaldo Hernandez", "comment_text": "I like how the video ends on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a>", "comment_date": "2017-11-01T22:58:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trey Simmons", "comment_text": "Any coincidence that this video is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> minutes?", "comment_date": "2017-11-01T22:53:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bogdan Arnaut", "comment_text": "HAH the vid is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> min long kek", "comment_date": "2017-11-01T22:36:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TAEE -

Its even more worse  for toddlers and babies.  Its also an issue because the average smoker usually does not do it in moderation, and  sometimes buy cigarettes instead of paying bills or using money for very much needed resources. Any addiction can rewire your mind. When addiction gets to the point that it is making someone dysfunctional then it  is when its most definitely  bad.   This is not a personal attack to anyone.

It&#39;s not nicotine that harms your body, it&#39;s the smoke and other chemicals in the cigarette. It&#39;s called smoking bc you are inhaling smoke, not vapor. And there is NO TOBACCO in personal vaporizers. You are not heating tobacco leaves. That&#39;d be smoking. You heat a liquid, turning it into a vapor, which you then inhale. Unlike smoking, there&#39;s not hundreds of harsh chemicals that build a layer of tar in your lungs that harm and destroy your body. Vaping is about the same as boiling water. There&#39;s as little as 1 and as many as 4 ingredients in vape liquid: Vegetable glycerin (VG), propylene glycol (PG), flavoring, and nicotine. Vegetable glycerin can be used by itself bc it&#39;s naturally sweet and it&#39;s what produces the vapor. Propylene glycol is used in many foods to enhance flavor. It&#39;s used for the same reason in a lot of vape liquids. To enhance the flavor and bond it to the vegetable glycerin. The flavoring is to make it taste even better than just straight VG does. And the nicotine is in some liquids, but not all. It&#39;s there to help smokers quit. Smokers switching to vaping can use a higher nicotine level and decrease it over time until they have 0 nicotine in the liquid. And then they can quit vaping if they want. Or they can continue to vape bc they enjoy blowing huge clouds of vapor. My point in saying all this, before you go and make a video on something you know nothing about. Take some time to research FACTS and not what the news or somebody else that knows nothing about vaping is saying. Next time, talk to some folks that use a vape and see what they know.", "comment_date": "2017-08-09T06:02:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Rangel", "comment_text": "Anyone else notice that the length of this video is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a>?", "comment_date": "2017-08-09T03:56:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gp5", "comment_text": "Marijuana sends you to the fourth dimension, smoking cigarettes sends you to your grave", "comment_date": "2017-08-09T00:58:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lander", "comment_text": "The vapers here are thinking now Wtf he&#39;s dumb saying there is water in e-liquid", "comment_date": "2017-08-08T23:25:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KILLERONROAD", "comment_text": "Occasionally flavorings?

You usually start with an ego or a cig a like in a tobacco flavor with high nic. But for most people, you don&#39;t stay there long. Gradually you move towards higher powered, more complicated devices, and in the process you lower your nic levels significantly. The problem is that as your devices and flavors become more and more complicated, you begin to move further and further away from what helped you quit and substitute in the first place. Eventually you begin to crave the simplicity of cigarettes. Ironically you had the simplistic design very early on, but now that you&#39;ve gone through so many different devices and tons of money, you decide it&#39;s easier to just start smoking again. And you do. This is the vape trap. All those fancy sub ohm devices might look really cool, but if you use vaping as a cigarette substitute, beware of needless or premature upgrades that will eventually leave you wanting and bring you back full circle", "comment_date": "2017-05-29T05:18:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Owl the Reviewer", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know if vaping is better, but I do know one thing; when people think they are healthier they use them 10 times more, which makes it much worse than cigarettes.", "comment_date": "2017-05-29T01:42:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Javier Caceres", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a>", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T22:17:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Whirls", "comment_text": "no one is saying if you dont smoke start vaping. no one is trying to say kids should vape, but saying that vaping is as dangerous as smoking is completely not true.

I&#39;ve been a smoker for 22 years and switched to vaping. My lung capacity has doubled (it&#39;s actually better than the non smoking lung average out there) My teeth are whitening and there is absolutely no smell on me or my clothes.<br>I hate people demonizing ecigs when in fact this is the way for saving thousands of lives.<br>And you throw kids into this? If your kids are vaping it&#39;s not the ecig that is bad, it&#39;s you as a parent that has failed. You might as well say wine is bad because when kids drink it it fucks them up, duh!", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T14:55:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zane Fowler", "comment_text": "E-Liquid does NOT contain water<br>we use Propylene Glycol or Vegetable Glycerine as a base", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T09:01:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J", "comment_text": "Vapes and e cigs unfortunately encourage mold to grow in your lungs, and also there&#39;s always the chance that it explodes in your face with the power of a cherry bomb :/", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T04:32:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tasha May", "comment_text": "Is it just me or do I see &#39; smoking and vaping&#39;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a>&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T03:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yujinz", "comment_text": "fapping 8)", "comment_date": "2017-05-27T14:52:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Lilley", "comment_text": "This is the stupidest video i have ever seen, its all first of all its not smoke from e cigs its vapor, there is way more diacetyl in regular cigarettes, i could go on and on but there is no point.

Also, given that propylene glycol in its aerosol form is a potent bactericidal agent &quot; <br><br>Well here it says PG is a potent killer of bacteria and that is going to drastically lower risks of lung infections since it kills bacteria.<br><br><a href=\"https://pneumonia.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41479-016-0001-2\">https://pneumonia.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41479-016-0001-2</a><br><br>&quot;Only one study (to date) models the interaction between EC aerosol emissions and susceptibility to airway infection. Sussan et al. [21] exposed mice to EC vapour for 2 weeks, followed by pneumococcal infection. EC-exposed animals had increased pneumococcal colony forming unit counts in both the airway and lung tissue. There are several problems with the design of the study and the authors\u2019 interpretation of the results. The mice in the experimental group were exposed to a much higher level of stress than the control group, and stress affects bacterial and viral response. Moreover, the experimental conditions exposed the animals to significant nicotine poisoning, with an average cotinine concentration of 267 ng/ml. Cotinine is the primary metabolite of nicotine and in humans the amount of nicotine needed to give similar cotinine levels are tolerated by heavy smokers, but highly aversive to non-smokers, who would be expected to feel sick and vomit at this level of exposure. Mice are much more sensitive to nicotine than humans (lethal dose in mice is 3 mg/kg, in humans it is 6.5\u201313 mg/kg) [22]. The observed accelerated weight loss, reduced immunity and early death in the experimental group were more likely the result of protracted stress and nicotine poisoning.<br><br>These interesting findings in rodents do not corroborate the evidence in humans. Despite millions of regular EC users, there has been no evidence of new emerging pneumonia outbreaks in recent years, or reports of infectious pneumonia in the medical literature. However, we are aware of a case of lipoid pneumonia that respiratory physicians in the United States have suggested being a direct consequence of vaping [23]. Lipoid pneumonia is a rare respiratory illness that may occur from aspiration or inhalation of fatlike material in the lung; an occurrence that is commonly reported in elderly people after accidental ingestion of oil-based laxatives.

If combusted, like anything, new chemicals are made and can be dangerous. If you buy vape juice from an untrusted source or: crack head, there&#39;s a chance it could kill you or cause cancer. Do you do your research on Facebook and Google? Try reading science journal magazines written in counties that are not so whitewashed by corporations. Look through some published papers from trusted scientific teams. Many have found that even including juice sold from crack heads in the figures, vaping is 98% safer than smoking.

Vaping, on the other hand uses Propylene Glycol and/or Vegetable Glycol as a basis (both very known and studied since decades, and used without harm in every aspect of our daily lives, like: Pharmacy, Food Industry, Cosmetics... you name it. None of the substances have resulted in illness or even shorten the lives of the planet population).<br>5. In addition, the Flavours are used since even longer in the Food Industry, and none of us consumers even so much felt ill at any point by them.<br>6. As to the recently debunked &#39;Pop Corn Lung&#39;, it has turns out, that regular smokers inhale about of 1000 times more the particles found at said factory, and as far as experts go, none of the smokers have ever developed that horrific illness. Vapers consume less than a fraction of what they measured in the fabric, so even the investigators are reopening the case to search for the REAL culprit.<br>7. Cigarettes produce Smoke. Vaping devices produce Vape. Smoke is the result of combustion, and is inherently life threatening. Vape is produced by heating a liquid to its boiling point thanks to a heating coil wraps by cotton (mostly), so that is function as a medium to transport always liquid to the coils.<br>8. As it was scientifically demonstrated by the most brilliant and serious Experts in the field, UK, not only it is saver to vape than to Smoke, it is about at least 95\u2030 less dangerous. Alcohol beats the cigarette by being far more dangerous, because our body don&#39;t have any use whatsoever for it. And even Coffee has been proven quite as hazardous as smoking.<br>9. Nicotine is also proven to be a close cousin of B3, and as B3, our body needs Nicotine to function correctly. Plants like Tomatoes or Potatoes produce some quantity of Nicotine to defend themselves from being eating by insects, but in our body, Nicotine is part of our regulatory system of Hunger. There are even Studies in the US, that had good results so far, to treat Alzheimer, Parkinson and other Neurological diseases with Nicotine.<br><br>Bonus fact: tell me anyone who is as addict to nicotine parches or nicotine chewing gum as to the cigarettes? No? Even if say to you, that those contain about three times the nicotine you would consume with regular cigarettes?<br><br>Bonus fact 2: tones of people have discovered the endless joy of vaping, and living their lives again at full speed, with the option of having the luxury to put down their vaping devices without more consequences than just missing it, but not one single had cravings whatsoever to go for miles and miles to get their fix done.<br><br>Please, do us alla favor: FACTS before Rumors.<br><br>Thanks!", "comment_date": "2016-11-29T03:01:28Z", "likes_count": 181}, {"comment_by": "DirtyBastard", "comment_text": "Diacetyl in E-liquids are far safer then that of cigarettes: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/3w8zqk/some_of_the_hard_science_on_popcorn_lung_and/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/3w8zqk/some_of_the_hard_science_on_popcorn_lung_and/</a><br>Just an example.

If the alternative is smoking cigarettes, it appears that the immediate answer is yes, although this is a slippery slope given that this assumption then leads to another assumption that they are &#39;healthy&#39;. I understand that smoking cigarettes is actually a combustion process that allows unburned particles to accumulate in the lungs, and as the video informs, it allows the buildup of tar as well. This has been shown to be detrimental to pulmonary health in numerous of studies over the past 35 years. We now as a society know that smoking cigarettes is bad for your health. Period. As for vaping, time and time again I hear that &quot;all I&#39;m exhaling is water vapor&quot; except that is not the case, it has never been the case, the vapor contains many ultra-fine particles as several studies have shown. Also, water vapor doesn&#39;t have a scent. Either way, the real concern for me is that longitudinal studies cannot occur until vaping products have been around for a longer period of time, and if this craze is starting with children who are 12 and continuing on into late adulthood, by the time we have real long term data, the damage will be done. As a general rule, inhaling hot, or burning, or vaporized anything is not a good idea. And for that reason, one would assume that the FDA would place more restrictions on both manufacturing of liquids, and the age in which purchasing is allowed. Until they do, vaping will continue to be self-regulated and with that, possibly even more harmful to health. Regardless of whether you are for or against vaping, the long-term effects have not had a chance to be studied yet, and the overall future outlook is eerily similar to that of cigarettes 75 years ago.", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T04:17:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SnPr Ashton", "comment_text": "10515414514316416215717215715114412345678812345678123456781236783264705472999999259923478990124999995689902993413269916749953349999914649932724997299456780991256899013995679980992993678146799829963469981899116996614499029999945699701249956998013234599990126153027999953249932436990199234129932994567801993569980299356780239999456725634569974326992644399243992369936299456780199268990123996789902993994574531531993125339943699801199234995029980123452999993883529999910399539912320124799346732899999826404999994159", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T02:02:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dakota Swaim", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a> Not only THC, but also many other cannabinoids found in cannabis such as CBD. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=1m50s\">1:50</a> No eliquids contain water, only the base as stated consisting of propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin.

I haven&#39;t had a lung infection a single time in the 3 years since I started.

I&#39;ve noticed e-cigs make me feel really dehydrated, makes my skins/hair dry &amp; not glowing &amp; make my cardio (breathing) a lot worse, &amp; give me chest pain, which makes me wonder, Whats is it doing behind the scenes. So I avoid buying the liquid, etc. ones you can refill, &amp; instead buy the disposable so that I don&#39;t keep having it (because I will keep smoking it)plus there more expensive, which will make you wna stop buying them :). When you do wna quit, do it when people who can irritate you are not around you, when your least stressed, take naps, drink grapefruit juice, eat frozen grapes, get beautiful smelling candles (and close your eyes &amp; smell them when there not lite,lol, the deep breathing really helps), drink lots of water, &amp; expect body withdrawals (bloating, acne, irritability, fatigue) which will go away shortly after a few days. Leaving you Happy, Glowing, &amp; Healthy, and if your a female, do Do-It-Yourself spa/pampering days for yourself (face-masks, deep hair conditioning, nails polish, exfoliate, etc.) to make you feel beautiful, &amp; relaxed.Also you may want to avoid coffee &amp; alcohol, as that make you feen for cigs more. Just make sure you find something to go to, or do, when your stressed, mad, bored, etc. so you don&#39;t fall back in. Also 1800-No-Butts helps, they&#39;ll talk to you (like a therapist for free) so you can deal with your problems instead of running to nicotine for an escape.

The study concluded that diacetyl is an avoidable risk for electronic cigarette liquid, and measures could be taken by the industry to eliminate its usage, without limiting availability of flavors. In 2015, another test of 51 purpose-selected liquids found diacetyl at trace levels or higher in 39 of the liquids.[38]&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-06-08T05:59:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "patrick kresnik", "comment_text": "nation z sold me vaping haha", "comment_date": "2016-06-07T23:14:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kidd Isley", "comment_text": "Cmon you need to do more research, those workers inhaled the flavoring in a powdered form and that still wasnt proven to cause popcorn lung", "comment_date": "2016-06-07T22:44:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Marcelino", "comment_text": "Just stop smoking or vaping.

There is more toxic chemicals in tap water than in Vape products.  NO... NICOTENE DOES NOT CAUSE CANCER! TAR DOES.<br>There are hundreds of doctors that have done research on vapor and e-cigerette smoke... all have deamed vapes to have 0.. YEP .. ZERO carcinogens in both first and second hand vapors. This product is backed by the UK equivelent of our FDC AND EPA. Vaping is directly responsible for over 60 percent of smokers world wide to quit smoking.<br>Fact... the Tobacco industry loses over 6 billion dollars a month from people who have quit smoming because of e-cigerettes. Fact... standing on a sidewalk in any city for a few minutes has more harmful effects to your body than 2 months of vaping. Fact... goverments in the US DO NOT WANT YOU TO QUIT SMOKING!!! The taxes generated in the US alone on cigerettes and other tobacco companies amounts to over 24 billlon dollars a year.  this year alone, vapong has caused the revenue generated from taxes on tobacco to fall to less than 10 billion.  You know why there is so much misinformation out there showing vapor to be so &quot;bad&quot;? Its to keep the coffers full.. thats why the government decided to tax the hell out of the industry .... why they are campaigning so hard to convince you of the lies..... smokers are quitting in droves... and withen 10 years, at this rate, we will cause the tobacco companies and many local and US governmental agencies to go bankrupt.

Data on people who managed to stop smoking in the UK for one year shows that only 3 per cent to around 5 per cent do it. This rises a few per cent if they use stop smoking aids like patches. Pretty miserable statistic as this data only covers people who really want to stop smoking.<br><br>Now the data on people who switch from smoking to vaping, the success rate rises to around 30% and that continues to rise every year as vaping products improve and become easier to get hold of. <br><br>People who vape don&#39;t die of lung cancer or suffer debilitating diseases and health problems. There is some tiny risk involved and sure that risk is enough to warn new users away. Vaping is not something you should consider if you don&#39;t smoke.<br><br>Also nicotine itself gets a bad rap. Yes its highly addictive but actually pretty harmless stuff unless you manage to take a massive overdose by drinking it or something stupid. Vaping nicotine has almost no health risks associated with it at all.<br><br>So to smokers I&#39;d say, get on the vaping! Your health will improve and then you can consider later on stopping vaping by reducing the nicotine slowly over time but you shouldn&#39;t underestimate the addictive kick nicotine has.

So probably in 2 more weeks i won&#39;t need to smoke any cigarette.

They are much different and alike, there are deffinitly some big mis haps between both, but some aren&#39;t even because they are beathing or ingesting (IDK XDD) it.  My dad works at a store the does all of this, This store makes a lot of money and has changed so many lives. The first time my friends saw my dad using it they were liek &quot;AAAHH HESH SHOMOOOKKIIINGGG&quot; But it&#39;s not at all, they know now :D I love it because sometimes, I play games with him in the basement and it&#39;s hard to see through the yummy and awesome smelling vapour. :D My mom was a heavy smoker, and this I think helped a lot with her asthma. I hear her using it a lot, like right now xD I mean, kids SHOULD NOT be doing this, unless they have already smoked reall ciggarettes before. In this shop, you cannot have it unless you are addicted to smoking. Some tanks can blow up, but using the right coils, batteries, and blah blah blahhhh, can help A LOT. I probably will never smoke, so i&#39;ll never need it. The biggest thing I love about it is that my parents feel a lot better in terms of lungs. It helped my mom a lot, when she does or did smoke, one of my wishes was for her to stop.

There are much less diacetyl in e-juices than in tobacco cigarettes, and noone has EVER in recorded human history gotten popcorn lungs from smoking tobacco cigarettes. In the popcorn factory where the workers got popcorn lungs, the amount of diacetyl in the atmosphere was close to 5000 times more of the diacetyl found in TOBACCO cigarettes. And second of all, not many of the juices contained diacetyl, but only some, and it has now been regulated, even though it is completely harmless in such small amounts. Please do some research before you start trying to educate people. Popcorn lungs has NEVER been seen apart from that popcorn factory, EVER.<br><br>E-cigarettes are not meant to be completely harmless, but instead a safer alternative to tobacco, both chewing tobacco (for example snus) and cigarettes. This principle is called &quot;harm reduction&quot;, and its the whole point of this product.

Kids smoke e-cigarettes? Great! Atleast they stay away from whats really harmful.<br><br>The liquid used in these products contain aromas/flavouring, nicotine, glycerin and propylene glycol. Aromas have never been seen as harmful to inhale, even through years of scientific research. Glycerin is ingested by people everyday, through different foods and drinks, and the same goes for propylene glycol. As for how it affects the lungs, propylene glycol is found in asthma inhalators, and has been used for MANY years, and nothing ever happened to the consumers, and please note, these people have asthma, that should logically mean, that they would get immediate side effects, if this chemical was harmful, but obviously, they DONT. It has also been used in hospitals for about 70 years, for ventilation systems, which basically works as an anti-bacterial. Nicotine is poisonous, that is true, but an adult human being needs a very high amount to overdose.

It doesn&#39;t bother people that much or hundreds of thousands of asthmatics, people sick with pneumonia or bronchitis requiring temporary inhaler use, or people with COPD needing inhalers would have yielded a massively obvious pattern of unacceptable side effects by now and removed from widespread medical use.  PG is also commonly used in mouthwash; yes, you do absorb it through your mouth&#39;s tissues.  No, it does not give you cancer.  PG is actually a handy solvent (when something other than water or alcohol is desired) for a variety of things and so it is literally in thousands and thousands of commonly used products and has been for decades.   PG and its side effects are fairly well know by now, not that mysterious.  New studies are being launched only because of the new vape culture and the bullshit fear mongering around it.   Please pay more attention to your sources next time.  <br><br>Misleading people about propylene glycol and making it seem scary and mysterious will only further demonize vapers, and more importantly, prevent smokers from making the switch to a significantly less destructive system of nicotine delivery (because the likelihood of people giving up their nicotine permanently is about that of giving up the other popular stimulant, caffeine).  Nicotine itself (not tobacco or tobacco additives) is not the part that kills people, though it of course can kill at extreme doses, and actually improves short term memory (through acetylcholine), fine motor skills and a few other things that make people interested in it as a nootropic (though I am not advocating such a thing), and a few productivity-enhancing things that make people love caffeine.  It has similar side effects as caffeine too, so it&#39;s not all perfect.  I don&#39;t recommend nonsmokers to take up nicotine gum or patches or vaping devices for the purpose of using nicotine as a smart drug, because part of nicotine&#39;s mechanism, it&#39;s interaction with our nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, is what makes it addictive (though not as addictive as a commercial cigarette because of how the cigarette has been tweaked to make it more addictive).<br><br>Also, vegetable glycerin is another common base for ejuices since it produces more vapor, and a denser vapor, and because some people have a sensitivity to PG.  <br><br>One downside (actually, can be an upside too, depending on your intent) to vaping is the vapor itself; the body absorbs nicotine in vapor more slowly than nicotine in smoke, water vapor and base vapor provide a partial but temporary moisture obstacle between the nicotine and your mucosal tissues (the vast majority of nicotine is actually absorbed by the tissues in the sinus cavities and mouth, not the lungs).    A drag on a cigarette is felt nearly instantaneously as nicotine is far less impeded by being carried in smoke as opposed to vapor and enters the bloodstream faster, but a drag from an eliquid atomizer comes with a certain lag time before the vaper feels it (it differs on what the VG/PG ratio of the liquid is).  This inherently makes ecigs slightly less addictive because it is often perceived as LESS SATISFYING compared to smoke delivery (it&#39;s also less addictive for other reasons I mentioned before).  It&#39;s fairly well known now that speed of delivery intensifies the effects of drugs and makes them more addictive.  Vaping typically delivers less nicotine in general due to the popularity of low-nicotine concentrations of eliquid - also because the mg-to-ml concentration of nicotine in an eliquid that would be comparable to the average cigarette (about 18-24 mg/ml give or take) is very harsh and unpalatable to a lot of people, so 12mg,  8mg, 6mg, 3mg or even 0mg are used more often by all except the most hardcore vapers and former heavy smokers.  This is one reason why many smokers have a hard time <b>staying</b> with the e-cig after making the switch, and many relapse.  Think of methadone and the addicts who relapse despite having regular access to this medication; it&#39;s just not as satisfying and many go back to the street drug again.  It&#39;s not a perfect analogy but it&#39;s adequate.<br><br>Lastly, there is no reason to be suspicious of eliquid from various companies if you buy your own US Pharmacopeia grade PG or VG and concentrated nicotine solution (in PG or VG or a mix of both), <br>concentrated flavorings (these are commonly used food grade flavorings usually produced for the production of candy, soda, juices, other drinks, pastry baking, etc, but now there are flavorings being produced that are exclusively intended for vaping, for example they will not have any artificial coloring or other compounds unnecessary for vaping - this both decreases the different compounds in flavorings, better for vapers, and extends the life of atomizers) and make your own damn juice (much cheaper that way too).  Close-knit vape communities actually keep vendors honest (nearly always themselves vapers), and as long as they stay small businesses that are in regular contact with their customers and the vape communities there is little to worry about.  It&#39;s typically the larger companies and corporations who are detached from the human element of their revenue that you have to worry about.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>It&#39;s actually the little bit of concentrated flavoring in eliquid that can be the mystery for a lot of people (who don&#39;t make their own).  The nicotine, the PG, the VG, we know enough about these and they&#39;ve been with us long enough for us to know these are no big deal.  It&#39;s the unknown stuff that&#39;s in artificial flavors (natural flavors too, actually, since most of the time when you see &quot;natural flavoring&quot; on something at the supermarket, chances are it&#39;s not a simple extract from a natural source like most people think it is) that we need to study, not just for vapers, but for consumers everywhere.  What&#39;s a common solvent in food grade flavors, &quot;natural&quot; and artificial?  Propylene glycol.<br><br>On the whole, I think moderate vaping is not a damaging as standing in a hot shower or steam bath for a while, because you absorb much more chlorine that way (by inhaling tap water vapor, you will absorb more chlorine through your sinus and lung tissues than through your skin alone, though you are still absorbing chlorine through your skin for the duration) and chlorine is definitely not-awesome for us in the concentrations usually put in our water.  Of course we drink quite a bit of chlorine in our water, but there&#39;s no need to make things worse by inhaling it and soaking in it too.   Eliquid vapor is also considerably less harmful than vehicle exhaust and smog ... but nobody seems to be all that up in arms about that, or leaving their homes with masks on their faces (unless you live in China I guess).  .  So it&#39;s really weird to see people make a fuss about eliquid vapor; the reaction is very irrational.   People being personally offended by vapor (because face it, it&#39;s not usually about fear, it&#39;s usually about a sense of entitlement and an opportunity to put someone down and feel good about yourself), provided some douchebag is not literally blowing thick clouds in your face, provided that it&#39;s mostly dissipated by the time you can smell the flavor?  It&#39;s all psychological, it&#39;s in their head, because they cannot disassociate it with cigarette <b>smoke</b> (though they easily disassociate it from smog). But since when does the public in general do anything rationally?<br><br>Tell people the truth, the whole truth: vaping IS safer/healthier than smoking - but by no means is this better than abstaining from either.  Encourage smokers to switch, there&#39;s plenty of profit in that, no need to try to recruit new nicotine users.

Also, while you did mention that some flavor additives were found to contain diacetyl, you failed to include that it was only found in tiny trace amounts, even just a fraction of what is found in cigarettes, and them only within certain flavor additives.  You could have also included that most of the companies that were found to contain the diacetyl-containing additives moved to self-correct those problems by removing those ingredients from their liquids.  Another point that you could have mentioned is that while kids and young adults may be taking up vaping at a higher rate, many of them are purchasing e-liquid that contains no nicotine.  E-liquid can be bought in a range of nicotine levels from as high as 32mg per 10mil. bottle to as low as none in most cases.  Many former smokers have seemed themselves off of nicotine altogether by slowly lowering the amount of nicotine their e-liquid contains until they are eventually vaping 0 nicotine liquid.  That information is something that  often goes unreported by the general media.  <br><br>Include a little more research before you post videos like  this.  The tobacco companies are already working very hard as is to try to demonise vaping and scare the general public away from vaping and bring them back to tobacco.

As a result, 99.9% of e-liquid manufacturers aggressively advertised the contents of their products so as to avoid any uncertainty. At that time it was common to use a propylene glycol/vegetable glicerate mix as a base, since propylene glycol provided a &quot;throat hit&quot; or slight harshness when inhaling, that resembled the feeling of a real cigarette, and you could choose to raise or lower that level in your liquid to your preference...but it soon became obvious that this type of mixture was only really preferred by people who were just quitting cigarettes and making the switch to vaping.

Most vapers, after 9-18 weeks without tobacco feel the (huge) difference. <br>- Nicotine effect on heart rate is more complex (as it also decreases stress and lowers the heart rate/blood flow, especially without associated monoxyde intake).<br>- Smoking has always been dangerous because of monoxyde inhalation which was known to be dangerous before the last century. Effect of simple chemicals in the long term have been studied for years which was not the state of the science in the 50&#39;s and vapor is quite simple compared to the thousands chemical in tobacco smoke.<br>- The current knowledge of long term risks associated with PG/VG/water/nicotine (decades of studies, billions of people exposed during their whole life) can give quite precise risk evaluations for what constitues 90+% of eLiquids.<br>- Effect on bystanders have been proven to be without risks for years (hint, look at figures and compare to indoor air studies for example).<br>Hope it&#39;ll help you make better videos on this subject.

I think that its worth noting that most e-juices use a higher level VG (vegetable glycerin) as a base with the lesser part being the PG (propylene glycol) and it&#39;s mainly used for the throat hit and to better absorb the vapors. I vape, and I recognize that it&#39;s not 100% healthy. I do however believe it is healthier than smoking. So it&#39;s more of a harm reduction rather than a harm elimination. I also don&#39;t vape it public places. Not because I&#39;m concerned with second hand vapor. But I can see how a room full of clouds can annoy anyone. Another thing that I feel is worth stating, that I feel like this video should have touched on to be 100% non-biased is that even though the levels of teens vaping has risen (lets face it when it&#39;s a new industry and no one had tried it the statistics have nothing to do but stay at zero or go up) the level of teens smoking has gone down drastically.

First of all, that is an e-cig, NOT a vape.  There is a difference.  An e-cig is a device that is meant to mimic a cigarette and uses cartridges.  It&#39;s not reloadable with different juices, once it&#39;s done you toss it.  Vapes however have replaceable coils, generally don&#39;t mimic a cigarette (particularly with mechs and box mods, but even vape pens look nothing like them) and have a tank with which you can fill, refill, and refill again with juice.  E-cigs are classified as vaporizers, but that doesn&#39;t make it a vape.  A vape is a specific term for the good kind of vaporizer. The other major difference is e-cigs generally use crap like sweeteners and such, while most Juice companies are moving towards natural flavoring because they know regulations are going to come out eventually and they want to be on top of the game before it happens, lest they have to be shut down until they get up to code.  Not to mention the whole point of moving to vaping is to be more healthy than cigarettes, so why put crap into it?  I know my vape shop ONLY buys from people who use natural flavorings, so I can guarantee what I put into my lungs isn&#39;t going to harm me.  You can taste chemicals and it burns, it&#39;s not a pleasant thing, so most companies won&#39;t even use stuff like food coloring because it sucks and people won&#39;t buy it.<br><br>Another thing is your mention of Propylene Glycol.  Now, what you said wasn&#39;t entirely incorrect, although you missed several uses for it and it almost makes me wonder why it wasn&#39;t mentioned since these are very big medical uses.  Nebulizers, for example.  Not to mention inhalers.  If it was bad to have in your lungs, do you honestly think they&#39;d allow it to be used as medicine for lung disease?  No, of course not.  That would be like giving someone with a peanut allergy small doses of peanuts to cure it.

There is a paper on that that also articles on this research (google it) that\u00a0anyone can read. Vaping transfer only a small part\u00a0of damage that also caused in smoking only in bigger scale\u00a0 and this damage comes from factors that said in this video BUT also its known that all branded\u00a0e-liquids since 2\u00a0years ago does not contain anymore those chemicals\u00a0, also PG can be replaced completely \u00a0by VG (vegetable glycerin) for those that have problems with PG.\u00a0Does it means that the danger has been eliminated\u00a0? No. But what it seems\u00a0 that there is evolution, it is technology and like any piece of tech evolves e-cig does\u00a0too . Some of the 5% of the danger is on the temperature that increases in the e-cigs by wrong usage the bigger temperature the more chances to release harmful particles BUT here again now there are temperature control devices that will not allow the temperature go higher than the safe setting of your choice within the safe range\u00a0 that will not allow even a dry cotton to burn. Yes still there are harmful substances but a name of a chemical and a number by it self means nothing and we have to compare it with something(water\u00a0that we consume \u00a0contains a bunch of lethal chemicals but there are\u00a0in\u00a0to small amounts to cause harm)\u00a0, with tobacco because I assume and I hope that only smokers will use e-cigs to stop smoking and comparing to tobacco is way much safer. Of curse the best of all is\u00a0NOT smoking NOT\u00a0vaping .\u00a0Vaping is only for\u00a0smokers\u00a0that have addiction.\u00a0Also we the vapers must always have in mind that vaping is not clean air and the best way to minimize that 5% of damage is to control the consuming of e-liquid .

Most use hair dyes and wear make up that supports their mental instabilities or suggests they&#39;re mentally handicapped. (I condone this because it helps decipher the mentally stable form the mentally weak.) They smoke just so they can post it on Instagram and show everyone how &quot;dope&quot; they are. But it just makes anyone with a working brain think less of them even more so than before. They can&#39;t think of logical response to a statement such as this so they either lash out with an insult or the typical, &quot;I don&#39;t care what you think. You don&#39;t understand why I smoke.&quot; Although there really isn&#39;t much as to why they do. Unfortunately you can&#39;t respond to things like this due to their crave for attention. But honestly as long as it&#39;s not affecting me or anybody with an IQ greater than 10, I&#39;m fine with it. One of two things will happen to these people. They end up in poverty, or die from natural selection. If smoking didn&#39;t affect our way of life in the harmful, destructive way it does today, maybe it wouldn&#39;t matter as much. The new criminal of this day and age is tobacco, and the tobacco consumer. We don&#39;t need people like this having kids, spreading their filth around this world we live in like a disease. If we get the smoking rate for teens AND ADULTS down to 0%, poverty will become more and more obsolete, and more people will have meaningful jobs. Also something to take into consideration: We&#39;ll be giving our next generation a safer environment at school and in everyday life overall. No perks come from smoking and contributing to it shows the lack of compassion for the lives of others.

There is a PG that is used in cooling systems but has a completely different compound make-up than the PG used in e-vape. And finally yes, yes there is vape that contains nicotine.

All the proof i need has been confirmed by Public Health England. Vaping is 95% safer than cigarettes. People talk about &quot; second hand vapor still contains nicotine and other chemicals&quot;. simple fact is that statement is wrong and has been proven to be wrong, its the uneducated misguided people of this world who will ruin what is already saving thousands of lives. Do research, read for once in your life instead of just sitting behind a keyboard spouting useless fearmonger information. Hell you call the vapor smoke for god sakes. It isnt smoke<br><br><br>I smoked for 10 years. I had no interest in quitting cigarettes for a long time. I thought id try out a vaporizer and wouldnt u know it, i instantly quit cigarettes. I started at a medium/high dosage of nicotine in my liquid (16mg) and have cut down to 2mg of nicotine. For those who dont know, the mg in liquid isnt relatable to cigarette strength as that measures tar. I woiuldnt have been able to stop smoking without a vaporizer and i am quite happy to say that the evidence that has been found so far indicates i now have a habit that is 95% safer and im not supporting big tobacco companies to boot<br><br><br>Its a win for everyone. In my city we have a carnival on once a year, last time i went they had dedicated smoking areas. I was forced to smoke in a certain place and i was ok with that. I understand that its bad manners to smoke around children and adults who dont like it, however it has been stated that now they are accomodating for E-cigarette (i hate that term) users by now stuffing them into the same spot as the smokers. Now i have good manners, so treat my vaporizer like a cigarette but why in the world am i forced to be with smokers instead of our own area. I am trying to get away from cigarettes and negative effects just like every other non smoker!<br><br><br>The study you talk about where you say &quot;propelyne glycol is know to be a lung irritant and cause infections&quot; is bogus<br>To Quote <a href=\"http://realclearscience.com\">realclearscience.com</a>\u00a0<br>&quot;\u00a0there&#39;s a &quot;little&quot; problem with the study that escaped the scrutiny of early reporting. Mice have vastly higher rates of cotinine metabolism than humans. While the half-life of cotinine in mice is roughly\u00a035 to 50 minutes, the half-life of cotinine in humans is approximately\u00a020 hours! This massive disparity means that mice have to be exposed to much higher amounts of e-cigarette vapor at faster rates in order to reach comparable cotinine levels to humans.&quot;\u00a0<br><br><br>&quot;As Mukhin and Rose further explained (emphasis mine):&quot;It should be noted that in our calculations we postulated that the blood for cotinine measurement was taken immediately after the end of 90 min of exposure. In the results section the authors stated that \u201cBlood was collected \u2026 within 1 h of the final exposure\u201d but in the methods section they stated that \u201cexposure was assessed by measuring serum cotinine at 1 h after exposure.\u201d If the last statement is correct, because of the fast elimination of cotinine in mice the level of exposure in the study was 3 times higher (2^(60/37.5) \u2248 3) than the above-calculated values. In other words, to obtain the same exposure in humans the e-cig user should take 11000 \u2013 13000 puffs per day.\u00a0Assuming 8 hours of sleep per day, in order to acquire such a high number of puffs e-cig users would need to take 11-13 puffs per minute and thus practically take an e-cig puff with each breath.&quot;", "comment_date": "2015-08-20T12:54:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Vekemans", "comment_text": "The video is confusing.\u00a0 Please separate the content from Smoking vs Vaping (with Cannabis)\u00a0 and Smoking vs. Vaping with Tobacco Cigarettes. .. as these are 2 COMPLETELY different things.<br><br>Cigarettes are Bad for you... and Cannabis is essential to good health.<br><br>Perhaps a video explaining the difference between the term &#39;Cannabis&#39; and &#39;Marijuana&#39; is needed?<br>..

If you really want to tell people what science says about it, look it up. A study was done not too long ago about if the vapor is harmful or not. Scientific studies said that inhaling the vapor is no more dangerous than inhaling the air we breathe. Also many or most e-liquids are not pure propylene glycol. On the market now, you probably won&#39;t find any e-liquids that are 100% propylene glycol, you will find that it is mixed with vegetable glycerin(which you didn&#39;t mention). Most common in at 70%VG 30%PG - 80%VG 20%PG - 90%VG 10%PG - and sometimes 100%VG. Propylene glycol is mostly used as a carrier for the nicotine and or flavoring. Also, almost every e-liquid company that i know(which is a ton) does not contain diacetyl in their e-liquids. I have been vaping for a long time after quitting smoking, and i can honestly say that i&#39;ve never felt better. Also, instead of trying to give vaping a bad name, and saying that 6% - 20% of younger people find it appealing and try it, why don&#39;t you list the decrease in percentage of younger people trying cigarettes?? And vaping has been around for quite some time, as far back as 8+ years. I&#39;m sure if it was harmful, someone would know by now. And for some reason, people always tend to associate marijuana with vaping, when it is completely different. And the thing that bothers me the most, is that propylene glycol is definitely NOT a lung irritant, as it is used in inhalers.... Some people are affected by it because of a slight allergy to propylene glycol. My sister tried it and got a headache and had an allergy to it, so she tried a Max VG e-liquid and everything was fine.

Exposure to mists may cause eye irritation, as well as upper respiratory tract irritation. Inhalation of propylene glycol vapors appears to present no significant hazard in ordinary applications.[31] However, limited human experience indicates that inhalation of propylene glycol mists could be irritating to some individuals.[32] It is therefore recommended that propylene glycol not be used in applications where inhalation exposure or human eye contact with the spray mists of these materials is likely, such as simulated fogs for theatrical productions, or antifreeze solutions for emergency eye wash stations.[33]<br>Propylene glycol does not cause sensitization, and it shows no evidence of being a carcinogen or of being genotoxic<br><br>There may be some negative effects of vaping, that being said, I vape often and have never experienced any irritation or infection of any kind; nor has anyone I know (some of whom have been vaping for around 10 years).

As an avid vaper I will always be keeping my eyes on reliable studies about the health risks.", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T03:02:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "myfairjew", "comment_text": "Glycerine tends to be the most prevalent substance in e-cigarette liquid, which was not even mentioned in this video.\u00a0 It is much less irratating than propylene glycol nor does it metabolize into anything potentially harmful.<br><br>That being said, the main danger of regular cigarettes is tar accumulation in the lungs, which contains poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the main cancer causing substances produced by combustion. There are plenty others, but this is these are mainly the &quot;tarry&quot; substances that make up the accumulated glob. Not to mention the harm the tar itself does as a physical entity by accumulating in the lungs. I don&#39;t believe for one second that no one ever considered that cigarettes weren&#39;t harmful, before the long-term scientific observations. You&#39;re inhaling shit that has been lit on fire; does tar seem appetizing? No, it seems pretty intuitively poisonous.<br><br>Something being &quot;safe&quot; is a matter of philosophical discussion, and is also quite subjective. Therefore, in my opinion, e-cigarettes eliminate the main health concerns of smoking regular cigarettes, and it can be said with certainty that they are safer by comparison. That is, of course, it&#39;s found 15 years from now that people are dying from vaping for some reason that I couldn&#39;t possibly predict.<br><br>I think, as I was saying before, that before we knew regular cigarettes were causing cancer and all the other ailments its known for, there were probably people saying, &quot;hmm.. that can&#39;t be good for you&quot;.\u00a0 I think the primary reason vaping (and second-hand vaping) has come into question is due to the fact that smoking, in general, has quite a stigma surrounding it, and people are biased to think that inhaling any vapor besides air is potentially harmful.\u00a0 We inhale plenty of nasty shit just breathing normally, that&#39;s for sure.", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T03:00:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M kind", "comment_text": "hit the bong", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T02:57:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mind Over Modder", "comment_text": "Whats worse, Vaping or Chewing Tobacco?", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T02:57:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Haunted In PA", "comment_text": "Just don&#39;t smoke, plain and simple.", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T02:50:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hobofuture", "comment_text": "To any former smokers who now vape; is it as good as smoking?", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T02:43:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u265bRooland\u265b", "comment_text": "Will the mars really be visible in the sky on August 27th?", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T02:43:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charles Hagen", "comment_text": "My theory is 10 years of vaping causes you to become a zombie.", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T02:29:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aidan Frew", "comment_text": "So I watched this video and now YouTube is recommending that I watch videos about people smoking &quot;ECIGS&quot; \u00a0Anyway keep up the good work guys!!", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T02:27:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mattguitarman1234", "comment_text": "You&#39;ll forgot about heart disease from nicotine.

For instance, the idea that Nicotine takes only about 6 seconds to get to the brain and start soothing cravings. This may be true of traditional cigarettes, but with vaporizers, the liquid droplets are too large to be efficiently absorbed by the lung. Nicotine absorption typically happens in the mucous membranes of the mouth or throat - which can delay nicotine spikes in the blood for up to 20 minutes. This is a big cause of dual-use, especially in new vapers who are using it to get away (or cut down) on traditional cigarettes.<br><br>Secondly, the concept of temperature control in vaporizers is a rather new development and hasn&#39;t been widely adopted yet. While there is a general range of temperature these devices operate at, letting the wick get dry prevents the coil from cooling efficiently and can spike temperatures up to a point where the liquid and wicking can undergo thermal breakdown - causing the release of formaldehyde, hence the infamous studies which found 4x the level of formaldehyde in vapes than in traditional cigarettes. Looking at their methodology, it&#39;s clear that they were letting the wicks get dry and still putting power to the coils long after a normal user would have stopped. This is what vapers call a &quot;dry hit&quot;, and it&#39;s horrible taste and harshness generally prevents further use until the issue is corrected.<br><br>Temperature control devices exist now, and use different coil materials which increase resistance as they heat up. By measuring the resistance over time, it&#39;s possible to get a fairly accurate estimate on coil temperature. So your coil will always stay at the temperature you set it (218c or 425f for me), because the power to the coil automatically fluctuates to prevent it from going over that set temperature. When your wick runs dry, the resistance (and heat) of the coil will shoot up extremely fast, triggering a safety mechanism which prevents the device from firing altogether. So you never get that &quot;dry hit&quot;.<br><br>On the downside, the most common material to use in temperature control devices are Ni200 (Nickel) wire, which has some safety concerns of it&#39;s own. Titanium wire is becoming slowly more popular, but it&#39;s still on the fringes, and is not totally without it&#39;s own safety concerns. Albeit, the temperatures needed to produce Ti02 in quantity are far above what most of these devices are capable of producing under temperature control. (My device maxes at 300c, whereas it takes between 600-800c to produce Ti02). Though it is possible to produce them if using Titanium Wire on non-temp controlled devices. Kanthal, as imperfect as it may be, remains the best choice for most vaping devices.<br><br>And while it&#39;s true that vaping has seen a rise in popularity among young people, it&#39;s also been accompanied by a corresponding continual decline in traditional tobacco use. While vaping isn&#39;t &quot;safe&quot;, it&#39;s a significant harm reduction over tobacco, and the modularity of nicotine in the juice (from 3.6mg/ml down to 0.2mg/ml - and even nicotine free), means that they have a much easier avenue of stepping down and quitting if they do get addicted. Cigarettes only come in ONE nicotine level, high, and it&#39;s either that or total abstinence (cold turkey) if you want to quit. The issue of regulation is a bit sticky in the vape community, but there is one in which nearly everybody on both sides of the debate agree needs to be put in place. Total sales restrictions on customers under the age of 18. It certainly won&#39;t stop kids from picking up vaping, just as it hasn&#39;t stopped them smoking traditional cigarettes, but it&#39;ll help and it needs to be in place.<br><br>Lastly, just a short word on diacetyl. The video is right to identify flavorings as, presently, the major source of concern when talking about the unknowns of vaping. This is something the community has done a fairly good job about combating, at least when a unreasonable risk is presented - such as diacetyl. Most juice companies will not use this flavoring (and the few who have, and continue to do so, have been publicly shamed by the community - such as SuicideBunny). Some other companies have used other diketones which approximate the same flavor, but unfortunately have shown to have the same (or worse) capacity to cause the same tissue damage. For the time being, I&#39;d say it&#39;s best to avoid all custard/butter/creamy flavors. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not always the e-juice manufacturer&#39;s fault. Selling flavorings for the purpose of inhalation is new to most flavor manufacturers (who are used to just selling it as a food additive), and often flavorings sold to e-juice manufacturers that has been labeled as diacetyl free - isn&#39;t. I think that if flavoring manufactures wish to continue selling their products to e-cigarette companies, that they should shoulder some of the cost of testing.", "comment_date": "2015-08-17T22:38:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ni ni", "comment_text": "Hey I have a question...<br><br><br>Why when ever hit ur knee with anything else, it starts to kick by itself?", "comment_date": "2015-08-17T22:30:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MuricanMemer", "comment_text": "So as you recall from the video, if vaping, go with approved e-liquids without nicotine that don&#39;t contain diacetyl and aren&#39;t blueberry and grape.<br>Done.

These chemicals aren&#39;t immediately dangerous, but studies show that they can metabolize into potentially harmful chemicals such as diacetyl in certain conditions.<br><br>As far as propylene glycol, it&#39;s found to be safe for human consumption and respiration, as it&#39;s used in hospital vents and asthma inhalers, but the concern is that of how it reacts to the heat of e-cigs.\u00a0<br><br>Vegetable glycerine is the other base of e-liquid, which we&#39;re also unsure of how it reacts to the heat.\u00a0<br><br>Then there&#39;s the problem of the cotton.

The overlooked aspect of vaping is how it affects people who genuinely wish to quit smoking. My wife was roughly a pack a day smoker. She tried the gum, patches, everything. None of it worked. She&#39;d be back to smoking within a month. Then she tried vaping. Within a week she threw her cigarettes away. After a year she had reduced the nicotine content of her e-juice to 0%. A year after that she stopped vaping as well. This is what is known as progress.<br><br>As for children smoking and vaping? That is a societal problem, not a product problem. Without proper guidance from the adults in their lives children will make uneducated and often foolish decisions. Educate, show all sides of a story, and make sure the young have enough information to make an informed decision. They&#39;ll more than likely still make foolish decisions, that&#39;s part of being young, but at least they&#39;ll know better.<br><br>Education is the answer. Videos which demonize a product without addressing the positive values as well as the negatives lead to reactionary behavior. I&#39;ve come across two types of vaping videos on the web. Type A demonizes vaping by presenting facts and giving them bias toward the evils of the product. Type B tends to be avid vapers who are tenaciously defending their habit. I&#39;d like to see a third type which focuses on ways of using the product responsibly. The risks as well as the benefits.<br><br>It is true that vaping has its potential risks and needs further study. These risks however are far less potent than smoking.

I switched easily and haven&#39;t had to smoke since. Anyone who is addicted to Nicotine should understand how huge that is. My lung capacity is full again, I can walk much farther without being winded, I don&#39;t stink, no stained fingers and teeth. All that alone makes the switch worth it to me.<br><br>While considering the ramifications of vaping I did a lot of research, read many papers and watched a bunch of videos. Here&#39;s what I found. Most academics and doctors agree that vaping is less harmful than smoking, (some citing up to 200 times less harmful) but the clear healthier path is quitting altogether.<br><br>It&#39;s important to note that nicotine itself isn&#39;t actually that bad for you. It&#39;s a stimulant similar to caffeine, but it is highly addictive. If you&#39;re a smoker I highly recommend giving vaping a try. There are tobacco flavoured e-juices that taste very similar to most brands of cigarettes and help make the transition easier.", "comment_date": "2015-08-17T13:31:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JOCKOS OWNER", "comment_text": "omg you cant do anything without the risk of dying, what is the point of living", "comment_date": "2015-08-17T13:29:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jbOi10", "comment_text": "I have a question.

The nicotine is NOT absorbed as quickly using an E-cigarette as it is using a regular cigarette.<br>It can take several minutes before you notice any effect from vaping and in that time you can end up vaping too much and feel sick for up to an hour.<br><br>Another point i want to make is that those young people who started smoking E-cigarettes which marked a rise of 20% in the statistics is actually quite a low number. If there were only 1,000 youths vaping three years ago that means only 200 more youths have started vaping in the past three years. Of course the figures are different but put that into perspective.<br>Then consider that out of those 200 new vapers, a great deal of them used to smoke or would have smoked cigarettes instead.<br><br>And yes, vaping seriously messes with your lungs if you inhale the vapor. Ideally you should only vape with your mouth and not let the vapor get to your lungs. The same way you ideally smoke a cigar.<br>The problem for smokers of cigarettes who make the transition to vaping is that they will naturally try to inhale to the lungs. And the first 2-3 weeks of vaping is riddled with coughing and wheezing. That stops after a while and assuming you have been cigarette free for 2-3 months and you have another cigarette (which tastes like SHIT by the way) you will cough and feel a nasty burn in your throat and lungs.<br>Basically, your lungs adjust to vaping and build up a resistance to the irritant.<br>But if you smoke a regular cigarette after vaping it feels like death is entering your lungs.<br><br>Beyond that, there&#39;s thousands of different vaping products out on the market. Some are not that good while others give you the best experience you&#39;ve ever had.<br><br>All in all, i still favor vaping over cigarettes any day and have done so for 1.5 years now. Even though i really should stop inhaling to the lungs!", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:08:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "connor walker", "comment_text": "I want his drawing skills!!!", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:07:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jayme L", "comment_text": "4 minutes and 20 seconds", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:07:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheBjcn", "comment_text": "Smoking vs Snus?", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:06:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Mariano", "comment_text": "Is there way to help/aid facial hair growth?", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:06:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KonnaFX", "comment_text": "Ca you make a video about body fat and how to lose it", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:06:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "legomypancakes", "comment_text": "if you have eaten peanut butter high you would know how wrong you are in the case of killing taste buds", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:04:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chonk", "comment_text": "Vapeing is still 10 times better if you but quality e juice and don&#39;t get one with high nicotine its fine", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:04:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sage Gartner", "comment_text": "Subliminal messages...<br><br>The video is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> long...", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:03:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pacboy \ud83c\udfda", "comment_text": "I saw a pot brownie at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=0m58s\">0:58</a> ...", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:03:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GreenEarthTrees", "comment_text": "I love seeing Videos relating to smoking being 4 minutes and 20 seconds long", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:02:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kevin whalen", "comment_text": "So iv vaping weed bad for your health?", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T20:02:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan Albl", "comment_text": "That length of the video though.", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T19:56:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wayward Martian", "comment_text": "DEATH.

About a week after I switched to only using the e-cig I physically felt so much better. No more waking up and coughing. My taste came back. Even my sense of smell improved. So while obviously you should never start smoking, I would say that if you are a smoker and want to quit and nothing has worked, try an e-cig.

Nicotine is not addictive (At least not to the extent that people think it is). Nicotine has mild addictive effects similar to that of caffeine. The addictive parts of smoking are the MAOH inhibitors that are part of the tobacco plant which get into the blood stream (Which are not present in the e-liquids due to the fact that only liquid nicotine is present.). Nicotine is a mild reinforcement agent which had an evolutionary purpose of ensuring that insects who survived eating the tobacco plant would remember they had a bad time and not come back again.<br><br>\u00a02. Propylene Glycol is a common additive in MANY different things. Food, antifreeze, medicine. In medicine Propylene Glycal (Here on referred to as PG) is used as a drug solubilizers (It gives the medicine a way to actually get into your blood stream once ingested, inhaled, or applied to your body.). It has shown to have some adverse effects on children, and can cause\u00a0thrombophelitis. Rapid infusions of high-PG containing drugs have been shown to have adverse effects. Overall, PG is a safe substance otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be present in so many things some caution needs to be applied as with any substance. (Source:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.drugs.com/inactive/propylene-glycol-270.html\">http://www.drugs.com/inactive/propylene-glycol-270.html</a> )<br><br>3. A lot of the companies that put harmful ingredients in their e-liquids are (Surprise surprise) tobacco companies. Tobacco companies are not involved in the vaping industry (Only really selling any products in gas stations) they have not invested a whole lot of money into researching vaping products, and in fact have been actively fighting it (Because they would go bankrupt otherwise.). Most e-liquids only contain a few base ingredients (Nicotine (Optional), PG (To some extent), Vegetable Glycerine (For vapor effect. PG is not visible ;P), Flavoring (Optional.) While some of the flavorings can cause issues, not all of them do this and again studies have shown the more harmful ingredients are mainly used by the tobacco companies. (A common theory is part of the reason is so that people can point and say LOOK HARMFUL INGREDIENTS! But ignoring theories and focusing on the facts Tobacco Companies have been actively fighting vaping, and do not have that much stock in the industry.).<br><br>4. The &#39;ultrafine particles&#39; released by vaporizers produce no real harmful effects in people around the person vaping. Any particles produced by that are well below the legal safety limit (The harmful substances exhaled being similar to those normally exhaled by humans only a difference of 20-30 particles per million has been shown. Ie. Not statistically significant.) Nicotine released by vaping is not harmful to those around you because, refer to point 1. Nicotine is not harmful.<br><br>The reason the only links I have is for PG is because the rest of my knowledge comes from a myriad of studies and other sources. I&#39;ve looked at a lot of positive and negative studies, looked at their biases, tried to find out any flaws in methodology and concluded from the short term studies that have been done that vaping most likely is a safe alternative to smoking, and probably overall a safe practice if handled responsibly.<br>Yes you will need to do some personal research and ensure you aren&#39;t actually vaping harmful substances until the freak-out session around vaping calms down and more research is done by the FDA to help further regulate the industry. But overall it IS a safer alternative for those attempting to quit smoking (With studies showing that it has the highest success rate, with participants even quitting vaping afterwards.) which is at least a positive thing right?", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T17:05:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Young Kim", "comment_text": "So vaping Marijuana is the way to go?", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T17:05:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Durjan Krist", "comment_text": "Pretty sure the video length is no coincidence", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T17:05:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joel Miller", "comment_text": "Why Does everyone say the video length is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqi4xvjvKo&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> I don&#39;t get it ?!!", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T17:04:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JAdHum", "comment_text": "This video missed one important thing: nicotine and THC are neurotoxins.
