Why ? The reason is simple. Ever heard &quot;The forbidden apple tastes the best&quot; ? This is the very same thing. Most people try drugs, just because its illegal and illegal things are more often considered to be cool. If we would not care about drugs, then it would surely decrease as it would stop being illegal, so less people would want to hop in.<br><br>Same goes for other things, such as guns. Studies have shown, that if guns are allowed and regulated enough, so only the responsible get it, the overall criminality goes down, often making a huge hop down.<br>It has shown, that if guns are really regulated or outright banned, the criminality raises as well. The reason is that criminals dont care about laws. They will either get a gun from black market or use other objects to do what they want ( such as knives, clubs, pipes,.... etc. ). Guns are the equalizer of power, where even the smallest and weakest ( me ) can protect themselves against much larger and much stronger foes.<br><br>Of course there will be deviants, but they will be just a very small percentage. As well, if we take deaths by guns and other means of death, then we will find out, that Its very unlikely, that you will be killed by a gun ( i wouldnt say as low as being struck by lightning, but pretty slim ). You are much more likely to be killed by a knife or a blunt object, hit by a car, drug overdose, medication overdose, die by fists, medication error, doctor&#39;s error, unreadable prescription, ..... etc.<br><br>Dont ban guns, nor ban drugs.<br><br>( if someone would wonder, i am a libertarian )", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T16:57:30Z", "likes_count": 55}, {"comment_by": "Yo Was", "comment_text": "Lil Peep died from Fentanyl Overdose ;-; rip", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T15:25:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "qe qe", "comment_text": "Just do alcohol prohibiton.

I just lost yet another friend to heroin last week . My boyfriend and I have been together 3 years and him and I have lost a total of 21 friends and acquaintances since we been together . &amp; this is why maintenance drugs like suboxone are so important ! People really seem to think suboxone should be banned but it\u2019s a necessity at this time when there\u2019s an epidemic going on. Some addicts are just unable to get sober without it. N I\u2019m one of them. N peoples reason who are against it is cus they think you are trading one addiction for another. That\u2019s false.

Given a total population of 7.5 billion, that&#39;s 4.627 billion people.  Which means the percentage of users killed by alcohol is 0.071. I&#39;m not a statistics expert but calling something the most dangerous drug when it kills less than 0.1% of its users seems like a fallacy to me. I know I&#39;ve only considered the amount of deaths, not the other types of harm mentioned in the video but alcohol isn&#39;t addictive and doesn&#39;t generally have long-term effects like other drugs. And to call it the most dangerous just because many people drink it would be the same as calling common cold the most dangerous disease because pretty much everyone has it.

(on the 4th of july this year I did drink half a bottle of a wine cooler but only because they bought this bubbly fruity wine cooler for me specifically, and I felt rude not to at least drink one. They didn&#39;t know I went cold turkey. But that&#39;s the only alcoholic beverage I&#39;ve consumed at all all year long) It&#39;s not like I was drinking all that much to begin with. But a couple of bad experiences was all it took. It doesn&#39;t make me feel very nice at all, only very sick and dissy, and hangovers are the worst ! I still smoke weed but that&#39;s really the only thing I actually do. I don&#39;t drink Caffiene or coffee, I drink soda on rare occasions (not daily like a lot of people I know), I don&#39;t smoke cigarettes, and I don&#39;t drink alcohol either. I decided to not drink at all at the beginning of 2017, and I&#39;ve been successful all year long ! (except that one time on 4th of july). Weed is great cause I can feel a wonderful high and clear mind with relaxation, without the consequences of a terrible after feeling like alcohol. And weed doesn&#39;t make me feel nauseous or make me throw up either. It actually can help when I&#39;m feeling nauseous and calm those feelings down. Even when I&#39;m on my period it helps with feeling a bit better. It&#39;s up to each individual what they wanna consume in their body, but taking steps with regulation and more knowledge about each one, is ultimately the best weapon against the war against drugs. Knowledge is power ! It is more helpful than restricting people and punishing them for using these substances. Overall I believe not drinking is a great decision. Perhaps a small drink, just enough for a buzz and not full on drunkenness, is fine every now and again or on rare occasions. (it works for me). Alcohol is so popular, it&#39;s no wonder it was chosen as their pick for the most dangerous drug in the world. It&#39;s accepted in almost every society and has been around for a very long time. It still does permanent damage everyday not only to the individuals drinking it, but the people around them too. How many stories are there with a young child being abused emotionally and or physically from an abusive parent who is an alcoholic? Or car wrecks from a drunken idiot ? I agree with their choice. If you really think about what is so great about being drunk/drinking alcohol anyways ?", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:25:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Darkness, It Consumes Me", "comment_text": "PCP", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:24:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MonkeyMaster 64", "comment_text": "looks like kurzgesagt", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:24:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quasiker", "comment_text": "wHat I didn&#39;t even realise this video wasn&#39;t be kurzgesagt until he said it", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:24:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elaine Pham", "comment_text": "Best Ft ever", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:24:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "roody crles", "comment_text": "This looks like In a nutshell", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:24:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neal Lawler", "comment_text": "Made cuz of peep", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:23:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PivotShorts", "comment_text": "Ironically I&#39;m watching this slightly drunk", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:22:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diego Celaya", "comment_text": "The same  day Lil Peep died", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:22:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T-m0", "comment_text": "dang", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:21:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacked Cup", "comment_text": "It&#39;s so odd to hear him narrating over the animation lol.", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:21:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SutaTheStar", "comment_text": "The most dangerous drug in the world is thought, once you start thinking it&#39;s more addictive than anything else.", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:21:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B Pajger", "comment_text": "bruh where the white board at", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:21:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tas The Watcher", "comment_text": "Dopamine, it gets you addicted to the other drugs.", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:19:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bigtime39384", "comment_text": "Tylenol", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:18:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clik", "comment_text": "Caralho caiu no enem isso", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:17:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "moco loco", "comment_text": "rip peep............................................", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:17:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lars", "comment_text": "allacoholl is nto bad, cannavis iss lettucze of.devil!!! <b>burp</b>", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:17:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NKM MASTER", "comment_text": "Yooo kurzesagt", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:15:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kbellacee", "comment_text": "I looooove the graphics with this narration!! :)", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T22:15:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marley", "comment_text": "Ah I\u2019ve missed you guys.

From a dose that&#39;s normal to a dose that you can overdose on - it&#39;s a visible amount. The problem is, the people that overdose either 1) use the same amount they normally do with stuff they just picked up(which can be much, much stronger if it hasn&#39;t been cut yet and there&#39;s no way to know) or it&#39;s mixed with fentanyl or something else of the like. I would say 95% of cases of OD are also through IV - 10 mg IV difference can be life or death, whereas you have about 5x more leeway with snorting.

Very harmful in multiple ways and yet fully accepted in society, not just legally but socially. If these were new drugs just invented we would never even consider making them legal - and for good reason.<br><br>Education and prevention is good, and a far better approach than trying to punish addicts into not being addicts anymore (which even on the surface is obviously just doomed to fail) - but the only true longterm strategy that is going to work is replacing harmful drugs with BETTER alternatives that people will both prefer to use and cause minimal harm.<br><br>Weed is a good candidate in that regard, but honestly the main reason we don&#39;t have a lot of good alternatives aside from that is society has some retarded (likely religiously based) notion that pleasure is inherently sinful and bad - so drugs that make you feel good are inherently bad - not just because they have tangible negative side-effects. That has made it so that actual research into recreational drugs has been basically non-existent. All synthetic or processed recreational drugs we have today are either based on ancient recipes, accidental discoveries, or illegal research where the goal was to make lots of money on a cheap and addictive drug rather than to make it safe.<br><br>So of course big pharma won&#39;t spend money doing such research because anything they make is likely to get banned immediately even if it&#39;s harmless just because it is recreational. If they were allowed to I bet you they could make recreational drugs with better safety, better highs, no physical addiction and minimum side-effects pretty damn quick.<br><br>But no... instead people will keep on killing themselves with unregulated harmful drugs - and worse yet, the legal-but-widely-abused hard drugs like opioids.
