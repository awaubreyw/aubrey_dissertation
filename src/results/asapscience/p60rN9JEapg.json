There are two ways by which people cheat on exams. They use helping tools when it\u00b4s not allowed, or the teacher shows them the right answers to the exam questions before other students are shown the same questions. Why can\u00b4t we ace an exam? Simple. Exams are not designed to be aced. They are carefully designed not to. Each teacher designs their exams on one principle and one principle only - the principle that the exam questions must never focus solely on the material taught in the curriculum. This is why exams in British history focus on Henry VIII and Andy Warhol, not on how to live in Britain. The first exam which will be based on the curriculum\u00b4s material will never air. But there is a solution to this problem. That solution is banning exams altogether. Ban exams, ban grading. When you ban exams and grades, you give students the opportunity to go to school to learn to learn. For that to happen, you must separate classroom and teacher. The dangerous and life threatening deleterious delusion of grandeur that there are students who can easily ace exams by watching a youtube video has resulted in nothing but millions of unemployed students. This tells us that all exams promote only three things - a - unemployment, b - drugs, and c - prostitution. The question then is - how are people hired for work? Job skills. You don\u00b4t earn those by going to college or by finishing school. You earn those by going to the job centers, learning the job, and making sure the staff superior does not discriminate against you. Our patience for exams is over. Exams are ancient history. We are on the internet now, which has practically killed off whatever remained of the exam grading system. Therefore, if we bye bye the exam grading system, we are putting jobs back in business, and removing pointless obstacles which don\u00b4t teach anybody anything.", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T08:28:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thecanadian", "comment_text": "I have add and I can&#39;t focus but ya he did say that music isn&#39;t good for studying but I&#39;m going to keep using a thing that I found on YouTube that helps focusing and studying so if you have add/adhd try finding a meditation sound thing it helped me consecrate but we aren&#39;t all the same so you might be different and find sounds like that get you distracted (sorry if what I said didn&#39;t make any sense)", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T02:25:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kirito_ Kun", "comment_text": "wow so useful at this rate I&#39;m  going to become omniscient.", "comment_date": "2017-11-20T00:30:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marko Bradas", "comment_text": "I\\&#39;m not sure but ,if anyone else wants to uncover study habits try Elumpa Simple Studying Alchemist (should be on google have a look ) ?

But I never highlight in the book. I would extract information as I read the text and would put it all on unlined white paper. (because there is no paper with lines small enough to how I write) and also allows me to shift my information in different areas, especially when creating tables and graphs. This organization helps to organize my own brain to how I see it rather than how the book does.<br><br>I use color pens to write different things given to what topic they are and place the course number, class and page number at the top right corner.<br><br>Topics such as &quot;conditioning and learning&quot; goes in green while the term conditioning or &quot;priming&quot; goes in blue. <br>Further definitions are written in light blue. Comment with // before in green.<br>Names of people in pink <br>Black for all definitions and concepts<br>Red for any major key concepts<br>purple for any sub topics. <br><br>This works quite well and like note cards, helps to break things up in color so it forms new associations. Especially when I try to remember names of people.<br><br>Also I agree that routine and short times in study is help full but so is sleep as well. Rest too. Long study times isn&#39;t the biggest issues but it is the pacing and not enough breaks that leaves the brain over worked. For every 30 or so mins I take 5 on a break. Get up, stretch. And get something to eat or drink.  I even sometimes would go out to get a treat before my study time and leave it somewhere so when I am done with one subject I reward myself and go to the next. This reward system also helps condition the brain. <br><br>Repeated actions and associations are also big key factors. Like the place to which you study as is why you need your own &quot;spot&quot; you will remember more in the same setting than if you were removed from it. Which is why I recommend to take tests in the class rooms rather than a testing center (for many reasons) because it removes you from the environment which you first received that information.<br><br>Music on the other hand is one thing I love as well but depending on what it is, over rhythmic music can be more harm than good but music that is soothing can be help full, at least for me as it isn&#39;t repetitive (which can make you feel more tired such as a fan blowing in the background) or too distracting. IF anything by creating sound it helps cut back a few more sounds that can be a distraction. Like others talking in the room.<br><br>And I know everyone that this might be the&quot;digital Age&quot; But really, put down your phones.

Personally, I was a little disappointed by this video because not everyone learn or should study the same as other people. It depends on their personalities. If you are always moving in your chair or making draws on your notebook while your professor is explaining the topic, it means that you should study by writing and practicing a lot. Now, if you feel the necessity of always being looking at the board, it means that you should study by using visual tips. For example, use yellow paper and red marker. Why? Because red is a color that is very bright and do not confuse your brain. That&#39;s why it is easier to read an old yellow book than a new one since the mix of black and white confuses your brain making you feel tired. Finally, if you prefer to listen to what your professor says, you should study by repeating the information with loud voice or recording yourself and then listen to it. <br>If you are visual, don&#39;t try to use the same study method of a person who prefers to listen...that&#39;s why some people learn faster than you even though you use the same study method  because they know how to study and probably their style is not the best one for you.", "comment_date": "2015-09-04T19:44:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Canjura", "comment_text": "32 seconds in, I learned more than 6 hours of school..", "comment_date": "2015-09-04T19:42:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Derek Leung", "comment_text": "Practice.
