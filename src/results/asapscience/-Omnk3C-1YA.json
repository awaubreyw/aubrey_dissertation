I grew up as a really picky eater, i refused to eat certain foods and sometimes they would make me throw up. My mom pretty much gave up on trying to make me eat normal food and started feeding me the only thing that i could keep down due to i guess my sensory issues, potato chips. Although i also managed to eat some other foods, its what my diet basically consisted of. This weird diet continued for years, i would eat a whole bag of any kind of chips pretty much every day. Since it was the only thing i would eat i didn&#39;t become overweight so people weren&#39;t really worried about me. This continued until i eventually sort of grew out of my picky eating habits and realized my body needed nutrients to live. At this point i was suffering from severe depression that was making me suicidal, anemia and pretty much all vitamin deficiencies. I decided to live for my friends and family and decided to turn my life around. But it wasn&#39;t easy, i was severely addicted to potato chips. And although it seems quite comical it was pretty serious. It&#39;s not easy to stop doing something you&#39;ve been doing for pretty much your whole life. And i really struggled for a long time. And finally today i can proudly say i haven&#39;t had potato chips in five years. And even though there are still foods i can&#39;t eat i try my best and my diet is as healthy as it gets. I don&#39;t suffer from depression anymore and i can also proudly say i&#39;m not suicidal anymore either. But my old habits still haunt and have really affected my life and my health. I have a few health problems and my growth was stunted. But i&#39;m happy i&#39;m still alive and now i finally enjoy life :)", "comment_date": "2021-06-20T17:42:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0623\u0628\u0637\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u062f", "comment_text": "&quot;People who watch the video and eat chips&quot; : \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T10:42:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Arleen Flynn", "comment_text": "THE GIRLS:18+ ARE  <b><a href=\"http://sexgirls.uno/\">SEXGIRLS.UNO</a></b>  <br><br>Youtube: This is fine<br>Someone: Says &#39;&#39;heck&#39;&#39;<br>youtube: be gone<br><br><br>&#39;&#39;Quotes&#39;&#39; Everything will be fine", "comment_date": "2021-06-11T12:51:21Z", "likes_count": 26}, {"comment_by": "sirus", "comment_text": "ayo that&#39;s my diet", "comment_date": "2021-06-08T17:44:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RJ", "comment_text": "Occasional?!", "comment_date": "2021-06-06T22:53:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "soo miew leng", "comment_text": "never heard of lays. but i finally allowed this year to eat chips they so good like they dont make me feel thirsty.", "comment_date": "2021-06-06T11:40:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GareRhett", "comment_text": "Chips are so fuckin good.

YOU CAN ACTUALLY SURVIVE AND LIVE OFF OF EATING ONLY CHIPS FROM WHAT I FOUND AND RESEARCHED! Okay,  hear me out, I know that the video says that chips can prove to be deadly and extremely unhealthy when being the only food source supplied to a person for a long period of time. And yes, when it comes to POTATO chips, this is definitely true. But ONLY for POTATO chips. But when it comes to chips themselves this is false and here&#39;s why; THERE ARE CHIPS OTHER THAN POTATO CHIPS. Let&#39;s look at an example: Oh no! You have only been eating potato chips and lack LOTS of nutrients, where can I get those nutrients while still only eating chips? Need Vitamin A B and C? BOOM! Banana chips, get them nutrients rolling! Even more vitamins like that? POW! Tomato chips! Missing protein? KAPOOYA! Tofu chips! Need MORE protein? KAPOW! Crispy Proscuitto Chips! There are so many types of chips that exist that can meet anyone&#39;s nutritional needs too? Allergies, diets (vegan, vegetarian), won&#39;t be a problem with all the options available on your plate! Not to mention there are THOUSANDS of types of chips and flavors so that it never gets old! There are chips like Cinnamon Carrot Chips, Pineapple chips, Brussels Sprouts Chips, Radish Chips and so much more! You even got AMAZING Brownie Chips! <br><br>And there you have it, you CAN survive well with all your neccesary nutrients by only eating chips. I hope you enjoyed learning about this info! If you want to try chips other than potato, I would recommend brownie chips or banana chips. If you want to look for chip recipes, BuzzFeed made a good article titled &quot;23 better alternatives to potato chips that are healthier&quot;.
