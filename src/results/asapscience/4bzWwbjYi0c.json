If we manage to develop a form of Artificial Intelligence that would be able to exceed humans at any cognitive task, then that would be the last invention humans would need to create. Consequently, if the goals of strong AI aren&#39;t aligned with those of humans, then there is going to be a huge problem. However, w/ strong AI, almost all human problems could be solved: diseases, hunger, general violence, political corruption and other disorders in political systems; it would also enable research with extreme speeds, which means that strong AI would be the last invention humans would need to make. As a result, interstellar travel and space colonization would no longer be fantasies, but become reality; money would lose it&#39;s value; long asked questions would be research with capabilities never seen before. This is all a result of something called an &quot;intelligence boost,&quot; which is currently theoretical. At one point such a superintelligent system will undergo self-improvement, potentially triggering an intelligence explosion and leaving human intellect far behind.  <br><br>       Although many people don&#39;t understand this, there is no reason to think that strong AI would become intentionally benevolent or malevolent. When researchers look at AI, they think two scenarios are the most likely: <br>            \u2014 The AI has been programmed to complete a devastating project; <br>            \u2014 The AI has been programmed to do something beneficial, but does so by developing a devastating method.<br><br>       AI, by definition is the \u201csimulation of human intelligence processes by machines, in specific, computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.\u201d Presently, AI is properly know as narrow AI (weak AI) considering that it is designed to perform minimalistic tasks that are predestined by the user (humans). Things such as internet searches (Siri), self-driving cars summarize weak AI, and portrait mode on an iPhone 10 (who tf calls it the iPhone X lol). Although many don&#39;t realize this, AI is already present in our daily lives; however, it isn&#39;t looked at since they operate within a predefined range and not many necessarily see it as \u201cAI.\u201d This is why scientist aren&#39;t worrying about weak AI, but instead strong AI (also called general AI).<br><br><br><br>       P.s: just wanted to put some info. out there, since I have been taking this computer science course and for a project we had to do a presentation. I find that AI is a extensively interesting topic. Also, since Mitchell stated at the end of the video that AI either: 1. does a devastating project that it has been programmed to do; or 2. does something beneficial, but develops a devastating way of doing so; I wanted expand upon it since we pretty much got that from the same website (I&#39;m guessing).<br><br>References<br>(n.d.).
