I mean once I ran a 6 minute mile after not workout for 3 months. For course talent and trainer do go hand and hand. My bff is a talented soccer player and plays for college. But it seems his athletic talent is soooo much better. He literally walked into tennis practice and made the team, over guys who&#39;ve had private tennis practice their whole lives. But saying that im not that shitty lol, maybe it depends on the sport??? One sport im excel at is boxing. I can even out box people that have been doing it for months and keep up with people that have been doing it for a few years. Maybe its just depends on what you love. hmmmm...", "comment_date": "2017-04-21T16:11:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashok Karekar", "comment_text": "how to identify genetics", "comment_date": "2017-04-21T11:30:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Artaxerxes :", "comment_text": "After reading the comments.

You see, I trained once with a friend of mine for running. This guy had talent and genetics, so he had beautiful body and was great at running. When I was running with him, the results were\u00a0300 meters of keeping up to him.<br>He did great, was running far faster than me, had a far higher stamina and everything for him was better. Later years I trained myself with the exact same exercise, running.<br>This time though I was running completely alone with my OWN pace. Super slow, but in the end I did all the course after a MONTH. It took me a full month to do what that previous exercise took the other guy a day to do. If I was to do it at his own PACE, it would have taken me MUCH MORE (It took me 3 months and absolutely no improvement at all).<br>So this exact same exercise showing on the video was adequate for those exact same people. If everybody was doing it at their own pace, everybody would have had same improvements for a period of time.<br>Later on I ran again with him and he got tired. I was like: &quot;What? Are you kidding me?!&quot;. I was really amazed, but he actually could not keep up and was tired. He also said that he was doing that to stretch his muscles. He won 5th place in my country for 21km.<br>But guess what happened to me later on! I actually was smoking when I was training alone. It took me two months to achieve a stunning 7km! (for me it is stunning, from 0.3 to 7!)<br>So the genetics are just pre-written machine code for you, but you can change that if you really believe in yourself.<br>I tried to run yesterday after years and eventually I did 2km without any training at all. No muscle stretch, no sweat, no nothing. Just going to the finish and coming back without stopping.

So talent is basically how high in the scale of responsiveness you are is what I&#39;m getting at, but how is it trainable?<br><br>The way you set up the video seems as if baseline values are the key in which talent is trainable, I can see it as an equation being time x responsiveness = skill. In athletes, I can see greater volumes of blood helping as it increases circulation, and ultimately increasing the amount of time available for training, but how would this work for other parts in talent? How would the blood increase help with drawing, music, and so on? And how is your talent being increased?<br><br>SORRY I&#39;m just really curious about this subject matter because it&#39;s just so interesting, and definitely applicable.

Then you can also argue that luck has nothing to do with it; since really all it is: is the contributing factors like diet, education, etc. So luck falls flat on just being a shallow, generalizing term for lamemens. You might beable to associate talent with genetic variation and epigenetics. Genetics can effect whether a person has longer arms, or blood vessels to transport more nutrients, or a trillion other mechanical features. But I will cast aside the idea that a person is born smart. Ironically they may be born Lucky since their habit building can be promoted by those mechanical features. Just don&#39;t stop short when arguing that talent has to do with luck, because then you&#39;re missing the point and squandering your genetic potential.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-04-25T10:56:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quantum Kush", "comment_text": "This explains Naruto and Sasuke so much....", "comment_date": "2014-04-23T23:19:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eleri Abel", "comment_text": "yes I have trained my talent :D", "comment_date": "2014-04-23T12:43:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TOMIS13LACK", "comment_text": "can emotional strength be passed down via genetics?", "comment_date": "2014-04-23T03:15:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hudson Ruprich", "comment_text": "Kd", "comment_date": "2014-04-22T00:14:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hellangel tetrisbattle", "comment_text": "Why do we stretch our body when we feel weak?", "comment_date": "2014-04-21T15:32:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abir Hasan", "comment_text": "fuck you...", "comment_date": "2014-04-20T14:02:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "8Bit Shadow", "comment_text": "I can tell that Lamark would aprove of this theory.", "comment_date": "2014-04-20T10:36:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sadgy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23science\">#science</a> says How can you control your emotions?", "comment_date": "2014-04-18T20:42:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danny Okezie", "comment_text": "Well, now I know why I&#39;m terrible with sports.

I had a tough time picking up kicks and forms in particular. Hell, I couldn&#39;t even get my roundhouse kick over waist height. Yet now, as I am getting into XMA and tricking, kicks come really easy to me. I can get some in only a few attempts. Sound ironic, right? It all comes down to mind set for me, and this leads my opinion (relax, because it is only an opinion). See, maybe the individuals who were blood related and were &quot;high responders&quot; were simply siblings competing with each other to get good at athletic, or even mental feats. Also, a big (REALLY BIG) factor is simply confidence. If there is even the slightest hesitation or insecurity in your movement it shows up right away. Some of these so-called &quot;low-responders&quot; just have to let go of themselves and there self image in order to discover and unlock their potential. Finally, as for body types, yes there are different body types with different metabolisms and even natural muscle growth, however, as far as I can tell, the only difference between individuals and their ability due to their natural body type, is that they THINK they are strong. It&#39;s sad, but in my experience, endomorphs and ectomorphs in particular tend to have a difficult time really pushing themselves to their true limits, only because they have been told time and time again in movies, ads and school that they were simply born unable to be strong. Which, as they find out in varying degrees of time, is bogus. This is why I believe that in maintaining an internal locus of control, anyone can become anything.

What I got from this is that whether talent is better than training or vice versa doesn&#39;t matter, because the best athletes have talent and train very hard. There isn&#39;t an easy way to measure your own talent before you train, but by training, you can measure your progress up against your initial performance and determine both how talented you were initially and how well you respond to training.<br><br>To fit the athletic theme of these videos, talent vs. training is like a race, where the finish line is maximum personal ability and those who finish faster have more ability than those who finish slower. Talent is like having a head-start in this race, while training will increase speed and endurance in this race. While it&#39;s hard to measure whether having a head-start or having faster speed/endurance individually is better, it&#39;s important understand that the highest-level athletes taking first, second, etc. in this race both have a significant head-start AND insane speed/endurance.<br><br>In short, if you want to become a top athlete, you might need talent, but you can&#39;t rely on talent alone. You need to harness that talent with training. But this is not exclusive to athleticism. This is why people will pursue any walk of life in which they&#39;re naturally talented and receive some form of education or guidance over many years as training.
