Whether you want to be smarter, younger, stronger, or healthier,  keep your kidneys healthy and strong.  My psychiatrist thought I had ADD because my mind wanders a lot, but when Qi is weak, the mind wanders. When my Qi is strong, my mind becomes very still and peaceful. To keep the brain healthy and strong, we must keep our body healthy and often train our brain. Nowadays kids are playing with cell phones, computers and video games, these can damage their Qi. Kids are more hyperactive these days because the Qi is weak.\r<br>\r<br>Ways to keep our kidney healthy is to have enough sleep, eat more black beans and black sesame seeds.

On that break avoid using phone, ehen im on a break i usually eat chocolate or something sweet. Also when studying you already know that u have two sides of brain one is in charge for letters ( facts, math ..) and other is more imagination and in charge for pictures. I always asked myself how can i remember a movie easily but after a lesson in school i cannot. So the thing is when u are watching a movie you are using you both sides but when you are reading something ( studying) u are only using one side of your brain. Sooo when i study i first go to yt and watch an animation about that topic and then i read the book and when i finish i act like i am explaining that lction to someone (outloud).

I practically failed all my GCSEs because I couldn&#39;t remember anything I revised in the weeks leading up to each exam - I did a lot of revision, but still did terribly and also the questions in some of the exams were really hard, I didn&#39;t understand them or didn&#39;t know how to answer them.", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T17:36:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cinderbloc", "comment_text": "Walk around the pawk. @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9SptdjpJBQ&amp;t=1m53s\">1:53</a>  Lol", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T17:35:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fenrirgg", "comment_text": "Or cheat.", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T17:34:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bababooey", "comment_text": "My exams just ended!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>Couldn&#39;t have uploaded the video a few days ago could u?", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T17:34:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Acrosicious", "comment_text": "What if I have a stylus?", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T17:32:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Perfection M", "comment_text": "those study on the morning and the evening does not sleep?", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T17:31:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aron D'Souza", "comment_text": "Wow !
