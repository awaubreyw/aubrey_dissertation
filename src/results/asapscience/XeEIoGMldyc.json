It does make sense though, that if you stretch too much before certain things it can decrease your muscle strength. Now that I am no longer actively playing a sport, I typically go to the gym to work out. I have gotten into a habit of not stretching anymore before I work out because it didn&#39;t really seem to be helping, but I still warm up a little before I get started. If I am sore I tend to stretch to help with it and typically it does help loosen me up a bit. I agree with the video though that the more flexible you are the easier you could get hurt. I knew someone in high school who was extremely flexible and she was always getting hurt. I still think that warming up before you start to do any kind of exercise is very important. It warms up your muscles and get your heart pumping and helps your body get prepared for whatever you are going to do.
