I contacted him through his email : ( templeofsupernaturalcontact @ gmail . com )\r<br>I got a reply from him telling me what I had to do and immediately I complied. My wife called almost immediately and begged to return home. On her return i observed instant change in her character.she changed into the woman that loved and cared for me.

What it does to the victim&#39;s brains (trauma bonds, stockholm syndrome) as well as the chemical changes it causes (how these toxic relationships literally become an addiction) . Since there is such a stigma on being a victim of such violence, the rest of the world can&#39;t seem to (nor does it seem like they want to) educate themselves on why it&#39;s so hard for victims to leave these toxic relationships.<br><br><br>Being a survivor of such violence myself and finally being able to break that cycle and leave the relationship. I&#39;ve become determined to educate as many people as I can on exactly why it&#39;s so hard to leave. Why it&#39;s so hard to get over our abusive exes and why we tend to go back an average of 7 times before fully being able to break things off. I&#39;ve done bouts of research on this, for myself and for others I will be able to help in the future. Not only are there emotional, financial and physical dependencies, abusers tend to put on this mask so that people do not believe the victim because there&#39;s no way someone so nice can be so abusive. This minimizes the severity of the abuse at hand, this causes the victim to feel like they are over reacting. (Gaslighting the victim)<br><br><br>On the other hand, police aren&#39;t too well trained to deal with domestic violence. The first time I tried to leave my abuser, i called the police for help and they ended up arresting me and holding me in a containment cell for hours. (Reinforcing that trauma bond to my abuser) I had to go to court and ultimately at the end,to be proven innocent. But the damage had already been done. If this happened to me, in Canada a country not known for police brutality, think about other vulnerable men and women in America for example who are victims and finally got the courage to leave? Being wrongfully arrested happens more than we would hope. <br><br><br>I really do hope you guys decide to touch base on this growing issue. I wish no one would have to go through what i went through and i will not take this information with me to the grave. I will inform, support and educate as many people as I can. <br><br><br><br>Take Care.<br><br><br>-Nicole", "comment_date": "2019-02-22T00:01:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hannes H", "comment_text": "just smoke some meth lol", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T23:44:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ruse", "comment_text": "just browse r9k and you will never have an ex \ud83d\udc4c", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T19:42:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miscy Videos", "comment_text": "These guys are one of the very, very few couples-I&#39;ve-never-actually-met that I would be genuinely sad about if they ever broke up.", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T17:46:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kartikey", "comment_text": "Didn&#39;t they mention suicide?", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T17:45:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zezus Christ", "comment_text": "<b><i>I Don&#39;t Even Have Girlfriend</i></b>", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T17:18:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dodge This!", "comment_text": "Tried it.
