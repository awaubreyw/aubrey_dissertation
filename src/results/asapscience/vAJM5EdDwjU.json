As sustainable technology becomes better, cheaper, and more widespread, consumption might not be nearly as damaging to the environment as it is today. Think about this: people say that buying a Tesla isn&#39;t carbon neutral, but with the technology tesla is developing, we could eventually see more and more aspects of the production cycle be replaced with sustainable energy sources. The same technology that powers an electric car could feasibly power any machine. Additionally the area required for farming could be seriously reduced with hydroponic interiors farming technologies. Ironically, as global food demands increase, it may become significantly more cost effective to build farms in artificial, vertical habitats. Same thing goes with the consumption of fossil fuels: as a limited resource their price will increase with the demand for them, thus making sustainable energy sources more enticing. I&#39;m not saying excessive consumerism is necessarily always good, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an automatic tradeoff between the amount of consumption and the health of the environment.

There is so much to dissect here - the why and the what and how. There is no way it can be covered in one video or comment - but I think, at least for me, the answer has been in simplification. I don\u2019t believe we evolved to be constantly entertained or constantly busy, but the forces around us are constantly competing for our attention to make money and garner resources for themselves that the right/wrong/should/shouldn\u2019t is forgotten. We end up being bombarded with shiny things, emotional ads, outrageous news headlines - and we lose our time to center on what we really need. We lose our ability to even really know what we need because there is always someone or something telling us exactly what that next thing is. <br>We need to simplify and break it down to basics and really question why we are spending our resources and the Earth\u2019s on every thing.", "comment_date": "2021-03-12T04:56:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott Kidder", "comment_text": "Well, you\u2019re right, if everyone lived like the top 0.1% we\u2019d all be screwed and just by living in America or Canada we\u2019re already living off the backs of poor people and people less fortunate than us. And it\u2019s also true that happiness is only correlated with wealth to a point but after a certain point, it has absolutely no influence. I suppose modifying culture could be part of the solution. But while all cultures are different, they still have stages of maturity. I highly doubt that Bangladesh will do us all a favor and keep from consuming goods the way we do now when it becomes industrialized just because it\u2019s the right thing to do. People are people after all. They\u2019ll probably use air conditioning the same way we do or they\u2019ll find something else to spend ridiculous amounts of resources on that we don\u2019t care about. Sustainability won\u2019t matter to them, and why should it? We didn\u2019t have to worry about it when we industrialized, so why should they? <br><br>I guess what I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s in credibly unlikely that we are going to found a governing body over the whole world and then pay taxes to it and evenly distribute our energy and resources to each other while singing kumbaya within the next 50-100 years. What we really need is innovation. We need to be able to enjoy our air conditioning and heaters while being sustainable and not needing 12 earths of land and resources. Or we need to find resources from elsewhere like asteroids. <br><br>We only have a few tools at our disposal to modify human behavior towards a collective outcome. The three major ones are violence, money, and culture. Normally these tools are used to force people to look out for the group rather than just themselves, and many times, they have been used to force people to look out for only the group at the expense of themselves. People became properties of the State. So we can\u2019t go crazy with these tools. We really shouldn\u2019t use violence. So that leaves us with money and culture. Culture takes too long to modify, so it might help a little bit, but not enough. We\u2019re just going to have to create financial incentives to innovate our way out of this mess. And you can\u2019t pay people to live a poor lifestyle to save the world... because there would be no financial incentive to do that. What you can do is give people a lot of money if they can figure out how to sustainably live in mansions so that the whole world can live in mansions without us needing 12 earths.", "comment_date": "2021-03-12T04:50:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samantha Robertson", "comment_text": "hmmm, pot calling kettle black much", "comment_date": "2021-03-12T04:46:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ronit Srivastava", "comment_text": "Does no. of earths mean the land area.

Stop flaunting and being pretentious and it would help a lot.<br>Influencers are also bad for society as a whole, people too often start thinking such things are normal or can be achieved if they did something similar. However these influencers don&#39;t show exactly how they actually make most their money, get ignorant followers to be influenced by subtle branding and ideas which companies pay big money for (anyone thinking that MOST influences actually care are naive).<br><br>However the BIGGEST impact by far is still industry, the US is one of the biggest problems along with a few other countries. China produces a tremendous amount of CO2eq emissions each year, of course most their citizens don&#39;t but all their factories and waste facilities, as well as industrial transport (anything that transports goods/products), etc does.. <br>India also still produces a ton of emissions and other problems due to their policies regarding waste treatment and disposal (I know many countries send their landfill waste to India and Africa to get rid of it).<br><br>So yes, stop following influencers, because that means no income from influencing, makes it hard to spend money on stuff to flaunt with.<br><br>Also start actually fighting lobbies, policies and industry.<br>Read to understand where the biggest problems are and what is causing them, then fight those. <br><br>Last as a little side note, colder climates need more energy, heating is always going to take more energy than cooling, which is one reason why Sweden and Norway are still fairly heavy energy users per capita (electric cars are an issue because low temperatures can easily compromise your battery life and the range). Airconditioners use something called a COP (coefficient of performance which nowadays is usually between 3 and 4), while heaters/boilers can never be more than near 100% efficient. While isolation is the biggest solution to cutting cost and improving efficiency in both cases (smaller windows ... or triple pane with low emissity coating for those mansions).<br>Point being you can not simply divide the energy evenly, colder climates will need more, temperate climates (15-30C) the least probably, and hot climates are somewhere in between.<br>Same reason when you compare Canada and the US directly that it would be a fair comparison.", "comment_date": "2021-03-12T04:30:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Saikat 404", "comment_text": "\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\udde9\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-03-12T04:29:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh McMurdo", "comment_text": "your alabama is a picture of georgia.

Particularily for areas like rural Alberta. <br><br>I think this video brings up very valid points, but in the context of Canada, neglects to mention just how gigantic Canada is in terms of physical area.  Yes we have <b>terrible</b> public transit in most places, and large vehicles, but between our relitively small population, and large area, it is often quite difficult or even infeasable to have good public transportation.  Further many areas of Canada have little to no alternatives to those &quot;gas guzzling&quot; vehicles, as, in rural areas there is spotty or non-existant snow removal systems, and there is rather extreem conditions in terms of cold, snow, and distance to work/ammenities that would prohibit walking or having a small car.   Also many people in rural areas rely on the ability to tow/haul things with their vehicle for both everyday life, and work.  I think that many people in Canada feel opposed to &#39;green initiatives&#39; because those green ideas are often quite infeasable for many rural Canadians.  This comment is not to say that those people are totally right, but just to bring up the point that many of those people have valid complaints.  I think the idea of stopping climate change is largely supported/pushed by people from larger centers and warmer climates, so if we could help to include people from rural areas (without making them feel like we are attacking them) then they too could get onboard for fighting climate change.  Thus I think an analysis of rural vs urban resource use, and the ways it can be reduced would be quite helpful in convincing the people who are not already on-board the stop-global-warming-train.  You guys make excellent videos in terms of good sources, good science, and a well balanced argument, and I&#39;d love to see a video from you guys that I could show to my rural friends that oppose climate change initaitives \ud83d\ude43", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T22:03:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mulan 121", "comment_text": "Rich people are the most miserable and pitiful creatures I&#39;ve met in my life.

I always thought that was the best environment friendly way, but I never thought about how much it still was in terms of footprint:<br>Comparing pre-corona and corona times, going from 700 km traintravel to 0 reduced my footprints from 2.9 earths to 1.6!! thats a huge difference with just that one change!! currently with travelling once a week to another city for 120km weekly, I&#39;m at 1.8 earths. This calculator probably underestimates the footprint a bit, but still. <br>So what I take away from this, is that I really should go live in the city that I work in and travel by bike, or work from home more often.  Working from home may be one of the good trends from corona.<br><br>And what to do about going from 1.8 to &lt;1. well yeah that&#39;s the challenge.", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T19:13:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moyetito", "comment_text": "What we need is more AsapSCIENCE kind of influencers.", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T19:12:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Sacay", "comment_text": "Back In the closet \ud83d\udc80", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T19:12:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alberto moro garcia", "comment_text": "Stop following them clowns.", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T19:11:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Canote", "comment_text": "Love your candor, boys!
