[{"comment_by": "EveaGornall", "comment_text": "Tax dollars need to be reallocated towards creating a unified trash/recycling/compost system so a) it\u2019s common knowledge everywhere what exactly goes in each bin so those who don\u2019t recycle properly due to lack of knowledge have no excuse and b)so that it\u2019s paid for and doesn\u2019t cost home and apartment owners and business owners more money to recycle than to have trash. I\u2019ve lived in my apartment building for 10 years now and the first 3 years we only had trash until the city made it mandatory for everyone to have recycling too (everyone at the restaurant I worked for complained and I was like YOU GUYS WE WASTE SO MUCH). Anyway, we\u2019ve now had a teeny recycling bin that gets filled up in a day or two and my manager just confided in me that he has to put most of in into the dumpster anyway or the trucks won\u2019t pick it up. We got a compost bin last month but he said it\u2019s only for the gardeners to use, like WTF no that\u2019s a lie, he just doesn\u2019t want it getting overflowed too (which I understand on his part, it\u2019s the rental company and their stingy bins I\u2019m annoyed with). It\u2019s an obnoxious system. I think most people WANT to recycle", "comment_date": "2022-07-28T22:12:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aat karelse", "comment_text": "Soo YouTube thinks every video title should be translated to my local language: Dutch &quot;Wat als we al onze brugklassers verbranden&quot; and i for one could not agree more, lets burn all the firstgraders!", "comment_date": "2022-06-23T13:34:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JohnnyMidnight1", "comment_text": "This narrarator guy sounds like he puffs peters", "comment_date": "2022-05-23T05:34:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "David Kendall", "comment_text": "Wrong.

If we use Critical Thinking we can solve this issue I think. <br>1. Lasers- vaporization<br>2. Acids- really strong ones can even dissolve metals<br>3. Geothermal disposal- tube dug to heat layers, waste could de dumped<br>4. Container volcano disposal- metal container could sink into lava/magma before melting/burnup of waste? <br>5. Underground nuclear/thermobaric/napalm explosions- vaporization<br>6. Solar tower heating- sunlight beam from tower or satellite could fry waste? <br>7. Collision vaporization- metal cone-shaped container could be shot into wall at extreme speeds, vaporization?<br>8. Suborbital capsule reentry- metal container could be shot up on a rocket and reenter atmosphere, burning up?<br>9. Deep ocean vaporization- submarine hulls/ships/giant containers with waste and a small nuclear bomb could be sunk a mile deep offshore and bomb detonated, vaporization? Or metal containers could be taken out to sea, sunk to bottom, a nuke lowered <br>and detonated to vaporize waste?<br>10. Nuclear fusion reactors- really hot, a metal container could be put in a vacuum chamber above to equalize pressure, then dropped into plasma (Tokamak design) and vaporized? <br>Temporary Storage Ideas<br>11. Containers- metal canisters could be put In yards or underground tunnels? <br>12. Better toxic waste barell- plastic/metal/plastic, lasts longer? OR glass/plastic/metal/plastic? <br>13. Better landfill liner- metal or glass or concrete (leachate contained?)<br>14. Tank farms- similar to oil terminals, giant metal tanks could contain leachate and methane could be collected for energy?", "comment_date": "2019-11-09T04:58:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jessica Osborn", "comment_text": "Is this Dalton from Bobs Burgers?", "comment_date": "2019-11-04T22:41:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Biesemans", "comment_text": "Whats that Belgium you talk of ?", "comment_date": "2019-11-04T20:09:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Call Me Cyan", "comment_text": "sweeten is the best. country from my calculations<br>-They have schools that are good and the children like learning at the<br>-now the literally do the best stuff with there trash<br>-whats next? they get the first person to Mars?
