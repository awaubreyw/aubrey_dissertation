TEG would be 3rd place. (Solar, and wind are 1&amp;2) why would you want to make power for lights when there are other options. You could just use an oil lamp, candles, or a wood stove. All can be made by yourself. Oil can be made a hundred different ways, from fat to anything that can burn. Wax is a little harder, but it is also a byproduct of the oil making process. (Not bees wax, but replacements) and in Canada you will need a fire sooner or later.<br>EDIT: look to how people did things in history. You know there was lights before the electric light. And the Egyptians had batteries. Look up the Bagdad battery, it could have easily charged a phone. And last of all you do NOT need AC power. Your phone and laptop use DC. The little box you plug into the wall changes the AC in the wall to the 5v DC your phones use. ( Laptops commonly used 30 volt DC) incandescent lights use both AC and DC. LEDs use DC unless you buy ones made for AC. AC LEDs have more parts and use more power then a basic LED.
