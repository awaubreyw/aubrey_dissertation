That&#39;s about 8 x louder than a rock band. Maybe if I got a pair of speakers and taped them to my ears. You can certainly get loud enough to make the ears tickle though. The most sensitive pair of earphones were some Olympus in ears that I hot glued to a bent piece of coat hanger with right angled ends that sealed them in sideways. Stupid loud off of little power but uncomfortable as shit and needed EQ to sound good. Perhaps my Olympus coat hanger hot glue earbuds would do almost that if I played them loud enough to blow the speakers but so far I haven&#39;t tried them off of anything more than the headphone socket off of a Toshiba Satellite Pro A200.<br>I am curious about one demo I did where I put a SoundMagic E10 right up to the end of an SPL meter with the foam mic cover removed. Off of the laptop it would read as high as 126dB on the C scale. This is beyond the threshold of pain but listening to it it sounds in the 100s as on the SPL meter it can reach well over 100 at 1/4 of the level on the volume bar but this is quite comfortable volume. I&#39;m wondering whether the tiny airspace between the bud (a rubber tip) and the mic capsule (embedded at the front of a thin metal tube) creates far more level than a longer ear canal. Also an SPL meter might overestimate SPL for an earbud because outside sounds measured by the spl meter get further amplified by the shape of the outer ear whereas an earbud does not. I suppose if I could stick a rubber ear shape and canal on the end of my SPL meter it would equalise the difference.", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T21:57:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JeremyF1tzgerald", "comment_text": "What would happen is..<br><br><br><br>*wAiT hE cAnT hEaR US hE hAs aIRpOdS iN", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T20:48:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "quazy", "comment_text": "Whos watching this even though you don&#39;t have air pods?", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T20:16:03Z", "likes_count": 190}, {"comment_by": "Mallow The samurai", "comment_text": "He\u2019s just hating on my FLEX dude", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T19:53:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kenneth Hulse", "comment_text": "Who is watching this with AirPods?", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T19:18:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ShadowVinnie", "comment_text": "Even iheart  radio", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T18:12:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Myiphonephotos Iphone", "comment_text": "Buys airpods just for photos and to walk around town and never turns them on", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T17:10:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cuan fenton", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETJs5moej9M&amp;t=0m16s\">0:16</a> <br><br>I thought that was my actual phone", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T16:57:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bavan Dhaliwal", "comment_text": "I got an ear infection from AirPods BUT I STILL USEEEE THEM NOWW..It\u2019s fine if I use them now tho", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T14:54:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bunny", "comment_text": "I was putting it on and watching it", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T14:29:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T Callum", "comment_text": "You would become tall", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T09:07:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ThinkInfinity", "comment_text": "I personally dont see why people stick white pieces of macaroni in their ears", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T08:23:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jose", "comment_text": "Sup", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T02:11:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ua9c1\u2022Sakura Himari\u2022\ua9c2", "comment_text": "Cordless headphone things are bad for you.", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T02:03:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "J\u00f8ke's \u00d8n Y\u00f8u!", "comment_text": "i&#39;ve never taken my airpods off...because...<br><br><br><br>i don&#39;t have airpods!

The earwax helps protect your ear from dust and germs. Your ear already had the wax in it and it goes on the q- tip when you use it.

If you use a q-tip a lot the pushed in wax won&#39;t have time to work it&#39;s way out so you will get a buildup of wax and possible a blocked eardrum.

But that&#39;s not quite true. It really depends on what kind of headphones you use and how you use them. Over ear headphones have (for me at least) ten times more comfort and don&#39;t put these sound waves directly in to your ear. Silence is nowhere so even if you go to bed you will probably still feel like hearing things while it seems silent. Just make sure you protect your ears when loud music is around you. For real be overprotective, ignore the weird faces of your friends, just think &#39;I&#39;m not going to have hearing damage as you will have after this&#39;. With headphones just be smart and don&#39;t put the volume too high. This 8 hours is only true if you use your in ear headphones or always put your volume over 80db.

You can see it on your airpod(you could prove me wrong if you don&#39;t have &#39;any&#39; wax or germ on there even if you wore it and never cleaned it for at least half year). Check it out once in 3 month or so; there is definitely a wax buildup. Ear wax can build up till your outer ear, which I keep it very clean to prevent the pimples and stuff. Especially, if you have a hair long enough to touch your ear, you might wanna clean up your airpod once in a while.\r<br>That is, of course, if you want to maintain your Airpod clean(even on the surface there will be dusts and pollen, viruses and bacterium  from outside, so it&#39;s actually important to clean your earphones, but they usually don&#39;t cause any disease, thanks to your tympanic membranes. Although, try not to share your earphone/airpods with your friend too much; germs that was already on your ear is fine but it&#39;s unhygienic to share some germs each other with your friend.)\r<br>So, there&#39;s an actual possibility to inner-ear infection and allergic reaction on tympanic membrane which would also cause hearing problem. DO NOT SHARE IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS. And make sure to clean it up with alcohol before you put it back on your ear.\r<br>\r<br>Suck on this, pesudo-scientists. &#39;Constantly having Airpods on your ear&#39; is basically a matter of the rate of the infection buildup. I mean, sure. People wash ears when they shower.

If the wax is constantly produced and naturally migrates outward and falls out, blocking the canal off with an ear bud will clearly impede the wax and cause a buildup. You are right about not using Q-tips in the ear canal; they push wax backwards.
