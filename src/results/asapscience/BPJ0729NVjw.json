We live in an over stimulated society, a rat race.  We are over stimulated visually and audibly when in heavy traffic, probably why peoples brains are being conditioned to dumb things down/not focus.

A waay higher risk for a car accident in my overpopulated city.  When I close and get off at night the parking lot is nearly empty, it is nice and quiet, and the air quality is much better. Way better for your blood pressure because you do not have to deal with all of that unnecessary chaos, pollution and anxiety.

The weird thing is that I did try working overnight jobs and those did not seem to fit better for my schedule. I could not sleep very well in the daytime and I felt like I could not get anything done. It resulted in my feeling tired 100% of the time instead of 75% of the time. If my body is allowed to follow its own natural sleeping pattern, I sleep in a series of naps.

NO. How is it that the Greeks were so brilliant when it came to treating ailments/conditions/disorders? Because they utilized the person&#39;s astrological birth chart.

We, much like the planet itself, is made up of nearly 70% water. If the outer planets can so greatly influence LARGE MASSES of water on Earth, then how difficult would it be to influence us little droplets?? Not difficult at all. Astronomers always find out things decades (if not centuries) later that astrologers already knew. Documented. This is a science that needs to be considered in studies like this. For instance, if you&#39;re a Leo (or any fire &amp; air sign), you&#39;re likely to function better during the day.

Some must take the morning and others must take the night, but some are on standby and can be used wherever needed. I seem to be one of those, which is why this is even a theory to me. It seems the thriving is more full though, for those who have their schedules decided for them. It helps that they don&#39;t have to worry about having to switch everything around at any given time. It also seems the flexibility diminishes the longer the terms between shifting shifts. I mean, some flexibles deal with frequent switch ups better than others, while for the rest every six months/year or two might be more ideal.

I like waking up in the morning (once I&#39;m up and out of bed) because it makes me more productive and I feel like I get more errands and chores done. Plus waking up early allows me to take a nap without feeling guilty. I also feel that when i wake up earlier I am more motivated to knock homework out right away. However, I also love staying up late and sleeping in. I feel that\u00a0I am more motivated to clean at\u00a0night but also more relaxed.

Until Grade 6, I thought it was normal to stay up till 1 am on a school night. But boy, living as a night-owl in a morning-lark world has taken its toll. It&#39;s become harder and harder to get away with loss of sleep, and harder and harder to cope with the typical 9-5 job. I work nights right now, but to my surprise, it&#39;s harder to cope with. I thought I&#39;d be okay because my natural tendency (when I&#39;m not working/on a stay-cation) is to fall asleep later and later until I&#39;m going to bed at 4 or 5 or 6 am and going to sleep till 1 or 2 or 3 pm. However, it&#39;s a struggle to try to sleep in the daytime, never mind if you have to get shit done at the same time. I think it&#39;s because, after coming home from working a night shift, my body is undergoing mixed hormonal signals - it&#39;s energized with cortisol and just about tired enough for sleep at the same time, and also hungry for food. So I eat breakfast, and surprise, I can&#39;t sleep for a while. I&#39;d probably be doing better if I had absolutely nothing that needed doing in the daytime, but of course, that&#39;s not possible, so I have to sacrifice precious sleep hours to get shit done.<br><br>On the bright side, sleep has suddenly become harder to ignore and more important to me as thing to guard and protect, with working nights. And one generally good thing about being a night owl was that it helped me to plow through many all-nighters for pretty well all of my English term papers in University.

Some people are very responsive to circadian rhythm markers like light and melatonin. Those people, despite their predisposition to being an &quot;early bird&quot; or &quot;night owl,&quot; are able to employ flexibility in their sleep and wake times that allows them to maintain any schedule they choose.\u00a0I&#39;m a circadian rhythm disorder patient. That means that not only am I predisposed to be nocturnal, but I don&#39;t have the ability to maintain any other schedule. It causes chaos in my life because I don&#39;t have the ability to force myself to be societal to go to school/work; if my brain had its way I&#39;d fall asleep at 6 AM and wake up at 3 PM. The concept of circadian rhythm &quot;flexibility&quot; is perhaps most apparent in shift work disorder. Take a nurse who needs to work nights. If she had her way, she&#39;d work nights. But she can&#39;t, because her body signals for her to sleep at night. Her circadian rhythm causes disorder in her life because of its inflexibility. Bottom line, skeptical commenter, is just because you feel great after forcing yourself to sleep at 10 PM and wake up at 6 AM every day does not mean that the concept of chronotype or this video is &quot;bullshit.&quot; Many people do not have the ability to regulate their sleep like you do.", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T04:58:31Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Eli Lee", "comment_text": "\u00a0I stay up really late but i wake up really early", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T04:32:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lauren", "comment_text": "As a Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder patient, thank you for making this video.", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T04:29:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Valentine Reviews", "comment_text": "This was a great video guys, keep up the good work!!!", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T04:18:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Maddy Gee", "comment_text": "Why do we cry?", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T04:14:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DEEP SHETH", "comment_text": "Why do babies cry when they are born?", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T04:01:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roz\u2019s Reviewz", "comment_text": "can you do an asap video of the brain on lsd?", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T03:59:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diana Fuller", "comment_text": "I 100% understand the social jet lag thing.", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T03:59:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michelle Brunner", "comment_text": "what is growing pain?", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T03:33:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cas", "comment_text": "&#39;Who&#39; needs sleep these days, right?", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T03:04:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kinenz", "comment_text": "This explains so much", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T02:50:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "musketman12", "comment_text": "My brain can&#39;t make up it&#39;s god damn mind.

It&#39;s all relative I guess. Depending on what I&#39;m doing, I can adjust my internal clock to either. If I know I have an important meeting, exam or test coming up, I&#39;ll adjust my schedual so that I wake up a few hours earlier, keep doing that for a week and you&#39;ll be an early bird, but if I&#39;m on vacation, all the fun happens after midnight and I&#39;ll be sure to stay up late.

I was born 10pm, and when I was a little kid, my mom couldn&#39;t get me to sleep before 10pm. When I went in kindergarten, I actually used the morning to get into a hidden place, lay down and sleep, instead of interacting with the others (sadly, my kindergartners didn&#39;t even noticed my absence...), making my mom wondering why I&#39;m always so fit and refreshed after kindergarten.<br>But I also remember a time where I got up early on weekends without troubles to watch morning cartoons. Overall, doring the first years of school, I managed that sleeping rythm fine. But the older I got, the harder it was for me to wake up in the mornings and the harder it became to go to bed early. In the end, constant bullying in school gave me all the good reasons not to care about school anymore, and I stayed awake till 2am, slept a few hours, tried not to fall asleep during class (didn&#39;t always worked out) and slept a bit when I came home again.<br>Today, I can shuffle my time as I want, which is a big plus. I go to bed at 6am and stand up around 12am - 1 pm. Some years ago, I tried to get a &quot;normal&quot; shedule, when my boyfriend moved in. Went to bed around midnight, stood up around 6am. It went fine for a few months, but about 3 months later, I completely broke down. I couldn&#39;t get fully awake until 12am, and I got a nervous breakdown. I then adjusted my times to the time today, which gave me a huge benefit again.<br>And I do admit, social life can be very harsh and stressful because of that.

Not only do I feel more awake during the night, but my body just doesn&#39;t like to sleep then. In fact, when I force myself to sleep at night, even after 8 hours, I wake up without feeling very rested at all.\u00a0<br><br>The main issue I have is that my sleep pattern isn&#39;t consistent. A quick example. I work night shifts. I&#39;ll get back from work at about 4 AM. I also bike to work and back, doing manual labor. When I get back, I&#39;m still pretty awake and energized from that exercise, adrenaline and so on. And of course, I don&#39;t want to sleep as soon as I get back, I&#39;ll stay up until at least 5 or 6 AM. This can be my routine for a while, but after a couple weeks, I&#39;ll notice I don&#39;t get tired enough to sleep until at least a few minutes later, each day. Until I notice I&#39;m only getting tired at 7 am, or 8 am, and it keeps getting worse, until I find myself sleeping at 1 PM and waking up at 9 PM, and even for a night owl, that is rather depressing.<br><br>Eventually to fix this I have to pull an all-nighter... well, I guess an all-dayer is more accurate for this situation. It&#39;s very difficult to do when you have to work later, but I&#39;ll do it, and manage to reset my sleep pattern back to the default, only for this cycle to repeat, yet again.<br><br>It&#39;s very annoying.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-11-27T16:58:38Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Celeste Tan", "comment_text": "And I&#39;m watching this at 1am in the morning.<br><br>Night owl for life! :)", "comment_date": "2014-11-27T16:58:21Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Nicole Estefania", "comment_text": "I wake up early no matter what..
