I think tutorials such as this are so helpful in learning about diabetes and what is occurring in the body because the intended audience gets to hear about what is going on and also gets to see what is going on with the body when these processes take place. As a student, I find tutorials over very complicated processes like this to be very helpful. In contrast, I feel like a video such as this can be almost too informative for someone who is trying to learn about diabetes for the 1st time. This seems like it may be geared towards someone who has previous knowledge about the topic. Altogether, I find this video extremely helpful and very well done. but i want to use this great opportunity to give thanks to 14 days negative i used to cure my type 2 diabetes naturally by DR. Oguku peterson i found when i was looking for alternative cure for my type 2 diabetes. i am recommending 14 days negative to all type 1 and 2 diabetic patient out in in the word. new  York, Florida, Texas, san Francisco, Chicago, Austin, los Angeles, Denver, Seattle, Houston, Boston, phoenix, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, las Vegas , Mississippi, Miami, Columbus, Virginia beach, St. louis. let&#39;s all come together to support DR.

The increased amount of heat carried by water evaporation in lungs during yawning is insignificant compare to a minute of regular breathing. Over a minute one yawn causes maybe 25% of extra ventilation. In general it can&#39;t meaningfully affect brain temperature: <br>Lets assume a human exhales an extra 3L of air during yawning (less in reality). It carries no more than 0.1g of water vapor (usually 2-3 times less). 0.1g of water vapor carries about 55 metric calories. The brain weighs around 1.5kg. If all 55 calories are somehow instantly transferred from the brain (and not spread over blood, lungs, other tissue), they can cool it off by only 0.03C.<br>Evaporating 1g of water as perspiration (breaking sweat) would carry 10 times more heat.&#39;&#39;<br>(Quora answer - <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Is-yawning-contagious-If-so-why-Whats-the-evidence\">https://www.quora.com/Is-yawning-contagious-If-so-why-Whats-the-evidence</a>)", "comment_date": "2017-02-20T09:34:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arben Bedzeti", "comment_text": "Is that the reason why you start singing a song you heard someone else just sing", "comment_date": "2017-02-15T00:02:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Toilet Paper", "comment_text": "My brother and I didn&#39;t yawn at all on this vid or the yawn-o-meter", "comment_date": "2017-02-14T22:19:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eagles Fan", "comment_text": "I got to50", "comment_date": "2017-02-09T04:07:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sami Danial", "comment_text": "i yawn like 999 times in this video xd", "comment_date": "2017-02-08T17:04:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephanie Randall", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve watched 5 videos of yawning so I could unplug my ears, and for some reason this one worked...weird", "comment_date": "2017-02-05T07:03:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "William", "comment_text": "I yawned 17 times this video and on the meter failed at 2", "comment_date": "2017-02-05T06:43:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cam", "comment_text": "in the first 10 seconds I yawned", "comment_date": "2017-02-05T01:30:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ThatRandomBrayan", "comment_text": "I yawned like 3 time while watching this video", "comment_date": "2017-02-04T17:10:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mohamed Debrrn", "comment_text": "Reading the comments makes me yawn. like 10 times.", "comment_date": "2017-02-02T20:15:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tug Speedman", "comment_text": "After every time I yarn I start laughing uncontrollably", "comment_date": "2017-02-01T22:32:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ishan Patel", "comment_text": "I yawned like 4 times during this vid.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-01-29T02:48:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Troen", "comment_text": "i made 50", "comment_date": "2017-01-28T01:51:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "prashant kumar", "comment_text": "I yawn in starting of video when i read title of video\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T05:31:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Lana", "comment_text": "@ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0dQx4SNSwE&amp;t=1m30s\">1:30</a> the kids looked stoned", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T02:02:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samira", "comment_text": "Did anyone else also yawn throughout this video? \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-01-26T21:01:33Z", "likes_count": 45}, {"comment_by": "Taylor Dean", "comment_text": "I yawned like 10 times", "comment_date": "2017-01-26T00:48:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zttack", "comment_text": "I got to 50", "comment_date": "2017-01-25T20:13:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TwisterLord", "comment_text": "Well guys, i&#39;m apparently autistic.<br>Time to make a drama alert channel.", "comment_date": "2017-01-25T14:27:55Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jungle Setanta ._.", "comment_text": "i didnt yawn", "comment_date": "2017-01-24T18:18:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L.

Or possibly because we either find these temperatures soothing in general, be it hot or cold. However I must say that I find warmth to be soothing but I must sleep in a semi-cold environment. In the shower I often set the water temperature to being as hot as possible, to which I begin to feel drowsy and begin to yawn. Even now I must say that I am yawning. Why do I say this? Because I&#39;m standing outside, sun is up, and the air feels quite vibrant...soothing I must say, a temperature are what I would say as to being the one I sleep with. And the wind, usually I keep a fan on so I stay cool as I sleep, it is replicating the conditions that I fall asleep at.

There are two types of yawning: spontaneous yawning, which occurs when someone is bored or tired, and contagious yawning, which occurs when a person hears, sees or thinks about yawning. Contagious yawning was recently found to be linked with age. As a person ages, their likelihood to contagiously yawn decreases, and past research suggested that it may by linked to variables like empathy, tiredness and energy levels but that is NOT TRUE. Research was conducted on 328 healthy volunteers that were prompted to watch a yawning video to see how many times they would yawn. The numbers ranged from zero to 15, and the numbers were consistent for each person for every round they did it. This means it had to be linked to genetics, and they found that people with disorders like autism or schizophrenia, both of which involve impaired social skills, demonstrate less contagious yawning despite still yawning spontaneously. So researchers suggested that people that do not yawn contagiously often, may have a trait from one of these disorders, but may not necessarily have the disorder.

Unless this petition reaches 100,000signatures by next week, this will happen:<br>All websites containing media that refers to or is owned by a company that hasn\u2019t given its permission for the media to be displayed can and will be shut down. This means sites such as Tumblr, Wattpad, Pinterist, <a href=\"http://fanfiction.com\">fanfiction.com</a>.<br>People who post such media can and will be fined, with a maximum sentence of five years in prison. This includes, but is not limited to, people who own/post the following: fanfiction, fan art, roleplay blogs, fan blogs/accounts and movie streaming sites.<br>&quot;The legislation would allow copyright holders and the Justice Department to seek court orders against websites associated with copyright infringement. SOPA, the House version, applies to both domestic and foreign websites, while PIPA targets foreign websites. If that court order is granted, the entire website would be taken down. Internet users who typed in the site\u2019s URL address would receive an error message, and for all appearances, the site would never have existed. Importantly, the court does not need to hear a defense from the actual website before issuing its ruling. The entire website can be condemned without a trial or even a traditional court hearing.&quot;meh", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T03:07:13Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Saurav Verma", "comment_text": "you made me yawn a lot with the video. 5 times", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T03:07:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Danger", "comment_text": "I feel out of the loop because I didn&#39;t yawn at all.", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T03:06:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nawen \u30ca\u30a6\u30a7\u30f3", "comment_text": "I feel you bro", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T03:05:35Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "LoveJasmine", "comment_text": "I yawned in the beigining and at the end with all those people.", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T03:03:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Androman", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t yawn! :D", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T03:03:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anton B\u00e4ckman", "comment_text": "i got trugth the whole yawn-o-meter but i was holding it back :P", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T03:02:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tasneem Shaikh", "comment_text": "Yawned four times during this video ", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T03:01:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phanteus", "comment_text": "Why do I not yawn when I have a fever or a headache though?\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T03:00:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephanie Slywchuk", "comment_text": "I yawned before the video even started \ud83d\ude0b", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T02:59:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CherryBoo65 B", "comment_text": "I yawned as soon as I saw the link, in total ten times for the video (and once with the comment!). ;)", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T02:58:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Annie McClutcherson", "comment_text": "I lasted to the end of both videos, is that bad?", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T02:58:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bobby Jack", "comment_text": "50", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T02:58:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr.D", "comment_text": "if you yawned hit like", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T02:56:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IAmAThespian", "comment_text": "I yawned so many times throughout this video... from title to every time the word &quot;yawn&quot; was said...", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T02:56:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M Mj", "comment_text": "0", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T02:53:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Damian Henderson", "comment_text": "I yawned three times during that video.
