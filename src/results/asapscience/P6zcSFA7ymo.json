So those extra 10 mins from pressing snooze COULD be beneficial? Do we have a set sleep pattern where in the first 10 mins after initially falling asleep, that if we wake up, we will always feel more tired? Is this why it will start the &#39;vicious cycle&#39; that was mentioned in the video? Then how come i&#39;ve heard that having &#39;powernaps&#39; or microsleeps are a good thing and will make you less sleepy? Or does &#39;less sleepy&#39; not mean the same thing as &#39;less tired&#39; in this context?<br><br>However, i&#39;ve been told/advised that you should pull over to take a 20 min powernap if you&#39;re feeling tired/sleepy while driving. The road/vehicle authorities advised drivers to pull over and take a 20 min powernap.. telling us in an advertisement/campaign that it could save your life etc. So how can this be true if having a 10-20 min powernap(which, correct me if i&#39;m wrong, is what i assume snooze to be, right..?) will only make you more tired?<br><br>Or yeah.. i guess you can you wake up being more tired but less overall sleepy, as i suspect is the case in the example with them telling us to wake up straight away and not use the snooze button and have an extra &#39;powernap&#39;..?<br><br>So yeah. If the above was too confusing, then just read/answer the questions below.. thanks.<br><br>TLDR: In the example given in the video where they advise you to wake up and not snooze/have an extra powernap(or more), even though you would wake up feeling more tired, would you actually be more or less SLEEPY overall? And would you have more or less of a chance to fall asleep unconsciously if you had more sleep overall(but did it with 3 extra 10 min powernaps) compared with if you had 30 mins less sleep overall, but it was all done in one continuous session?<br><br>So just say one person had 2 hours continuous sleep, and the other had 2 hours continuous, and then another 30 mins(note that the extra 30 mins was done in 3x 10minute powernaps).. if according to the video, the 2 hour guy would feel less tired since he woke up straight away, would he also have less chance to unconsciously fall asleep(just assume they were both sleep deprived and almost nodding off). And yes, i know about different stages of sleep, and the times are just for example only.. if 2 hours is not enough to reach the deepest stage of sleep, then change it so that they do reach the deepest stage.", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T07:51:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Name", "comment_text": "You should just put it at the other side of your bed so you may as well get up and to make you not go back to bed put your fav thing next to it but if it&#39;s sleep don&#39;t lol", "comment_date": "2015-08-18T11:06:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aidan Schram", "comment_text": "So basically you shouldn&#39;t go back to sleep once you wake up?", "comment_date": "2015-08-18T04:42:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mia santos", "comment_text": "Sorry if you already have a video on this but , what about artist and writers block?", "comment_date": "2015-08-15T06:35:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Another Doge", "comment_text": "I have a question: what do our voices actually sound like and when will the human race end?", "comment_date": "2015-08-14T03:40:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ExplosiveDude", "comment_text": "@AsapSCIENCE\u00a0 My modified alarm shocks me ( Literally TAZES me with 5 kV Capacitor on my arm ) , so I wake up and don&#39;t dare to snooze as I get scared of having that shock , but is it risky and non healthy to do so ?", "comment_date": "2015-08-07T11:11:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pluto the Insomniac", "comment_text": "Because of the sleep schedule, I don&#39;t even use alarms.

There are indeed stages of sleep, but you cannot progress to a &#39;deeper stage&#39; of sleep than you woke from in the 10mins it takes to snooze. Also the studies that mention &#39;fragmented sleep&#39; refer to people who do not take their sleep in lump sums (one long period of rest at night), but try to scatter it throughout the day and replace or greatly reduce their nightly sleep. Essentially, these topics are almost irrelevant to the topic at hand.<br><br>They should have instead focused on the state of sleep you WOULD go into during &#39;snooze&#39; which would be the LIGHTEST levels of sleep, which are not the restorative, deeper levels of sleep that your body needs to feel rejuvenated.<br><br>You can also use things like the UP band to wake you. It sits on your wrist and monitors your movement to determine what stage of sleep you&#39;re in and will wake you when you&#39;re in your lightest stage, and you will therefore experience the least amount of sleep inertia.<br><br>Another great way is to use nature&#39;s alarm clock... light! As light filters in through your windows, your brain detects light level change and will start producing chemicals to wake you up.
