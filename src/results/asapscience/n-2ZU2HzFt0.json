Learning moderation I believe is key, not cold turkey. My best advice I could give anyone who is afraid of a terrible hangover, take 600mg of ibuprofen (totally safe even up to 800mg but start with 400mg to 600mg) and two large glasses of water before bed and have another glass by your bed for the middle of the night when you wake up if you have to pee or something.

It will probably sound ridiculous, but I can think of so many ideas for you guys to try, as non-alcoholics that are binge-drinking for science (not that I could ever recommend it!). After reading a study published in a Finnish journal, I recently began experimenting with L-Cysteine, a sulfur-based amino acid used for a number of things. including Glutathione metabolism. The study indicated a 500mg dose could be used to treat &#39;hangxiety&#39;, a form of anxiety often attributed to being habitually hungover. I&#39;m curious about the effects of it on one-off binge sessions vs a full-blown alcoholic. I&#39;m also curious about the effects of the various types of ethanol products, such as beer vs. wine, whiskey and/or tequila vs vodka, etc. Ethanol is the main contributor to the effects of, well, ethanol, but there are many various substances included with it based on how it was produced, i.e. the by-products of brewing different malts and fruits with different strains of yeast and eventually distilling the product of those, the effects various types of wood can play in the aging of distilled spirits, the effects of &quot;terroir&quot; on consumption and metabolism, etc.. I never fail to feel subconscious as it were while watching videos like this because I know I have a problem, but I do enjoy exploring the science and chemistry behind it. I wouldn&#39;t encourage you two to go on a dozen benders in the name of science to explore some of these topics, but they could be decent starts for future videos.
