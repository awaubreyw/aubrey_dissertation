Thus my gonads failed to develop as testis. Well to be more accurate the one testis did mature to about half of normal adult size while the other testis remained completely as a fetal gonad. As an adult this testis became malignant with a form of ovarian cancer. <br>Those germ cells that failed to reach the gonad area became caught in various areas of my body and kept growing until they were surgically removed. They rained in size from. 10-17.5 cm . One of them was malignant while the others were not. One of these germs teratoma took on the appearance of a fetus. It had eyes, skin, bone, some organs and even limbs. <br>In my youth I was looked sort of female and I\u2019ve always felt as such. But I did marry and despite having hypogonadism we managed to have two children. It took many years to do so but we managed. <br>It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone that I have had to deal with gender dysphoria my whole life.

There I learned about the chromosome and zygote formation. I had read this before and commented that the single x chromosome that is active at first in males inherited by one of the parent doesn&#39;t make it a female in any case because the process is still incomplete and going on no matter when the y chromosome gets activated. For example, you make a drink in which you put both salt and sugar. Now you started making drink by putting salt first and as you were about to put sugar in it, someone interrupted in between and said pause, till this moment this drink is salty and after mixing the sugar it will give the perfect flavor. Then he is wrong in commenting that because till that moment ,it was not the drink yet, it was midway. The first moment of it being the Desired drink will be when the process of mixing both salt and sugar will be taken as a whole, to complete once. The same is the case here.As for the syndrome in which women are born with single x chromosome is an outcome after the completion of process (copying of chromosomes) and being unable to copy the second chromosome due to missing of some required link in DNA code of partner chromosome, the partner chromosome is not copied, so process is completed with single x chromosome in offspring that turns into a genetically special female.(Note here that the process of single x has completed unlike in above male case where process with single x is still incomplete as it has to sound after combining with y as it gets activated later on).", "comment_date": "2016-07-14T13:02:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Graham A", "comment_text": "Did you just assume my gender you are so sexiest and racist. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23triggered\">#triggered</a>.

In the womb, they start out as physiologically sexless, then intersex (an undifferentiated state that is neither male nor female), and then around week 10 they begin to develop specifically male physiology. There is <b>never</b> a time when they have only female-specific physiology. They develop some female-specific structures (Mullerian ducts), but females also form male-specific structures (Wolffian ducts) during the same period. The ducts for the &quot;non-selected&quot; sex eventually disintegrate.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Kdoja3hlk&amp;t=0m29s\">0:29</a> - <i>&quot;At the moment of conception you were, of course, male or female based on your genes.&quot;</i><br><b>Which is it?</b> I was male at the moment of conception, and &quot;my life actually began as female&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Kdoja3hlk&amp;t=0m05s\">0:05</a>).<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Kdoja3hlk&amp;t=0m34s\">0:34</a> - <i>&quot;The Y chromosome doesn&#39;t kick in right away. In fact, the first 5-6 weeks of embryonic development are attributed to the X chromosome alone&quot;</i><br><b>Misleading and somewhat false.</b> Here is a list of genes on the X chromosome:\u00a0<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/X/show/Genes\">http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/X/show/Genes</a><br><br>There is one gene on X that produces a protein found both in ovaries and testes, so by definition it&#39;s not sex-specific. Additionally, X has two known sex-specific genes, one of which (AR, which produces androgen receptors) is <i>mostly</i> useful to males (and trans-men), and the other of which (ARX) generates a <b>male-specific transcription factor.</b> Wanna know what <i>else</i> is a male-specific transcription factor? That&#39;s right - <b><i>SRY</i></b>, which is found <b>only</b> on the <b>Y chromosome.</b><br><br>In other words, <b>X HAS MORE TO DO WITH MALE-SPECIFIC BIOLOGY THAN FEMALE.</b> There is a logical fallacy going on here, &quot;denying the antecedent&quot; if I&#39;m not mistaken. They assume the following: &quot;Y=male, X not Y, female not male, therefore X=female.&quot; X mostly consists of genetic code used by <i>both</i> sexes - cellular biology, generation of teeth and red blood cells, etc.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Kdoja3hlk&amp;t=1m00s\">1:00</a> - <i>&quot;The ovaries descend and become the testes, and the labia fuse to create the scrotum.&quot;</i><br><b>Wrong.</b> Good example of the &quot;definist fallacy.&quot; (That&#39;s where you attempt to redefine things in a way favorable to your position.)\u00a0The <i>gonads</i>, undifferentiated tissue that isn&#39;t ovary <i>or</i> testicle, begin to differentiate into one or the other around week 10. Before then, they are <i>bipotential,</i> capable of becoming ovaries <i>or</i> testicles - but they aren&#39;t differentiated into either one yet. There is simply no time at which a male develops ovaries. The urogenital groove and sinus will either develop into labia <i>or</i> a scrotum, but like the gonads, they aren&#39;t either of those things before differentiation. You may as well refer to an egg as a hatchling.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Kdoja3hlk&amp;t=1m12s\">1:12</a> - <i>&quot;The skin of the scrotum and penis are zipped up like a zipper&quot;</i><br><b>Right.</b> And if the fetus is female, the urogenital groove and sinus <i>also</i> change shape and take on additional features, so this is a distinction without a difference. Likewise, females develop Wolffian ducts, which can only become a part of the male reproductive system. In the female, they eventually disintegrate. Do we consider females &quot;males&quot; while they have Wolffian ducts?<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Kdoja3hlk&amp;t=1m19s\">1:19</a> - <i>&quot;The male variant of the clitoris&quot;</i><br><b>Wrong.</b> (Another example of the definist fallacy.) The bulbous tissue at the &quot;top&quot; of the urogenital groove is not a clitoris. It&#39;s <i>undifferentiated.</i> It has to change shape and migrate before it becomes recognizable as <i>either</i>\u00a0a clitoris <i>or</i> a glans, and the tissue that surrounds it also changes. Before differentiation, it makes no more sense to call it a &quot;clitoris&quot; than it would to call an infant an adult - perhaps even less, because an infant is at least fully differentiated.<br><br>Do you see how they keep making the same mistake over and over? They mistake tissue in an undifferentiated state that is neither specifically male nor female, but in a homologous state somewhere between them, and they think, &quot;oh, that sort of looks female, and I already think we all start as girls (cognitive bias), so it must be so.&quot; Well, I looked sort of like a seahorse when I was five weeks in, but I didn&#39;t have gills. My undifferentiated gonads may have looked (to them) like ovaries at some point, but they never had follicles, egg cells, or any of the other things that specifically differentiate an ovary from a testicle. The actual relation is &quot;precursor =&gt; differentiated&quot;, but they think it&#39;s &quot;female =&gt; female or male&quot;.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Kdoja3hlk&amp;t=1m21s\">1:21</a> - <i>&quot;If the Y chromosome does not become activated for some reason, then the female phenotype, or appearance, will persist in the male.&quot;</i><br><b>Right, but misleading.</b> If a female fetus is exposed to enough androgens (from taking various steroids, genetic mutations, etc.) she will take on male characteristics, to the point where she may be mistaken as a genetic male with mild to moderate intersex physiology (intersex people used to be called hermaphrodites, in case you don&#39;t know). She may have what looks like a partially-formed <i>penis and testicles.</i> If you give a girl or woman enough androgens, she won&#39;t develop male-like genitals, but she will develop male-typical body and cranial hair (sometimes even male pattern baldness), bigger muscles, improved visual processing, and a more relaxed emotional affect than she had with estrogen. In other words, this is another distinction without a difference: <i>Both</i> sexes have code for expressing <i>each others&#39;</i> physiological characteristics.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Kdoja3hlk&amp;t=1m29s\">1:29</a> - <i>&quot;The nipples form before the activation of the Y chromosome&quot;</i><br><b>Right, but misleading.</b> Females develop Wolffian ducts, which can only become a part of the male reproductive system, during gestation. They degrade later on. They also develop androgen receptors, which are next to useless to them, just like nipples are somewhat to completely useless in a male. Some men find nipples useful for sexual stimulation, which is tied into reproduction; so while they don&#39;t produce milk, their sensitivity <i>is</i> biologically useful.<br><br>---<br><br>I told ASAPScience about this in 2014, and reminded them of it several months later. They haven&#39;t responded and the video is still here. Why should this be? People come to them for facts and knowledge and science, but instead they get a cultural myth that&#39;s literally wrong. They seem unwilling to stop doing so. If deliberate, this is an abuse of our trust. If not deliberate, it illustrates that they are not performing due diligence on their research. I really wish they would post a correct version of this video. If they want to be taken seriously as presenters of science, they have to admit they&#39;re wrong and STOP DOING WHAT THEY&#39;RE WRONG ABOUT. This is expected of anyone in science. Whatever page views, ratings, ad revenues, personal beliefs, etc. are on the table may be relevant to them, but that&#39;s their problem - not ours. <b>We don&#39;t owe it to them to believe falsehoods for the sake of ad revenue and pageviews.

Makes sense... not.<br><br>The x chromosome is huge compared to the y. The y only covers male-specific things, while the x covers everything. This is why the y is idle for such a long time. Because women are double x, the x needs to have all the data that is necessary to create a woman. Using programming terms, the Y is meant to override certain functions of the X, and that&#39;s the full purpose of the Y.<br><br>This is why females are more resistant (another X to fall back on) and why they have a greater variety physically. You can see this in the coatings of cats for instance. Cats who are both black and orange can only be female.<br><br>So to claim that men were female at some point in time is untrue. The X chromosome doesn&#39;t represent the female gender, it represents the human species, as 100% of all humans have a X chromosome. It&#39;s the lack of Y that defines the female gender, so a XY with a not-yet activated Y is not a female. He may look the same, but if you study his genes, you&#39;ll see the difference.<br><br>Male nipples serve no purpose, but they are also not an hindrance, so from the perspective of a programmer, there is no real motivation for overriding the creation of nipples through the Y chromosome, because that would require it to intervene much sooner, and it would also increase it&#39;s size drastically. It makes sense for the Y to stop the further development of the nipples and the breast tissue though, and this requires a lot less coding, as this is largely achieved by cutting the estrogen levels, and this is a function that the Y chromosome actually has.", "comment_date": "2014-08-22T01:57:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcus Varga", "comment_text": "That doesn&#39;t mean we were all females we weren&#39;t alive ", "comment_date": "2014-08-20T17:12:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Proper Purple Pancake", "comment_text": "Lol I do not know why but I&#39;m happy girls have breats", "comment_date": "2014-08-19T07:52:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lost Silver", "comment_text": "HAHAHA FEMALE ARE GOING TO RULE THE WORLD", "comment_date": "2014-08-18T23:46:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zane Roote", "comment_text": "SRY Gene + SRY sorry = PUN CITY!!!

After all sexual identification can be broken down into 4 ways: Chromosomal (whether you have a Y chromosome), Gonadal (the presence of Testicular Differentiation Factor (TDF), the product of the SRY gene and other genes/products of the Y chromosome), Somatic (the development of accessory sex glands and external genitalia), and Psychic sex (the sexuality that your psyche identifies with). Assuming that you are referring to somatic sex, the external genitalia present in the indifferent/undifferentiated stage is not of a female&#39;s (Physiology of Indifferent - gential swelling, phallus, urethal slit, and a tail; female - clitoris, labia minora, urthral meatus, vaginal orifice, labia majora, anus). While these might develop into a female genitalia if there are no Y chromosomal factors present, they need further factors present in the X chromosome to develop into female genitalia. To claim that these undifferentiated organs are female is strange. Take a look at the Wolffian Duct which in males develops into the epididymis, seminal vesicles, and vas deferens and atrophies in females, but is present in the undifferentiated stage of a fetus. Would you classify this as a &quot;male&quot; organ since it is not present in females and is used in development of male genitalia? I personally wouldn&#39;t.
