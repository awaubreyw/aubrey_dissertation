The bride was using all her tears up at the wedding, so she wouldn&#39;t have any left during her marriage.  You might as well frame &quot;catching the bouquet&quot; as proof of a witch, since the woman who caught it must be a slut if she&#39;s going to rope a husband before all the other women.<br><br> It&#39;s a silly superstition like breaking a glass bottle on a ship christening or not letting the groom see the bride before the wedding.  People will repeat &quot;Brides had to cry a bunch at their wedding or they were called a witch&quot; despite how ridiculous it is because it was said in a &quot;science&quot; video.  <br>How plausible does this sound?:<br><br>&quot;Gee, I really love you and want to marry you, Esther.  It&#39;s too bad you didn&#39;t cry enough.  Now I&#39;m going to let our neighbors murder you and then I&#39;m going to find a bride that isn&#39;t a witch.  As a totally real and historically accurate man of the 1700s, I am incapable of love, as you knew full well before we decided to tie the knot, so I don&#39;t understand why you couldn&#39;t just cry to avoid the village murdering you.  Back to the dating pool for me, I guess.  I know you loved elm trees, so I made sure your pyre is 100% elm.  Hop up on this stake please.

I&#39;ve been taking testosterone for over two years now, and I can say beyond a doubt that I find it significantly harder to produce emotional tears. I cry significantly less than I did before I started testosterone, even when experiencing the same level of emotion. It now takes a MUCH stronger emotional response to cry. I find that I cry pretty easily when near another person that&#39;s crying and confiding in me, however when I&#39;m alone, I usually don&#39;t cry very often. Maybe.. 8 times a year?? Like I can pinpoint every single time I&#39;ve cried (and by crying, I mean full sobbing, tears streaming down my face, struggling to breathe). I cried when my dog died, when my sister moved out, and I cried a little when my mom graduated with her BSN. I cry when I feel frustrated and stuck, I find after being angry about the same thing for multiple days that emotion begins to divert to sadness and I&#39;ll start crying over it, and I cry when I think about things that made me really happy in the past that I lost before I was ready to move on, like hanging out with my sister (then she moved out and moved across the state) and going to band (I had to drop out of high school during Covid because I have ADHD and I just.. can&#39;t learn online. It stresses me out and my mental health rapidly declines, and within a matter of months I become suicidal; because of that, I lost band, where was the only place I&#39;ve felt truly at home. Music is my therapy, and playing outside of a band setting just isn&#39;t the same). I cry the same amount of instinctive tears, like when the sun is really bright or an eyelash is in my eye, but emotional tears are just less common. I NEVER cry from movies or TV shows, though I find I do still cry while reading some books.<br><br> I&#39;ve definitely cried over the bills being passed this year that target specifically trans youth, it&#39;s barely May and I can feel that this year is going to be a record low for trans people and I can only hope that people out there see how much it hurts us. I cry for my brothers, sisters, and nonbinary siblings. I fear for their safety. I fear for their lives. I know I would have killed myself if I had to wait until I was 18 to start testosterone. Even waiting for 2 years after hitting puberty (when I first began experiencing body dysphoria) was so distressing that I tried to kill myself, and the only reason I didn&#39;t was because my sister hid everything I could&#39;ve easily hurt myself with, and I didn&#39;t want to fail and have to explain to my family what had happened. And my mom and two sisters were incredibly supportive, my dad was not. I had support and I still wanted to die. I can only imagine what other trans people are going through, and how many of them will die because of laws passed that target them. Lawmakers claim that they&#39;re protecting children from permanent harm by preventing them from taking hormones until the age of 18. You know what&#39;s far more permanent and far more harmful? Death. Most of the effects from HRT can be reversed with no additional effort. Hormones do not make you sterile. In fact I get my period if I go long enough without doing my T shot. I&#39;m getting off topic but I just.. Please be aware of how much these laws are hurting us. Please be aware of how much danger we&#39;re in. I&#39;m one of the lucky ones that are soon going to be 18. But even I don&#39;t feel safe, because there&#39;s already so many loopholes in laws that are meant to protect me. Please don&#39;t look the other way. The trans community is a vast minority compared to the cisgender population, we usually need representation from the privileged majority to be seen. Even as a white person in a first world country, I&#39;m afraid to walk alone no matter the time of day because I fear that if someone attacks me, nobody will help. Nobody will care. So many trans people, mostly trans women, are brutally murdered and nobody says their names. Nobody tries to find their murderers. It feels like no one cares. And now, not only are they not helping us, they&#39;re attacking us. I know I&#39;m just a stranger on the internet, but if I can open one person&#39;s eyes to the unique hardships trans people go through, I&#39;ll feel like I&#39;ve done something. The world doesn&#39;t have to be this way, we have the power to change it.

I have often felt the welling up of tears, but it takes me quite a bit to pass the barrier into crying. the times when I have cried, it was associated with moments where I felt the dispair/hoplessness/futility/helplessness of the situation in such a strong way that my rational brain couldn&#39;t identify a way for me to quanifty that in a way where I could go forward. instead, I took a moment to cry it out.\r<br>\r<br>as a correlary to this, I often times experience experience bursts of laughter when I receive emotion from someone else that I can&#39;t express in words, but it feels really funny to me. ever been to a party and a bunch of people are laughing really hard at a joke you totally didn&#39;t understand, but because it feels so fnnny, you laugh right along with them -- even though you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re laughing at?\r<br>\r<br>---\r<br>\r<br>it seems to me that the mechanism for both laughter and crying happens when you pass a threshold. before crying, there is that feeling of welling up, and before laughing there is also a buildup, where the smile on your face eventually passes to a laugh. this suggests to me that when you hear/see/experience something, it resonates with you and that either makes you feel good or bad (the basic emotional response/reaction). this reaction seems to come from your own perception, or how you interpret the thing that you just saw/heard/experienced.\r<br>\r<br>for example, yesterday a veritasium video came out with bill gates: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Grv1RJkdyqI?t=320\">https://youtu.be/Grv1RJkdyqI?t=320\r</a><br>\r<br>derek says, &quot;I&#39;ve got to say that as I was growing up and coming into this information age, it seems like the internet and all of these tools were going to make the correct information so much more easier to access -- and bring us into a more fact based world. instead, it doesn&#39;t look as though it&#39;s bringing us there.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>bill is clearly smiling and holding back laughter.\r<br>\r<br>this suggests to me that based on what I experience and what I postulate to be the mechanism for laughter, this seems to suggest that bill thinks derek&#39;s question is hilarious. he must have thought the information age bringing us to more fact-based world bit to be the setup for the punchline of &quot;it doesn&#39;t look as though it&#39;s bringing us there&quot; being the punchline.\r<br>\r<br>do not kill the messenger.

Specifically that high levels of testosterone suppress the ability to cry. I&#39;m a transgender woman, and before I started Hormone Replacement Therapy (&quot;still a boy&quot;) I cried extremely little. However, once I suppressed my testosterone and increased my estrogen I started to cry substantially more. There are countless sad movies that I had managed to watch and not cry before my transition, but end up sobbing when I watch them now. This is something that many of my trans woman friends have also noticed. On the other hand, when talking to many trans men, most of them say that it&#39;s harder to cry and they cry less often after starting to take testosterone. <br><br>I definitely believe the &quot;big boys don&#39;t cry&quot; mentality (a.k.a. toxic masculinity) has a big role to play too. I was told that a lot growing up, and remember plenty of times where I should&#39;ve cried but forced myself not to.
