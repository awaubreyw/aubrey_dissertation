His neck muscles have weakened to the point that he can\u2019t hold his head up and the left side of his body is weaker than the right , the doctors told me all his muscles were dead, he was able to eat via a machine because he could not swallow anything. I searched and tried different neurologists and different medicines none worked and I was so scared to lose my husband. While running up and down seeking a solution I met my friend from third grade and saw me all worked up, we got talking and in the process of discussion I told him all I am facing. He felt sad and told me about Dr. Hassan who was able to cure his cousin. I was interested and he gave me his contact. I contacted him and he sent me his medicine and in a space of 3 weeks he was up on his feet again and in 4 week he recovered fully. He can do normal things like walking, eating, without any assistance whatsoever. I am so amazed at the potency and effectiveness of his medicine.

Since I changed I had no progression and all symptoms went away. I also do yoga to stimulate and calm the nervous system. I don&#39;t know why doctors don&#39;t recommend and plant based diet for MS there are countless cases of people online like me who have done it and had great results. I refused the pills, adjusted my  diet and it was done. You can not cure something that is a symptom of lifestyle(diet and lack of excises) with a pill. And if you are interested in why this works it mostly has to do with a combination of leaky gut(intelligent one layer of cells in the colon) which is breached - THEN, animal and milk proteins enter the bloodstream and the body tries to remove it by producing antibodies which get those foreign proteins out of your blood THEN your brain and Myelin cells looks to the anti body like a foreign protein and attacks it. And if your brain blood barrier is breached that is how its gets the nerves in the brain. SO People here with MS like me - The most simple solution is to take out these proteins from the diet that resembles your own Mylene that would be Dairy and Meat then no more antibodies get made that attack your system. Step 2 heal your leaky gut and blood brain barrier. You can eat a easy to digest foods and foods that help heal the gut, pre and probiotics daily for many months to heal the gut. Cooked easy to digest vegan meal for the first part to heal the gut. For the brain blood barrier I took catalase and quercetin supplements. And for general health I took  and still take 1000mg x2 daily liposomal Vitamin C. Not normal vitamin C, as it is not good for the gut you are trying to heal. I take 10000 IU vitamin D  and a b vitamin complex too. These supplenments and the huge diet change of going completely vegan is/was my cure. If you are serious about getting well I recommend to do a 5-7 days water fast too, as I did and I now eat only between 12-8pm daily so the blood and body has time to clean and heal (intermittent fasting) It takes time to adjust and I don&#39;t recommend doing all the changes at once as you will fail. It is hard to go vegan and do the fasting but better than sitting in a wheelchair for me personally. I have never felt better and have lost 13kg in 3 months. Just a little side note about diet. I did read about the ketogenic diet and how it helps, i tried it for 3 months and was miserable I realized that the issue was meat and dairy. Then changed to a high carb vegan diet and this makes you happy. I eat whole pasta, rice, grains I mean who does not like eating carb rich meals twice a day and still loosing weight and being healthy. You need to watch and limit fat in the diet while healing too and use the correct fats. I eat 2 things that are not vegan 1 honey and 2 ghee due to Ayurveda, limit sugar and eat whole foods not a junk food vegan diet. one more thing for your gut to heal from Ayurveda that is simple to do is not drinking 30mins before a meal and 1 hour after a meal. During you can drink 1-2small glasses of water this helps the stomach acid to digest better and not be diluted. Its a small change that makes a big difference... IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING BETTER (IN MY OPINION HEALING) MS TRY THIS NO MATTER HOW HARD. IT WORKS FOR ME AND EVEN OTHER DOCTORS. VEGAN DIET AND FASTING IS LIKE A RESET AND WORKS...

My neurologist sent for me soon after, gave me an MRI and evoked potential (to find my trigger, it is stress). I had to go into hospital for a couple of days for monitoring, blood tests and a lumbar puncture. Had to get tested for something called CADASIL (genetic :( ). Came back all clear, apart from altered wbc.
