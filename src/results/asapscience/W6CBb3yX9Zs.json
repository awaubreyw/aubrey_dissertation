This man had once been brought to the scaffold in company with several others, and had had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some political crime. Twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and some other punishment substituted; but the interval between the two sentences, twenty minutes, or at least a quarter of an hour, had been passed in the certainty that within a few minutes he must die. I was very anxious to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful time, and I several times inquired of him as to what he thought and felt. He remembered everything with the most accurate and extraordinary distinctness, and declared that he would never forget a single iota of the experience. \u2018About twenty paces from the scaffold, where he had stood to hear the sentence, were three posts, fixed in the ground, to which to fasten the criminals (of whom there were several). The first three criminals were taken to the posts, dressed in long white tunics, with white caps drawn over their faces, so that they could not see the rifles pointed at them. Then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post. My friend was the eighth on the list, and therefore he would have been among the third lot to go up. A priest went about among them with a cross: and there was about five minutes of time left for him to live. \u2018He said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most interminable period, an enormous wealth of time; he seemed to be living, in these minutes, so many lives that there was no need as yet to think of that last moment, so that he made several arrangements, dividing up the time into portions\u2014one for saying farewell to his companions, two minutes for that; then a couple more for thinking over his own life and career and all about himself; and another minute for a last look around. He remembered having divided his time like this quite well. While saying good- bye to his friends he recollected asking one of them some very usual everyday question, and being much interested in the answer. Then having bade farewell, he embarked upon those two minutes which he had allotted to looking into himself; he knew beforehand what he was going to think about. He wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly as possible, that here was he, a living, thinking man, and that in three minutes he would be nobody; or if somebody or something, then what and where? He thought he would decide this question once \r<br>for all in these last three minutes. A little way off there stood a church, and its gilded spire glittered in the sun. He remembered staring stubbornly at this spire, and at the rays of light sparkling from it. He could not tear his eyes from these rays of light; he got the idea that these rays were his new nature, and that in three minutes he would become one of them, amalgamated somehow with them. \u2018The repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately, and the uncertainty, were dreadful, he said; but worst of all was the idea, \u2018What should I do if I were not to die now? What if I were to return to life again? What an eternity of days, and all mine! How I should grudge and count up every minute of it, so as to waste not a single instant!\u2019 He said that this thought weighed so upon him and became such a terrible burden upon his brain that he could not bear it, and wished they would shoot him quickly and have done with it.\u2019\u00b9\u2077", "comment_date": "2022-07-29T17:08:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bakhtiyar", "comment_text": "Set your screen time to 1hr/day and see how your life will change.

Dopamine adds transitory utility or value to moment to moment decisions and is harmful to decision making when it is not aligned with long term goals, as we well know by succumbing daily to social media, emails, and other distractors. The best way to eliminate distraction is to pursue activities that have more significant affective outcomes, or to artificially engineer them due to the unique ways incentive motivation works in the human brain. To demonstrate this latter point here is an easy procedure to manage motivation and eliminate distraction.<br>Simply follow a simple resting protocol (mindfulness procedure is best for this), and simultaneously pursue or anticipate pursuing meaningful behavior (e.g. cleaning house, writing poetry, exercise, etc.). Do this continuously for standard sessions of a least a half hour and chart your progress. As a result, you will be more pleasurably alert, engaged, and incented to continue being productive and resist distraction. Neurologically, this is due to \u2018opioid-dopamine\u2019 interactions, or the fact that rest is pleasurable due to the induction of opioid activity in the brain. Meaningful activity on the other hand induces dopaminergic activity, which is felt as a state of alert arousal but NOT pleasure. Opioid and dopamine neurons are located adjacently in the midbrain, and when both are simultaneously activated will also co-stimulate each other, resulting in enhanced feelings of arousal and pleasure. Indeed, when rest is accompanied by highly meaningful behaviors (creating art, athletic achievement), pleasure and alertness are highly accentuated, resulting in \u2018peak\u2019 or \u2018flow\u2019 experiences.

We spend more than half our days there, reading and writing books, that lead to bad eye vision and neck and hand pain.<br>     Every student learns &quot;everything&quot; the same way and that means that a &quot;bad&quot; student would need a little bit of time just to catch up. And you can&#39;t develop and learn your passion this way. We are so locked up and have a lot of tasks to do that we don&#39;t even have time to clean our noses. Did you know that schools haven&#39;t changed for more that 1 and a half century?! And they say &quot;School prepares students for the future&quot;, but your lessons haven&#39;t changed for forever, so do you prepare students for the future or the past?<br>     And this is my proof:<br>Imagine you just finished homework and thought of hanging out with friends, and then you look out the window and you see the dark sky with a bright moon and no cars or signs of movement. You look up at the clock and realised that everyone was sleeping. And THEN you got your phone and started watching pewds because of how addicted to dank memes you are. And then you fell asleep.

Having to talk with people all the time 24/7 drains me out.  I enjoy reading but I also would like to do something else, like a game, but play on my own.  Solitare gets boring after a while so I&#39;ll fire up Azur Lane or a game on Steam on my computer.  Once I finish the latest installment in a light novel or manga series, rereading right away gets dull.  Things like video games fill empty time for me that I could be spending staring at a wall.  Once things like a job take over, I probably won&#39;t be able to be playing games all the time.  TL;DR I have no life so a phone or computer keeps me occupied independantly.<br><br>Of course, I can hold a conversation just fine.  I just choose not to engage.  Never experienced social anxiety or depression, either.  And sure, I might go talk with someone now and again but it&#39;s not something I spend my leisure time doing usually.<br><br>My final gripe is that I use technology often to escape reality.  The life I lead is relatively..dull so stories and games help bring to life another, more interesting, world.  The minute I have to leave this paradise is the worst part of my day.  Now before you go and say, &quot;If your life is so dull why don&#39;t you go and explore outside or meet new people?&quot;  Re-read my post.  As a minor, it&#39;s difficult to ever dream of exploring the world on my own without a chest of cash and ambition.  Meeting new people doesn&#39;t typically bring anything exciting either.

I also felt more focused on my daily tasks and conversations. Even my mood improved a little. Also I felt this very comfy sensation of &quot;having enough time for everything&quot;: cooking, cleaning, reading a book, et cetera... since I didn&#39;t have to watch a screen every 15 minutes, therefore, not having to interrupt any activity. No more phone updates, ringtones, playing the newest game from the App store. It was like freedom. <br><br>After two weeks, my quality of sleep highly improved and I became more confident to talk to new people and hanging out. I nearly aborted my project after day 19 due to pressure from friends and family, who started telling me they were getting worried &quot;about not seeing me worried by this experiment&quot; or &quot;not giving them likes or sending them smilies&quot;. Priceless. The benefits of not using a cellphone vs using one were becoming real, so I just carried on. Everytime I was in need of information, just asked people or went to the library (yeah, those places still exist). An adress? Asked people on street. Some of them looked at me like &quot;Use Waze and stop bothering me&quot;. I just smiled at them. Also, no more &quot;pay everything or do transactions&quot; with phone. Started paying bills the good ol&#39; way: bank agents. Bloody hell... I even started to enjoy talking with them.<br><br>After three weeks, I decided to go further: no more social media nor television. No more pics nor selfies. Whenever I started a conversation at work about the things I was discovering... I slowly started to feel how sterile and trivial the conversations were, always talking about that new viral video and its derivations. At one point, I told myself &quot;Damn, these people are boring and totally laughing thanks to the same old jokes, memes and hashtags&quot;. It felt like waking up from a monotonous nightmare.<br><br>Day 30 came and I just began to charge my phone in the morning. Reached my goal.

they are and actually be social and talk to people and learn to have fun without a phone, it&#39;s also leading people to be antisocial and depressed, without a phone you need to go and do stuff and meet people to not be bored, with a phone you have stuff to do but then you never learn to talk to people and then you wind up feeling lonely, it happened to me, I really hope soon humanity starts to
