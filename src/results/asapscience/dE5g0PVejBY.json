Aluminum is used in some vaccines and excess aluminum in human bodies can cause neurological harm.  Formaldehyde, also found in some vaccines, is a carcinogen, and, according to <a href=\"http://vaxtruth.org/\">VaxTruth.org</a>, exposure can cause side effects such as cardiac impairment, central nervous system depression, &quot;changes in higher cognitive functions,&quot; coma, convulsions, and death. Glutaraldehyde, a compound used to disinfect medical and dental equipment, is used in some DTaP vaccinations and exposure can cause asthma and other respiratory issues. Some flu vaccines contain cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMB), a compound used as an antiseptic, which can be a skin, eye, and respiratory irritant. Some polio, TD, and DTaP vaccines contain 2-phenoxyethanol, an antibacterial that is a skin and eye irritant that can cause headaches, shock, convulsions, kidney damage, cardiac and kidney failure, and death. Some vaccines for the flu contain chicken egg protein, which can be harmful to children who are allergic to eggs. Some vaccines for PCV, HPV, DTaP, Hep A, Hep B, and Hib contain yeast proteins which, according to VaxTruth and Joseph Mercola, MD, an alternative medicine proponent, contain MSG that can cause migraines, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), asthma, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, ADD, seizure, stroke and According to the CDC, all vaccines carry a risk of a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) in about one per million children. The rotavirus vaccination can cause intussusception, a type of bowel blockage that may require hospitalization, in about one per 20,000 babies in the United States. [49] Long-term seizures, coma, lowered consciousness, and permanent brain damage may be associated with the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) and MMR vaccines, though the CDC notes the rarity of the reaction makes it difficult to determine causation. The CDC reports that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, and a &quot;small possibility&quot; exists that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, a disorder in which the person\u2019s immune system attacks parts of the peripheral nervous system, in about one or two per million people vaccinated. The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) says that vaccines may be linked to learning disabilities, asthma, autism, diabetes, chronic inflammation, and other disabilities. Yet listen to this, medical decisions for children should be left to the parents or caregivers. Barbara Loe Fisher, Co-founder of National Vaccine Information Center, stated, &quot;If the State can tag, track down and force citizens against their will to be injected with biological products of known and unknown toxicity today, there will be no limit on which individual freedoms the State can take away in the name of the greater good tomorrow.&quot;  Ron Paul, MD, former US Representative (R-TX), stated, &quot;intimately personal medical decisions should not be made by government\u2026 Freedom over one\u2019s physical person is the most basic freedom of all, and people in a free society should be sovereign over their own bodies. When we give the government the power to make medical decisions for us, we, in essence, accept that the state owns our bodies.", "comment_date": "2019-10-02T04:19:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "[milk n\u2019 cookies]", "comment_text": "I died from.<br><b>sadness</b>", "comment_date": "2019-09-23T01:00:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ded", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE5g0PVejBY&amp;t=2m22s\">2:22</a> shitloads of ppl are probs salty bout that.", "comment_date": "2019-08-21T21:55:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suhasini Bellary", "comment_text": "I want to diee", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T07:44:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wafaa Alkhateeb", "comment_text": "2019 anyone?", "comment_date": "2019-07-28T01:16:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NBS Bryan", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t know <br><br><br><br><br><br>And I don\u2019t want to know", "comment_date": "2019-07-19T02:36:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bob The Bear", "comment_text": "...the answer for me is suicide", "comment_date": "2019-07-19T01:00:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XxJayxX", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE5g0PVejBY&amp;t=3m20s\">3:20</a> what about suicide?

It sounds like it was saying do not fear being killed on a bike but fear more of being killed as a pedestrian. That would, in my opinion, maybe be wrong as we can not use only the data of number of deaths to determine the risk of safety for each mode of travel. And this is because we need to know the entire data.. including the amount of pedestrain traffic and its percent of deaths compared to those who survive... and compare it to the percent of deaths of bikers.... we can use a regression analysis or some sort of statistical analysis.
