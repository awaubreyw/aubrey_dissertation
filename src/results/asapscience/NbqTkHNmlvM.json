But this story helped me through a tough time. <br><br><br>Once there was a Chinese farmer who worked his poor farm together with his son and their horse. When the horse ran off one day, neighbors came to say, \u201cHow unfortunate for you!\u201d The farmer replied, \u201cMaybe yes, maybe no.\u201d<br><br>When the horse returned, followed by a herd of wild horses, the neighbors gathered around and exclaimed, \u201cWhat good luck for you!\u201d The farmer stayed calm and replied, \u201cMaybe yes, maybe no.\u201d<br>While trying to tame one of wild horses, the farmer\u2019s son fell, and broke his leg. He had to rest up and couldn\u2019t help with the farm chores. \u201cHow sad for you,\u201d the neighbors cried. \u201cMaybe yes, maybe no,\u201d said the farmer.<br>Shortly thereafter, a neighboring army threatened the farmer\u2019s village. All the young men in the village were drafted to fight the invaders. Many died. But the farmer\u2019s son had been left out of the fighting because of his broken leg. People said to the farmer, \u201cWhat a good thing your son couldn\u2019t fight!\u201d \u201cMaybe yes, maybe no,\u201d was all the farmer said.<br><br><br>On and on it goes. What is the point? Well There is no good, there is no bad, there just is. If you think with your feeble human mind that you have the ability to discern between what is good for you and what is bad for you, you&#39;ve missed it. You&#39;ve missed the beauty in life.
