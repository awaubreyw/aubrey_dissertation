If they came from a human then give them the rights you would give a human, if they came from a pig then you should not have any difficulty with that thing, if it came from a frog then the animal rights that apply to a frog should apply to this robot. But because the way that these cells are combined with other cells is the only thing that humans actually partook in, then something tells me that this would be akin to surgery. In surgery a doctor that has never done anything that directly or indirectly affected the life of the patient, if they do open heart surgery they are changing the position of the heart cells, then the cells will fuse together. Like the cells of the frogs being removed from their initial position and then fusing together because of human intervention, the researchers took them from pre-existing frogs, if they were the ones to bread these frogs from two other frogs and on top of this oh, the only things that went into their bodies were things that were pre-approved by the researchers. Then this in my opinion would be a true living robot, besides taking every single protein and painstakingly applying them together, or genetically Engineering in organism using crisper. But the point remains that the only things going into that thing would have to come from the researchers. That is what I would consider to truly be something that was made by man, not something that man had changed. In this case they would not have taken some cells from a frog they found in the wild, remove them from the initial position in the Frog, and then reposition then in a manner that caused them to fuse. No, this scenario means that they put into the frogs what the frogs are made out of, they are are the people who allowed those frogs to be born, and all the things that they put into them would then be what form the Frog. This would mean that that the frog is entirely made out of what the researchers had approved, this means that they truly made it, then when they take these cells and do to them what day did to the real frog cells. This would be something that would be truly man-made, and it&#39;s organic, this would be alive, this is a true living room, if you&#39;re going to call this thing that they did in real life a living robot, then open heart surgery that has been completely successful would be a robot, even if a whole calendar year past. But this, this is like surgery, they did surgery to the frogs that were not consenting and had no health issues, but let&#39;s ignore that, they did surgery to the frogs, the surgery caused pieces of living tissue to come off a lot of the cells removed in surgery may indeed be living individual cells. And there is a literal surgery where living cells, which would then be classified as tissue would be moved from one point of the body to another. This is like what&#39;s going on here, it&#39;s still part of the body because it&#39;s a different grouping of cells from the Frog, and it&#39;s being removed like a skin graft, this is a skin graft with included muscle, and the thing about rights, personally I think it would make sense not that it is necessarily the right way to go about it, but it would make sense to you give the uses xenobots the rights that would go to whatever organism their cells are harvested from. However if they were to be born from Human intervention, all of their bodies were composed of things that were deliberately put their size humans, and their entire bodies are made of the stuff that researchers allowed, then this would mean that they were entirely created by humans, on top of this because not only was their birth done that way but also their literal composition, by making these organisms into xenobots, perhaps under these conditions may be the thing about rights given to the organism the species that they belong to can be ignored. Well if you are working on the right thing for the right government and are doing it for the right reason and are given the right resources then things like that aren&#39;t really an issue are they.", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T20:13:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RLegend Official", "comment_text": "If you can give a robot consciousness. <br>It would definitely be alive .

We have too many narrow educated so called experts and their fun boys. Academia seems to be able to sell anything to general public if they only say that it cures cancer or some other disease. People are stupid enough to believe this shit. We have corrupted every single thing and action ever made. We are unable to handle emotions, we live in fear, stress, we are tired and depressed. Pollution, chemicals, radiation, drugs and pills addiction, poverty, war and crime are the reality. We do not need any robots to heal cancer. We do need honest human beings . Science is the worst whore known to men. Average academic doesn&#39;t have developed emotional competence or cultural identity and integrity. It appears to me that we have even lost the ability to recognize cause and effect and correct the mistakes. We claim to stand for peace so we produce weapons. We respect life so we kill animals and test radiation effects to nativ tribal people. We respect the privacy so we spy on everyone. We obey the truth and honesty, so we create secret services. We teach facts and  we hate lies, so we need  institutions of public relations, think tanks, censorship and some secret projects.We fight for good this is why we secret agents and infiltration and coups. We are logical and reasonable wie act rational with best intends, therefor we cut rainforest and throw garbage into oceans and we steal resources. We imprison people which reveal truth, we ridicule people with different opinions. God damn , only fools can accept and support present day narrative. We produce garbage technology and stupid commercial poisonous dump. Each single action we take can be influenced by money and power. Intelligent mind don&#39;t need any degree in rocket science to analyze the structure of the society and recognize the dynamics and repeating patterns. Today you do not need any sinister scientist experimenting on human beings , we have so little of resistance that we accept every kind of crap they want to sell. You ask few crucial questions about possible negative consequences of it but still, you do not have alternative opinions. You lack insight into the academic community and its nature. There is ton of different opinions and understandings of reality. If you recognize that science is not any sort of romantic self correcting altruistic community of honest and dedicated people, rather hierarchy of authorities and commercial interrests and agendas. Research is subject to restriction and special interests. Science need money, this is factor controlled by military, corporations, rich individuals and governments. There is very little independent science. Only profitable research get support.  General public cannot be introduced to strategic technologies or be informed about geopolitical strategical goals and actions. To avoid any unity and organization by citizens to act as one body, disinformation, competition, specialization, individualism and short living technology designed to be.frequently replaced. People need to understand that we already understand how to cure human body and much more. It will be revealed only to the new kind of humanity. I believe that trans humanism is the ideology of elites. What we call pandemic is the new tool to create this new kind of man.  Man relying to pseudoscience, controlled by restricting access to resources and dependent on corporations. Man should percept humanity as problem, kind of desease in need for cure. In this way everyone controls another one. <br>Next time they offer cure for some major decease, think about how many jobs and products are linked to it and would stop to create profit. Ask yourself if healthy society somehow is beneficial to the system. Do not trust or believe what they say is true, do not disbelieve either. There is no way for us to really proof or disprove science but we can perfectly determine what they say and what they do and understand motivations and logical fallacies. General public is mostly confronted to scientific oversimplifications and commercial dialectic. It presents itself as authority and follows the doctrine of objective atomistic material universe. See, we can not know what we don&#39;t know, therefore what we think we know could be also wrong. If we postulate that something is proven by science as truth,<br>then no other alternative can be accepted. If something is right and truth then there is wrong and false as necessity . This thinking leads to blind religion. If truth can be understood by science, then all other claims are antiscoience.  There are many subtile restrictions caused by linguistic patterns and philosophical infantility. Observe, measure, repeat is nice idea but can not stand the reality. It should be the tool but not  limitation or instrument of exclusion The most important : know that you only can be wrong so be precise that others can find errors. Understanding that descriptions are not explanations is crucial. Gravity for example is not attraction, it is what it does not what it is.  We mostly observe effects without knowing what is the cause of it.  <br>If there is no opposition in science, something is wrong. Our mechanical conceptions of living systems treating us with  chemical drugs and causing horrible side effects should now put robots", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T08:36:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Tyler", "comment_text": "And science once again provides proof of Intelligent Design.", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T23:35:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meliodas.assault", "comment_text": "Little joke the begging of cell", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T21:25:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darkcloud Barrett", "comment_text": "Humanoid robots have been here for years now.", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T12:27:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "booty warrior", "comment_text": "the humans are evolving we are gods yes yes YES", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T05:18:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ioganstone", "comment_text": "So according to this video, the best definition of life (as non reproducing cells) is going to be from a Microsoft funded experimental technology/mesearch project, the Allen Discovery Center (Michael Levin) or Josh Bongard who did the study and made the claim first, a prof with a Computer Science degree.

I believe that He died <br>for my sin and that you raised Him to life.<br>I want to trust Him as my Savior and follow Him as Lord,<br>from this day forward.

Furries might end up getting fleas or may get diseases or stuff that animals get, so they would have to be treated. Furries will be very unique just like how many people are different. Furries should be made, maybe they can help us as they would have animal senses such as better hearing or smelling. We might have to try and fix their instincts if it becomes a thing as predators attack. We would have to find a way to get them to not attack. Furries as cops is cool because we have police dogs so we might end up having furries help with what the dogs do. Furries might end up causing a few problems such as protesting for animal lives or being as equal as humans, or they might have diseases or stuff so it would be very interesting.

For example, mechanical limbs, they could create a mechanical skeleton, which would connect directly with a biological brain, if they can create such a thing. <br>       Because that way it is technically alive, as it uses the brain to make its own decisions, but uses the skeleton like a human would use a mechanical limb. Which is different to a robot, with a metal, programmed \u201cbrain\u201d. It might be able to make its own decisions, but it\u2019s still programmed in the end. So that wouldn\u2019t be classed as living? But if the main part of the decision making \u201cpart\u201d (like a brain), was biological, then to me, that\u2019s technically alive. They could also fit these new \u201chuman robots\u201d with brain chips, to help them connect to devices, but with also human like thinking, however, with this comes issues, as humans have issues as it is. But a \u201crobot\u201d is programmed, and only made to do what it has been programmed to do, however, this can be altered, or even the robot itself could justify something that we would find, not acceptable. So for me, it\u2019s just weighing the pros and cons, and whether they would give a \u201chuman robot\u201d actual rights, as it would technically be alive, unlike a \u201crobot\u201d. <br><br>Sorry if it doesn\u2019t make sense, I tried my best. :)", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T20:12:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bloblo", "comment_text": "oh no", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T20:02:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Matt Yates", "comment_text": "I feel like the scientists that named this was a fan of the Alien franchise.", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T19:55:29Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Duke Catfish Junior", "comment_text": "maybe it&#39;s possible to reconstruct a fully functional living eyes to make people born blind see? that would be amazing.", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T19:43:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sharbel", "comment_text": "And you tell me corona is &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;unintentional&quot; and &quot;NOT-human-made&quot; pllleeeaase", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T19:26:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Janssens", "comment_text": "So artificial life?this stuff is dangerous", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T19:25:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sharbel", "comment_text": "So we do not controll them?

Aside from existing in literature since who knows when, biocomputers have existed for decades, and genetic engineering (reprogramming of living organisms) has existed for centuries. They have many medical, culinary, et cetera applications which we reap the benefits of here in the USA (and so far as I know Europe, Australia, and other parts of the developed world too) in almost every aspect of our healthcare and genetically modified food. <br><br>The type you\u2019re calling \u201cliving robots\u201d are called Biomechanical Computers. The majority of the applications you\u2019re referring to have been possible for years, only the use of programable human cells; AKA stem cells; and any form of genetic modification of animals; such as using stem cells to create more of the persons own cells that fight off cancer and disease; is illegal (last I checked). The official reason being some drivel about disrespecting God. <br><br>In the early 2000s the news stations all showed a montage of a veterans entire finger growing back over several treatments with stem cells before they were made illegal and the research censored. The discovery of how to create stem cells in a lab was exciting... until it was made illegal with basically no chance of that ever changing. I can\u2019t believe you thought this was like some new discovery, next you\u2019re going to tell me you\u2019ve never heard of biohackers or cyborgs hahaha. Hell nowadays it might be cheaper for me to just genetically modify my own multicolored fluorescent bacteria than to buy decoration lights and pay the extra in the electricity bills. I could probably find biohackers with the stuff I need online, easily since biohacking (private genetic engineering) isn\u2019t technically illegal (yet).", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T10:53:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Satifactory Meat Stick Of Your Very Doom And While You Were Reading This I Stole Your Meats", "comment_text": "Ah yes, the reapers.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T10:44:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Geno Breaker", "comment_text": "I had an idea for a sci-fi concept a couple years ago, based on organic nano bots.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T09:29:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wemikouss g", "comment_text": "So one caveat is that every single cell in your body in fact has it&#39;s own intelligence.

The problem that\u2019s doing my head in, and this is a fascinating subject, but I\u2019m kind of thinking, these simple cells have a form of memory to instruct itself what is their form and what is their purpose and would grow into, right? However, when the guy in this video said about cells have the knack to stick together, there\u2019s where my brain kind of panic, and I\u2019m trying to understand my brain\u2019s sudden alert going off because, I\u2019m thinking if these individual cells began sticking together, there\u2019s room for a really bad and dangerous opportunity that could endanger every other living beings. What I mean by this, if there\u2019s a Petri dish with both heart cell and skin cell, the scientist is working their magic to hybrid those two cells, which will mean the one hybrid cell will share both memories of the heart and skin into that living cell, but what if that Petri dish was contaminated, say by airborne cells that came from that scientist working on Petri dish? Things can happen, and what is scary is if that Petri dish was contaminated by miscellaneous cells, those cells will also have memory of instruction for them to become what they are meant to be, but now communicating that to the already living hybrid cell, and so begin the nightmare. Those scientists may think that they know how that Xenobot operates, but then look at cancer, some develop from cells who are supposedly live-programmed to behave a certain way and to grow a certain way, but cancer disrupt that programming... man, now my brain is hurting from thinking too hard, but scientists shouldn\u2019t underestimate and suggest cells are simple, far from it. For example, conception is suppose to be the beginning to new life, right? Well, why in some women, the supposedly conceived embryo turns into molar tumour that can lead to cancer?

There seem to be some sort of combinations that form universal limits to the types of recombinate organisms our region of the universe will accept. The research is non-scientific but worth considering. The hypnosis evidence derived from many deep trance somnambulistic case studies include cases that relate to parts of your interesting video. (1) People who recall former life as a robot. Here there are cases involving a range of vivid memories from various cases. Karmic Drudgery of being unable to escape an ever repeated assigned task as a karmic debt for having built \u201cthinking-conscious\u201d machines in his former life, all the way to noble adventure and struggle to continue to explore until it could go no further. This latter case was a woman who\u2019s consciousness experienced itself as one of our Lunar Robots - (it may have been a Mars surface robot but the case is an old case so it had to be early in our public record.. that or some kind of secret early trip). The karmic drudgery case was strange in that the engineer robot builder was not building biologic components, nonetheless his robots were each vested with a piece of his own soul energy and they each were subjected to an unintentional drudgery of having immense awareness yet unable to escape, until they wore out and were destroyed. <br><br>(2) This other group is more troubling. This group was first encountered by a man hypnotized and regressed into a former life where the hypnotist had a difficult time calming him down so he could talk. After he understood he was not being activated for another Earth mission he began explaining his activation role and why he was deeply concerned. His role if required once again.... as best as we could tell... was to serve on Earth as an energy anchor point. His last mission was apparently carried out by him and others on Atlantis to end Atlantis for unacceptable recombinate mutations used solely for entertainment by humans. While there are many theories just as valid on what ended Atlantis, this intelligent anchor point transient energy from a higher cosmic judgment, was cited as the underlying reason for ending Atlantis. The reasoning does not seem to match up well with the spiritual science of Rudolf Steiner who&#39;s work suggests Atlantis ended to make way for the great post-Atlantian spiritual evolution of mankind a sub-sub-phase of which we are transiting right now.  I will explain later what was so abhorrent to the natural universal cosmic order if anyone is interested; what I will use the balance of this paragraph to say is that we heard from this one case client, there are several souls sprinkled across Earth at any given time that are here as energy anchors. If they are called upon to activate, even they are greatly saddened. Some sort of cosmic energy flows through them into the Earth and entire geologic plates become destabilized leading to a cataclysmic morphing of the surface of the planet. The lesson here is he was very clear on his last mission that the Atlanteans were so self-indulgent, pleasure seekers, they were entertaining themselves with gladiator-mutant, arena fights to an extreme, some sort of mere entertainment pleasure feast causing great suffering. Another practice on the other hand that seemed very nice, and I\u2019m sorry it even comes up, as it would probably help humanity not hurt. they used orgasim experience when saying hello (without bodily contact) to each other. That to me would seem like an ultimate sacrament in saying hello so maybe it was not the precipitating issue. But it does show they had advanced mental powers. There were many survivors from Atlantis integrated into all of society. Several case studies relate to Atlantian survivors. Many knew the end of Atlantis was coming and prepared. While there are no cases of current beings retaining these ancient Atlantean  powers, the main case that uncovered these few individuals who serve as energy grounding rods, are with us apparently all the time... even right now.  Some sort of higher power knows everything going on. The hypnosis cases are real, it\u2019s not acceptable science, but keep in mind that many cases turn up the same experiences describing identical features. We write all this off as  &quot;the collective archetypal experience&quot; ... you know, the C. G. Jung thing. But I have read and cross referenced and participated in many hundreds of cases having some small experience with the process myself and amazed how real it is to meet your spirit guide. It&#39;s a full-on reality, sort of like this: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LhIpWcXJIPc\">https://youtu.be/LhIpWcXJIPc</a>  My spirit guide is an ancient, robust, lovable 40-something-ish year old Greek male in white linen rob and sandals. He doesn\u2019t quite look like Socrates. And has a charming sense of the dramatic, standing in a tunnel of light. Love that guy. Yet I\u2019m Irish not Greek. This all leads me to conclude there is a positive and a negative and the universe over time is telling us ... be the good you want to see ... the energy is love ... be careful how you play with it.

Shouldn&#39;t that be discussed, before we discuss if they should be attributed to willfully constructed things, that may or may not evolve into other things? <br>It might shed some light on these more basic questions, but at this stage, that is the only imaginable use of such questions of rights for something non-human. Any other form is not yet capable of speaking for themselves, so there is a lot of guesswork and interpretation involved.<br>For instance, what does &quot;feeling pain&quot; even mean, when we allow fishing on the basis that fish don&#39;t feel pain and humans report vastly different pain-thresholds and will in some experiments even choose to endure more discomfort in situations that defy logic..?<br><br>And is attributing a quite innocent-seeming &quot;right&quot; historically been any use to humans, if you cannot enforce it for everyone or chance the way people think? <br>Look at how the &quot;right to pursue happiness&quot; led to desctructive, uncontrolleable capitalism. It has even fed back into extremists beliefs. It  arguably provided less inequality, but on a much more massive scale. It also led to a more entrenched belief in race, both it&#39;s existence and importance, then even in the time when slaves were exploited. <br><br>Also, what kept plaguing me during this video: Why the emphasis on the value of the individual, while this value varies famously in different cultures? Who is deemed &quot;right&quot; here and for what reason, that you can actually back up with some facts or statistics?<br>Ethics break down really fast whenever you have to consider the lesser of two evils. <br>And I&#39;d argue that with human rights this is always the case at the moment. As we cannot even ensure all humans basic human rights, extending human rights to constructs seems like an overreaching discussion, that will very quickly descend into expressing non-factual sentiments and do nothing than reflect cultural biases about individuality and rights. <br>The more unenlightened responses may be interesting when studied statistically and with some detachment, but I see no scenario in which these questions will yield anything ground breaking or even mildly productive.", "comment_date": "2020-02-02T12:35:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kristine", "comment_text": "I hope I live long to witness something this wondrous to complete", "comment_date": "2020-02-02T12:30:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yetaloz", "comment_text": "Strange doesn&#39;t the xenobot form reasembles the form of necroa virus from plague inc?", "comment_date": "2020-02-02T11:51:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "31webseries", "comment_text": "Lots of good can come from this or we just created our own replacements.

I could strap a snake onto a turtles shell and lure the turtle to food, but that is not a robot.

We can literally create new life from life, we can clone life, we can genetically modify life to make it be almost whatever we want it to be, yet of course, humans being humans, we will and probably have already found a shit ton of ways to abuse this power. To do bad things with it... I mean the moral weight of it all is one thing, even if you do remove all the religious and personal beliefs and just look at it from a purely logical standpoint: if we can create living beings or organisms PERIOD, then they are really no different from all other forms of life. They can probably think, feel, and act just like all other advanced life on earth. Yet with each negative there are also positives. Perhaps we could clone animals in massive quantities to slaughter them (humanly or non humanly) for their resources and food, this could benifit mankind as a whole, solve world hunger even. but then the &quot;lesser&quot; beings, the animals, COULD live a pretty awful life. I like to think of the clone issue as how it was shown in the Star Wars The Clone Wars television series, where clones who all were living, breathing, feeling human beings were born for one singular purpose: to fight and die for a war they didnt understand and had no choice in weather or not they could fight in it. Pretty harsh and bleak take on things but i also feel it is the best representation of what a real life scenario would be like. And why do i focus on clones here so much? Becuase they arent any different from a completely new life form being made by humans playing god. They, like clones, still think and feel.. They&#39;re still living... So i just hope humanity doesnt treat them like a tool. Like slaves to their cause. Becuase history tells plenty of how we&#39;ve already done that before. It&#39;s nothing new.

What this boils down to is this: Energy.<br><br>Energy is able to make life AMAZING. Life LOVES energy and is an attempt to access as much of it as possible. Earthlings, who have (perhaps uniquely) evolved a transcendent consciousness, now have the ability to access millions of times more energy than biology alone was able to access. We also want more power, which is essentially the speed at which you can access energy to do work.<br><br>Unlimited energy and power essentially could make human life a Utopia. There are many problems we cannot solve currently because we are limited by this tiny trickle of energy and power we have, compared to the massive amounts we will have in the future. If you don&#39;t believe me, just look at how energy consumption has changed from 1920 to 2020! Electricity is still a VERY recent technology. Hell, we couldn&#39;t even support pocket phone computers, which we now all have, 20 years ago, because we didn&#39;t have good enough batteries back then. We really still don&#39;t have good batteries, yet, compared to what is coming. If the Green New Deal takes effect, our relationship to energy will accelerate a lot. We are going to get good at accessing energy and power and it can solve virtually all of problems, if we do it right, since we are also getting Quantum Computers and A.I. Essentially, once you have those working, you can just throw more energy at any problem and get more powerful answers, thus solving all your issues, if you do it right.<br><br><br>BUT, there is this unfortunate corollary: access to large amounts of energy and power also gives you the ability to do great damage physically. If you use this energy as a weapon, you end up becoming like the Empire in Star Wars: the Death Star is just a really concentrated source of energy and has the ability to generate large amounts of power. This allows it to destroy entire planets.<br><br>But more generally:<br><br><br>more power = more destructive weapons.<br><br><br>But we aren&#39;t going to live like cavepeople. We already worked hard to get to this place, and the price was already a potential nuclear holocaust that could literally destroy EVERY SINGLE HUMAN ON THE PLANET. We live DAILY with this reality right now, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s pretty scary when we elect a crazy man to be president.<br><br>But we aren&#39;t going to go back to being cavepeople. Sorry. It just isn&#39;t much fun to live like that.<br><br>So we MUST PASS AN INTERNATIONAL BAN ON WEAPONIZING ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY, period.<br><br>That means, we will still have guns and all the weapons we have developed so far. But new technology should be OUTRIGHT banned from weaponizing. The penalties should be stiff for this.<br><br>That one act would solve most of our troubles going forward, to the extent we integrate it into our culture, worldwide, as well. We have done similarly for chemical and biological weapons. Although terroristic groups still occasionally utilize them, as a planet, we are not particularly under threat of them as we once were.<br><br>Next will be nuclear weapons.<br><br>But we should STOP ALL NEW WEAPONIZATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY going forward. It&#39;s the only way to be sure.<br><br>Otherwise, this ability to destroy human life in a few seconds will only grow worse and worse and we&#39;ll have the ability to blow up planets or destroy all life on earth before we know it.", "comment_date": "2020-01-26T21:17:14Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Hernandez", "comment_text": "Bro were literally just playing god here.

If we are able to further our understanding and better manipulate the behavior of those cell-stacks, then we may be able to do some of the things mentioned in the video, such as use them to clear blocked arteries or assist in removing damaged tissue ie cancer tumors, etc.<br><br>What I don&#39;t agree with is the overdramatizing terminology of calling them robots. It&#39;s said that scientists made use of heart and skin cells from frogs. If so, then those cells are alive in the first place, and putting 2 different types of cells doesn&#39;t suddenly make a robot. It&#39;s literally how tissues are made, by combining multiple cells in a way that individually, they each serve their own purpose, and collectively they are able to perform a greater function by their collective efforts. In this case, the skin cells may provide mass and weight as a sort of center of gravity while the heart cells contract and propel the cell mass. <br><br>With regards to the matter of debating ethics, and whether the newly formed cell masses have rights, I&#39;m going with a definite &quot;no&quot;. Those cell masses have no consciousness whatsoever, which is the main point and end goal of the experiment, if I&#39;m not mistaken. The scientists are trying to create something that can be made to behave exactly like is desired, and this behavior is ultimately intended to be replicable. I can imagine it like this: we humans can &quot;will&quot; our fingers to flex.
