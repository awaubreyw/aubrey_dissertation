A lot of people are just waiting for any excuse to justify sleeping around and this video feels like it\u2019s left out a lot of information regarding the pros and cons \u201cOf both sides\u201d. It doesn\u2019t state the pros of a monogamous relationship and the type of monogamous relationship mentioned here is one that involves cheating (which is why there is a \u201chigher chance of STIs). Secondly, it doesn\u2019t consider how the relationship affects their life when they want to start a family. Another point is that they  kind of make it seem like \u201cjust because it was done in the past, it is the correct thing to do now\u201d, which is just not true. Due to the fact that it is very complex, I feel like something like this shouldn\u2019t be compressed into a 3 minute video that is very open to interpretation, especially by young people that do not know any better.

You cannot have an open relationship if you don&#39;t talk about your wishes with your partner.

And we developed to control our basic &#39;animal-like&#39; instincts for a reason. There are practically ONLY two things that make us different than animals. And these are the capability of emotions and the ability to spend our life in a relationship with one person. In fact, these things are closely related and dependent on each other. If we take away emotions and the whole wide spectrum of human reactions caused by them: love, guilt, trust, sacrifice, regret, sadness, relief, devotion, commitment, disappointment.. we are nothing but animals, limited in their decision making, led by simple instincts of surviving and reproducing (here we have a link to polyamory). Emotions are in fact what makes us a more advanced form of living than animals. And it is the emotions that allow us to make that conscious choice to stay with one person for our entire life and be faithful to them<br>The fact that people in &#39;polyamorous relationships have more trust and less jealousy&#39; doesn&#39;t say anything positive about it - it just outlines the definition of what these relations are. Logically speaking, how can you actually be jealous when you fully consciously are allowing your partner to sleep with someone else while you are also doing the same thing? The definition of polyamory is that you are not faithful to one person so  to me, this is mutually exclusive with jealously. One of the top if not THE TOP reason for couples having the biggest arguments in their lifetimes is exactly that - jealousy and suspicion of cheating, whereas in polyamorous relations this reason doesn&#39;t exist. The whole &#39;positivity&#39; of polyamorous relationships probably comes from the fact that partners don&#39;t argue as much therefore theoretically their &#39;relationship outcome&#39; is more positive than for monogamous. It&#39;s like saying that apple tree is better than cherry tree because it doesn&#39;t grow cherries. It doesn&#39;t grow cherries from definition - because it is a freaking apple tree so there is no reason for it to grow cherries!
