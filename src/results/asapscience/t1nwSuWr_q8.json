There was a radio station in Sacramento several years ago that had a &quot;Hold your wee for a Wii&quot; contest, and one of the contestants died, despite the fact that nurses, doctors, and scientists were calling in telling them to stop the contest (the D.J.s just made fun of them). This kind of thing also happens during hazing for fraternities. There was also a case when a child spilled some juice on the floor, so as punishment her mother forced her to drink all the juice they had left, and when they ran out of that she forced her to continue drinking water until she died (sick bastard of a mother, if you ask me).
