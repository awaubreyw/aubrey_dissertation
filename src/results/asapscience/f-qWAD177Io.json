Think of it like giving them a knowledge injection!<br><br>Now if they\u2019re deep into some kind of community and obsessed with appearances and refuse to do something that goes against the group\u2026 there is literally nothing you can do, just don\u2019t even waste your time. I\u2019m not even joking.. <br>the SECOND they bring up Facebook or whatever, just walk away. It\u2019s not worth it. People would literally rather DIE than feel like they look bad to their group.. no amount of education and logic will help someone getting medical information from a MAGA group on Facebook and who gets all of their news in the form of minion memes. Just back away slowly. They have one foot on a landmine and you are NOT a bomb disposal expert. Just tip toe away quietly and save yourself! Seriously. Studies show that you literally cannot change beliefs that are constantly being reinforced. It\u2019s like killing a boss in a video game with instantly regenerating health.. you might make some headway but the second you stop talking with them, they check Facebook and reinforce their stance and ignore everything you just said. The only option is to remove them from the echo chamber of misinformation but like I said\u2026 you\u2019re not a Bomb disposal expert.. you could theoretically defuse that landmine under their foot, but you lack the expertise and steady hand. In those cases you genuinely do need some expert help. Deeply reinforced beliefs that go against common sense and logic go FAR beyond vaccines or elections, there is a root problem that pushes people to seek validation and support instead of seeking knowledge and truth. You cannot address those problems. So don\u2019t try.<br>You can and probably will push them deeper into the nonsense. It\u2019s like quicksand, if you try to pull someone out by wiggling them they will just sink deeper, you can\u2019t force it.. you NEED expertise and help. You will never survive by just tackling them off the landmine.. sure, they\u2019ll be off the mine\u2026 but the damage will be severe and probably irreparable.<br><br>I hope this helps someone.<br>I\u2019ve had this problem before, because I have cancer and my family tried to get someone to get vaccinated so I don\u2019t die.. my nephew also has an immune disease too.. it\u2019s serious. But we just pushed and wiggled and made things worse. <br>Since then I did a TON of research to see what we did wrong and the answer was, everything. The unintuitive answer is literally to just leave them alone. If you can seek professional help, absolutely do that! But if you can\u2019t\u2026 just don\u2019t push. Don\u2019t try to prove anything and do not ever try to win against them. <br><br>Good luck!

The fifth doctor just said, that this is most likely an allergic reaction to an ingredient of the vaccine, she should take this medicine and next time get the other vaccine, which doesn&#39;t have this ingredient. Rash was gone in 2 days and she has never had another reaction afterwards, as they just skipped the vaccines with the problematic ingredients. <br>Secondly when I was a baby and was scheduled to get my first vaccine, I had a flu with pretty high fever etc. So my mum went to the doctor with me and told them at the entrance that she isn&#39;t here because of the vaccination appointment, but because I am sick. In the treatment room the doctor came in syringe already filled, grabbed my arm and wanted to give me the triple vaccine without even asking if there is anything else. My mum had to pull me away forcefully, declaring that she isn&#39;t here to get me vaccinated, but that I am pretty ill and that the vaccine appointment needs to be rescheduled until I am better. Doctor started getting angry, because she had wasted a dose of the vaccine and told my mum, that she was probably one of those insane anti-vaxers and she hopes I die from the measles, because then it&#39;s only my mums fault. My mum just grabbed me and rushed out. Two weeks later I got the vaccine at another doctor.<br>Due to these incidents my mum is usually critical when it comes to vaccines and trys to compare the risks (because there are always some risks) with the overall benefits instead of just blindly getting it.<br>However she was also the first one to get the CoV19-Vaccine in our family, because she considered it important and necessary. People, who are vaccine critical/hesitant are not anti-vax, they usually just want more information to be able to estimate their personal risks and the overall benefits of the vaccines appropriately. And they also want pharma concerns to take responsibility for vaccine injuries or deaths as well as doctors taking averse reactions to vaccines more seriously, because this still barely happens, but would restore a lot of trust.", "comment_date": "2022-04-23T05:20:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MyenemyQ", "comment_text": "What about encouraging jab lovers to NOT get a jab?<br>I have a family member who wouldn&#39;t have gotten blood clots if she made smarter choices", "comment_date": "2022-04-23T00:47:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Engima", "comment_text": "This is true, it&#39;s used in the negotiation technique.", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T04:32:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pool Floaty Summer", "comment_text": "These comments: I&#39;m uncomfortable with the energy we have created in the studio", "comment_date": "2022-04-21T21:11:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Semmelein", "comment_text": "Going to try this so hard!

And that\u2019s not by choice because I\u2019m NOT against the vaccine, it just wasn\u2019t on my mind and I just wasn\u2019t putting it as top priority. I have a busy life. My mindset wasn\u2019t \u201cI need to get the vaccine tomorrow\u201d it was like \u201cI\u2019ll get it eventually but soon\u201d. And for some reason that answer isn\u2019t good enough for some people \u201cWhy not NOW\u201d \u201cYou need to get it NOW\u201d \u201cSchedule it NOW\u201d like no if I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s any urgency for my area then I\u2019m not gonna rush it. I already had covid and still have antibodies. I don\u2019t have a big social life. Plus my overall health wasn\u2019t that great and I was scared the vaccine would make me feel worse even if it was for a couple days. \u201cYou can KILL people it\u2019ll be YOUR fault\u201d so basically calling me a murderer with that tone, which is sh*tty and not even the whole truth. Same thing happens with the flu. It\u2019s a severe cold that targets the old and people with weak immunity, and not everyone gets the flu shot (Obviously covid wasn\u2019t like the flu in the beginning but it has regressed into that). To the people with weak immunity, it\u2019s more their responsibility to get the vaccine. Not my fault you\u2019re not vaccinated when YOURE the one with problems. But still this wasn\u2019t the tipping point for me, because I still wanted the vaccine to show my support. It was when people said to me \u201cWhy are you REFUSING the vaccine\u201d UM excuse me I\u2019m not WTF just because I don\u2019t have something doesn\u2019t mean its \u201crefusal\u201d. That\u2019s like saying \u201cwhy are you REFUSING to buy this certain item in the store?\u201d like excuse me I didn\u2019t even look at that item. So because of these people jumping down my throat when I wasn\u2019t even fighting them, it\u2019s made me hate this vaccine and NOW I refuse to get it. It shows how much politics get into people\u2019s heads which I hate. More power to everyone else for getting it but now it\u2019s personal for me. Call me stubborn I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m just leaving this comment to show how being confrontational constantly will change someone\u2019s mindset. I get sick thinking about getting this vaccine because it reminds me of the people with closed minded overly political opinions who treated me horribly for no valid reason. It\u2019s April 2022, I\u2019m not gonna make a difference by getting the vaccine anymore.

So it&#39;s a big 0 for me .

It\u2019s effecting people all over the world. People with certain health conditions cannot get vaccinated even if they want to do they\u2019re at risk of losing their life or having permanent organ damage because healthy people don\u2019t want to vaccinate. People like me who are vaccinated but have a suppressed immune system and/or are elderly can get vaccinated but it\u2019ll never be as effective for me and them as it is for a healthy person. So I am at risk (and so are others like me) of dying or having permanent organ damage because healthy people won\u2019t get vaccinated. Babies and children who are too young to get the vaccine are at risk of dying or having organ damage because healthy people don\u2019t want to get a vaccine. It doesn\u2019t only effect them. It effects a lot of people and that\u2019s why it matters. They\u2019d rather decide the vaccine is bad because of misinformation that they got from unreliable news sources or worse just random people on the internet then help protect their community. When people say, Covid isn\u2019t a big deal. It\u2019s mostly just elderly and people with pre-existing conditions who die anyway\u2026. Do we not matter as much as a healthy person does? We didn\u2019t ask to be sick or old during a pandemic or at all. It\u2019s frustrating because a lot of these deaths and near death experiences could\u2019ve been prevented if people would\u2019ve gotten vaccinated. And sure if you wanna risk your own life that\u2019s up to you but by refusing to get vaccinated you\u2019re not only risking your life. You\u2019re risking mine, your grandparents, new born babies, young children, your disabled/sick friends, disabled/sick people you don\u2019t know and elderly people you don\u2019t know. Yeah it\u2019s a big deal. I shouldn\u2019t have to live in my house hardly ever getting to leave for multiple years when there\u2019s a vaccine.

Reason 2 you need to get boosters like every 6 months, all the vaccines I had as a kid its 1 to 3 shots then your done only booster you need to get is for tetanus and thats every 10 years. Reason 3 they launched this vaccine with no testing so guess who there testing it on us. So just know if you got the vaccine your a lab rat.

I&#39;m a 1.

I also don&#39;t trust the people pushing the vaccine, and by that I mean the primary voices such as Fauci and CNN, not of the regular people and YouTubers and such who support it. I also have already dealt with COVID-19 and Omicron without symptoms, and Delta&#39;s already passed, so I find it highly unlikely the vaccine will protect me against any strains I am not already immune to. Further, I don&#39;t trust the research around COVID because every move the government has done to &quot;fight the disease&quot; appears to have a primarily political motivation, and the &quot;science&quot; seems to always say what the politicians want to hear. Further, there <b>have</b> been side effects with the vaccines, more than usual due to the vaccines rushed development, so I see no need to add additional risks when I&#39;m already not worried about COVID and don&#39;t think the vaccines (which were made for the original strand) will protect me against any future variants. Also, the government just seems to be using it and other COVID regulations as a tool to control people, and this is around the same threat level as the flu, give or take some.

Especially as the vaccine does not actually prevent anyone from catching or transmitting the virus and can only lessen your chances of having debilitating symptoms or dying from it. And if it is a question of virus mutation, it actually has the same chances of mutating in a vaccinated person as it does in an unvaccinated person, so that point doesn&#39;t really carry much weight. Personally I&#39;m thinking that more work should be done on the vaccines to make them even safer and more reliable for all variants of the virus, and if it can actually prevent people from catching the virus, then it can also prevent new mutations in the virus. I think that is the ultimate solution.

Really? Can you say the word  Narcissist.<br>&quot;Let me make you feel bad by not being highly rated by my scorecard&quot;. Said the Narcisist<br>How about if we reverse it and called every one else that is taking a vaccine a zero instead and who ever is not taking it a ten. That sounds alot better right. <br>All of this sounds like you are really grasping on stiring a person&#39;s emotions of acceptance as opposed to respecting other peoples wishes. &quot;Awwwe let me not call you a zero, be like us and get a vax shot&quot;. Remember it can always be flipped. From a person who doesn&#39;t &quot;Choose&quot; to get a vax this is their thought, &quot; Wow to bad all these people who vaxxed are not a ten, there are so many sheep. What a bunch of Zeros &quot;.<br><br>Why are so many of the Awakened Ones being singled out? Simple. Because we are fighting for the rest of the sheep. Because we are empathetic towards others. Because we are calling out the Narcism, Gaslighting, Lies, Fraud, Corruption. Because we are the chosen ones. Because we are independent doers and thinkers. Because we are Alpha and Sigma beings. <br><br>On a very important note .<br>You are not my Doctor. Why do you care so much about me or your fellow human beings health care? Hmmm...?<br>Truth most people lack empathy enough to be compassionate to take action. They are weak when they need to do something by themselves. If you cared so much about others? When is the last time you helped a complete stranger for no reason, without expectation, by being annonymous. <br>It is best to do acts of kindness from your heart and not looking for recognition.

Right?<br><br>Second seek to understand them first. Why is a question I like to ask myself? Why this or that?<br><br>Third remember most people do not have a strong mind and cannot see through the NLP tools that are being used as a tool of persuasion against a person&#39;s inner belief. This is a classic sign of Narcism and Covert Narcism. <br>Unfortunately the person who is doing it to persuade others to join their cause or be like them has strong narcissistic tendencies and they cannot see it.<br>They might want to check themselves before recking themselves.

It is forever being tested to be right.<br><br>At one point they thought the world was flat. <br>Then they thought that the Earth was the center of the solar system.<br>Then they thought the Earth was the center of the Galaxy.<br>All to find out that the Earth is not flat.

Yes following the science is very important but so is following the lessons from history and I think that&#39;s where the divide is greatest. People who are more hesitant are looking more at the history of what government is capable of committing while heavily pro vaccine people seem to be very focused on the present and current science. The tricky thing here though is that science isn&#39;t gospel. It&#39;s ever shifting and correcting. Sometimes predictions are way off and modeling gets led down a wrong direction due to some error. Yet so much of the communication in the mainstream has been treating predictions as set in stone fact. This hurts the credibility of the narrative to those that aren&#39;t as interested or literate in the science.

Sticking to the boosters seems to work better than the vaccines because when my family and i got the first dose, we all got covid (We live in seperate houses and ended up getting them a couple days apart bc schedule conflicts) same with my friends and their families. It seemed like the vaccine made us more likely to get covid instead of less likely. We hadnt gotten it before we got the vaccine, and only got covid right after the vaccine. My friends got the second dose and got covid again, so my family and i said we would just stick with the masks and social distancing. It felt, for lack of a better word coming to mind, sketchy.

The boxes on disposable masks said they wouldn\u2019t work. Plenty of people said these probably don\u2019t even work. You could wear a bandana around your face and it counted. <br><br>People in healthcare were fired in huge numbers for not getting the vaccine. Kids missed out on any sort of regular school experience and opportunities to keep themselves mentally and emotionally healthy (which greatly impacts physical health.) Business owners lost their livelihoods, people lost jobs, the government just keeps printing money and lowering its value, and shelves are still missing items they used to carry because everything is all screwed up.<br><br>Now the cdc has suddenly rolled back on all the guidelines they were saying. Masks don\u2019t work but school students who are contact traced can wear one to go to school for 5 days or stay at home for 5 days. No symptoms develop, you\u2019re good after 5. Libraries still keep returned items in quarantine but it was established a short time into the pandemic that it\u2019s not spread that way. Oh and the healthcare workers can go to work with patients if they have symptoms and test positive for Covid!!! What???<br><br>People received positive test results when they never were tested. People are struggling with not being given the chance to in someway say goodbye to loved ones even ones without Covid because no one could go in.<br><br>We\u2019re stuck in a perpetual state of emergency that we never should have been in.

We were able to more or less stop polio and small pox, but they do not mutate much, and some places with low vaccine rates do have polio present. It is why we need a yearly flu vaccine, and will probably need a yearly covid vaccine. It is also partially why we need boosters for things like measles, mumps, hep a, whooping cough, etc. They do not mutate as much as the flu or covid, but your immune system also begins to forget diseases after several years of not seeing them, so you need to remind it of the disease. Even then if you come in close contact you can still get said diseases, but they tend to be less dangerous to you and last a shorter period of time in your body, since your body is able to respond to it quicker. So in theory the covid vaccine is likely to decrease the chances of you getting seriously sick or being sick for a long time, but it does not stop it from infecting you entirely. This makes people hesitant, plus the fact that it is a new technology.. mRNA trigger instead of a denatured virus...and the fact they said if enough people got the vaccine we could get back to normal...which enough people did but they keep moving the goal posts..makes people even more skeptical. Add the fact that the governments have also hurt people before with false claims, such as the Tuskegee incident when they purposefully infected certain minorities with syphilis and lied about curing it, makes even more people worried about it. The inability to sue if you have a bad reaction also does not help.

I\u2019m not extremely for or against the vaccine. I admit when it first came out it was scary to think about it. I was scared to be one of the first to get it, and was determined to wait a while before I got it myself. The main reason I have yet to get it is my extreme fear of needles. And I mean EXTREME. Like, it isn\u2019t just something I hate, it\u2019s something I have to be tied down to get and I\u2019m pretty sure they can\u2019t physically restrain me now that I\u2019m an adult\u2026 For some more clarity on how extreme my fear is: When I was in a car accident and in the hospital hooked up to a heart rate monitor\u2026 The doctors came in and told me I needed to get an IV. I immediately went into freak out mode and started bawling my eyes out and screaming to my mom. My heart rate increased so much that the heart rate monitor went into alarm mode. If my mom hadn\u2019t have been there with me I think it would have been a lot worse. But now I have no family near me and no one I trust enough like that to go with me to get the vaccine\u2026 I\u2019m not quite sure what to do or even which one to get if I do eventually get it. Lots of people just tell me to put my big girl pants on and just do it but that isn\u2019t really helpful. In fact, that makes me want to go get it less because it\u2019s just so patronizing and it really downplays my extreme fear. The fact that I\u2019m so scared of needles I would rather risk my health than get a needle should be a clear indicator of just how scared I am of injections. Plus, I have a tumor on my arm from an injection I got a few years ago that went wrong. I\u2019m mentally scarred by these things, and I don\u2019t know how to get over it.

They no longer follow the measures of prevention that are necessary for the safety of everyone.

The vaccine doesn&#39;t work the same for everyone. It doesn&#39;t affect everyone the same way, and putting it does not guarantee anything.

Everyone is in different situations and it is impossible to know everything others are going through. Try to have some compassion and empathy for others.<br>I usually kind of push emotionally difficult things to the back of my mind and just try to continue on and I knew all of this was affecting me but I didn&#39;t realize how bad until I started writing this. I am sitting in my bed crying because this has been so difficult and scary to deal with, not knowing whether a lot of my family and myself are gonna lose are jobs and the constant crap from people both on the internet and in person. It&#39;s mostly been difficult watching members of my family be discriminated against at work and school and even in church. I never imagined I would be in a situation where so many people that don&#39;t even know me, who have never met me and don&#39;t even know my name, wish horrible things upon me just for wanting to keep my medical freedom.

My best friend who knows any little secret I have doesn&#39;t even know a lot of the details about my medical stuff. I especially don&#39;t want to have to discuss them with coworkers or school people or whoever.

The members constantly get called anti-vaxxers (even though they all got the vaccine) and people try to silence them and all they want is to have an open conversation about the possible side affects of the vaccine just like any other medication or treatment for anything. I highly recommend watching Kyles videos on the topic, they are heartbreaking but I know so many people in similar situations. I know he has really helped people see a different point of view and gotten them to try to be more kind to others, especially when they don&#39;t know their situation or reasons for their decisions.<br>I do really appreciate this guys video trying to atleast have a civil conversation about the vaccine. It is really nice to see because honestly like 99% of people I come across talking about this topic are hostile and super degrading towards unvaccinated people.

The question isn\u2019t if one is \u201chesitant,\u201d the question is WHY they\u2019re \u201chesitant.\u201d <br>Assuming you\u2019re in some form of sales, you\u2019re trying to gain some leverage based off their response, and flesh out any objections  to help move the conversation forward. <br>WHY they\u2019re hesitant isn\u2019t an objection, it\u2019s a decision. And like some, if not most, people do research before they make a decision. Therefore they\u2019ve already made up their mind (whether or not to buy what you\u2019re selling). <br><br>There are many brands to choose from in regards to the subject of this video. Much like there are many brands of cars to choose from. It\u2019s not if one is better than the other, because they\u2019re all going to do the same thing at the end of the day, it\u2019s if it is a trustworthy and reputable brand. For example, one might prefer Tim Hortons coffee over Star Bucks because it\u2019s cheap, and the other because it caters to their lifestyle, prefer the quality more etc\u2026<br><br>They (the buyer) have already considered the cost for their beverage, this is a simplistic example.<br><br>Regarding the subject of this video, the brands all have varying degrees of influence, reputability and truth-worthiness. But thats where choice stops (with the brands) and pros vs cons begins.<br><br>If one is 3/10, asking what would make them a 10 isn\u2019t so easy, unless you hold hostage their job, and their capacity to buy food etc\u2026 With that said,  it\u2019s no longer a closing question, it\u2019s a hostage negotiation. <br><br>There are a million reasons why one would and why one wouldn\u2019t. <br><br>In my opinion 0-10 scale is more of a soft close/trial close question.

See, one of the earliest instances of white society &quot;helping&quot; us was to give us blankets intentionally infected with Smallpox, Influenza and other viruses for which my ancestors had no immunity.<br><br>Then both the native and black communities were experimented upon without their knowledge, sterilized without consent, and basically f*cked with by &quot;scientists&quot;.<br><br>This distrust is intergenerational. It is shared by parents with their children, and I don&#39;t mean they sit down and teach it, I mean the kids pick up on their parents fear and distrust and internalize it. <br><br>This was made WAY worse by the choice to push black and native people to the front of the line for vaccines. Like I got mine in February 2021. The intention was supposedly to help high risk citizens. The perceived intention was the same as it&#39;s always been, extermination. <br><br>And you can&#39;t blame any of them for it! I personally studied everything I could get my hands on. I didn&#39;t &quot;trust&quot; anyone. But most people don&#39;t take the initiative to learn and often see all sources as the same, so they don&#39;t know what&#39;s real and what&#39;s lies.<br><br>So, if a person from a background like this says they&#39;re hesitant but cannot articulate why beyond being suspicious or afraid, this might be the reason and they just don&#39;t fully understand it.

So it effectively has 0 benefits for others, but may protect you personally a bit. So unvaxxed ppl are not stopping life from being normal, because everyone can catch it, &amp; anyone can pass it on. They are not selfish, or stupid, or in need of someone repeat what the gov or doctors say, we&#39;ve heard it, we&#39;ve looked into it, and we&#39;ll pass and take our chances.

If it doesn&#39;t stop the spread.. why does it matter too you if others take it.. everyone claim it prevents you from getting as sick right? But all the people I know who are unpoked haven&#39;t gotten covid because they&#39;re thoughtful about sanitizing and social distancing. The people who are vaxed are the ones who think they don&#39;t have to use masks or follow protocols. The people I know that are vaxed got way sicker than the unpoked. So if it really doesn&#39;t help you get not as sick and symptoms very person to person it seems weird everyone wants to force the vaccine on others and no one can give me a good reason for it other than the government says we have to and if we don&#39;t they&#39;ll restrict us longer sounds like blackmail or terrorism to me. The only decent argument I&#39;ve heard is oh hospitals are overwhelmed and we don&#39;t want to pay for it with taxes for ventilators when people wouldn&#39;t need em if they&#39;re vaxed. But the truth is hospitals are filled with the vaccinated. A quarter of covid patients are unvaccinated. Which just so happens to be the average rate at which people are unvaccinated an odd coincidence that means your as likely to get covid weather you vaxed or not. In the icu half the patients r vaccinated and half r unvaccinated but 80% are obese and the other 10% have auto immune issues this info is according to Canadian government website and the cdc. So being fat is just as likely a cause of getting super sick from covid as being unvaccinated.

It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t trust vaccines in general, I&#39;m just very skeptical about the covid vaccine. When you think back to the development for other vaccines, scientists spent many years working on them to make sure they were safe and effective. The covid vaccine was developed over the span of less than a year, and didn&#39;t have nearly enough time to run it through testing. On top of that, the long term side effects are still largely unknown. Just because you&#39;re perfectly healthy weeks or months after you take it doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t necessarily be facing probems (whether they be mild or severe) years down the road. If I were to ever bring up skepticism about the covid vaccine to someone who&#39;s pro vax, they might say something like &quot;it was developed by scientists who spent years getting their degrees and studying this sort of thing, so it can be trusted and you have no right to question it&quot;, or &quot;you have to get vaccinated because you&#39;re selfish if you dont&quot;. I don&#39;t see those as ringing endorsements to want to get vaccinated. I see it as though I&#39;m almost being manipulated or threatened to do it. And when people say these doctors can be trusted because of all their scientific accomplishments, the way I see it is that the degrees and awards make them qualified on the subject, but not necessarily trustworthy. How do we know that these doctors are being honest when they claim the vaccine is super safe and effective. Well, that was my 2 cents, and if you&#39;re one of those people who is completely in favor of the covid vaccine, than more power to you. But as of right now, I think I&#39;m gonna wait just a little bit longer and see where things end up before I even consider taking it.", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T16:39:23Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Sleepy Steev", "comment_text": "This is just general good life advice.", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T16:36:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sleepy Steev", "comment_text": "Remember folks, it&#39;s not about being right.

The high relative risk reduction (\u201cefficacy\u201d) is meaningless without also assessing absolute risk reduction. relative being the ratio of the rates of incident between without and with treatment, and absolute being the magnitude of the actual difference between with and without. <br>Absolute risk reduction for me was too small to get excited about a high efficacy. <br><br>Without absolute risk reduction, you can\u2019t tell the difference between a drop from a 10% to a 1% chance,  and a 0.1% chance to 0.01%, as both examples here are 90% effective.<br>It\u2019s contingent on Base Risk and how it changes to New Risk, the issue is that not everyone\u2019s Base Risk is the same. <br><br>Just look at the estimations for infection fatality ratios by age, an earlier paper from dec 2020 calculated 10 year olds at 0.002% IFR and 80+ at 15% IFR. <br><br>Now reduce both those by 90%. <br><br>Certain people only marginally benefit, and some people benefit a lot, but this is lost in conversation because absolute risk reduction was never discussed from the beginning. <br><br><br>When I understood antigenic drift for a mutating RNA virus and how were using a vaccine with the tip of a single antigen (the S1, tip of the spike), I understood that the vaccine has little to no redundancies or breadth of immune response. Necessitating that any S1 mutations would serious cut into efficacy, as it\u2019s efficacy effectively exists only on a razor\u2019s edge. I understood an escape variant would emerge. <br>When I understood that S1 vaccines elicit a strong humoral immune response but a weak intercellular response I went from \u201cI\u2019d rather not\u201d to \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason to get it\u201d. Especially know that disabled virus vaccines and recovery grant a strong intercellular response. But novavax and covaxin aren\u2019t available, and the live attenuated COVI-VAC is a ways away still. <br><br>When the conversation is consumed by \u201cwaning antibodies\u201d, I can only ask, \u201cdo people not realize that plasma cells die, and only a fraction remained long lived plasma cells? The role of memory B is to make more plasma cells when re-exposed, the logic for boosters makes no sense.\u201d <br><br>When I learned that chronic high antibody titres is an organ stress, and is prolonged can lead to hyper viscosity syndrome, my concerns grew. <br>When I learned that we don\u2019t know WHY myocarditis or any of the mRNA side effects occur, I became more concerned. <br><br>One can speculate, like how the LNP causes cells to express the S1 on the cell membrane may cause CD8+ T cells or NK cells to see those cells as infected, thus they will kills those cells, seems plausible. <br>Or how the spike in the blood is known to cause Renin-angiotensin system problems from the days of SARS-CoV-1, and since the vaccine spike is stuck in prefusion confirmation, it may bind to ACE2 like an antagonist, such that if Ang 2 can\u2019t be down regulated from ACE2, it may take the AT1R pathway which can lead to vasoconstriction, inflammation and fibrosis. <br><br>These are unacceptable concerns for a vaccine. <br><br>When I learned I had covid, I knew my risks before hand, and it played out as expected. So, I\u2019m never getting the vaccine, at best it\u2019s marginal benefit along a greater risk profile. Risk-benefit analysis is not in the benefit\u2019s favour. <br><br><br>Ultimately, when you want more people to get vaccinated, demand a better vaccine. <br><br>Pushing a sub-par vaccine causes people to unnecessarily doubt vaccines as a whole, and not acknowledging that undermines better vaccines with clear pedigree. <br><br>A good product sells itself.", "comment_date": "2022-01-25T05:09:20Z", "likes_count": 32}, {"comment_by": "Ellis Williams", "comment_text": "Never going to get the vaccine.
