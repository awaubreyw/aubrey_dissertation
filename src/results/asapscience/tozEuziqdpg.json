I really enjoyed this video because its facts like that that no one expects to be true, but realizing it now, I can see that it can be true. I also like how they compare two different things to help people understand it better. The heart, for example, they compared clenching both of your hands together to picture about the size that our heart is. I like that that give you a visual imagine to see about how big our heart is instead of just imagining the size and being way off.  Same thing when it comes to how much blood our heart pumps that compared it to swimming pools that gives me an imagine in my head to help see how much exactly that is.
