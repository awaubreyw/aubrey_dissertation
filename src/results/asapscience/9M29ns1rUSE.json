That means to warm the climate by just 1&quot;C carbon dioxide molecules must capture 2,500&quot;C of heat energy. That is impossible. It also breaks the fundamental laws of thermodynamics.\u00a0<br><br>Methane at 0.00017% is a 600,000th of the atmosphere so it&#39;s even more impossible.<br><br>However, the climate is changing. This is because of deliberate geoengineering programmes, in particular ozone thinning away from the poles. Though largely unreported ozone thinning effect is directly observable, this summer you can see a unnaturally bright sun just as we did last year. Under these conditions the pain felt when looking at the sun is not only from the increase in visible light but the much larger increase in infrared.\u00a0(Look up at the sky and you will see a range of geoengineering operations in progress, these include chemtrail induced cloud or hazing, ripple patterns caused by HAARP installations, bizarre and unnatural cloud formations). <br><br>Climate change is a programme to force change in accordance with the implementation of Agenda 21 /2030. Current events demonstrate this transition is well underway and will involve massive population cull through injected nanotech (re transhumanist programme). Agenda 21 also sees the permanent loss of all property rights with the introduction of universal basic income (ref NESARA/GESARA) and has/is being promoted by The World Economic Forum.\u00a0<br><br>&#39;You will own nothing and you will be happy&#39; WEF<br><br>In a depopulated world the surviving brainwashed and controlled population will be confined to mega cities.

In fact it shows those using such arguments do not even understand what heat is. <br><br>When we measure temperature we are measuring the heat energy a thing is losing. In short heat is a measurement of flow, the transfer of heat energy and this will always be in the direction towards the colder. For this reason a thing can never &#39;accumulate heat&#39; in the way those advocating CO2 climate change describe. The temperature of a body is the measure of heat output, it can never be greater than the measure of heat input. Output = input. When a thing is warmed it is heated to an equivalent of the heat input. If this input is not maintained it will cool. Those that propose that heat can build up to be hotter than the total measure of heat input at a given time either do not understand what heat is or are being deliberately misleading. To illustrate, an object being heated by a flame can never become hotter than that flame, it&#39;s temperature cannot rise inexorably to the temperature of the sun for instance. Heat cannot be accumulated. When we think about it common sense tells us this must be the case. <br><br>NASA and even Nobel Prize winning physicists have expounded &#39;accumulated heat&#39; as the explanation how CO2 is able to warm the atmosphere. They claim that over hundreds of years CO2 has captured heat energy and this heat has &#39;accumulated&#39; to produce a serious warming effect. As I have just explained, this is totally impossible and fundamentally violates all the laws of thermodynamics. That respected scientists should support such uneducated, unthinking nonsense is disturbing and only reflects that in terms of being able to think clearly about a subject they have no facility or inclination. These are the Dark Ages of science. Belief has outweighed logic or any critical thought. It tells us that we should not unquestioningly accept anything we are told, that experts can be fools. <br><br>(NB: be aware of attempts to discard thermodynamics by talking about biology. <br>Eg. &#39;It only takes a drop of arsenic to kill a person.&#39;<br>This would be somewhat desperate, muddled thinking.

I leave here a paper about industrial/breadwinner masculinities: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333818011_Industrialbreadwinner_masculinities\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333818011_Industrialbreadwinner_masculinities</a>", "comment_date": "2020-12-12T00:36:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isidore Aerys", "comment_text": "That lady is a visionary. <br>Good for her. <br>Moral leadership on the Right side of the aisle is so heroic in this time of post cold war theocratization of the religious right.", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T20:16:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rick TD", "comment_text": "If you love being lied to you came to the right video here.", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T17:25:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carole Chamberlin", "comment_text": "Can we do this but how to talk to the &quot;COVID is a conspiracy&quot; people too please....", "comment_date": "2020-12-03T19:16:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Drew Jackson", "comment_text": "Dealing with climate change goobers is like dealing with flat earthers.

How much has our innate survival instinct been co-opted by fear and its allies, denial and anger.<br><br>Anger and hatred makes one feel stronger and is but a temporary antidote to feeling fearful and weak. It\u2019s what \u2018moves in and takes over\u2019 when denial isn\u2019t enough by itself to assuage one\u2019s fears.

Both of these issues are resisted by rigid thinkers. Denial of the source of these dangers in order to \u2018combat fear\u2019 actually winds up increasing the dangers. This further increases fear levels, which then ramps up denial, which results in even more danger. The vicious cycle continues until a \u2018shit storm\u2019 finally manifests.

Let\u2019s see,.....Step 1 ask questions-So what is the difference between science and pseudoscience?  Which of the two would you consider the current study of man made global warming?  Please spend some time looking this answer up before moving on.  I won\u2019t answer it for you but I  can lead you in the right direction.  I recommend a YouTube search for Nobel Laureate Ivar Giaever.  He gives a 31 minute lecture on the subject and I think it was worth it to watch every minute of it.  <br>Step 2 tell a story- There once was a boy who cried \u201cwolf.\u201d  We will call him Al.  He told the villagers that the wolf was going to gore his sheep.  He said it would happen in less than one decade.  When it didn\u2019t happen then he said it would happen in the next decade and then the next.  Then some of the smarter villagers stopped believing him.  But it was too late.  They had already bought all of Al\u2019s wolf traps, wolf repellant, wolf poison, and ammunition.  Al retired in a life of luxury and moved to beachfront property in California in a giant mansion using ungodly amounts of electricity.  (Maybe he will be underwater soon, ya right \ud83d\ude44.)  Someone should have told the villagers that there were no wolves on their island only 90 miles south of Key West.  Moral of the story - Don\u2019t trust Al or you will become a broke peasant stuck in a Socialist / Communist country.  The End \ud83d\ude42.  I like story telling.  <br>Step 3 Be Equipped.  I went to the Skeptical Science web page and learned all of the ridiculous rebuttals to my arguments and now I have rebuttals to your rebuttals.  For example, I say polar bears are doing just fine.  Then you run to the bathroom and look up your webpage.  It says to counter with \u201cpolar bears are at risk of extinction\u201d.  Then I say,  if overall population has increased possibly from 1000 in 1970 to 25,000 today how are carbon emissions hurting them?  Then you counter with \u201csub populations are decreasing even if the total number is increasing.\u201d  And then I say, that is a ridiculous argument.  Are we now going to count the equivalent of Hispanic polar bears which are increasing while Asian polar bears are decreasing\u201d. And then we either laugh or cry hysterically.  \ud83e\udd23<br>However, after visiting the site, I can say the studies are PSEUDOSCIENCE run by PSEUDOSCIENTISTS.  Return to step one if you are confused right now.  <br>Step 4- Big ideological issue -follow the money!  Carbon credits, carbon tax, government mandated price on carbon, carbon trading. Hopefully Trump will complete our exit from the Paris agreement.  By the way, we breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.  Plants and trees love it.  Most of them are starved for it.  If they could think, they would crave SUV emissions of carbon dioxide.  It is like oxygen to them.  So.....not so scary.  And the most scary molecule that makes up over 90% of greenhouse gases is......wait for it.........H2O.  Otherwise known as water \ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude31.  I just delayed our future demise by trapping some of it in my body by drinking it.  But I apologize for taking a breath after each sip of water, thereby expelling CO2.  If you truly want to stop CO2 from being released into the environment, stop breathing.  That was only a joke please continue to breathe.  Try not to think about what you are exhaling.  <br>Step 5 show vulnerability-  I\u2019m really scared that my children and future grand children and great grandchildren will have to pay a heavy tax on all things carbon so that a World government / Bank can gain more power and control of our lives\ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb4\ud83d\udcb6\ud83d\udcb7\ud83d\udcb0.  One of the skeptical science articles showed the slow down of warming over the last 20 years where the global  temperature change was either negative, or a possible increase of 0.056 degrees C per decade.  That is despite a continual increase in carbon emissions.  SERIOUSLY?!!!!!

This is what I&#39;ve found.<br><br>The Earth&#39;s Greenhouse effect of 34C is entirely a product of assuming the energy balance applies at the surface. The immediate question is why do we assume sea level is the correct surface? Why not include the sea bed, the average altitude of dry land, the tropopause or the clouds? All of these could arguably be a &quot;surface&quot;.<br><br>Yet if we look at every world in the solar system that has an atmosphere we don&#39;t find a balance at 1 bar of pressure (Earth sea level pressure) anywhere. It is always higher up than that. The closest match is the top of the main cloud systems. Perhaps that represents the effective reach of atmospheric circulation for this problem.<br><br>The actual temperature balance for Earth is at about 5km up which is roughly consistent with the above. What this means is that the actual Greenhouse effect is much smaller than 34C. My hunch is that its in the bottom third of that range, 10C to 0C. That&#39;s right, it might be that it is actually zero and this whole business is based on applying the equations at the wrong altitude.<br><br>The temperature at any other altitude is then due to the lapse rate which is simply the normal temperature gradient you get going up or down through the atmosphere.<br><br>I have noticed that CO2 tends to emit radiation higher up the atmosphere but that does not mean heat lower down is &quot;trapped&quot;. Also we don&#39;t know what the actual relationship between CO2 and temperature is, it is very difficult to claim that either one causes the other.<br><br>What about the graphs that show runaway rising temperatures? If you look at the sources they nearly always quote Marcott and Hadcrut. These are different, one is low frequency so it does not include decades long warming, the other is high frequency so it does. The main reason the graphs look different is that they represent different methods of dealing with the data.<br><br>Other graphs of past temperatures exist and they show a range of results.

I remember around 2001 scientists saying that all of the beaches in Los Angeles were going to be underwater by 2016. This did not happen. Additionally we have passed several &quot;global warming points of no return&quot; claimed by environmental scientists. Once we pass these &quot;points of no return&quot; it seems everyone just forgets about it and creates a new one. There are people getting tremendously wealthy off of the green industrial complex and yet were not seeing any real solution for mitigating climate change after throwing trillions of dollars towards climate research scientists over decades. <br><br>Many are resentful of the hypocrisy brought on from the green movement.

However, when folks left of center try to have this conversation - they often assume the only solution is through the government. This is dangerous and shuts down dialogue. Scientific consensus on the issue of climate change =/= consensus on policy prescription. I find a lot of the time that people left of center will call folks client change deniers when they do not believe a carbon tax will work, but do believe climate change is a problem that needs to be addressed now. This is harmful to the discussion from your side of the isle. When discussing ideological &quot;poisoning of the well&quot; - the left has a huge blind spot in the tactics that they use to do the same types of things they disdain in the right.<br><br>Personally, I think that technological innovation will bring us out of this. If enough businesses have the funds and resources for R&amp;D, then they will have an economic incentive to develop something that tackles this issue. I think that slapping a carbon tax on the industry might delay the effects of climate change, but ultimately prohibit it from being resolved in a timely manner - which is what we all want, right? If we extend the duration of a solution, it might not come about in time. It&#39;s like placing a bandaid on a slit throat. We need to figure out a way to stitch the artery now - not waste time with the bandaid. Taking money out of the pockets of people who can actually develop that technology right now is a net negative, imo.<br><br>I think the left has a tendency to focus in on the bad apples in the group. The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation wouldn&#39;t exist with the policies y&#39;all push. I also find that the policies don&#39;t accomplish the things you hope that they do. People on the left have this disdain for large corporations, but then place their hope in the largest, most corrupt monopolistic enterprise that has ever existed - the government. It makes no sense to me.<br><br>To clarify this point - people become cynical when you present a crisis and imply you know the solution&#39;s correct policy prescription when presenting scientific facts.

Their best advice?  1) Buy an electric car. 2) When on holiday overseas, use container ships as transport.  That&#39;s the best advice they gave.  Two problems with that.  Electric cars are still expensive.  Two, buy the time the container ship docked into the port destination, my holiday would already be over.  I was the only one who stood up and offered a suggestion, that was to eat a plant diet (Vegan if you prefer).

But, ABC news was caught deleting their Facebook posts encouraging climate change activists to campaign against controlled burning.  If controlled burning was allowed to happen, the bush fires wouldn&#39;t have been able to wreck as much devastation.  Nearly half a billion animals are believed to have died in agony in these bush fires.  Half a billion!  Also at least 20 people have died in these fires.

We need more food! How to grow more food? (1) A warmer climate. (2) More food for the plants i.e CO2 in the air. Luckily we have seen improvements already.  We have slowly gotten out of the Little Ice Age during the last 1-200 years with the planet warming up again, and with higher levels of CO2 we have seen a greening of the planet the last decades, which has resulted in a huge increase in global food production. \r<br>\r<br>The data: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth\">https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth</a>? \r<br>\r<br>The data shows that global warming is having a dramatic positive effect on crop yields. As an example, the average corn yields (measured in tons per hectare) in the USA since 1940, have INCREASED MORE THAN FIVE-FOLD! We see more or less the same trends in Europe and the rest of the world for most of the major food crops. Access to cheap fossil fuel has allowed us to grow food ever more efficient, and against all odds, we are now able to feed the growing world population. Famine is now half of what it was 30 years ago. Only populations without access to fossil fuel are starving today! \r<br>\r<br>The data: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture\">https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture\r</a><br>\r<br>There is a lot more food and wealth per capita now than it used to be, thanks to cheap fossil fuel. And because of this and unprecedented access to cheap fossil fuel during the last 100 years, we are now better off, when it comes to the economy, health, education, technology, social equality, war/peace, etc than any time in our known history. We are in a time with more resources and human well-being than ever before. \r<br>\r<br>AND IT&#39;S GETTING BETTER EVERY YEAR! :) \r<br>\r<br>A hundred years ago you were more educated than most if you could read, and wealthier than most if you owned shoes. And you had to work 12+ hours every day just to put food on the table. We should be thankful for living in this time and not in the ages before us.

The reason we are in this mess is because of the innovation, greed and individualistic worldview of the modern world. We say we can just fix it with more innovation and tech but that&#39;s what got us here in the first place, this is the classic fighting fire with fire. With new tech and innovation brings further uncertainty of the negative impacts that every new technology may bring. No tech is simply bad or good all tech is good and bad. We exploit land and its resources, man isnt above nature, we act as if we can tame mother nature. Who cares about others and the future just worry about making money for your own company or yourself. Completely unregulated free markets (they practically dont exist) which is central to capitalism. Every political system is on the spectrum of pure capitalism and pure communism at which both extremes will ultimately lead to self destruction. And I think this is what people must realize. There is a balance of socialism and capitalism that we must find in order to incentivising enough production to support the needs of everyone while having a reasonable amount of redistribution of wealth and regulations. Capitalism produces too much that ultimately incentivising self gain and explotation at the cost to everyone else including future generations. Simply put capitalism with no regulations and taxes is unsustainable. Communism produces too little which historically and currently starve many people to death. We are currently too hyper consumerist and we waste too much. The only way we solve our issue is completely shifting our worldview. We cant see ourselves as above nature in some hierarchy cuz in reality we arent. We say we are destroying the world but that&#39;s mainly because we are destroying what makes earth inhabitable for us. Earth will eventually rebalance itself out in the long run as many of the deniers have pointed out there are cyclical warming and cold periods. Our hyper consumerist and individualistic worldview is ultimately our main problem no amount of carbon taxes or energy tech innovations is gonna solve that.

But when the official temp record began, it only covered 20% of the globe and mostly in the northern hemi. In modern times 80% of the globe is covered and they are working on further improvement. So, for much of the accepted record that shows warming, much of the globe wasn&#39;t even covered. You don&#39;t have to be an expert scientist to have reasonable doubts about the temperature record. And it would be nice if they had started measuring co2 a long time before the official temp record, so we could see a clear and long official measured co2 behaviour pre-industrialisation and the human factor at play at the point of industrialisation. But unfortunately, because of alarmism, people aren&#39;t willing to wait for real data that won&#39;t be avaliable for decades, or even centuries to come.  With a branch of science (climate science) that can&#39;t even do a controlled experiment to back up its primary claim i.e. that anthropogenic co2 causes the warming,  they shouldn&#39;t be making the claims of certainty and alarmism they do without the hard data at hand. That doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t  do things to reduce pollution,  do scientific research and innovation for alternative energy sources,, and protect natural sinks, clean up the ocean etc, but it does mean we should not be rushing the west into urgent social and economic structural change and that we should be recognising a developing nations right to use its natural resources in a way to develop on similar terms to us.

The global climate is changing, but the actual question of whether or not man&#39;s industrial and fossil fuel burning activities have contributed towards &#39;causing&#39; the global climate to undergo the changes we are now experiencing is not an easy question to answer, but I think the evidence does point towards them doing so.<br><br>We have been burning fossil fuels intensely since the dawn of the industrial revolution almost 300 years ago, and over that period of time, we have increased our CO2 production exponentially year on year, especially as other countries began their own industrial revolution. We have not stopped increasing our CO2 production with each passing year. All that CO2 is not from natural occurrences, but from man&#39;s manufactured occurrences. All of it is &#39;extra&#39; to natural phases of CO2 production, so of course, it cannot be denied that we have contributed (300 years worth) to the current levels of CO2.<br><br>With having so much CO2 around, the earth&#39;s natural carbon sinks are quite saturated and are unable to take in CO2 at levels that make much of a difference, so more CO2 is in the atmosphere than what is normally present. This warms the air, and along with the sun&#39;s constant solar radiation, the energy in the atmosphere increases which leads to more intense weather systems propagating stronger storms and greater precipitation, especially in areas where the climate tends to be more &#39;moderate&#39;. What we are experiencing and witnessing today are changes to local weather systems that normally worked pretty clock-work like, that were stable and moderate within a fine-tuning. It is the fine-tuning that is breaking down, and is the first symptom of climate change.<br><br>I predict that as the atmosphere warms further, leading to greater land ice melting and finding its way into the sea, not only will there be loss of coastal regions as the seas rise, but we should be able to detect the sea rises at geographical places where the seas are channelled (bottle-necked) between landmasses, rises in sea levels will be focused at these points around the world first. Sea level rises will lead to greater amounts of precipitation over land masses, where more frequent flooding will be experienced each year.<br><br>You can argue all you want about causes of climate change, but the fact is...it is happening, and it will only become more intense. If the industrial revolution had never occurred, there would not be 300 years worth of &#39;extra&#39; CO2 in the natural carbon sinks and atmosphere.<br><br>If there is one statement that really pisses me off is the &#39;we have to save the planet&#39; bullshit.

This predates the invention of the internal combustion engine. 2) Atmospheric CO2 does not heat the atmosphere in a linear fashion, but rather logarithmically. If doubling CO2 causes 2 degrees higher temperatures, then you&#39;d have to quadruple CO2 to get 2 more degrees higher temperatures. Ice core samples show that atmospheric CO2 has been as high as 8000ppm, and yet everything was fine. 3) Global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 is not highly correlated. In earth&#39;s past temperatures have gone down as CO2 went up and vice versa. The evidence shows that CO2 actually follows global temperatures, so it would be more correct to say that higher global temperatures causes higher CO2, rather than the other way around. 4) It was warmer during the Middle Ages than it is now.

You felt safe and spiritual listening to the wise Grandmother Willow and the Colors of the Wind song. You felt guilty for liking these things because your parents disapproved of environmentalism. Your mom read an article against global warming while watching your swim lessons. You began homeschooling at age 10. Your last year of public school science was fourth grade. You were a very ill child who found it difficult to learn. You don&#39;t remember doing science in fifth grade. At the end of sixth grade you read an Abeka science book on your own. Abeka is a very conservative Christian homeschool curriculum company. You tried to go to public school part time in seventh grade but it didn&#39;t work out. You had one semester of science, which taught about electrical circuits, not climate. You used a Creationist book for eighth grade science. The whole book argued against evolution. You didn&#39;t do science after that. You learned that science wasn&#39;t interesting, and being interested in it would probably create unnecessary conflict with your parents that you didn&#39;t have the energy for and besides, you&#39;d always been the obedient oldest child. If you didn&#39;t have your parents on your side with your health problems, you were going to be our of luck. You went to community college. You walked into an English class where the teacher announced &quot;Welcome to Environmental English.&quot; You were scared. You were probably going to be attacked or made to feel stupid by some angry liberals. Your teacher turns out to be one of the best you&#39;ve ever had before or since. He calmly teaches you how to read arguments about which power production technologies to use where. He wants you to learn to think. Maybe liberals aren&#39;t so bad after all. You still put off biology as long as possible. You transfer from there to a conservative religious university which thankfully still teaches evolution even though many in the religion don&#39;t believe in it. You walk into Intro Biology for non-science majors. You were among many students who didn&#39;t know that evolution was real. The teacher sucks, but the one lecture where he held up models of skills demonstrating ape to human evolution was neat. It makes you want to learn more later. Years pass. You de-convert from your religion. You start to wonder about science. What about it might be true and interesting, or the opposite. You hear people who probably grew up knowing things you didn&#39;t getting frustrated with people like you. You feel put in the middle of a fight between the people you came from and the people you&#39;re starting to tentatively like. If you were me, what would you do?

It is my understanding that animal agriculture is the number one cause of climate change and world hunger according to the U.N.  Large amounts of methane from animal feces, deforestation, huge amounts of water usage, feces contaminating water, ineffective use of food, and toxic chemicals used to make leather all involve animal agriculture. If everyone went vegan we wouldn&#39;t need to feed 20billion+ animals and we would be able to feed the 800million starving humans. Also, Animal products are extremely unhealthy, the FDA classifies processed meats as a carcinogen in the same class as cigarettes and consuming animal products as been directly linked to shorter life expectancy, obesity, high cholesterol, heart disease, strokes, and many more health issues not seeing in vegans. Also, large amounts of antibiotics are given to animals which causes bacterial resistance which could be very horrible for humans.  Finally and most importantly Animals are treated horrifically on farms and this is very sad because farm animals are some of the smartest creatures on earth. Pigs have the same cognitive ability as  3-year-old humans and are capable of opening gates and playing video games. These animals feel pain and emotion just as we do and they fear death and know when they are about to die. Farm animals often have there tails and testicles cut off without any  anesthetic at all and when they are killed they are shot with a stun gun that dents there brain to keep it &quot;ethical&quot; but a lot of times this step is skipped or doesn&#39;t work and they are fully aware while their throats are being slit and their skin is being peeled off of them or even when they are dipped in scalding hot water. Production of milk involves constantly artificially impregnating cows taking their babies away then chaining the calf to a pole then killing it for veal and the dairy cow must repeat this process it&#39;s whole life which is very short because eventually it is killed for meat. Also, egg production involves throwing 500,000 male baby chicks in a grinder every single day and keeping hens in cages and in crowded conditions where they often break bones and die of diseases. Animals used for dissection such as frogs and cats are taken out of there environments and homes and thrown in toxic chemicals alive until they die a painful death, and this is trash science and outdated because we now have more affordable software simulations that get the job done just as good if not better. Also, much money is wasted on funding trash science where they torture animals for no reason other than they get funding for it so it is an easy way to make money (not talking about all animal experiments just most of them). There is so much more cruelty that goes on but I can&#39;t talk about all of it. Of course, I don&#39;t want you to take my word for it but instead, do your own research and please make a video about it.

We need more food! How to grow more food? (1) A warmer climate. (2) More food for the plants i.e CO2 in the air. Luckily we have seen improvements already.  We have slowly gotten out of the Little Ice Age during the last 1-200 years with the planet warming up again, and with higher levels of CO2 we have seen a greening of the planet the last decades, which has resulted in a huge increase in global food production. \r<br>\r<br>The data: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth\">https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth</a>? \r<br>\r<br>The data shows that global warming is having a dramatic positive effect on crop yields. As an example, the average corn yields (measured in tons per hectare) in the USA since 1940, have INCREASED MORE THAN FIVE-FOLD! We see more or less the same trends in Europe and rest of the world for most of the major food crops. Access to cheap fossil fuel has allowed us to grow food ever more efficient, and against all odds, we are now able to feed the growing world population. Famine is now half of what it was 30 years ago. Only populations without access to fossil fuel are starving today! \r<br>\r<br>The data: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture\">https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture\r</a><br>\r<br>There is a lot more food and wealth per capita now than it used to be, thanks to cheap fossil fuel. And because of this and unprecedented access to cheap fossil fuel during the last 100 years, we are now better off, when it comes to economy, health, education, technology, social equality, war/peace, etc than any time in our known history. We are in a time with more resources and human well-being than ever before. \r<br>\r<br>AND IT&#39;S GETTING BETTER EVERY YEAR! :) \r<br>\r<br>A hundred years ago you were more educated than most if you could read, and wealthier than most if you owned shoes.

We do not orbit the sun in a perfect circle by any axis, in fact no two cycles are the same. These changes as skeptical science points out indeed take long periods of time, though there are times when temperatures on Earth dropped or rose significantly and abruptly.  The last Ice Age lasted for 2.58 million years, and then in a span of 11,700 years thawed out to where we are today.  Putting that into perspective, when we as humans think that we cause significant climate change to this planet that has been enduring consistently and constantly changing climate patterns.  Of course we are more focused on how climate change effects humans and the environment and not the Earth as a whole.  The fact of the matter is that even if we kill all the cows, stop all the factories, eliminate all CO2 emission, we probably wouldn&#39;t put a dent in the current climate patterns.  Significant change to the planet&#39;s climate even if every single one of us adopted a green lifestyle would probably not happen before some other natural disaster.

According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth&#39;s overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years. That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth&#39;s overall temperature 800 years ago, which coincides with the Medieval Warm Period (950-1250 CE). World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to &quot;fight&quot; climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle. What we may need are commercial solutions that will aid in the survival of the human race throughout the coming centuries.

Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15\u00b0C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the &quot;Grenoble analytical setup,&quot; which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).<br><br>Trends<br>There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.<br><br>References<br>Barnola, J.-M., D.

Think of the worse fears you have for life becoming extinct, don&#39;t be afraid to let it all out. A couple weeks ago I had a dream and the final image of this dream, and the only thing I remember was a lava-covered Earth. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s how it would happen.

I do not deny that we are terrible to our planet, but I also do not believe that our factories and CO2 emissions can have the effect that the climate change people say it is having. When a burp from a volcano belches out more CO2 in a single event than mankind and factories belch out over multiple years, I don&#39;t believe we&#39;re solely to blame. I like facts. <br><br><br>For instance, out of all the greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere, only 3.62% is CO2.

The world is getting hotter, by temperature readings across the planet. However, MANY of those temperature systems are built in cities and at airports; places paved and notorious for heat. With the bias for recording temperatures in developed areas, it skews our data. Especially when NASA reported in 2014 that the Antarctic sea ice reached a new record maximum.

I&#39;ll say it again: Correlation does not imply causation. I do not deny that the climate is changing, I do deny that we are the cause.<br><br><br>Finally, if humans are to blame for climate change, how come other planets are going through climate change as well?

And at the end, they turn out and refuse you, and go on in a continuous rampage spreading misinformation.

You tell a right leaning person you want to do away with air travel, planes, and stuff like that, they aren&#39;t going to listen. Instead, talk about how you want to support alternative methods of travel, like beefing up our train travel opportunities by creating a better infrastructure and cheaper travel alternatives. If I could travel by train to Florida from West Virginia (where I live), I would rather do that, but it costs nearly the same. Talk to us about supporting meat alternatives and making those things like The Impossible Burger to be comparatively delicious and maybe even cheaper than beef... That would get my attention!!! Basically, I believe that through enhancement in technology, we will solve many of our energy and environmental issues. If we were able to achieve cold fusion, I think much of the arguments would be moot. We could have a good conversation about how to really cut back on fossil fuels because the energy would still be there. I have many conservative friends who believe the left just wants to send us back to the dark ages, and you talk about being afraid, that scares conservatives.
