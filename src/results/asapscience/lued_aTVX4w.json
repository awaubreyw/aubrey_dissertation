Even so, if you\u2019re willing to spend money on buying plants and you really want to increase lighting conditions (e.g. you live in a basement with little natural light or you want to help promote survival over winter when there is less natural light) you can also probably afford a grow light or you can switch out a bulb with a grow light bulb. Since lighting conditions are passive for the most part (you have light or you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t need to remember to take the freaking sun out) a better quantifier for low maintenance plant is watering and fertilizer schedule and how prone they are to pests", "comment_date": "2021-03-25T14:31:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chicamepa", "comment_text": "So thankful you did and share this!", "comment_date": "2021-03-25T13:45:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edyta \u0141", "comment_text": "Thanks for this video!

Now, WHAT IF,... you had put the plants like in a larger area of soil... their roots would have the room to shoot out, to find nutrients elsewhere.. so my thought process is to imagine having to grow plants while having to live like in a cave  system below the earth surface,.. the roots would be able to search for nutrients that are in the soil from the sun light coming from above...  for example if volcanoes erupted and covered our earth, the sun would not be able to penetrate through and it would kill the crops because of it.. however.. im curious if other rays of light would pass through the soot, so technically the plants could still process photosynthesis, through its root system... i guess what i am trying to say is if your house plants had more soil room to stretch out,.. then they wouldnt become cramped up so quickly.. meaning, while living in the sun, the roots are not needed to branch out when they get what they need from the sun and the water, but if you take away the sun and usual water supply, the roots would shoot out quickly in search of nutrients, which can come from the extra soil.. so it may allow them to last even longer,... ultimately, plants need the nutrients, and if they are confined that limits their ability to go find the nutrients.. and that in and of itself can kill them, not just due to the lack of recieving sunlight.. interesting. so i just blabbered on about my thoughts, and long rant ended,... I am going to research this photosynthesis stuff, which already got started thinking about his 100 M prize for taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,.. so you have just opened up an area of curiosity i had not yet thought about..

In very hot climates the cuticle of the plant is very thick so it can hold water in so it won&#39;t completely die when it does photosynthesis later, because during photosynthesis it will lose some of that water.
