Diabetes and a few other serious illnesses run in my family and yet he still lived as long as he did. One of the problems with modern life is that the nature of most high paying jobs are intellectual but sedentary in nature. Therefore maintaining physical fitness and health requires a time commitment outside of work. Otherwise you&#39;re chances of developing obesity, heart disease and cancer. It&#39;s insane that physical exercise is seen more as a hobby by many than something that you should be doing regularly.

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.<br>- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.<br>- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.<br>- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.<br>- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.<br>- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).<br>- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn\u2019t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. <br><br>Fill the Ravioli shells.<br><br>- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.<br>- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.<br>- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a \u201chomemade\u201d touch as well.<br>- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.<br>- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. <br><br>Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.<br><br>- Roll the dough into two sheets<br>- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.<br>- Fill with the ravioli mixture.<br>- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.<br>- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.<br><br>Cook the Ravioli.<br><br>- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.<br>- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.<br>- If you don&#39;t want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest <br>- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates<br><br>Serve it up.<br>Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy", "comment_date": "2017-07-13T16:17:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "linda xu", "comment_text": "Sucks to have a birthday at dec. 31.
