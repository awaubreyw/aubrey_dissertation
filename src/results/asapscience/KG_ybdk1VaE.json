Humans have been eating full fat dairy products for thousands of years, and they were not dropping dead from heart attacks caused by high cholesterol. In a study when subjects were given vegetable oil and the other group was given dairy products and meat, things did not go as far you would expect.

Fry with oil, cook with oil, have oil as an ingredient to any meal and your adding to the possibility of a heart attack here&#39;s why: when oil becomes heated its becomes Oxidized. you then ingest that and the oxygen atoms stick to almost everything and either causes the cells to become inflamed or killed.

But was it Cholesterols fault? Well, no because if the tear wasn&#39;t there in the first place it wouldn&#39;t have to accumulate in the artery. It&#39;s caused by oxidative damage due to oil in your food. Who knows how long the oil has been sitting in the factory it will most likely have Oxidized.

Many people found it to look unappetizing. Around the late 1880s the manufacturers decided to dye the margarine yellow, so it would sell more. Dairy firms, especially in Wisconsin, became alarmed and succeeded in getting legislation passed to prohibit the coloring of the stark white product. In response, the margarine companies distributed the margarine together with a packet of yellow dye. In 1951 the W. E. Dennison Company received U.S. Patent 2,553,513 for a method to place a capsule of yellow dye inside a plastic package of margarine. <br>During WWII rationing, only two types of margarine were available in the UK, a premium brand and a cheaper budget brand. In recent decades, margarine spreads have gone through many developments in efforts to improve their healthfulness. Most brands have phased out the use of hydrogenated oils, and are now also trans fat free. Many brands have launched refrigerator-stable margarine spreads that contain only 1/3 of the fat and calorie content of traditional spreads. Other varieties of spreads include those with added Omega-3 fatty acids, those with low or no salt, those with added plant sterols, claimed to reduce blood cholesterol, and some made from olive oil or certified vegan oils. <br>Commonly, the natural oils are hydrogenated by passing hydrogen through the oil in the presence of a nickel catalyst, under controlled conditions. The addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated bonds (alkenic double C=C bonds) results in saturated C-C bonds, effectively increasing the melting point of the oil and thus &quot;hardening&quot; it.. This method is used today for some margarines although the process has been developed and sometimes other metal catalysts are used such as palladium. If hydrogenation is incomplete (partial hardening), the relatively high temperatures used in the hydrogenation process tend to flip some of the carbon-carbon double bonds into the &quot;trans&quot; form. If these particular bonds aren&#39;t hydrogenated during the process, they remain present in the final margarine in molecules of trans fats, the consumption of which has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. <br>If no solid fats are added to the vegetable oils, the latter undergo a full or partial hydrogenation process to solidify them. The resulting blend is mixed with water, citric acid, carotenoids, vitamins and milk powder. Emulsifiers such as lecithin help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil, and salt and preservatives are also commonly added. This oil-and-water emulsion is then heated, blended, and cooled. The softer tub margarines are made with less hydrogenated, more liquid, oils than block margarines. <br>Margarine, particularly polyunsaturated margarine, has become a major part of the Western diet and had overtaken butter in popularity in the mid-20th century. In the United States, for example, in 1930, the average person ate over 18 lb (8.2 kg) of butter a year and just over 2 lb (0.91 kg) of margarine. By the end of the 20th century, an average American ate around 5 lb (2.3 kg) of butter and nearly 8 lb (3.6 kg) of margarine.<br>Margarine has a particular market value to those who observe the Jewish dietary laws of Kashrut, which forbids the mixing of meat and dairy products, hence there are strictly Kosher non-dairy margarines available. These are often used by the Kosher consumer to adapt recipes that use meat and butter or in baked goods served with meat meals. The 2008 Passover margarine shortage in America caused much consternation within the Kosher-observant community.&quot; See Wiki &quot;Margarine, by contrast, has always been much worse for you than its profit-grabbing manufacturers have ever been prepared to admit. In the early days, it was made with &#39;hydrogenated fats&#39;, which were so dense that solid concrete couldn&#39;t have done a better job of blocking your coronary arteries. Honestly, this stuff was lethal. Confronted with irrefutable \u00acevidence, the food-processing giants reluctantly went back to their laboratories and reformulated their product. This time, they boasted, \u00acmargarine would be made with &#39;interesterified&#39; vegetable oils (a treatment that re\u00acarranges the fat molecules under high temperature and pressure, using enzymes or acids as catalysts). It made the oils less dense and therefore, they hoped, less \u00acdamaging to our health. Why we should believe the manufacturers a second time around I haven&#39;t a clue \u2014 especially as they never took responsibility for the tremendous damage they had done to global health with their hydrogenated fats \u2014 which are now banned in parts of the U.S. because of the concerns about the effects they have on our health. The best part of 20 years on, the components of margarine, or &#39;spreads&#39; as food processors prefer to call them, may have changed, but the arguments over their impact on health have not. Take the so-called cholesterol-busting spreads such as Benecol and Flora ProActiv. Yes, they use plant chemicals \u2014 sterols and stanols \u2014 to reduce cholesterol \u00aclevels, but they do so at a time when long-held beliefs on cholesterol are beginning to look as shaky as those about saturated fats.&quot;See <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2274747/At-truth-Butter-GOOD--margarine-chemical-gunk.htmlHowever\">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2274747/At-truth-Butter-GOOD--margarine-chemical-gunk.htmlHowever</a> I would recommend butter made from organic farming.

If you  notice a more crisp garlic bread then odds are that was cooked with butter and not margarine ..<br><br>now margarine has its good points also , for coatings , buffalo wings for example , the coating made with margarine seems to coat better because the oils don&#39;t break down with heat as cream in butter does therefore coating better .but the butter based one can leave the wings more crisp .<br><br>don&#39;t mean to get gross here but notice which one, insects might tend to flutter around the butter or margarine .. natural things only get attracted to natural foods , what the body is better to digest , there for here butter would be on the insect diet leaving the margarine usually insect free  ..

In fact, the many properties of butter make it a very slimming food, including its content of all the fat-soluble vitamins (especially if it is raw and grass-fed), as well as all of the fats that are necessary for proper absorption/assimilation of these vitamins, which means that yes, saturated fat is actually good for you if it is in the context of a natural animal fat. It&#39;s very interesting to me that the makers of this video didn&#39;t bother fact-checking the lipid hypothesis of heart disease, which is wrought with manipulated data and only correlative associations (that are based off of the manipulated data). The fact is that there is literally zero evidence to suggest that the structure of saturated fat, which is not solid in your body since it melts as soon as it hits your tongue, damages arteries, in fact, it is protective of the heart. There is a good layer of saturated fat surrounding the heart to be used as energy in times of crisis. The surfactant of the lungs is made up of entirely saturated fat. You cannot avoid saturated fat. If you do not consume it, your body is going to use whatever it can to make them (i.e. excess carbohydrates). They make up 50% of the phospholipid portion of cell membranes and give good integrity to each cell. Trans fats found in margarine, however, are beyond unnatural. There is no single food product out there that will clog your arteries faster. Why? The oil itself does not behave in the same way that saturated fat does in the body and is actually turns rancid during processing, acting as a free radical that does indeed damage whatever it comes into contact with, which includes the endothelium (lining of arteries). It is a completely unnatural product. Butter has been eaten for thousands of years, and if it is as toxic as it supposedly is, why are we all here? Wouldn&#39;t it have given everybody heart disease? Nope. Refined carbohydrates and an avoidance of animal products did that. Try eating grass-fed butter with your meals and notice the difference in satiety and fullness that you feel.
