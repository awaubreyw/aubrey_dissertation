As you know, eating even moderate carbohydrates and even most proteins will raise blood sugar and insulin, which gives us short-term energy but then a huge crash and tiredness. Have you thought about doing a comparison video about fasting for at least 14 hours (not including sleep time) and then staying up all night and maybe even continuing to fast into the next morning? <br>As someone who for the health benefits &quot;intermittent fasts&quot; (does not eat or drink any calories) for 16-19 hours most days (though that includes about 7 hours of sleep), I almost always feel very energetic and mentally alert while not eating. That&#39;s because my body and brain are now used to burning ketones over glucose. It&#39;s only after I start eating high-carb foods that I can get a sudden sugar rush and insulin spike, and then start feeling tired. (To avoid that, when time to start eating, it greatly helps to start with a whey protein drink and then high-fat, low-carb foods -- saving the higher carb foods for evening.) That said, I don&#39;t recommend anyone jump into fasting for that long without slowly building up to that level over a period of several weeks or a few months like I did. <br>But if you are willing to try that, it would be interesting to see how you guys feel while staying awake and not eating, instead of eating. Just be sure to stay hydrated with zero-calorie water or herbal tea (8 oz of black coffee is okay with just one calorie). And in the water or tea, it helps to add electrolytes (pink salt for sodium and cream of tartar for potassium), plus a dash of lemon juice and/or apple cider vinegar (both zero calories) for better pH. And before  or when you start eating, also adding a dash of cinnamon helps to control the blood sugar rush from food. If you&#39;ve already done a video where you tried fasting for a day, I&#39;m sorry if I somehow missed it. Otherwise, would love to hear your thoughts, or anyone else who does time-condensed eating, or wants to try it!  :D", "comment_date": "2019-09-24T12:11:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shay Kitoffe", "comment_text": "The longest I&#39;ve ever been awake is 4 days.

Our cells use the circulatory system to ferry fuel to the cells and waste out; but, it can only handle small molecules; so, our body uses the Lymphatic system to carry the larger (slower moving) molecules.  The challenge is the cells in the brain don&#39;t have access to the Lymphatic system (or at least we didn&#39;t think they did).  In a Scientific American article I ready they found that the brain did have a system similar to the Lymphatic system called the Glyphatic system; but, it was kind of hidden and it only operates when we sleep.  No sleep, not drain.  Sort of like a plug in your septic system, you may not notice it at first; but, if it stays plugged long enough, YOU WILL notice it.
