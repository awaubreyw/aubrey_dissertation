Drink water first thing in the morning (16oz should be enough for most people), especially before coffee. Drink 8+ ounces water before and after each (major) meal. As a guideline, eat 75% of the portion sizes you normally would for foods with high caloric density (fats and carbohydrates, generally; so consider how beef and chicken are thought of as &quot;protein&quot;, look at their total macronutrient profile and notice the fat content), and worry less about low caloric density foods like fibrous low-starch vegetables (without butter or oils), such as broccoli. Have that meal-ending glass of water and wait 20 minutes. If you&#39;re actually still hungry at that point, eg: maybe you had a really draining workout, you could consider having that other 25% of the food. <br><br>Remember, fat loss is a long game.

Don\u2019t know but would guess about 18% body fat. Decently larger person.  I also really pay attention to what I eat because I have realized in a week where I don\u2019t workout, if I am over 1,800cals per day, I gain weight very consistently.  Googling average male calories burned per day would give you an answer of 2,500, me being a larger person would suggest my average would be above that.   That is not the case for me as I have found out. <br><br><br>I think a good thing to mention in this video would be, your body is not going to put on weight if it doesn\u2019t have extra energy to store.

Yes everyone is different at how they process foods.  <br><br>But gut biome changes don\u2019t happen overnight.  And if you eat a relatively consistent diet (ie don\u2019t switch from a bread and pasta diet to a keto no carbs diet), and you pay attention to how many calories you eat and how your weight adjusts to that.  You can definitely still find a base metric for yourself to judge how you\u2019re doing on a certain day.  And this can be very helpful to keeping your weight where you want it to be. It\u2019s by no means a perfect metric.   But it is much much much much easier and able to be put into practice then trying to figure out how each food is going to effect you individually as you eat it from white bread to wheat bread to cashews to peanuts to strawberries to chicken, etc etc etc etc etc etc and coming to a useful conclusion that way.  <br><br>My personal opinion is that considering that over abundance of data just makes the task impossible for 99% of people outside health nut extremists.  And suggesting that as a practice is ultimately going to do more harm than good. <br><br><br>Figure out how your body uses energy.  What keeps you stable.  And then adjust around that as much as you can to gain/lose weight as you like.   Yes again, it is not perfect by any means.

You start to understand that 500 calories of pasta won&#39;t actually make you feel fuller longer, and that you&#39;d do better to spread out those 500 calories across fruits, vegetables, proteins, and carbs.

You&#39;ll realize that 50 calories of candy is a great afternoon treat, but you don&#39;t need 300 calories of it to appreciate the enjoyment it brings. Counting calories helps you with portion size. <br><br>Counting calories should be encouraged as a way to intelligently monitor the food you eat and help you change your relationship with food, and the choices you make, and to better understand how you want to feel on a daily basis.

Because biochemically your body doesn&#39;t deal with calories. It deals with carbs, proteins, fats, and nutrients. In biochemistry, you even don&#39;t find the word &quot;calorie&quot; because it is pointless and doesn&#39;t tell what your body stores and how it is used.<br>So &quot;calories in &gt; calories burned = weight gain&quot; is a big misconception in all three parts of the equation.<br>It&#39;s all about carbs and fats (but mostly carbs). And as you pointed out - processed food makes it really easy for the body to process those extra carbs because your body doesn&#39;t need to burn more energy to extract glucose and nutrients from them. And &quot;fast carbs&quot; (processed foods, added sugars, etc) are the core of all the evil. Too much of those carbs will get you a fun ride on glucose levels roller coaster triggering high insulin resistance which in turns stores those carbs as &quot;fat&quot; and in the long run you gain chronic insulin resistance which in turn will make you eat more.<br><br>So in the end, weight gain/loss is defined by your hormones, and hormones are influenced by what type of food (read &quot;carbs&quot;) you eat.<br>A calorie count may give you some info on the energy potential of the food but it won&#39;t tell you if you eat more of this food you&#39;ll gain weight. <br><br>As an example: it is really hard to gain weight from eating 200g of beef alone but it becomes easy if you replace it with calorie equivalent cookies. Because you won&#39;t gain any carbs from beef, only proteins and fats and proteins are not used for energy. Even more - it&#39;ll take a lot of time and energy for your body to process that beef.

First, counting calories will assure you that you do not get into a \u2018weigh loss plateau.\u2019  For 2 months I was frustrated after not being able to lose fat 6 months into my journey.  A dietitian evaluated my meal plan and said \u201cyou are not eating enough\u201d which dumbfounded my logic.  So I increased my calorie intake by 400 more calories and the fat loss steadily picked up again for another 8 months and I plateau-d again but I ended up at my target weight loss of 100 lbs.  At this point I increased my caloric intake by another 400 - 700 calories to maintain my weight of 185 and have done so for the past 8 months. Second, in order to make calories count, you need to eat the right foods, especially since it does not take that many calories to maintain weight let alone lose weight.  Third, the key to weight loss and health management is you managing your hormones to ideal targets - your body is very efficient and storing or burning fat - you just need to turn on the burning fat path through managing your hormones (melatonin, IhG, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, glucagon, cortisol, etc.).  There is no \u201cperfect\u201d diet or calorie number to managing your calories, but counting calories for me has allowed me to learn more about foods available so that when I do eat I maximize my nutritional benefit per calorie and helps me in assuring my daily macros are balanced out.", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T12:00:20Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Taped Ape", "comment_text": "Great Vid\ud83e\udd0c", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T10:03:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "teraxiel", "comment_text": "This guy is insufferable", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T09:20:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doctor Manganate", "comment_text": "The video was nice besides the casual racism.", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T08:59:30Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Damon242", "comment_text": "Another issue is the general ignorance of insulin and it\u2019s role with blood sugar and fat stores", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T04:03:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Baconcatboy", "comment_text": "Counting calories but also making sure you know the vitamins and nutrients your getting is very important", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T03:08:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mongojr 2618", "comment_text": "So I&#39;m screwed. \ud83e\udd74 I use the dieting advice on the back of nutrition panel.

Each person is vastly different than the next. I don&#39;t have any food allergies, but if I eat any amount of rice or dairy I&#39;ll immediately gain 5lbs. I&#39;m a 6ft tall built male who exercises 5hrs daily and I eat less than 1200 calories a day (all home prepared, no fast food, microwave, or junk) and only a single meal and I don&#39;t drop below 185lbs. I lose weight when I eat McDonalds which is once every 3-4 months (probably because my diet is otherwise lacking fatty foods and other things found in fast foods). I suspect that sodium plays a big role on weight gain as well, but haven&#39;t properly tested it on myself yet.<br>I believe that everyone is being told to eat way too much, too often, at the wrong times, and that they eat foods that their body immediately turns into weight gain even if it doesn&#39;t have the same affect on other people. I believe that adult bodies have grown so efficient at energy management that they hardly need to eat at all. I also believe that weight gain is a display of weakness and stupidity and that its something people should feel inclined to manage. Obviously people go through at least one fat phase in their life, but they should never get stuck in that phase. I peaked at 210lbs.<br>But ya anyway, your diet isn&#39;t something you can learn from other people and its not as simple as avoiding something like calories or fat. You have to learn how your body reacts to different foods and pay attention to know when something is causing weight gain or weight loss. You might be able to double your calorie intake and lose weight if your weight is caused by one or two food items that your body doesn&#39;t process normally. I could gain 50lbs in two months with just milk and rice. I&#39;ll gain 5lbs for days if my parents make rice one time when I visit (they don&#39;t have to know that).

Even subtle differences in amount of ingredients used in any particular \u201cbatch\u201d of food varies a bit. The point is to get a rough idea of just how many calories you\u2019re eating. This is critical information if you want or need to lose weight. No matter which diet you are following, if you eat more calories than you need, you will gain weight, if you eat just enough, you will stay the same weight, and if you eat less, you will lose weight. That\u2019s a constant that never changes in weight loss. Obviously there\u2019s TONS more to it than just that. Sure, you could technically eat 1800 calories of candy every day and as long as you burned more than that in a day, you\u2019d lose weight, but for many reasons, including everything outlined in this video, that isn\u2019t really the best idea. You\u2019ll be hungry all the time, you\u2019ll probably lose just as much muscle as fat when you do lose weight, your blood sugar will spike stressing your pancreas, your micro biome will change, and you won\u2019t get any of the nutrients your body needs not to mention mental fog, mood swings etc. You can also be sure your body will digest and absorb close to 100% of the calories in the candy. But you will lose weight, there\u2019s no question about that. So use calorie counting for what it\u2019s meant to do, help you lose weight. Same goes for the other extreme. If you eat 2500 calories of fruit and veggies, you\u2019d be extremely full, but you\u2019d also gain weight if you didn\u2019t burn that many calories for the day. You need to eat healthy foods as much as possible, and calorie counting helps you figure out what you can and can\u2019t eat on your journey. Can you afford to eat a little cake? You want to consume more protein, will that push you over your calorie budget? If so, will you have to find more protein dense foods? Basically, choose a diet that\u2019s specific to your needs whether it\u2019s blood sugar control, overall health, lowering cholesterol levels, lowering blood pressure, living longer, building muscle etc. and then if losing weight is also one of your goals, you can use calorie counting to help you budget your food in a way that will allow you to lose weight.", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T20:32:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karly", "comment_text": "It is a little confusing but it does work if you do it right.

There\u2019s SO much more than just calories themselves, like your individual micro biome, the actual macronutrients you\u2019re eating, and so much more, so the best thing to do before choosing whether or not to or not to count calories or whatever is figure out how these things work and what things will benefit you based on YOUR needs.
