After 100 hours no food/no water, I can&#39;t even lose any weight! My body weight stays the same! Weight loss starts showing on the scales only after the 5th or 6th day of no food intake whatsoever. Then I do 14 days NO FOOD, (but drink natural diluted lemon juice) to get all accumulated fat cells off the body tissue lining (FAT CELLS ARE THE REAL CAUSE OF CANCER).

I didn&#39;t actually like food except fruit then sometime later my mom started making grill cheese sandwiches with meat on them so I ate those at least 3-2 times a week(one sandwich per day), the only ACTUAL, food I ate. I think I only did this with the grill cheese sandwich for a month then I got tired of eating. I was never underweight, but I was skinny. I think all my water came from my fruit since I used to always have them rinsed off like your supposed to. I ate strawberries, every once in a while apple, canned fruit cocktail, and I think canned peaches, but mainly fruit cocktail. I would sometimes lick some of the juice from it. I only ate fruit every 2-3 days. I didn&#39;t really like drinking juice, but I liked it, but barely drank it. I preferred water since it was light and it didn&#39;t feel all heavy with junk. My mom just gave up on trying to convince me to eat the food she cook, well I guess had (if she even cooked; didn&#39;t feel like she did). The reason I didn&#39;t eat was one my mom couldn&#39;t cook and two I didn&#39;t like eating food mainly because of her. The only good food she made was grilled cheese sandwiches with meat. Btw I sat outside everyday from like 6am-10pm playing with worms. I never felt dehydrated, but went I did i was just a little thirsty and didn&#39;t feel like getting up (I also didn&#39;t know where the cups or even where to get the water beside the bathroom sink since I didn&#39;t actually associate myself with the kitchen). A few minutes later I wasn&#39;t thirsty anymore, got all my energy back, and felt like as if I just took a few sips of water which I didn&#39;t. I would go a few days without drinking and when I did drink I just took half a mouth wash cap full of water. If I ate fruit it would be sometimes the whole can which I ate once a day. I was very energetic, healthy, and had no problems at all. Later in life I tried to start drinking more water. I usually drink like between half to a full bottle of water a day. My body can&#39;t take much water because it&#39;s not used to it and if you don&#39;t believe me hear this. If I tried to drink 2 water bottles full of water within 2 hours I would have to go to the bathroom all day literally every 20 mins. I literally pissed out all water. It just shock straight out me like a violently, high pressure gyster the second I got my pants off literally just water (I know too much detail). It was clearer than the toilet water. I felt my body draining out all the water it just consumed. This would go on for the next few days which decreased to 30-40mins. This happened a few years ago. I tried again like 2 years ago, but drank less water within a hour and went every 25mins for a few hours. Now my body can with stand more, but if I drink like 3 water bottles within 20mins I will be running to the bathroom constantly for days. I&#39;m healthy today too with lots of leg muscle, btw I&#39;m a 17year old girl", "comment_date": "2015-05-10T01:11:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sachee Records", "comment_text": "So not drinking makes you h2o delirious ", "comment_date": "2015-05-08T12:39:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colten Soffen", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t drink water", "comment_date": "2015-05-08T01:35:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suha Mahmood", "comment_text": "*laughs nervously and goes to drink water", "comment_date": "2015-05-04T18:53:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YUNG FAVELA", "comment_text": "Why can&#39;t we use water on the ocean for factories?

The brain <b>must</b> be bathed lavishly in cerebral fluid and is constantly robbing other less important areas of your body for water.
