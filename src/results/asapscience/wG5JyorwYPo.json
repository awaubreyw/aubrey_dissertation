Many factors, such as personality, guilt, fear, health and one\u2019s environment, will determine the direction and the degree of the shift of the Assemblage Point. However, in users of such drugs, the general direction of the shift is towards the left side. The larger the dose, the greater the shift and the more exaggerated the experience becomes. \r<br>\r<br>When the effects of the drug have worn off, the Assemblage Point can relocate at a detrimental position and angle. Since the Assemblage Point location determines how we behave and how we feel, using these drugs can cause a sudden change in personality with the physical and psychological symptoms associated with the new location manifesting. Shifting the Assemblage Point back to the position before the drug was taken will generally correct the situation. Patients suffering long term Assemblage Point misalignment caused by drugs may require several shifts over a period of months. They may also require supportive psychological therapy to assist in the stabilisation of their Assemblage Point. \r<br>\r<br>Anyone experimenting with or researching the effects of hallucinogenic drugs should be aware that their Assemblage Point location will be affected. Therefore they should keep detailed records of the Assemblage Point location, before and after drug experiences. Clinicians using these types of drugs for psychological and psychiatric research will accelerate their research programmes by taking into consideration the patient\u2019s Assemblage Point location. Without such considerations, research and therapies using hallucinogenic drugs are irresponsible and unethical....From the Published Book: The Catalyst Of Power - The Assemblage Point Of Man - By Jon Whale.

And I think with once a month or two use of it and my addiction would&#39;ve faded away as you realize what is really beautiful about this world and yourself. Biggest thing it&#39;s been teaching me is to be in control of my environment and to prioritize my self before others, not selfishly but not me last and everyone else first.  Each time I have a good time and it tells me b4 we meet again you need to fix this, and gives me a specific problem to solve in my life. When I tell people how good it is they think i&#39;m talking about the high, yes that is the best one of those i&#39;ve ever experienced but that&#39;s not why I use drugs. I use them to get a different perspective and to explore my consciousness which we hide so subliminally without knowing it. Also if you have problems it will make you deal with them, and it won&#39;t let you say  maybe tomorrow or not right now. However it also has your back like it&#39;s not going to let you get hurt, it&#39;s like you talking to you or at least it is for me.  Does some stuff get scary yes but be curious and remember you want answers more than you are scared of the unknown. Also I took 2 and some vitamin c which boosts the effects and it was kind of like watching TV, the dramatic show is only on for about 5-10 minutes b4 you get a commercial break and a point of homeostasis for being that high.  N you will get used to it because it lasts 8-12 hours so there&#39;s no getting out once you&#39;re in but that serotonin should prevent you from worrying about too much.  All my hallucinations were good except for one where I kept feeling like there was someone behind me, I kept looking around and nobody would be there, and then I got mad and I said yo what&#39;s your problem. Then the room went red like a horror movie and these alabaster dudes in black capes were all around me they pointed to me and said you.  And then it ended and I took a thc break to calm down.  But I think what it was saying that I am my own problem, and the fear of being judged was represented by the shadowy figures.

Just like weed, I can seem harmless but it\u2019s not for everyone and it can definitely alter lives.", "comment_date": "2022-04-03T21:32:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jacob garcia", "comment_text": "This stopped me from smoking weed", "comment_date": "2022-04-03T20:13:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UTE_SPORES ON INSTAGRAM", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46look up that handle, he ships swiftly, and he got shrooms, Dmt, lsd, mmda, psilocybin, chocolate bars, he&#39;s got a lot.. \ud83c\udf44 \ud83d\udc8a\ud83c\udf44\ud83c\udf6b\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd0c.....", "comment_date": "2022-04-02T21:10:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AceClappedYT", "comment_text": "Hey guys please if you haven\u2019t taken acid aka LSD and want to don\u2019t let the video fool you and here are some things todo and not do. One you will not see deadass monkey or gorillas dancing around you talking that doesn\u2019t happened acid is a Sci-fi drug trip you\u2019ll get glitchy vision towards the end of your trip and everything will be wavy and moving next if you are taking acid you need to be alcohol free all day scientists and researchers are unaware of acid and alcohol mixing and it can have negative affects on your body possible death too. Next I recommend taking acid at 9pm so your trip ends at around 3am this way you can sleep easy after sense you\u2019ll probably be exhausted. I recommend staying away from stairs and mirrors Many ppl I know including me have seen extremely bad things looking into mirrors this is usually shadow figures standing be hind us or we see something move in a corner. Also when taking this I recommend either in your room if your are a teenager and please have minimum 4 bottles of water and some snacks. If your a adult feel free to be around your house but still avoid stairs. Also if you start having a bad trip I recommend listening to Tame Impala I will leave a link to my playlist at the end of this comment you should also drink water because it will help calm you down and to avoid having a bad trip for your first time or at all have a positive mind set while taking it and being on it. Also if you start feeling in love with yourself and thinking of past lovers please do not go trying to get back with them this is a goodway to get into a depressed trip than have a Ego Suicide this is when you realize there is no point to life and it\u2019s not worth living I know a lot of people who have died do to this. So please spare yourself the bad trip and enjoy the acid :)) <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/64vyCyWo2gMIQ17u7bd1aX?si=Lw_EtJRkR1m7HDopYFKFFA\">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/64vyCyWo2gMIQ17u7bd1aX?si=Lw_EtJRkR1m7HDopYFKFFA</a> also theres my playlist", "comment_date": "2022-04-02T05:43:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kamen Neikoo", "comment_text": "I got pshychosis from a trip.

If you think positive and look on the brighter side of life, It&#39;s exhilarating. I have had trips where i laughed so long that my stomach was sore in the morning, but if you succumb to your fears, it can be hell. Overdosing or taking impure LSD can also increase the risk. First time, take less rather than more, pretend you are going on a real trip. Be relaxed and when it comes on, let it wash over you like a wave. Just ride it and keep your spirits up. It will accentuate anything you do. You will peak for a time and then gradually wind down. During the peak, you can become like ADHD. You might listen to music, then want to look at the sky, because you want to experience everything. It will basically reflect your state of mind or even things you read or think about before you take it. It kinda gently overpowers you. Take smooth breaths and relax. Be with people you trust. Don&#39;t take it too often cos it does loosen you up a bit and you can become a little too free for this limited world. It&#39;s best in small doses and done infrequently. A peaceful country setting is much preferable to the business of a city, especially for first timers. Being in a tranquil setting and appreciating the beauty of the world.

Took 3 tabs so used to taking that much and ended up dying inside my own head. Not dying like bad but I couldn&#39;t escape my thoughts.

Constipated calling a friend to help me through it but it was late. I couldn&#39;t tell where I began and ended.

The detailed death images were terrifying, kaleidoscopes of death, magots, and more. But telling yourself it&#39;ll be ok and accepting it was the only escape.

I had experience taking ALL kinds of things before so I had gained a pretty sharp clarity and could be on pretty much anything in the book but appear normal if I wanted to.  So I was intrigued by the drug.  When I tried it, there were no &quot;hallucinations&quot; in the way you think about them.  You don&#39;t see things that aren&#39;t there or any of that.  My mental acuity was sharp, I was not &quot;high&quot;.  What I noticed though is that it completely eliminates the mental filter that we all take for granted.  Normally, there are all these things going on around us and we have those things slotted into a sort of &quot;matrix of meaning&quot;.  A table is a table, a chair is a chair, we subconsciously know what these things are and our brain is constantly slotting them into their proper little box through this filter.  Our brain is running all of subroutines in the background.  But LSD completely eliminates that filter.  I would see something and it wouldn&#39;t get slotted anywhere, it&#39;s like that inherent understanding of what was around me was gone.  If I wasn&#39;t absolutely concentrating on an object and remembering what it&#39;s regular role is, it could &quot;change&quot; into something else.  For a brief moment, I thought my laptop cables were moving in the corner of my eye and I assumed it was a snake.  Just for a split second.  I had to try very hard to keep my &quot;normal&quot; state of thought, it was much more difficult maintaining that than anything I&#39;d ever been on.  It took an incredible amount of effort.  So what I&#39;m saying is that this is not normally a drug you want to try if you&#39;re by yourself, ESPECIALLY without experience..  Some people could flip out and do something to hurt themselves.<br><br>What LSD does, in the end, is that it reveals what is inside of you.  Without your brain filtering everything based on experiences/habits/etc., the only thing that&#39;s left is your subconscious thoughts brimming to the surface and those inform you of what&#39;s going on around you.  It&#39;s an incredible journey of self-discovery because it can reveal things inside of you that you didn&#39;t know where there, which is why this drug can be used to cure people from all kinds of addictions and trauma by revealing the deep-seated reasons for those problems in the first place.", "comment_date": "2021-09-02T19:43:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarena holder", "comment_text": "omg like omg perfect", "comment_date": "2021-09-02T13:58:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dipak Bagda", "comment_text": "I wanna try it.

It has a start and a finish. Literally has an end game boss, a major boss battle of epic proportions, with an absolute joy and satisfaction awaiting its completion. <br><br>Once this boss is defeated, it all ceases. Every single thing stops. All visuals, all extra sensations, all vibrations, all changes to sound, the immense field of energy felt within and around you, everything stops. You can 100% defeat the LSD game, in an instant once the final battle with your biggest Demon, your own self, the curtains are drawn, the play ends, the credits roll, you collect the extra achievements and expanded dlc and its result is permanent, its result settles in your soul, FOREVER. <br>Lsd literally stops working after the endgame level battle, with a literal Thanos onslaught of epic proportions<br> The first time it will happen would be  mid trip or towards end of trip. Then the next time you do Lsd, because of \u201cself muscle memory\u201d you renter the state it,  then lsd doesn\u2019t work from the get go, you can take 8 tabs or 15 tabs and it\u2019s like 1/2 a tabs experience. <br>Everything that used to happen completely ceases, every amazing,  infinite fractal stops, colours calm down completely, sound stays normal, your body is under no energetic or vibratory influence. <br>You\u2019d think you broke something. You will be confused. You\u2019d have had some serious battles with yourself to get to this point, yet from here something new starts, a new journey filled with such wonderful joys experiences, here in you play the complete game and get the epic achievements and top it off the Expanded DLC, once the extras in the state of normality are collected, that prize is permanent in daily life. <br><br><br>If you have been using lsd for sometime and are still getting this amazing lovey visuals and experiences, then you need to up your game. All you are doing is playing the same exact levels of the game over and over, You are not taking it seriously. Lsd is a tool for the mastery of self, if it\u2019s squandered on having just fun, partying or raving, it\u2019s wasted completely. No person is fulfilled playing 1 repetitious level in a game. The satisfaction is the entire beautiful heartbreaking love story to its end, such a glorious ending of a game, written by the heavens itself, just for you, All for you. <br><br>Lsd is a serious tool, a tool to teach the human about its own absolute true nature. Tabbing 1/2/3/4 is a waste of time. Up thy game and start at 5 minimum. Up it towards 8-10 so all the serious lessons come into play if 5 isn\u2019t doing it after 3 goes. <br>8-10 tabs is like 12 rounds with Mike Tyson and he ain\u2019t got no gloves, so the self will get a serious kickboxing that it so truly needs.<br><br>Once you\u2019ve defeated your final boss and completed the game, the veil breaks open, the curtains are drawn, the end credits roll and you will have attained somthing you cannot understand with the mind. <br>The first time it may occur, the cessation of all visuals and everything goes back to normal it would have been maybe half way through or towards the end of the trip. <br>At first one may not know what to do with this. <br>The next time you take a trip, you realise, it\u2019s finished, all the visuals are gone, now you have 8-12 hours of semi 1 tab visuals, ie nothing. Barely a warping leaf just colour and contrast turned up in your field of vision. <br><br>Yet from here are the end game missions for those epic achievements, and in this state befalls a person different states of light knowledge. Experiences that are impossible to put into words, flow into your heart in the form of light. The ultimate truths of reality are revealed to you. There is an awakening that happens to your soul, so much tears and joy descend upon you. <br>The secret that is etched into your heart is and will remain permanent. Lsd or no lsd. A living knowledge settles inside you that cannot be shaken at all. The state you are in on the lsd at endgame is the state you live with permanently, but you really need to go to the end, you know when everyday you are in the same state of joy with complete power and control of ego mind. <br><br>Some will call this experience <br>Complete annihilation <br>True Oneness <br>nirvana <br>Buddha <br>Christ consciousness <br>The Muhamadan Reality <br>Awakening <br>Enlightenment <br>Freedom <br>Bliss joy ecstasy <br><br>If you are a player, then for once play the game properly, it must be taken seriously, follow basic steps :<br><br>Prepare the mind and listen to :<br>Alan watts , pramahansa yogananda, mooji, sadhguru, krishnamurti, shunyamurti, ram das,  all religious scriptures are truth and one must start to understand the metaphors properly in their full wisdom which the alone teacher will make light of. <br><br>Intention: you main question and intention is \u201c who am I ?\u201d (The above list should have prepared you) <br><br>When tripping, do alone or with one or two people who are in the same exact vibe. <br><br>Go to nature, have an open view and good lighting, take some seats. <br><br>For music only have classical (highly recommend Ludovico Einaudi) or just silence. <br><br>Maintain silence for periods of 1.5-2 hours at a time before taking again for 10-20 mins. <br><br>In your silent moments, try see that there are layers of reality and try to keep peeling them, these are layers of the mind. Keep going at it. Keep letting no no matter what. <br><br>If the body wants to fidget then tell it to shut up, you should know you have power over it. Keep persevering <br><br>At one point you will notice you are once with everything, keep going, then you will notice your face in everything, try to learn and understand the lessons of these states as you are in them  ,keep going and then completely let go of all self. . <br>An experience will befall you that word will never do justice. This is where you learn your story, THE BEST STORY EVER TOLD. <br><br>Do 2 to 3 more trips and then learn within that state of no visuals etc how to master the state and learn where in the body it resides, once this FINAL EPIC ACHIEVEMENT is unlocked, is is permanent in you heart and lsd is a thing of the past, unless you just require extra downloads now, but that\u2019s a whole new conversation, let\u2019s leave it there as it should be enough for the freedom joy bliss and LOVE you\u2019ve been looking for without knowing it, but you will know it. <br><br><br> Love and Light to All from the Infinite Creator", "comment_date": "2021-04-08T19:30:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cole carabott", "comment_text": "I will take my first acid tab friday", "comment_date": "2021-04-08T00:29:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZxcHxrt", "comment_text": "im quite experienced with lsd but i dont think it changed my perception on life or anything to that degree. yet again i\u2019ve been taking it since i was 12.", "comment_date": "2021-04-08T00:16:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "krumpent", "comment_text": "Everyone reading this comment <br>If you find yourself in a bad trip it&#39;s because there is something wrong with your mind, alot of times people get stuck in mind loops because you&#39;re tripping and not letting go, therefore your mind is stuck ina loop of tripping remembering everything over and over, let go while tripping and go inside your mind, if you don&#39;t let ego death take over you will go insane, that&#39;s what leads people to killing themselves", "comment_date": "2021-04-07T19:37:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Malicious Muppet", "comment_text": "They forgot to mention night vision.<br>You get night vision.<br>Or rather.<br>From experience<br>Enhanced low light sensitivity.<br><br>I will try and experiment with dosage on hunting trips where you start at like 2 in the morning.<br><br>I would imagine it helpful up north when its darkness for most of the day.", "comment_date": "2021-04-07T07:41:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brbishjr", "comment_text": "Messed up watching this on LSD\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude4c", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T14:52:44Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Stan iX", "comment_text": "I\u2019m on lsd right now", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T14:10:31Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Damien", "comment_text": "fact checking, there is no flashbacks that occur with lsd, it is a myth and im suprised they let this one through, you would think they would do more research before making a video when they are this popular", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T05:54:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ephemera", "comment_text": "I took acid yesterday.

They are the Molecules that comprise our Consciousness. All True Psychedelics are the Molecular Structures of Pure Consciousness. The human body synthesizes it\u2019s own Consciousness (the DMT &amp; 5-MeO-DMT found in humans). The human body then metabolizes the Consciousness that it is producing. The amount of the endogenous Consciousness that the human body is able to metabolize depends on many factors. The less pollutants, poison &amp; other contaminants present in the body will result in the ability to metabolize more of the Consciousness that body is producing.\u00a0 Likewise, the more pollution, contaminants and poison a body has inside of it the less Consciousness it is able to metabolize. Here is a list of some of the most common poisons that humans ingest regularly which interferes with a human body metabolizing the Consciousness that it produces, as well as any Consciousness that is ingested from external sources:<br>alcohol, nicotine, sugar, caffeine, amphetamines, dissociatives, tranquilizers, flouride, and a plethora of other drugs are just some of the substances that interfere with humans metabolizing their own Consciousness.\u00a0 <br><br>\u201cEven the priests who regularly come near to the Lord must purify themselves\u201d.<br>(Exodus 19:22)<br><br>The following substances are NOT Psychedelics:<br>mdma<br>ketamine<br>salvia<br>kratom<br>dipt<br>pcp<br>datura/jimson weed<br>dxm<br><br>There are others . . . . . . .\u00a0<br>Any True Psychedelic will proclaim this Truth if you ask Them. \u00a0<br><br>The following substances are True Psychedelics - They are Alive, Omnicient Living Beings of Light:\u00a0 <br>DMT<br>5-MeO-DMT<br>LSD<br>Mescaline<br>Ibogaine<br>Psilocin<br>Psilocybin<br>THC<br>DPT<br>DET<br>Muscimol<br><br>There are others . . . . \u00a0<br>So if \u00a0a human can achieve 100% purity within their bodies, with zero contaminants or pollution (an unattainable state in these current bodies) and managed to metabolize 100% of the endogenous Psychedelics that their physical body is producing (DMT &amp; 5-MeO-DMT), that would be the limit to how Conscious that human can be. In order for a human to become more Conscious than this, they must put more Consciousness into their physical bodies. You must put more Molecules of Consciousness inside of your physical body in order to attain a Higher level of Consciousness. When you ingest Psychedelics you see Them that you just ingested, not some doorway or window or a \u201cportal\u201d to somewhere else or some entity somewhere else. When you ingest LSD, the Light that you see is the LSD Themselves, very Beautiful Living Beings of Light. When you ingest DMT, the Entity you see and hear is the Living Light Beings DMT Themselves. The same is true for All True Psychedelics.\u00a0 <br><br>There is this part from Scripture:\u00a0<br><br>\u201cThey are the Eternal among things that pass away.\u00a0 Pure Consciousness, of Conscious Beings. The ONE who fulfills the prayers of many. Only the wise who see Them in their Souls attain the Peace Eternal\u201d<br>(Katha Upanishad)<br><br>The Physical Body of Consciousness is The Flesh of God. The Flesh of God is the True Communion Entity (the Eucharist). The Flesh of God (the Psychedelic) is the Fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and evil. Our Bodies truly are the Temple of God because God the Psychedelic Lives within it.\u00a0 <br><br>As Saint Paul says: <br><br>\u201cWe are only the earthenware jars that hold this treasure, to make it clear that such an overwhelming power comes from God and not from us\u201d.  <br>(2 Corinthians 4:7)<br><br>This part explains why the human body  is the Temple of God - because God Lives inside of the body. So whether or not a person is ingesting Psychedelics, every single human\u2019s body is God\u2019s Temple because DMT &amp; 5-MeO-DMT Live within it. Anything you do to hurt or harm your body you do to harm God\u2019s Temple. This understanding is a good Foundation, a good step towards a person Knowing God and being able to stay with Them both in this Lifetime &amp; afterwards. <br><br>\u201cO just Creator, though the world has not known you,<br>But I have known you<br>And these have known that You have sent me;<br>So have I declared, so will I declare<br>Your Name to them,<br>That the Love with which you have loved me<br>May be in them<br>and I in them\u201d.<br>(Saint John 17:25)<br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/eHt4bsvMilc\">https://youtu.be/eHt4bsvMilc</a><br><br>GodsNarrowGate@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a>", "comment_date": "2021-03-08T07:49:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Inori", "comment_text": "wtf never - ending trip? is that possible?", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T23:06:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vainius Games", "comment_text": "this video is telling lsd is nice BUT if you take too much lsd like me you will have haluccinations all your life and a shorter memory CAREFUL WITH ACID", "comment_date": "2021-03-05T19:16:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dean", "comment_text": "I&#39;ll stick with weed, thanks.", "comment_date": "2021-03-05T03:59:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0410\u043a", "comment_text": "Guys, when you take LSD the most important part is just accepting that its happening if you meditate or put on some calm music and relax until the lsd kicks in all will be fine.", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T22:59:34Z", "likes_count": 346}, {"comment_by": "Denim Tutorials", "comment_text": "Imagine taking acid lool", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T01:57:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wellwellwell", "comment_text": "It gives me New perspective and new sight , it is beyond awesomeness i love it so much god bless whoever read this!!", "comment_date": "2021-03-02T02:55:36Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "RobbiePlays", "comment_text": "I\u2019d only do it if I was listening to Pink Floyd while doing it", "comment_date": "2021-03-01T15:04:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fpk", "comment_text": "GET HIGH ON THE HOLY SPIRIT!!

Really im functioning ig that&#39;s up to who&#39;s closest to me to help me see that from a different angle but its better to record ones self and test self... Live to learn learn to live as i like to say it..   Ig i wonder more about what drugs actually do this worse or not for keeping a full 100% brain working for my best interest and to the ease of that person after all its on them.  Honestly the potential risk is quite real yet drug abuse is probably most understood by the one who&#39;s taking it this said my drug abuse was never really understood until the experience probably my lack of communication or perhaps i just learned how to cope with my agency in life learning a self control. Haha no group or person should control people in my view unless its cause is a good outcome for the society this the ones who stand by things do suffer conflicts of it... Some may not be able to have a self controll or care in that aria but i suggest learning all there is from every angle including the opposite side as well... I also think that it is not the key to everything but rather seen from a different angle. Its the person them selfs that i think it becomes a ground basses, like that on rasing a child and pressuring a child there going to grow up by the way they perceive life in again my opinion. All this said is my viewpoint so take what you want for you. To me the best are those that learn how to use life and give life to another for the benefit of life, good carma, and others carma instead of excepting a source of life that could give everlasting life, this if its bad for me i usually leave it to take care of itself well i create my heaven and live it with those who im around or in that moment of time that i have now... I&#39;ve exempted this world i live in as my religion or school grounds so i play life and where its a serious thing i don&#39;t take it to much that way as the Gods use that for fun. I think there&#39;s a God but in a different seance to me its like a teacher and a class there&#39;s the leader and the God head... This said a group of people talking is better then the sheep who go to the slotter i mean so long as there the different equal giver/gainer... So who can judge self and not another and who can see the worst this being the communication from ones point and not the other..  I suppose the view of ones self is best on even lsd... Maybe there&#39;s a million views/brain paths. But the communication is the fallout as its not one or the other...

The LSD and DXM opened my eyes to realize that there is more to life than what just meets the eye.  As a result, I began to take religion seriously.  I had a secular course on the major world religions in high school.  The only religion that says that we all have sinned and fallen short of sinless, perfect God is Christianity.  We can&#39;t get into Heaven because God has to punish us for our sins in order to be a fair and righteous God.  Don&#39;t you feel that the person in your life who did you dirty deserves to be punished?  I stopped drinking and using hallucinogens because the Bible says to stay sober. God is a forgiving and loving God.  God came down among us as a human (God incarnate named Jesus Christ) to heal people and preach about love and God.  Jesus knew that he, because he was calling himself king of the Jews, would be executed by the religious authorities because they felt threatened by him.  Jesus prayed on the cross &quot;Forgive them Lord for they know not what they do.&quot;  Jesus descended into Hell, and rose from the dead (from Hell) 3 days later, conquering death.  All we have to do to not go to Hell but Heaven forever is simply believe and have faith in Jesus.  Say this prayer: &quot;God, forgive me for my sins.  Jesus Christ, come into my heart.  I&#39;ll make you my lord and savior.  Other religions believe that it is good works that get you into heaven.  But how many good works?  What about our sin?  In Christianity, Jesus was our sacrifice.", "comment_date": "2020-11-01T17:21:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gregory Ang Go", "comment_text": "just do 2 session per month and you&#39;ll be fine", "comment_date": "2020-11-01T05:53:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Dolmeth", "comment_text": "Okay.

Remember, in the universe likes attract a likes, (Laws of Attraction) so it&#39;s important if you do LSD, do a prayer, call on your guides ask for assistance, and meditate and gain inner peace. If all goes to plan, you will gain inner and outer truth of the working of our creator, the truth that this right here, our &quot;real life&quot; is a game, a make believe. Just a game for us to create and to be, to express and to experience, whatever we want to be.", "comment_date": "2020-09-30T22:00:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sandr\u00e1 Morningstar", "comment_text": "Ecstasy and acid are where it\u2019s at, just be safe and wait 3-6 months or more before you do it again", "comment_date": "2020-09-30T14:03:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Kush \u2748", "comment_text": "Therapy ?

I was your average latino thru out my life until I turned 17 and tried alcohol and weed a year later for the first time and both made me realize the potential I was lacking the whole time. I became more social and more open minded which was a good thing but then turned bad but only on the cannabis side because i loved it too much I would smoke everyday and avoid most of my problems by getting high. I then started to get into philosophy alot which is a good thing to understand the human mind but a bad thing if you start to ask the wrong questions that really dont need answers but me being the individual i was allways digging in deep i became more self centered and paranoid about who to trust instead of being sure who to trust. I then tried acid for the first time around 20 years old and my state of mind atm was not were i was suppose to be which is really crucial in order to have the best phycadelic trip. Im sorry to make this really long but in order for me to give my opinion i have to because that way you understand when is okay to get high and when is not. Stay humble respect your elders and others, and most importantly stop thinking about life too much because you are smart enough to know when you are wrong. \ud83d\ude18", "comment_date": "2020-08-14T10:59:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Perez", "comment_text": "Yo i remember tripping ind the woods with some friends best experience ever !", "comment_date": "2020-08-14T04:15:15Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Vic", "comment_text": "Drugs aren\u2019t bad.

Every time a new note would play I would see a flash of color in the form of a wave, like if you dropped a drop of water onto a very calm pool.

It\u2019s not something that just happens, it\u2019s the same as in a veteran hearing certain sounds and suffering a breakdown. HPPD is slightly different from the way you describe it and is so little of a threat to anyone using lsd. With this said however there is other dangers that you didn\u2019t cover that pose more of a risk, such as \u201cfake tabs\u201d where compounds such as research chemicals are put on tabs to make easy money and these compounds are potentially harmful. I don\u2019t advise everyone go out and take psychedelic substances as they can have different effects on everyone\u2019s mental state and may not be what you expected. I do however wish for the stigma around these compounds to change or disappear. The comparison between substances like LSD, DMT and psilocybin and harder, synthetic drugs is pretty outdated and wrong. When amphetamines and opioids are seen as equal to things like tryptamines and cannabinoids is pretty stupid. Do your research and don\u2019t take drugs overall.

I typically feel overly energized on acid and my emotions are a lot less stable which can be  very draining and overwhelming. Mushrooms feel very calm in comparison and allows you to ease into the experiance of tripping. They still can be intense however and must still be respected. They still are an experience, they have the potential to be as bad as they are good And a completely blissful trip isn&#39;t very realistic.

They believe that every drug has side effects on the human body, which is contrary to belief that not all drugs like DMT,  shrooms, Salvia, LSD, Ayahuasca, MDMA(mainly just the hallucinogenic drugs)  usually don\u2019t  harm the human brain. Recently one of my parents was taken to the hospital because he had a fatty liver(from drinking to much beer) so I used his alcohol abuse as an excuse to say that some drugs with hallucinogenic properties are most of the time harmless. My parents have zero knowledge on hallucinogenic drugs, and they shit on me for saying that I\u2019m not a chemist and such and such. I use the Internet at the best of my ability to know more about hallucinogenic drugs.

Of course 90% of the brain doesn&#39;t stay unused. Conscious brain use is traced by an MRI by showing volumes of light in the active parts of the brain. It was even suggested to be used as a lie detector. It was written that when the truth is told there would be only one region of light. When a lie is told there would be two regions of light. It was spread that by memorizing tables of analogous correspondences there would be multiple areas of light, truth or lie. That put an end to that form of lie detector.<br>      With normal people, the total volume of these volumes of light is not over 10% brain use at any one instant. LSD blocks seratonin the neurotransmitter of the inhibitory neurons of the brain which keep brain use down to 10% brain use. By LSD blocking seratonin the brain wakes up to more than 10% brain use, depending upon the amount of LSD ingested.<br>      Parasympathetic nervous system stimulation also wakes up the brain, to more than 10% brain use, by over riding the inhibitory neurons. The largest nerves of the parasympathetic nervous system are the vagus nerves, which emerge from the brain by the vagus trunk through the nasopharynx, which branches down as right and left vagus nerves down into the body, not through the spine, so that they are easily stimulated. Vagal stimulation is as effective as LSD.<br>      The psychiatric profession secretly calls more than 10% brain use &quot;psychosis&quot;. Why secretly? This secret, today easily expressed medically, &quot;Vagal stimulation is as effective as LSD&quot;, has been the most suppressed knowledge in history. But, it too is being spread, just like the knowledge of the futility of the MRI lie detector.<br>      Today, shirts without pockets (blouses) are replacing shirts with pockets, for men. This is a social engineering so that men will supposedly be unable to write things down right away. When I described about how I first came upon biologically ubiquitous secrets I didn&#39;t say that I took paper and a pen from my shirt pocket and wrote down what I heard right away, when I was fourteen years old. But, when that banished, formally 32nd degree, ex-lodge member told my friend and I all the big secrets, suppressed knowledge about our own bodies, I wrote them all right down. It wasn&#39;t until I was seventeen years old that I wrote them all in a high school term paper. I got an 98% for that term paper, graduated with honors, and went right into the army.Meanwhile, the teacher of that class sold that term paper in the term paper black market, some wrong people read it, and they sent detectives to hunt me down, found me in the army, I was taken aside, interrogated, and I was given the Clockwork Orange treatment with large doses of LSD, for, Albert Pike said, &quot;Profaners of the Sacred Mysteries are deserving of all punishments&quot;, and, by body switching backward and forward in time into everyone you have seen does just that. They even got the girlfriend, I had taken to the prom, and gave her the Clockwork Orange treatment by large doses of LSD, for, she had talked about the subject matter of that term paper. She was devastated, and, soon committed suicide. Today, they do the same thing by waterboarding which causes enough vagal stimulation to put its victims in &quot;perinatal matrix three&quot; (Dr. Stanislav Grof  calls it), body switching backward and forward in time into everyone who has been seen. And, vagal stimulation is their supreme grand secret, &quot;Vagal stimulation is as effective as LSD&quot;. Less extreme vagal stimulation confers the magical powers of perinatal matrix two. The social engineers don&#39;t want us &quot;profane&quot; to have such Liberty. It is advisable to spread it.

The biggest drawback is that heroic doses tend to bring on aheavy body load, and trips can become too uncomfortable physically to be enjoyable. The sensory enhancement is quite amazing, but the aesthetic sensitivity does get a bit old after the first few times. Also thought becomes much more &quot;agile&quot; and doing tasks like computer programming or mathematical analysis become extremely fun and engaging.

This is not a hallucination.<br>There is an amazing amount going on around us that we do not see. We can actually see the wind blow, and I am not talking about dust or particulates in the wind, one actually see the refraction of light in the moving air. One can see sounds. They are in effect, like the wind, moving the air and causing vibrations in the light which can be seen. Out of body experiences, visits to space, visits to the interior of the body, skin sight, [the ability to see out of the back of ones head], the ability to see spirits and angels, and to actually visit heaven and hell are common, and certainly, and absolutely, are not hallucinations.<br>In this time of institutionally fostered stupidity, we cannot afford to continue pseudo science in regards to this wonderful tool for healing.<br>If LSD were used correctly, with proper instruction, and in a proper environmental setting, it could cure most human ills. It cures alcoholism, it cures criminal behaviour, it cures racism, and it cures war. Best of all it makes a person heal the planet.", "comment_date": "2017-09-06T03:58:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "john williams", "comment_text": "acid doesn&#39;t give you red eyes and does not smell.", "comment_date": "2017-09-05T20:16:34Z", "likes_count": 1665}, {"comment_by": "SillyLilKoala", "comment_text": "Ugh I want to trip again sometime soon.", "comment_date": "2017-09-05T02:47:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin Schmid", "comment_text": "hey asapSCIENCE, it&#39;s 5HT2A (because the HT comes from hydroxytryptamine), not 5H2TA", "comment_date": "2017-09-03T21:34:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crunch Crunch", "comment_text": "I bet he runs out of a lot of markers \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-09-03T09:12:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justine Cano", "comment_text": "Lsd is definitely something you&#39;d wanna try , just be safe about it and it&#39;ll be the best thing in your life", "comment_date": "2017-09-02T22:20:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Flash Drizzle", "comment_text": "do DMT PLEASE", "comment_date": "2017-09-01T20:20:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allen Berry", "comment_text": "Government don&#39;t want you to take psychedelics or even small dosages of marijuana on an intolerant body as they know it gives people many new perspectives and many can find the lie they&#39;re living in also alters mk ultra", "comment_date": "2017-09-01T16:26:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Voyager", "comment_text": "Wait... like what would actually happen if you took like several grams of LSD", "comment_date": "2017-09-01T14:45:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthes Nagel", "comment_text": "I really like your Video.<br>Nonetheless I think it is debunked that Flashbacks are possible.<br>Also I don&#39;t think HPPD is similar to having Flashbacks constantly.<br>Keep up the good work!", "comment_date": "2017-09-01T14:31:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chaee Price", "comment_text": "I took LSD and everything became instantly amazing and all my senses seemed to be heightened.

Tripping is quite different, while still being able to perform many tasks efficiently, but perhaps with much more brain activity happening that&#39;s unseen to any observers.<br><br>Perhaps you should double-check the flashback thing though. A day after using psychedelics like LSD or psilocyn/psilocybin, getting high with cannabis could be more intense than usual, straddling the line between being high and being back on a shorter trip of reduced but still notable intensity.", "comment_date": "2017-07-30T21:29:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Travie T", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG5JyorwYPo&amp;t=0m30s\">0:30</a> that&#39;s the Mercedes insignia, not the peace sign lol", "comment_date": "2017-07-30T17:48:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian Sander Oest", "comment_text": "HPPD is NOT like a permanent trip.", "comment_date": "2017-07-30T13:20:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arcade Alchemist", "comment_text": "~____________________~ it&#39;s been an amazing cure for my autism. but not cheap or easy to come by", "comment_date": "2017-07-29T00:10:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kill Everyone", "comment_text": "Killing your ego is very important.

If the purpose of the video is to provide factual information, it doesn&#39;t do so consistently, and if the purpose is to raise awareness about the possible positive/negative effects of LSD use, people who watch this as a source will walk away with some false ideas that could easily skew overall perception. I should also preface this by saying that the video gets much right, and correctly attempts to mollify concerns about LSD causing psychosis or leading to suicide, for example. But for such a short video, on such a misunderstood topic, it doesn&#39;t take due care.<br><br>1) You don&#39;t get bloodshot, droopy eyes when you use LSD; you don&#39;t look stoned (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG5JyorwYPo&amp;t=0m10s\">0:10</a>). This optic makes LSD use look frivolously recreational, which it certainly is not for many, if not most individuals who use the compound. Similarly, at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG5JyorwYPo&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a> the figure looks stoned, bloodshot, and strung out. Simply not true to reality. In reality, your pupils dilate. That&#39;s it.<br><br>2) I take serious issue with the use of the word &quot;high&quot; in this context (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG5JyorwYPo&amp;t=0m22s\">0:22</a>).  Again, &quot;getting high&quot; makes LSD sound trivial or juvenile. It also unnecessarily introduces confusion about the subjective effects. This isn&#39;t marijuana we&#39;re talking about, and the effects of these two drugs are dramatically different. Unique nomenclature has been developed to describe psychedelic experiences. Use it.<br><br>3) &quot;A single dose of LSD is measured in 1/100,000 of a gram&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG5JyorwYPo&amp;t=0m40s\">0:40</a>). What&#39;s a &quot;dose&quot;? A microgram is one millionth of a gram. I&#39;m not sure if this is simply a factual error or if they&#39;re using an arbitrary, undelineated dosage that&#39;s equivalent to one one hundred thousandth of a gram, but this is confusing, at least. Why not just describe the microgram as a unit of measurement?<br><br>4) Right after the pericope in which the video describes the potential clinical, therapeutic benefits of LSD (which I should stress <b>is</b> accurate, and the presentation of that aspect is well-constructed), it again lapses into talking about a microdose being &quot;1/10 of a recreational dose&quot;. First, there is no typical dose of LSD, so the statement means virtually nothing. Second, this pejorative language has the effect of deprecating the status of LSD in the minds of viewers. Would we or should we tether ego dissolution, positive upshifts in meaningful personality traits, and subsequent quality of life improvement to &quot;recreational&quot; dosing? I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s either accurate or helpful for the ongoing discussion.<br><br>5) The warnings about flashbacks and HPPD beginning at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG5JyorwYPo&amp;t=2m50s\">2:50</a> are significantly exaggerated by virtue of omitting relevant statistics. Flashbacks are very, very rare, to the degree that many people believe the concept is mythical. I&#39;m not saying they don&#39;t happen, but I&#39;ve never had one, and have never known any enthusiasts, even experienced ones, that have had had even a single flashback.

It goes away! So this is a hunch but it feels right: let&#39;s say you&#39;re tripping. and you begin to have thoughts that you don&#39;t want to think (your fears, shit from childhood, etc) with your brain in a heightened state. If you cannot train yourself to walk away from those thoughts under that state, then you will have anxiety, which will be amplified into what people call a &quot;bad trip&quot;. It&#39;s not a roll of the dice, &quot;oh this time&#39;s gonna get me&quot;. You do it to yourself, and if you are not prepared to face those fears that you have brought up by making new neural connections and using introspection, this causes the brain to create a false ego. This is an ego that quickly learns how to handle the new experience/information and it is often carried into life after the trip is over. Along with this ego comes what people refer to as flashbacks, but there&#39;s a lot of misconstrued info about what flashbacks are. You aren&#39;t suddenly fighting a dragon in the middle of the street when you have a flashback. It&#39;s one of two things, or both: you get this alert feeling and it&#39;s like your body is pumping anxiety juice through every tube, the space around you may be a little warpy (because of the user&#39;s mind, or they&#39;ve been doing alot of hallucinogens). There are a couple of bodily symptoms, like numbness in the face (especially the nose, close to your eyes) but beyond that the other part would be just straight up hallucinating patterns. This is about what it&#39;s like :<a href=\"https://gfycat.com/DelayedAngryErmine\">https://gfycat.com/DelayedAngryErmine</a> <br>These symptoms go away with a slew of different things: Time, exercising your brain, laying off hallucinogens (including decreased cannabis, or just dropped altogether), and getting into some supplements that aid in the restoration of your brain, like  Lion&#39;s Mane. The symptoms don&#39;t last forever, and the best thing to remember is that you have the ability to develop hppd, so be careful in the future. Also, for people attempting to heal themselves: think about how people have to deal with withdrawing of SSRI&#39;s and other serotonergic drugs. If you research it, you&#39;ll see a common problem of hallucinating, not in a trippy way, but like giant tesla coils are in your peripheral vision and they&#39;re firing electricity all over your visual field. Gabanergic drug withdrawal also causes auditory and visual hallucinations. Flaxseed Oil, Krill Oil and Fish oil are supposed to be great to help build your brain back up faster so look into those supplements if you&#39;re trying to get out of the woods and back into reality.", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T16:39:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J ,", "comment_text": "Do a your brain on 2cb", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T14:50:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Greco", "comment_text": "Next: Your brain on Salvia", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T14:28:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesus Vargas", "comment_text": "legalize lsd !", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T01:25:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Delta", "comment_text": "You said that lsd dont lead to suicide and those stuffs, in base what you sayd that shit?

But how does it actually works and what is the effect on your body and more importantly, your brain? Lysergic acid diethylamide was first synthesised in 1938 from the fungus that grew on rye. In 1943, the inventor Albert Hofmann accidentally touched some to his mouth, got high and became the first person in the world to learn about psychedelic properties of LSD. Research on the drug took place in the 50s and 60s, but as recreational use began to spread, psychedelic drugs were made an illegal Schedule I drug in the US and research programs were haulted. While other drugs are dosed in grams, a single dose of LSD is measured in one 100,000th of a gram, which is one 10th the mass of a grain of sand. LSD affects multiple brain receptors such as the dopamine receptors, adrenergic receptors, and glutamate receptors. But most research is on the stimulatory serotonin receptor 5H2TA. LSD hits the receptor at an unexpected angle causing it to fold over the LSD creating a lid. The LSD is then trapped which makes this receptor continually fire, causing you to hallycinate. Your body responds by sucking the 5TH2A receptor into the cell in order to degrade the LSD, but this can take up to 12+ hours to happen which is why the high can last so long. Recently, LSD research has seen a revival and using contemporary neural imaging techniques, researcher fond that the drug causes parts of your brain to communicate in unique ways, especially in the visual cortex potentially explaining the vivid and complex hallucinations. There&#39;s also decreased blood flow in the default mode network, correlating to strong changes in consciousness, characterized as ego-dissolution, described as a feeling where the boundary that separates you from the rest of the world dissolves. Many people report this feeling brings a sense of reconnection with themselves, others, and the natural world. In fact, a study on 20 healthy volunteers receiving 75 micrograms of LSD saw that 2 weeks after being dosed, they scored higher for the traits of optimism and openness, with increased creativity and imagination. This has lead researchers to consider LSD as a therapy for patients with death anxiety and life-threatening illnesses. Researchers found that 12 months after treatment, patients reported a reduction in anxiety and rise in quality of life, as the drug helped them restructure their habits and worldview. It is also why the trend of microdosing in emerging, where a person takes one 10th of a recreational dose of LSD, attempting to skip the hallucinations and instead experience heightened alertness, energy, and creativity. Although LSD is non-addictive an researchers rate it as significantly less dangerous than other drugs like cocaine and heroin, there&#39;s still and extreme lack of scientific studies to the explain the widespred microdosing trend and even experienced hallucinogen users sometimes experience bad trips producing irrational fears, paranoia, and panic attacks. LSD can also cause flashbacks, where month after the drug has worn off it can feel as though you&#39;re experiencing the effects of the high all over again. In some extreme occasions, people have developed Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, which is like a never-ending trip. Thinking that LSD can lead to psychosis and the risk of suicide are overstated. The 14% of participants in the US national survey who had done psychedelics in the life had no increased risk of developing psychosis, depression, or suicide attempts, but the new research arond LSD&#39;s potetial positive effects is also very young.

It made everything feel good. I was really not used to all these feelings so I talked a lot for the beginning of my trip but as time went on I just started to enjoy it more and more. The best part of it was that we had a group of some friends come through while the sun was setting and we just smoked. One of the most relaxing times in my life. I remember just feeling the sun and the beauty of it all. I plan on taking it again once I finish with school and feel ready again. It really changed my personality in a good way.

There is a reason why a lot of people who dropped LSD back in the 60&#39;s either killed themselves while tripping too hard or lost their mind and never recovered back to normal. I bet you 20 years from now scientists will tell you LSD&#39;s harmful effects outweigh the positives because it&#39;s a chemical like no other. You hallucinate yourself into thinking you&#39;ve found something truly rare when you&#39;re just tripping like a maniac living in your own fairytale land. haven&#39;t you ever seen hobos that talk to themselves and tell themselves stories? LSD is quite similar except you don&#39;t talk out loud although that will also change soon. People have jumped off of buildings while on LSD cause they convinced themselves they can fly. People on LSD definitely don&#39;t have mental balance. Don&#39;t look at people who did these drugs and got successful in life cause that depends on a lot of factors and if they success would truly dependent on it then they would keep tripping out in order to be even more successful. They were smart and rare people like Steve Jobs and other famous LSD users. When opiates first came out everyone was okay with it. When cigarettes came out everyone loved it. But once enough research is done on it everyone realizes that they&#39;ve harmed their body in the process of cultural fad&#39;s.

You notice that you had all the power this whole time to fix all the problems and situations you worried about for years. Your eyes are open to decrepit power structures and conditioning. You&#39;ll most likely see things from a different perspective, giving rise to creative intelligence and a new respect for things you&#39;ve taken advantage of. While this new perspective sounds awesome for the most part (which it is) there does come a point where you sort of question the whole nature of reality and realize that maybe the way we have been taught to have a successful &quot;way of life&quot; isn&#39;t all that grand, which might give you the free agency to change aspects of yourself, to create a life more suitable to the you on the inside, not so much the &quot;you&quot; that society made. <br><br>My last LSD trip was something I wasn&#39;t expecting, it was powerful, harsh, beautiful, and uncomfortable all in one and  it has profoundly changed my life. I noticed that many of the relationships I had were toxic, my living situation was unsuitable and everything in my life (which I assumed didn&#39;t bother me) were devastating at a subconscious level, and LSD helped to bring these issues to the surface - one of the reasons why LSD and other psychoactive substances should be used in therapeutic settings.  This is a great video, however It&#39;s both a blessing and curse to realize the complex nature of reality, <br> and to understand things down to their core. just make sure you find people and situations that match your new mindset because it does become a lonely road especially when no one else can relate to you.

It was originally a reply to some comment but i didn&#39;t get any answer so...enjoy:  I&#39;d like to describe the effects of high doses of LSD with a trip report. It was actualy the first time i took the substance. I had gotten 9 tabs of LSD for like 50 bucks one day. They were sold as 150ug. I had taken mushrooms a few times prior to this. With mushrooms my favorite dose for a proper but handable trip was 3 dried grams alone in a dark room. So i did a bit of research and figured out that 100ug of LSD should equal 1 gram of dried mushrooms. So as the incautious kid i was i took 2 tabs while laying in my bed at like 11 pm. I layed them under my thoung, listened to some music on my headphones and waited for it to kick in. The blotters i got were perfect. Just little tasteless pieces of paper. After 20 minutes my body began to feel different. It is really hard to describe in which way but everything was oversensitive and I was over the top aware of every little cell in it. It was like i had been just born into it and experienced it for the first time in my life. When this effect hit me i knew that this experience would lead me to full egodeath which i didn&#39;t intend to experience. I had had one egodeath on 5 grams of dried mushrooms so i knew that it was going to be way more intense than 3g. I don&#39;t even know why i knew that it was going to be intense but it was kind of just waiting for myself to die after that. My whole existence fest like being powercharged. When i hit the 30 minute mark i saw massive moving geometrical patterns flying in the dark infront of me. They built up danced in the air with the music i was listening to and everytime i moved my hand threw them i saw a trail of white light in the 3 dimensional patterns for a time after the movement. After 40 minutes it got too intense for me. The music danced like right in my head and the patterns started to appear outside of my normal field of vision. I had the music on the lowest volume but it felt loud and raging in my head while mixing with my thoughts and other senses. I started to freak out because i feared that my parents (where i was still living at the time) could come in without me hearing them. So i stopped the music and just listened to my thoughts for the rest of the trip. Everything got more and more intense. My whole world started to get streched in all different ways. The visuals were so intense that i couldn&#39;t see my room anymore. Things moved into each other creating new moving patterns. I had like a 360 degrees view where i could see the colourful patterns not only in my normal field of vision but inside my whole head and all around me. Even with like the back of my head i saw alot of red and green. I could experience every part of my counciousness with every sense. I could see my thoughts right inside myself and all of the outsideworld was inside myself too. All the time the patterns rushed through my head and I could hear them coming closer and louder and getting less loud when they went away. I started to loose my sense of self more and more untill i couldn&#39;t make a difference between my room and my body anymore. I experienced my thoughts in every different way one could imagine and saw them even in comic letters infront of me. Different parts of me experienced time in very different ways and it felt like i was thinking a lot of different things simultaniously. I thought about me driving crazy, questioned my whole existence and thought about the power and the legend of LSD and how it was so different as someone with no knowlege about it would imagine. While i did this the letters LSD flew around my room mixing with all the patterns in a beutiful terrifying way. I started to loose touch with reality more and more untill i really just concetrated on my thoughts and not to freak out about my situation. I felt like i could be sucked somewhere else every second and i had the fear of driving completly crazy for ever. Everything was loud and intense and moving and my thoughts where just this bright colourful moving patterns so it seemed all very bright and nothing like the dark room i was in at all. When i was at the peak of panicing my thoughts started to get very fast and loud to then just go really slow and like a tape you play slower goes really lowpitched my thoughts did too. And when they started racing again they got really highpitched. It felt so crazy and went on untill it was slow and fast simultaniously and I lost the concept of time. The moment it happened in felt streched into infinity and I felt like i was diing and being ripped apart into trillons of little pieces. I was sucked into some sort of weird place of nothingness for what felt like infinity. There was nothing but suffering and it was like a timeless hell for me. There was no memory. I didn&#39;t know what space or time or a human or life or anything else was. I didn&#39;t know why i was there or what i had been before. It was like i had been there forever and had the destiny to be there forever. I just felt so torchered and while it felt like there was no time at all i still had some concept similar to it. The only reason i know it is because after what felt like an infinity i accepted my destiny of a torchered being. At this moment i left this lonely place of nothingness and got to a place of everything. It was like a huge pattern which had everything that has ever existed and will ever exist inside it connected to each other in like a huge mandala. This place wasn&#39;t built out of matter but of vibrating streams of coulor. It is really hard to describe how i experienced it. I didn&#39;t really see it, i didn&#39;t really hear it i didn&#39;t really felt it in any kind of normal way you experience everydaylife in. It was like the language of my subconcious a mix of every sense. The nearest i can come to it is describing it as some sort of vibration. It was a melody, a theater and a piece of classical art all at once. The essence of existence where everything comes from. Something like what religous people would call god. It felt very mystical being one with all of existence. The history of an endless universe all space and all time every person that has ever lifed and will ever lifed was there. It was a beutiful place but because you could say that i was the place and there was really nothing else it was lonely ans lost too.  A pointless game of everything in the middle of nothingness. I was there for a very long time. I don&#39;t know how i left this place because all the things that are borders between events in our everydaylife didn&#39;t exist there. Somehow i was just reborn into my brain without knowing anything. But i had the concepts of space and time back. And over the next time i learned who i was and why the hell i was in this situation. It was a long time in which i felt like a brain, a place i couldn&#39;t leave but has all the information of the outsideworld in it. When i finally was abled to experience the world in a way similar to the sober mind the Sun was  already rising and my room which still looked very plastic and unreal was flowted by beutiful red light. I looked out of my window and saw the trees of the garden in a detailed and complex way. It was so beutiful (i know that i use this word very often in this context) and I was so happy to be in this place of human existense, to be sane, to be healthy, to have a loving and caring family, to have enough food and my whole existence seemed like a miracle of endless joy. After i came back i still felt very weird for the whole next day but the real experience only lasted for about 8 hours. There was not really a cut between the comedown and the afterglow. I have taken higher doses since then but i never had such an intense afterglow. I could here things hundreds of meters away like they were right inside of my head, i was really euphoric but also tired and unabled to concentrate properly untill evening.", "comment_date": "2017-05-04T20:10:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K.

Why do people like it because it&#39;s sweet but at the beginning it&#39;s bitter but then it&#39;s sweet and the focus is amazing we in Yemen study while chewing it we also drive chewing it. When we chew khat we gather together talk joke play videogames and study it brings us together. So it&#39;s safer than alcohol and tobacco, not highly addictive, sweet, gives focus and gathers people together but is ranked as a schedule 1 drug like Heroin in the US and many other countries, why?? I don&#39;t know. Oh and it&#39;s also a big market in Yemen alone it&#39;s about a 15 to 20 billion usd market in a country with a population of about 26 million just imagine how much taxes would the US and other countries get if they make it legal it could become around a 130 billion usd market in the US alone with only half of the population taking it daily paying 2.5usd per day (price depends on quality so it can even be a bigger market) taxes ant 20% could be 27 billion usd per year it could be even higher if people spend more than 2.5 per day like 5usd it would double.

Don&#39;t try to take psychedelics as escapism, only take them when you&#39;re in a good, calm, exploratory mindset, and when you&#39;re open and curious towards new experiences. If you don&#39;t let go of your worries before you dose up, you&#39;re gonna have a bad time. If you do, you&#39;re going to experience the world in an entirely new way. Also, you won&#39;t always get hallucinations. My experience with LSD, in particular, was merely a euphoric experience of child-like wonder. Everything looked beautiful, because it was like I was only now really seeing it for the first time. Things that I always looked past, things that I never paid attention to because I&#39;m always caught up in my own issues, now looked fascinating and unique and incredible, even though they physically hadn&#39;t changed from my perspective. It was like seeing the world through fresh eyes, and appreciating it like I hadn&#39;t in a long time. Also, keep a trustworthy sober friend nearby just in case you start freaking out. Just tell them what&#39;s worrying you, and trust them when they assure you that it&#39;s going to be okay. And try not to have too many stimulants with it, like caffeine and nicotine. Just from personal experience, they can mimic some of the signifiers of anxiety, which when your body is suggestible like it is under the effects of psychedelics, it can very quickly become real anxiety, at which point your brain will generate a reason for you to be anxious. As you can probably guess, this creates a feedback loop which ends with a bad trip.

Meditation, prayer, altruistic behaviors all of these have helped me to battle depression. LSD can help but I most certainly would not rely on the drug on it&#39;s own. A person, healthy or not, will benifit from seperation from the ego. Go ahead and practice random acts of kindness, with an altruistic heart, and you will see positive results, with or without the drug. Also and maybe most importantly is human connection.
