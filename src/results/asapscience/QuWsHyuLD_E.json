I came into this world alone and I know I will leave this alone and nobody would even care. I had loneliness as a blessing and a curse and I had problems with people b/c they see me as a threat and a non starter and a joke and People messed with my head and lied to me and I would much rather stay away from people especially those who lied and betrayed me and its hard to understand yourself and people just do what they want and go about their lives and business. The only feelings I feel is being alone and enjoying my own company is alot better than having someone in my life tearing me to pieces and messing with my brain. When I am alone I don&#39;t need anyone and I am content and I feel like a lone wolf and I do my own thing and I don&#39;t play follow the leader and I go by rules and if people don&#39;t like it that is there problem not mine. I feel a vampire half dead half alive. Besides nobody knows each other anyways. People confuse me and scare me and lie to my face. Being alone I can live in my own world and create a world of my own if you don&#39;t belong.... create a world of your own.

Loneliness is a state of being alone for oneself, in which a human being is alone because he wants to be alone or has to be alone. Loneliness, on the other hand, is based on the fact that human beings have thoughts and feelings that make them separate them from all external influences, make them feel alone and abandoned and do not cultivate any connecting contacts with their fellow human beings. Depending on the thoughts and feelings, one human being feels lonely more often and more quickly than another, whereby acceptance and imitation also play a very important role. Especially very sensitive human beings feel lonely very quickly, often because they feel misunderstood by others and feel that they have been treated wrongly and trivially. This leads them to isolate themselves from the environment and to go away in cloudy, evil thoughts and feelings, which of course promotes their state of loneliness even more. But not enough with that, because even if it sounds paradoxical, the radiated loneliness acts like a poisonous virus on the fellow men, consequently the whole thing is transferred to them. And the worst thing about it is that it is precisely where the interpersonal contacts are very close, such as in the family, in the circle of friends and acquaintances or in a smaller or larger group of human beings, that the symptoms of loneliness are expressed very strongly and have a contagious effect. As a result, loneliness can spread within a group or in society like a nasty ulcer. For as soon as a human being feels lonely within a family, circle of friends or acquaintances, or in a smaller or larger group, the risk increases that others will also slowly but surely begin to feel lonely, with the risk of others being infected being over 50 percent. The whole thing creates a kind of cycle of isolation, and when a human being feels lonely, he inevitably behaves negatively towards others. This usually leads to a situation where, if there is not an infection, the other people turn away from the lonely human beings, whereby those who turn away are naturally disappointed, but this has the negative effect that they then unconsciously begin to avoid the lonely human being and treat him unfairly. In this way many friendships break up, not only direct contacts, but gradually the whole social network is infected by it and falls into bad ways.&quot;                                                                                            Semjase Silver Star Centre, 29th May 2010, &#39;Billy&#39; Eduard Albert Meier (BEAM)", "comment_date": "2022-06-28T16:17:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vengeance", "comment_text": "Guess I&#39;m dying of loneliness", "comment_date": "2022-06-26T17:40:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jessica Ross", "comment_text": "I&#39;m fat, ugly, 36 and always have been single, and I smoke.

Really young and still am young.<br>I had tons of friends, really close by family who I loved deeply, a loving home and neighborhood and good grades. I was happy. But my parents would sometimes fight at night, at times my mom would wake me and my sister up at like 3 am to drive us to my dad apartment where he only sleeps for work since his work is very far from home so he had to stay in an apartment at times with his roommate. And those moments scar me. I never liked fighting, yelling. It always scared me and still does.<br>It was bad enough to the point where my mom told me we were moving, I thought we were moving to a new house which I was kinda sad but ok with. But she told me we were moving to japan which is pretty much on the other side of the country to where I lived which was in Florida. I was broken, I couldn\u2019t talk to my mom I didn\u2019t want to. <br>I had only about 3 weeks until moving so I spend 1 full week with my best friend who is a sister to me, and the other 2 weeks with my cousins. I never got to say a proper goodbye to them because I left at night when they were all sleeping.<br><br>I\u2019ve been living in japan for 3 years now almost 4, and although everyone here is nice to me. No one really talks or hangs out with me. I\u2019m always by myself, everyday. And it\u2019s painful. I pray one day one friend who I can actually talk to will come along, I have internet friends and I desperately want to meet them. Being lonely isn\u2019t fun, some people joke about it. And I laugh sometimes, only because I laugh at my problems. <br>My mom doesn\u2019t seem to notice how much moving changed me in such a bad way, she never cared though. My mom doesn\u2019t admit it but I know she likes my sister over me, but that\u2019s fine. I know I\u2019m my dads favorite. I\u2019ll be moving to a new house soon because I\u2019m living with my grandparents, and my grandma is abusive, emotionally.<br>She makes fun of my appearance especially my nose, and I became insecure and now have terrible low self esteem, and self conscious. I wear a mask over my mouth and nose to cover half of my face when going to school or anywhere in public and try avoiding going anywhere outside.<br><br>I have an option to move in with my dad though, and as much as I want too.. I\u2019m now scared, my mom pretty much blackmailed me into not going, giving reasons as to why I shouldn\u2019t go. And I believed them, and as much as I don\u2019t want too I can\u2019t help it.<br>I do think if I had a friend to help me through this even one I might have some confidence in me to make my own choices, but I don\u2019t have friends, not a family to support me.<br>Doing this alone isn\u2019t easy, being lonely hurts. And I know some people deal with worst than what I\u2019ve been through, but I can\u2019t really say much besides. <br>Don\u2019t give up, even when you want too. You\u2019re standing strong right now so don\u2019t throw that away. You will find the path you\u2019re looking for you just have to stay strong, I\u2019m hoping to find that light for myself as well.", "comment_date": "2018-12-20T13:47:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KING ASH", "comment_text": "Listen people, This is true!

What happens in the mind is eventually reflected chemically and physiologically within the body. Feelings of power increase physiological performance, which is health as well. Feelings of distress and dis ease create disease within the body. Why?

I used to work during the night shift, 10pm-6am. The night shift only required ONE staff on the floor so was ALONE for 8hrs every night, for 5 nights a week. I&#39;d get home at half past 6am and my family would still be sleeping. I&#39;ll eat something and go to sleep. When I wake up my family would be gone to work or school and i&#39;d be all alone the whole day. I&#39;ll take a nap at 6pm before my family got home and be up by 9pm to go to work. This continued for months and I didn&#39;t realize it then, but looking back on it I was sooo incredibly lonely. I remember I used to get SO happy to see another staff member come on at 6am for shift change but right when I left and was alone again I&#39;d get this really sad feeling, I can&#39;t explain it :( I had limited contact with my family and friends and though I had weekends off, my sleep schedule was the complete opposite of everyone else&#39;s so I was always sleepy and not really there at the moment. Its so weird, but I completely understand how prison inmates who are in solid confinement go crazy after a while. <br><br>I left my job a few months back and my sleep patterns has never been the same but social contact has made me feel soooooo much better and healthier!
