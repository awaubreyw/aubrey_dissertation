Something that I hadn&#39;t learned then though, and that you didn&#39;t mention, is that there are very, very many types of landscapes and thus ecosystems and species that have survived until now, are now directly connected to and depend upon humans&#39; interferance in nature. <br><br>(Such as open landscapes that before and during the latest ice age were &quot;naturally&quot; kept open by megaherbivores such as mammoths and other trunked mammals, aurochs, bisons etc. [compare to today&#39;s African savannah], and later when most of these went extinct or at least were greatly reduced due to contested reasons [both due to climate change which might have led to habitats becoming overgrown with forest, and human hunting <del>-</del>&gt; more overgrowing &amp; difficulties surviving] were kept half open by smaller herbivores such as giant deers, moose, still/yet bisons, tarpans, beaver etc. These smaller herbivores were also hunted and reduced which led to more forest expansion, and then, about 6000 years ago up here in northern Europe, humans &quot;started agriculture&quot; [first still being nomads/seminomads] and eventually also started keeping livestock [generally settling down] \u2013 taking over these wild herbivores&#39; &quot;job&quot; as landscape openers [to some extent, not completely \u2013 and of course the landscape was not kept as open as when the megaherbivores roamed the land; it was greatly covered by tress, forest]. A lot of the species \u2013 plants, insects, birds, etc. \u2013 in some way linked to and dependant on open landscapes &amp; the interferance of grazing animals then retreated to these &quot;sanctuaries&quot; that were kept open by the humans and their livestock, and then continued to co-develop together with them [as well as the still thriving grazing wild animals].)<br><br>To repeat one of my two points, there are several types of landscapes [more than most people tend to think], not only up here in northern Europe but all around the world, that depend on human&#39;s interferance in nature (e.g. &quot;traditional&quot; hundreds/thousands of years long cultivation/use of the land). Thus (Point #2) if the human species just disappeared from the surface of the earth (orrrr just continued to reproduce and rationalise and scale up the agriculture and silviculture) the consequences for the biodiversity and the planet would be much more complex than this little short video partly understandably didn&#39;t describe. A lot \u2013 a lot \u2013 of other species (and individuals) and complete ecosystems would go extinct with it.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s na\u00efve but I guess nature would find a way through it in the end if this did happen, maybe even eventually develop to the better with as much biodiversity and resilience as &quot;before&quot;... but it would take a lot of time to get there. <br><br>As humans probably won&#39;t disappear anytime soon, the best solution would be if we could develop ways to feed everyone whilst favoring biodiversity without having to become cavemen again... Didn&#39;t get there yet though. Any ideas?<br><br>OK I&#39;ve expressed myself enough, sorry, this is kind of like religion to me. Actually not sorry, you&#39;re welcome!

Also I saw someone saying that the excuse survival of the fittest is useless as if you try to fight a lion bare handed and you will lose. Yes you will lose but survival of the fittest takes into account anything a species can do to evolve and grow in power. Technology and science is the human races edge. Humans have damaged the planet before to expand and evolve but its how we decide to use our resources like technology to help or hinder the earth that make us good or bad. Our identity as a species is yet unknown as we are a young species on this earth and how we impact the earth in the coming generations with our immense understanding of the world nowadays is what will make or break our planet.

Although I agree and constantly see examples of Tragedy of the Commons (a resource will inevitably be over consumed if there are no regulations restricting the consumption) with our race, but when you come down to it, many animals on earth show similar traits that are considered &quot;selfish&quot;.<br>for example, every animal on this earth has a &quot;right&#39; to live. Eating, killing, consuming another organism is having the &quot;right&quot; to survive and reproduce to further its line of species. We see the cutting down of rain forests as an act of murder and bigotry (Mass Clearing for palm oil for products like oreos or candy bars is in my mind, not a justifiable act of cutting down forests), but the farmers and their family are applying this reasoning with their destruction. They have the &quot;right&quot; to eat and live, and if that means killing many organisms and trees with it, then so be it. Even if there is one tiger left in the world, if a family is starving, they will most likely kill and eat it. Same goes with a starving animal. It is how a mind works, any animal is instinctively &quot;selfish&quot;. Thus so, I believe the human race is putting immense pressure to the earth and practically creating the sixth mass extinction, it is a process to learn and grow so we don&#39;t make these mistakes again and we learn from them.

They gnaw their way through New York, London and Tokyo, digesting spilled larders, ghost supermarkets and human corpses and turning them into new generations of rats and mice, whose racing populations explode out of the cities and into the countryside. When all the relics of human profligacy are eaten, populations crash again, and the rodents turn on each other, and on the cockroaches scavenging with them. In a period of intense competition, short generations perhaps with radioactivity enhanced mutation-rates boost rapid evolution. With human ships and planes gone, islands become islands again, with local populations isolated save for occasional lucky raftings: ideal conditions for evolutionary divergence. Within 5 million years, a whole range of new species replace the ones we know. Herds of giant grazing rats are stalked by sabre-toothed predatory rats.* Given enough time, will a species of intelligent, cultivated rats emerge?

Early bacteria created a methane atmosphere and life revolved around that until photosynthesis came about and the oxygen waste reacted with methane and removed it from the atmosphere and over time, the oxygen rusted all the dry land and what not, making it looks like Mars on land. Then the removal of the greenhouse gas methane and CO2 would make a snowball earth. Life was very compressed in that era, but after the snowball earth melted, the extra oxygen would push life into alliances, resulted in some bacteria living inside others and eukaryotes would be born.\u00a0<br><br>Eukaryotes would go on for a long time and eventually started living in colonies, such as things like volvox and a few specialization cells would appear, but eventually, the greater life would yet again overwhelm the Earth and remove enough greenhouse gas to cause another snowball earth. After this one, the higher oxygen levels would result in multicellular life as we move into the Ediacarian period and various filter feeders would come about.<br><br>At some point, burrow wormlike organisms would appear and expose the microbial mats to oxygen and caused a massive die off of the ocean floor and setting the stage for the Cambrian explosion. The loss of the microbial mats made CO2 levels soar and the shallow seas forming over parts of the continents would add minerals to the water, so life could use it to evolve shells. Coral would evolve along with shellfish, trilobites, and the first major carnivore, anomalocaris. When the warming spiked, ocean imbalance made the ancient coral reefs go extinct and were replaced by strolomatite mats again, which was a carbon sink to cool the world and eventually coral reefs, more like the family we know would reevolve in the Ordovician and start the warm trend again and in this time frame, the nautiloids, the crinids, and more bryozoans, creating tiering of filter feeds on the ocean floor. Moss would start to colonize land along the waters edge and would eventually drain the atmosphere of carbon and cause an ice age, which would lower sea levels and kill the mosses, which then decompose and release the carbon, warming the earth back up again, causing the first of the mass extinction events. Moss of all things. What a greedy organism.<br><br>And it didn&#39;t even go extinct, it went on to evolve into vascular plants in the Silurian. In the seas, fish continued to evolve and during this time frame, sea scorpions were huge predators. Life continued to develop on land, with mites, centipedes, millipedes, etc, coming before the insects and fish eventually coming onto land as amphibians later on as we move into the Devonian. Giant mushrooms came before the trees, perhaps as a way to transform the land into a place suitable for trees. The primitive trees related to club moss and ferns came about and broke the soils and rock inland until eventually, the extra nutrients in the ocean caused an algae bloom and a huge marine extinction that would be the second mass extinction.<br><br>Moving on to the Carboniferous, trees develop bigger and create undecomposable bark which creates coal swamps. The carbon sink boosted up oxygen levels and insects and amphibians evolved to be huge in high oxygen conditions. Being unsustainable though, eventually there was an ice age and the coal swamps died, closing out the Carboniferous and leading into the Permian, when Pangaea would form and the climate would be dry. Reptiles appeared in the previous period, but would diversify, leading to the sailfin reptiles like dimetrodon and would later become the synopsids, mammal-like reptiles, which would eventually become mammals in the next time period. But first, a volcanic event that lasted a 100 thousand years in Siberia, would release most of the carbon trapped in the coal from the Carboniferous and global warming would happen, complete with ocean currents releasing the methane ice in the water, making the world extra warm and the oceans hostile to life and this would be the third mass extinction event and the worst of them with something like 90% of species going extinct.<br><br>The low oxygen conditions of the Triassic, which followed the Permian, would favor the ancestors of the dinosaur, because of the superior lung capabilities that birds still have today while the mammals would have to remain small creatures. Many reptiles dominated the Triassic though and dinosaurs wouldn&#39;t fully manifest till the Jurassic. I don&#39;t quite understand the Triassic mass extinction, but another volcanic event was happening as Pangaea began to split in the middle.\u00a0<br><br>The Jurassic brought about bigger dinosaurs like allosaurs, stegosaurs, and the sauropods and later on in the cretaceous, the evolution of flowering plants favored the ceratopsids, the ankylosaurs, the hadrosaurs, and the subsequent T-rex. A volcanic event in India started to happen at the end of the Cretaceous, followed by a meteor resulting in the 5th major extinction. Mammals would evolve as the big animals, now that oxygen levels were higher while the surviving dinosaurs, the birds, would remain small mostly, sometimes a large bird evolved on and off. Humans come about and learn to kill keystone species like mammoths that shape the biomes via their eating habits, starting the 6th extinction event, which would slow until industrialization, which is pushing us to be the next harbringers of doom.

And if we can survive without species of animals here, then you admit you are a person of some faith, because you disregard Darwin&#39;s theory, and believe humans should not exceed nature (i.e. God).<br>And while I do think what we are doing is bad, we are starting to try to fix it. The past 300 years has been making scientific breakthroughs so fast, that some you&#39;re great grandparents lived before WWI. Hell, most of our Grandfathers fought Hitler, and our fathers lived through the most peaceful decade in the past 115 years (1991-2001). With change happening that fast, we could curb our waste and pollution rates insanely fast. In the past 10 years, we had rarely any sort of solar/wing power infrastructure. Now we have wind farms common across the plains, and solar companies are starting to compete with oil/coal companies, something never expected 5 years ago, even.<br>And humanity is the only species on Earth to be able to do this. No animal compares to our society, individuality, and infrastructure.

Instead of making him glue it together, or just live without that bowl, you believe that child should leave your house, so the other bowls don&#39;t break. In this case, that child is Humanity, and the bowl is a polar bear. The lego plane represents all of our infrastructure, and we got to carried away with playing (growing) with his plane, that he broke a bowl (killed a few thousand animals).
