They have these fixed-points which, once set, take a lot of effort to go against.  Also, they are either, asleep, or awake, and usually have no problem falling asleep or waking up instantly.<br>Similarity, I&#39;ve noticed that the so called, &quot;Night Owls,&quot; don&#39;t necessarily <i>like</i> to be up at night.  It&#39;s more that they can, &quot;keep going,&quot; if they have to.  &quot;Bed time,&quot; is less of a hard-cutoff and more of a decision, and a process.  Waking up is, similarly, a process.  Basically, there&#39;s a point where they&#39;re not asleep, a point when they&#39;re not awake, and then some 5-30 minute gap between those points.  This is why I use the label, &quot;Gradual-Transitioners&quot;:  they will get up out of bed (when the alarm goes off or otherwise) but not be awake.  They&#39;re not asleep either, but they haven&#39;t, &quot;reached Awake&quot; yet, either.  Conversely, at night, they will stop being awake, but not have &quot;achieved Asleep&quot; for some time \u2014 again, not a change-of-state, but a transition.  And during this transition interval, they can be &quot;shoved&quot; back towards &quot;awake&quot; by outside things.  This can also be intentional:  Gradual-Transitioners can push through feeling tired and keep going until they get a sort of &quot;second wind&quot; (though they&#39;ll pay for the lack of sleep).<br><br>Almost everyone that I&#39;ve given this explanation to has reacted with, &quot;Huh.

I also have no circadian rhythm and work nights so real REM sleep doesn&#39;t start occurring until 2pm-4pm (even though my work starts at 3pm). I struggled with falling asleep for a decade but caught onto ASMR back around 2015 and fell asleep to softspoken roleplays for years and its trained me to fall asleep like a normal person (even without it now).<br>So cured most of my sleep problems but there&#39;s no helping my brain and body deciding not to refresh itself when its cold, dark, or rainy outside.

Nobody seems to know everything that changes in an environment when its raining, when its sunny, when its overcast, when its dark. Something has a major impact on my body. For all I know, solar rays may somehow manage to go through concrete walls into my basement suite while I sleep and rejuvenate my body and this doesn&#39;t occur with bad weather.

Like crippled on the verge of death struggling to breath and waking up short of breath and with a sudden racing heart only during the winter and a jacked athletic superhuman during the short summer with none of those near-death winter symptoms.

So with regards to your reputation, lest we intentionally mislead people who need precise descriptions of reality to make informed decisions for themselves, here are my criticisms.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpaxxN8jTHo&amp;t=0m46s\">0:46</a> Amount of sleep alone is not a predictor of your mental condition. Quality, frequency, regularity, phasing, psychological and other individual conditions all need to be considered. The misconception that 7.5h of sleep makes ideal recovery is a conclusion pulled from studies on people with predominantly low scores in all other facets of sleep. I can reveal that if you lock your sleep to exactly 7.5h every single day without considering other , you are not going to be feeling your best. In fact, you may be feeling worse than if you just regularly slept 6. Fortunately, nearly all parameters of sleep are regulated by your general physiological and mental condition. If you remove artificial stimulants during all waking hours, ideal sleep is a nearly attainable goal. But it comes at the cost of a modern lifestyle. Multiple factors <i>will</i> make you predisposed for a certain chronotype. But research isn&#39;t nearly conclusive. As of 2022, it&#39;s largely a buzzword, and holds little to no significance as to what is actually feasible for you to habitually achieve. And because of fundamentally vital processes such as acquiring sunlight, adhering to a certain &quot;chronotype&quot;, because somebody told you it&#39;s ok, when it&#39;s inherently linked to an underlying pathology, is <b><i>very dangerous.</i></b><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpaxxN8jTHo&amp;t=4m04s\">4:04</a> For the same reason as above, you ideally do not want an alarm as a means of force. It&#39;s a temporary solution to an underlying problem. It will substantiate your resistance to an action, and symbolically strip you of your will. When you are healthy, an alarm used for that purpose becomes redundant. Timers and alarms are however tools that serve a functional purpose.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpaxxN8jTHo&amp;t=4m32s\">4:32</a> The sleep cycle is an observed phenomenon. And it is not ideal to be forcibly awoken when your body is reentering a deeper and more involved state of unconsciousness. It&#39;s not quite so simple, however, that in the few minutes since delaying an impending alert you will put yourself into a deep state of sleep. If your sleep has been successful, and a healthy state of mind has been retained for multiple days, your body will have no need to process either information or chemicals, and will either wake up by itself or delay an auxiliary sleep cycle for at least a few minutes. These are all scenaria you should expect, and invest into should they not be there.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpaxxN8jTHo&amp;t=5m19s\">5:19</a> Physical activity is undeniable, and at the core of a healthy recovery from fatigue, exactly because it engages multiple parts of your body that otherwise solidify in a stagnant state. In a natural environment, the human body cycles through periods of high and low energy. And it is these waves which dictate how &quot;recovery&quot; should happen in the first place. In a sense, tiredness is in fact not the lack of energy, but stagnancy; neither the absence nor abundance of energy caused by the vector of movement that stimulates action. The human body knows very well how to recover, but only does so when there is something to recover from. The second vital function of physical activity is constructive. It improves the already existing functions of your organs, and builds energy hungry machinery which in return requires and demands recovery. This partly automatess the vector you would otherwise need external impetus to move, resulting in a longer term cycle of energy abundance. There are also implied benefits of physical activity, because it engages you in ways generally associated with brutality; so it makes you more attentive, as if the physical activity itself was prompted by danger or opportunity.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpaxxN8jTHo&amp;t=5m37s\">5:37</a> It is this reason exactly that negates the first. Light regulates a myriad of different processes we&#39;ve barely even scratched the surface of. It is also a controversial field of research because a lot of myths surround what, when and how much light is necessary, and because ideal natural light conditions are not actually feasible for a large number of people, sometimes throughout their whole lives.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpaxxN8jTHo&amp;t=6m04s\">6:04</a> Hydration is always important. But because of its role in the body, it is tightly linked with both metabolism and temperature. As with salt, when and how much water you need is something you will know when your body is sufficiently active, and you are paying attention. In general, most people could drink slightly more water than is required. This will boost many energy intensive processes, and give you a surplus in return. (I will also add that respiration improves the efficiency with which your body utilises water.)<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpaxxN8jTHo&amp;t=6m17s\">6:17</a> Like the alarm clock it&#39;s a no whenever it doesn&#39;t serve a special purpose. But it&#39;s more comparable to p*rnography; a stimulant that desensitises you to certain arguably important things in life. But there is no evidence whether it is unhealthy or will kill you on its own.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpaxxN8jTHo&amp;t=7m09s\">7:09</a> Arguably the second most important point in the whole video, diet is a deceptively simple field of study. In fact, it is only very recently that we have even gotten close to understanding how it might work. For that reason, there are many things one should not begin conclude from diet for at least another few years. For starters, the human digestive system can work in a few different paradigms, all of which depend on your ability to digest and utilise nutrition. Therefore, food that your brother or sister might benefit from, because they have exposed to for a longer period of time, are things you might not be able to benefit from, if at all. In diet &quot;healthy&quot; is not a word to be thrown around lightly. Food has always served different purposes. And most of the food we eat today is quite unlike anything we have ever eaten before in history. And we don&#39;t quite know the consequences of that.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpaxxN8jTHo&amp;t=7m26s\">7:26</a> In general, whole foods, as in unrefined ingredients eaten in their current state, do <i>not</i> give higher energy levels. If they do so, it is because in comparison to their refined counterparts they are being consumed in much larger amounts, and in a way that gives a more stable hormone response, which in turn induces something which could be described as satiety.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpaxxN8jTHo&amp;t=7m34s\">7:34</a> Because sucrose has an insane impact on hunger hormones, it will severely stress you mentally and physically. In the long term, it&#39;s a very poor strategy for managing fatigue. Fibres typically serve the opposite purpose: to delay or prevent absorption, mitigating both hunger and stress. If what you care about is all the energy here and now, a tailored concoction of digestible carbohydrates, and little to no fibre will give you that. However, if you care about stable energy indefinitely, carbohydrates in any shape or form might not be for you. Cutting out carbohydrates entirely also has the added bonus of removing hunger and clearing all digestive issues entirely, but the disadvantage of not having energy peaks anymore and missing virtual satiety such as what you would experience at a dinner or house party.<br><br>Other notes:<br>As with meal times, naps tend to become a relevant when sleep is already less than ideal, and interferes for the same reason. It does however improve cognitive performance temporarily.<br>Alcohol is not ideal, but can potentially serve several useful purposes. Small amounts of pure ethanol will do nothing but improve blood flow. When we get into more complex forms of alcoholic beverages, they can have undesirable side effects. As with alarms, alcohol is a temporary solution to a deeper problem.<br>Hot baths cause vasodilation and evaporation, both of which lower body temperature (and reduce activity). However, it also causes perspiration. If you forget to hydrate after a sufficiently hot bath, this can cause a myriad of problems down the road, including sleep, as it hinders many chemical processes. Not allowing your body to return to a cool state after a bath, and high air humidity, may also worsen sleep.<br><br>According to actual science, the recommendations in this video will not really solve your tiredness or fatigue, but generally only support you in hanging on by a thread when the kind of lifestyle you have carved our for yourself demands that you be chronically tired.

The first week, I\u2019d cry every morning as the positive difference Cpap therapy was making was so shocking.  I was kind of like you with all of the sleep efforts; love Matthew Walker and Michael Pollen! The tips you give are incredible and I totally resonate with all of them!  I would say, if anyone follows your great advice and they are still feeling tired, they should do a sleep study to see if they have sleep apnea.  I had moderate sleep apnea (16 ahi), but it works also triggers different types of insomnia in me so it was exhausting\u2026my airway would close about 16 times per hour causing my brain to half wake or wake just as many times\u2026it created a baseline that I thought was normal. My reality has done a 360 with Cpap therapy, which is a continuous air pressure machine that keeps my airway open and stops me from waking so much! Cpap therapy is best thing that\u2019s happened to my health!! Omgosh, I just finished your video and you recommended seeing doctor if nothings working! You rock!  I\u2019d specifically ask for a \u2018sleep apnea sleep study\u2019.  I\u2019ve mentioned my insomnia to my doctor In the past and have been referred to therapy which did not help at all, ugh.  Some doctors prescribe therapy, drugs\u2026. Skip it all, email them in writing if you have to, tell them you want a sleep study to see if you have sleep apnea. Cpap machines are on nationwide back order, so I\u2019d try to order Cpap asap.  It\u2019s the best Strong arm move you can make for yourself and it could positively change your life for the better!

If you feel your job is the problem and why your tired. You may be wrong and ignoring these areas pointed to in this video. Diet, exercise and sleep duration have a huge impact on your work life. Remember it takes 21 days to turn any new behavior into a habit that is part of how you live day to day. There is a the story of the person that wen to the gym every day and only stayed for only 5 minutes till it became habit to go to the gym and exercise. When asked about it they said they were exercising their mind to learn how to workout consistently/ Once they got down the habit and looked forward to working out they upped the time spent at the gym. Also, do not overdue it at the gym if you have not been in a long time. Studies show that working out till it stops being fun and the stopping at the point of pain makes you  more likely to continue. Every time you workout your body and mind is in a different state. Focusing on how the body and mind feel can help you view the workout as a more of a positive experience and not a punishment. Most Olympic athletes train in the lower output range for consistency rather than over-exertion. Over time you will learn what your body and mind is capable of.

I just want to say one important thing. There&#39;s a big biological difference between fatigue and sleepiness. Fatigue comes after activity (mental or physical \u2013 both create different type of fatigue). Sleepiness comes after inadequate sleep and is growing stronger during the day, due to rising adenosine. <br><br>So, in a very simplified way, fatigue is a mechanical strain,  while sleepiness is mostly a chemical issue. That&#39;s why both states have a different solution. If you want to alleviate fatigue, you need to stop working and wait for your brain or muscles to recover. If you want to alleviate sleepiness, you need to get more or better sleep (there are 7+ different parameters that influence overall sleep quality). And after a few days or weeks, you&#39;ll get back to normal, because you will get rid of all of the excessive alertness-decreasing adenosine you accumulated over the past months or years.<br><br>Also. Both fatigue and sleepiness can be &quot;masked&quot; or enhanced by many other factors (diet, light, background noise, boredom ..). And both fatigue &amp; sleepiness can be objective (brain &amp; body function) or subjective (feeeling positive, motivated, vigorated). Studies show that, paradoxically, people who are objectively more sleepy (their cognitive functions are very low) usually feel more energetic than people who feel less awake (but their cognitive functions are fine). <br><br>And as for the feelings of fatigue, they are mostly related to the perceived demands, rather than our objective strain or objective function. In other words, if you feel like the work demands are exceeding your capability to deal with them, you will feel tired, even if you&#39;re objectively OK.<br><br>Anyway, what I wanna say is, tiredness is not an easy topic. And anyone who feels tired needs to find out whether it&#39;s fatigue or sleepiness. Mostly is a combination of both. But many people sleep fine and still feel tired. That&#39;s because sleep isn&#39;t a cure for fatigue. Or at least not for the mental fatigue. <br><br>Cure for mental fatigue is mental recovery. Resting BEFORE sleep (so your brain is already relaxed, which improves the sleep quality) and DURING the day (taking breaks after 80\u2013100 min of mental work, because that&#39;s the cognitive limit of our brain). That way your fatigue won&#39;t accumulate during the day nor between days. And then you will feel both awake AND rested. Not only in the mornings, but during the whole day. <br><br>Who wants to find out more about tiredness, google &quot;fatigue sleepiness ncbi&quot; (for studies about the difference between these terms). I recommend two papers in particular, google: PMC6139359 and PMC6660560, which focuses on difference between recovery &amp; restoration (then you can check related studies). Or you can google research from Sabine Sonnentag. She&#39;s done like 30 years of research on fatigue &amp; recovery. <br><br>For even more info about resting (with scientifically proven ways to increase efficiency of your recovery), check out these books: Rest (Alex Pang), The Art of Rest (Claudia Hammond) and An Oasis in Time (Marilyn Paul).<br><br>Hope you all feel energized soon. :)", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T06:42:00Z", "likes_count": 287}, {"comment_by": "YDSD", "comment_text": "Just do amphetamines", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T06:36:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Higuy", "comment_text": "Watching this as I should be sleeping right now", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T06:31:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "raven", "comment_text": "Nobody talks about oversleeping i actually feel more active when I sleep less.", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T06:29:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nikita Shutkov", "comment_text": "\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T06:28:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "maurice cuellar", "comment_text": "I am also a person who loved the study of sleep.

I work night shifts that frequently change in time (1p-3a, 5p-5a, etc.) so I can&#39;t schedule sleep based on time of day. Utilize habit pairs. By creating a link between activities you can get your body used to something because you have done something else. For example, I go to bed as soon as I get home. No matter what time I get off work, once I get home I immediately start getting ready for sleep. I have done this so often that just getting home now will start to make me ready for bed.<br><br>Second, is taking care of nasal dominance. This may not be a big deal for some but as I&#39;ve grown older, my sinuses can no longer maintain sufficient airflow as my nasal dominance changes throughout the night. To combat this, I use nasal strips (Breathe Right, for one). They adhere to the bridge of the nose and gently pull on the nostrils to keep them open throughout my sleep. These have been a huge game-changer when it comes to being able to stay asleep.<br><br>Again, great video!", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T00:19:06Z", "likes_count": 50}, {"comment_by": "alg11297", "comment_text": "this is all common sense nonsense we&#39;ve been told all our lives.
