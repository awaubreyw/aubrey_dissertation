I will get this out of the way now. I don&#39;t believe in climate change or in my day global warming. But I do see how we disrupt mother natures way of doing things. I have a degree in environmental science and I have been a excavator for the better part of my life. Those two can help each other. Here is the kicker. To do so it requires companies that are &quot;to big to fail&quot; to stop suppressing technology including people like bill gates. we have had technologies that have been better than what we have now if companies were not gready. One example; the 100 mile per gallon carburetor. Does anyone know the reason why  asphalt roads need drainage? Well asphalt is a liquid and it likes to move. If you don&#39;t keep the ground below it drained it will sink. Causing dips holes and cracks. Those drainage ditches dump water in the wrong places. They also stop water from flowing the way it should. Example; have you ever looked at a hillside that was cut out for a road and on a dry day seen the rock wet. that&#39;s because they cut out a section of a underground river, stream, or a seasonal stream. Now think about all the other things that we think needs to be kept dry &quot; house foundation &quot; and apply that same design. We disrupt water flow with just about everything. Putting water into the nearest stream or river does not work. One of the best thing that a person or a homeowner can do is have a septic system that requires your water use to be put back in the ground. Instead of hooking up your rain water from the roof. Either collect the water and use it or put leach lines into the ground and put it back into the ground. If you water fell there keep it there. For you dummies that farm or live in a area that gets little to no rain. Stop pumping it out of the ground. Because you can never replace the water back to the aquifer. And those who pipe water from a rainy area. So, that you can water your yard. You do the most damage of all. Yes I am talking about you mostly in Las vegas. The next thing that is damaging is the mower. What people think are ugly weeds are actually very good for the environment. It helps to hold in water. The ground doesn&#39;t get so hot and helps speed up the evaporation process by heating up the ground.

Go to Houston. Turn on an air conditioner.<br><br>Seriously, I had a gardener friend in Atlanta who owned a small house with small yard and small gardens. During the drought and water crisis that gripped the city some years ago, when there were severe restrictions on the use of city water, she was able to keep some of her most vulnerable plants alive and even retrieve extra water from the air which she could use to flush toilets, all by diverting the runoff from a large window AC unit.<br><br>She said that the situation had been so dire that restrictions had been placed even on AC condensate, but they never got round to regulating window units. I suppose that\u2019s probably because the condensate from those units is not typically plumbed anywhere; instead just allowed to drip out of a small hose in the back.<br><br>Your video reminds me of how some of the poorest people in the world get hot (or at least quite warm) water, primitively plumbed into their homes via gravity, much the same way water towers work. During the monsoon seasons of Africa and Asia, at least in the parts where I have traveled, people catch as much natural rainwater as they possibly can. On the roofs of their houses, or else on a raised platform if the roof cannot support it, there will be two tanks, one of which is painted black, storing water that is piped into the house below. In each neighborhood, people will share and pass around a pump or two to keep those tanks full, and of course the black one soaks up the sun\u2019s heat and provides warm water for bathing and cleaning, so they don\u2019t need to burn so much fuel heating it.", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T22:59:20Z", "likes_count": 33}, {"comment_by": "Tabby Cat", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEXrb6HBVuU&amp;t=14m04s\">14:04</a><br>What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T22:49:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u00c1gua pela barba", "comment_text": "Drinking it would be really fun", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T22:32:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Die-Is- Gain", "comment_text": "Demented fuqs", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T22:27:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oleksandr Makar", "comment_text": "\u0445\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0446\u0456, \u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0449\u043e \u0432\u0438 \u0446\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0435\u0444\u0456\u0440 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0454\u0442\u0435?", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T21:38:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Ezell", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t know about Canada but the biggest issue here in the US is restrictive rain water collection laws.", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T21:34:57Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "Esmael Essa", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEXrb6HBVuU&amp;t=1m47s\">1:47</a> \u0633\u0628\u062d\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0621\u0650 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u064e \u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0621\u064d \u062d\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064d", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T20:27:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Philip", "comment_text": "It&#39;s interesting but I think some rain might also be helpful.", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T20:23:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Legionario Cruel", "comment_text": "Nope.", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T20:16:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "skyphantom29", "comment_text": "Also, the local Municipalities will tax you or otherwise make it illegal to collect rain water", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T19:17:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "skyphantom29", "comment_text": "I applaud yall for trying, however, it&#39;s hard to imagine that you guys actually stick with it", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T19:13:14Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Agus Elektronika", "comment_text": "wow very innovative I&#39;m amazed by your thinking success continues", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T19:04:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ajay mehar", "comment_text": "Golden is in show of the tower \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T18:50:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Davidgaming Gallegos", "comment_text": "With the roof system I would suggest at least a charcoal filter that way you don&#39;t have stuff from bird poo and other animal stuff in your shower and dish water", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T18:23:45Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "Mariocosimo Parente", "comment_text": "Questa \u00e8 una idea Italiana gi\u00e0 da anni in Africa \ud83d\ude21", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T18:06:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sirus Tawnlien", "comment_text": "where i live in india NE we used water mainly from roof and <a href=\"http://well.like/\">well.like</a> ever house used roof water from rain.its easy to install we just put like metal idn in eng we curve metal and from that when it rain all from roof we let it flow in one curve metal and from that we get it.idn why US dont use <a href=\"http://this.you/\">this.you</a> can save many water from it.just put curve metal all around your roof end and let it flow in one <a href=\"http://way.you/\">way.you</a> can even use pipe just cut in length and put that at end of your roof and let it flow", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T18:03:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alquimia de Aromas Alquimia de Aromas", "comment_text": "Please were can i buy this3?????
