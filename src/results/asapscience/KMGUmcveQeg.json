Have you lied, stolen, used God&#39;s name in vain, or looked with lust (which Jesus said was adultery, Matthew 5:28)?  If so, God sees you as a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart.  If you die in your sins, you will find yourself in a terrible place called Hell, but there is good news.  Although we broke God&#39;s law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross (He took on the guilt of our sins, without committing any himself, God turned away from Jesus and released his wrath on him, thus paying our fine, he took the punishment we deserve : &quot;God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life&quot; (John 3:16).  .  Then Jesus rose from the dead (on the 3rd day, proving that what he did is enough, that God is satisfied with what he did (what he did paid our debt) , through the resurrection he defeated death)  was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses.

Sucrose sugar is transformed into blood glucose incredibly quickly.

For those of you who don\u2019t know, this is not the number listed on the nutrition facts of foods. The nutrition facts list the Calories, also known as kilocalories. Essentially, one thousand calories equals one Calorie, and so one Calorie is the energy required for a kilogram (2.2 lbs) of H2O to increase by 1 degree Celsius. To put it into perspective, the average amount of energy people consume each day (taking 2350 based on the 2000-2700 estimate in the video) is enough energy to bring 23.5 kilograms of water from its freezing point to its boiling point. That is over 6 gallons of water.

If you wanna gain weight, eat a caloric surplus (200-500 should suffice, though personally i shoot for 800 because im trying to gain quicker), eat high amounts of protein and carbs (and a bit of fat cant hurt), and dont worry too too much about anything else. that doesnt mean just eat junk all the time, unless youre a dirty bulker, which means youre wierd. but if you wanna gain weight, you gotta have some cheat meals every now and then. If you wanna lose weight, eat a caloric deficit (again, 200-500), eat lots of less dense foods such as fruits and veggies so you can eat a higher volume and feel like youve taken in more than you actually have, and up your water intake just a tad.

Cow\u2019s milk is a high fat fluid designed to turn a 30 kg baby calf into a 180 kg cow.   Cow\u2019s milk contains Animal protein- which has been proven by people like doctor T. Colin. Campbell to promote cancer growth.   Animal Protein is far too acidic for the human body. In order to neutralise this acidity, the body leeches calcium and phosphorus from the bones. People have been mislead to believe that milk gives us strong bones, yet the countries with the highest dairy consumptions all have the highest rates of osteoporosis. Dairy products like cheese and butter are high in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol, and are very low in vital vitamins and minerals. Diets high in fat and especially in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease and can cause other serious health problems like diabetes Because cows suffer from a number of infections, like mastitis, dairy contains a considerable quantity of pus. A glass of milk will contain around 90-135 million somatic \u201cpus\u201d cell. Dairy also contains bovine growth hormones, which have been linked to obesity and cancer.  It also contains antibiotics, and contaminants like blood and faeces.  Cow\u2019s milk also contains casomorphins, a form of morphine which is highly addictive.  Fortunately, there are many non dairy alternatives and a whole-foods plant based diet can provide all the essential nutrients for long-term health.  For more information: The China Study by T.

Not necessarily an eating disorder as I&#39;m getting all of my nutrients and the perfect amount of calories. But I can tell you right now, from experience, eating less is not the way. I used to be so fat, now I have a six pack. Besides working out, diet is what&#39;s going to get you there. Now, &quot;a healthy diet&quot;, what does that really mean? It doesn&#39;t mean eating rather unhealthy foods throughout the day (burgers, fries, cereal, etc.) and then having an &#39;extra healthy&#39; salad for dinner. That won&#39;t really matter. What you need to do is make sure that al of the foods you are eating throughout the day are healthy, high in protein, and make sure you know your calories as well so you have a basic idea of how many calories you&#39;re having without research. For breakfast, include a boiled egg, FULL FAT milk, and a cottage cheese sandwich made with a low calorie omelette with protein bread as the bread. This is the perfect breakfast with high protein, healthy fats, optimal carbs and everything you need. Once you discover cottage cheese, it will seriously make everything easier while preparing a healthy breakfast. Now, for lunch and dinner, try to get fish, chicken or beef (no pork) along with spinach, arugula or any type of salad. You can try tuna, salmon, lamb, multiple different types of meat with different types of salads so you don&#39;t get bored. Obviously, you can eat something different every once in a while, but ALWAYS healthy. Don&#39;t believe in cheat days, you must LOVE the food you eat everyday. Try discovering different recipes with meat and salad until you find one you&#39;re in love with. Now, between breakfast and lunch or lunch and dinner, if you&#39;re going to snack, keep it light. Such as fruits (watermelon is always my #1) or vegetables (broccoli or edamame are great).

Great visual depiction of caloric density of foods. Basically High calorie dense vs low calorie dense foods. However, I think the point that the creator made regarding the health portion doesn&#39;t cover the full scope for the majority of the North American population. <br><br>The majority of people are grossly considered obese or overweight due to consuming highly caloric dense foods and over eating too many calories which results in carrying more body fat. Most people need to bring their body fat down into a healthier range as opposed to eating &quot;healthier&quot; foods. Which in media is being promoted as the solution.  (Example eating avacadoos, nuts, salmon etc.) <br><br>Calories are a measure of energy expenditure so any calories not expended get stored as fat, in simple terms. Basically our bodies operate in calories IN vs calories Out. This is known in the bodybuilding world and fitness industry. <br><br>An example is if let&#39;s say someone  were to substitute for the 2\u2030 milk(130cals) they consume for the diet cola (roughly 5cals, rounded to 0) that would actually be a benefit towards weight loss for the person as its less calories adding into their daily maintenance limits.<br><br>Point being that &quot;healthy&quot; does not equate to being fit or skinny if the right food options aren&#39;t made.

Look at every food or drink&#39;s &quot;Nutrition facts&quot; and you would see what I mean. Because it sounds confusing when you say an average person burns 2000 to 2700 calories per day, but you defined 1 calorie as &quot;the amount of energy it takes to raise the temperature of 1 milliliter of water by 1 degree celcius&quot;, but the volume of my body is about 55,000 milliliters and I&#39;m just about as dense as water and I&#39;m almost always 10-30 degrees celcius hotter than my surrondings.

There&#39;s also a huge difference between being healthy and losing weight. I know people a lot healthier than me that have an overweight BMI. This is strictly weight loss, not anything health related.<br><br>I base what I eat on the amount of sugar and carbs the food contains. I never eat apples because they&#39;re so full of sugar and high in carbs, on top of the taste of apples not being worth how much they &quot;cost&quot; in regards to the sugar and carb content. In fact, I rarely have fruits at all. The fruits I have are blackberries, green grapes (a maximum of 10 grapes), and blueberries. That&#39;s it. I eat a ton of vegetables like spinach, celery, brussel sprouts, etc and plenty of fish and chicken. Vegetables are lower in carbs than fruits, contain little to no sugar, and the amount of calories they&#39;re worth are so small that you can eat a lot and still barely scratch your calorie limit. Green is golden. <br><br>I also consume absolutely no dairy whatsoever. No dairy sugars, no proteins, and no milk fats. By eliminating dairy from your diet, you automatically eliminate most desserts, junk food, and calorie dense snacks. No more cheese danishes, no more vanilla or blueberry scones, no more cookies, no more this or that. The only desserts a person can have at that point are homemade which I do bake, but I also control ingredients and sugar content on those. So even my treats are less sugary. <br><br>If you want to also be healthy, keep track of nutrients and add supplements. I&#39;m deficient in iron and B12, mostly because I only eat 500-600 calories a day. Eating healthy won&#39;t necessarily make you skinny, especially if you eat too many fruits and marinades and yogurt and whole milk etc, you have to restrict calories and keep track of the type of things you&#39;re eating.", "comment_date": "2018-12-21T00:28:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wissam Maalouf", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMGUmcveQeg&amp;t=2m45s\">2:45</a> yes I aM <b>potato</b>", "comment_date": "2018-12-20T21:21:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M A R I A .

As you ah e probably heard, losing weight is 70% diet and 30% exercise. 1 pound of fat or just under half a kilogram is equivalent to 3500 calories. If you cut your calorie intake everyday by 500 calories, you\u2019ll lose a pound a week. The average American gains about 1 pound every week and a half. Just figure out your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which is the amount of calories you burn everyday on average. There are online calculators for it that are free. My BMR is about 2600 calories a day, I\u2019m a 27 year old male. When I cut calories I try not to exceed the 2000 calorie mark. Remember it is okay to be hungry! We are used to eating as soon as we feel hunger but, we really don\u2019t have to eat right away. Smaller portions and eating slowly, will help you eat less because it takes 15 - 20 minutes for our bodies to really know how much food we have consumed. This is why people stuff themselves super fast and then a half hour later sit there as if someone punched them in the stomach. They wonder why they are so full and lethargic. You WILL feel full even if you eat less.

It&#39;s not some crazy conspiracy or theory, although I know it sounds like it since every aspect of advertising has normalized the idea that milk is good for you...or even necessary for bone development. The truth is no mammal needs milk to survive after weening, if we did, there&#39;s no way we could have evolved before the point of pastoralism. The only organism that needs the milk of a cow for &quot;health&quot; is another baby cow. <br>Think about why that&#39;s so. Think about what milk does to a calf feeding from its mother. Milk from a cow is a cocktail of grown hormones designed to transform a calf into the size of a full grown cow in under a year. These hormones are not necessary humans in any way, shape, or form. Most especially, they are harmful when consumed by people who already suffer from being overweight or obese (which is 1/3 of Americans). More proof to this fact is seen in how the majority of us are incapable of digesting lactose, the sugars found in milk. Some are, only as a result of thousands of years of evolutionary change in response to the notion of keeping animals as pets and a food source. Basically, milk is not good for you. You don&#39;t need it to live.

It takes 1 calorie to heat 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius, but the way we measure calories of food is in kcal which is 1,000 times more than one calorie. Meaning you can heat 1 kilogram of water by 1 degree Celsius using 1 kcal. Otherwise in the video it seemed that people would have to consume 1,000s of food calories to keep their bodies functioning as our bodies have many kilos of water, while 1 calorie (people thinking this is a food calorie) can only heat up 1 gram. Although I don&#39;t think you can change the video to somehow remove this mistake, hopefully you now know the difference between calories and kilo-calories so future videos aren&#39;t flawed.

I guess theirs a difference between being healthy and losing weight because you could stick to low calorie unhealthy food such as white bread and maybe some low calorie fries; you&#39;ll lose weight\u00a0 but definitely wont have enough nutrients to be healthy. whereas someone who does eat a lot of healthy foods can be a little fat but still be healthy. if you&#39;re looking for to losing weight AND being healthy then eat smaller portions and make healthier choices. this in my opinion is what should be done to lose weight.", "comment_date": "2014-03-21T18:08:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jessica Kuroki", "comment_text": "simple. eat healthier and small portions with anything. choose a salad instead of pasta. choose a banana instead of a pastry. etc.", "comment_date": "2014-03-21T17:58:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kay See", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t lie. you ate the whole bag XD", "comment_date": "2014-03-21T10:00:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rachel Petersen", "comment_text": "What are benefits of exercise ?", "comment_date": "2014-03-20T00:41:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Serg_mx", "comment_text": "How many calories is an m&amp;m", "comment_date": "2014-03-19T02:27:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Lam", "comment_text": "So potato car is possible?GENIUS", "comment_date": "2014-03-15T20:29:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gorilla and Cookie", "comment_text": "If we eat a bananna r we eating are selfels", "comment_date": "2014-03-15T14:09:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samm Sheperd", "comment_text": "But a food calorie is actually a kilocalorie..<br>one kilo cal = 1000 cal so one food calorie can potentially head one LITER of water 1 degree C, instead of a gram.", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T21:18:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kashin Koochie", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t lie, you ate the whole bag.

For surviving a 24 h period with full organ function assuming bed ridden 800-1000 will suffice. ACSM suggests an hour a day if moderate intensity so if we include that to our total we are at 1600 give or take 200 kcal (based on your jogging example which I think maybe over estimating as well). then you add in basic movements like filling your car which takes almost no calories and we can add maybe 200 kcal for the average person for moving around and doing chores. Research shows that 1500kcal is probably more accurate. Lance armstrong eats around 4000kcal a day due to the intense work outs he does. At the Canadian sport centre we tell high performance athletes to eat from 2000-3000kcal a day for muscle building. the average person does not do that.. if you were to say an average &quot;ATHLETE&quot; then you are right. I do not mean to start a conflict. please message me and i can send over lectures and notes and articles from my classes. I have a degree in kinesiology.
