Even still, it was ABSOLUTELY hell that went on for some days. Best med to take besides Librium is WATER, and tons and tons of it. It sure helped. But please please those suffering severely, NEVER stop cold turkey. You can very, very easily die!! Alcohol is THE only drug that coming off it can kill you. All the rest will make you feel like shit, but you won&#39;t die. Get proper help, if you have no doctor or an unreasonable one, go to the ER.

I was dependent and addicted to it for 12 years, my mistake was smoking the most powerful stuff every time. Tried to quit atleast once every year, the most i could go on was a couple months, experienced psychosis to extreme levels, delusional thoughts, even after week 5 i would still feel sick, thought i was already crazy, even at times thought i was schizophrenic. I was scared, depressed, wanted to end it all. Even afraid of my self thinking i could go crazy and hurt someone, (delusional thoughts and psychosis can do that to you) but it was a symptom and i thought at the time it was me with a damaged brain and damaged thinking pattern that thought i wasn&#39;t going to be able to heal. My heart would race so bad i was taken to the hospital 7 or 8 times in 2 months, at times with blood pressure so high i was told i could get a heart attack, slept 3 hours per night at most, crazy scary nightmares, sleep deprevation was driving me insane, crazy mood swings, prescribed xanax and high blood pressure medicine to ease symptoms, which end it up making them worse. My psychiatrist told me to quit them,  So i quit medication after 2 weeks which is enough for xanax to give you withdrawals (made me feel like week one). I would rarely get peace moments, ranging from only minutes to an hour at most, and then go back to anxiety and pain. But those moments where enough to see what i was missing on with my addiction.  i would go back to smoking to try to ease my symptoms, starting with very little and progressively getting back to high doses. What was my mistake? Trying to do it alone, going on day 34 today, but this time I&#39;ve been going to AA  since the first week of quitting, excercising 5 days a week 30 minutes a day, all 7 days if possible. Quit gun games. Quit Facebook videos full of fights, accidents, death, dumb people doing stpd things. Quit porn as weed would lead me to it to calm euphoria and anxiety. Quit soda and sweets, as sugar rush would give me more anxiety. My body becomes sensitive to everything and anything. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, ptsd, with panic attacks and major depression disorder. Tried to end all a few times in the past. Not a pill fan so no medication to help me this time. Just spitting all out at AA tribune, excercise, eating healthier, visiting family members, avoiding places, people and situations that could trigger my anger, pain, anxiety, and addiction, feeling in the gap with work when i can because currently unemployed, cleaning home, spending time with wife and kids, working on small projects like cleaning the cars and whatever i can do to distract my pain. Eating a healthy breakfast, Not eating after 9pm only maybe jelly or yogurt, and i sleep much better. also swimming decreases my inflammation. Drinking lots of water everyday, showing love to those around me,  and trying not run too fast in my recovery. But most of all getting closer to God, much prayer asking for forgiveness, help, and a chance to recreate my life and recover all the time wasted.   I been understanding myself better, learning I&#39;ve been my worse enemy, so trying to forgive myself to let go of the past and let go of the person ive been, or else it&#39;s like heavy chains on my body and soul that keep trying to make me think i will always be that person, and if i dont let go of that i wont be able to become someone new and free. trying to transform my habits, my thinking, my actions. It definitely a battle, that&#39;s why i have needed all those things and much more to feel in the emptiness before depression, anxiety, remorse, and pain take over and i go back to addiction. Im still a recovering addict, im understanding i was looking for peace in the wrong place, peace in marihuana thinking it would relax me, but was just making my body, mind, and heart sicker. Now im looking for that peace in all the mentioned above, im starting to appreciate soberness, everything smells, looks, seems, much brighter, much more positive, i am now hopeful for the future, im putting my faith in God and trusting He is with me on this journey, to being clean, to actually living. I have alot to work on, mood swings and old thinking patterns, all together with the physical pain that comes with abstinence, but the peace moments last longer as i get closer to detoxing, this time has been different, because im looking for all the help i can get, and actually using it. when i wake up anxious, i pray to God for help and peace, and end up Falling asleep again without notice. When i wake up in the morning i thank God for letting me see the sunlight once again, I thank him for my family, our health, our food, our home, the sun, the air, you name it, alot to be thankful for! .. Loosing a parent, loosing a child, having a chronic decease, are some of the harshest and hardest things in life, and i add recovering from addiction to the list. I pray that everyone who wants to change their lives around will make it, that they will get the help they need and take action in the right direction, I pray they never give up, i pray for God to help them heal and see the future with hope, and that they can recover faith and love in themselves, and most of all that they reach peace in their hearts to never need to go back to any type of addiction. I pray for healing for the sick, help for the poor, and i wish you all new beginnings in your bodies, minds, hearts, and souls! You can do it! Even when you feel alone, you are not, there are many of us who get you! Who understand what you are going through. We&#39;re all on this together, from different parts of the world! From different paths and upcomings! We are a sister/brotherhood. I am writing this from a peaceful moment laying on my bed, thankful for another day. Take it day by day, dont try to run. Its a journey to a new life, takes time and be patient with yourselfs, show love to those around you, forgive and forget, let go of the past, look for new begginings. Not just in the outter, but also within you! Love you all and pray we all find meaning in our existence, and true happiness and peace in our hearts. \ud83d\udc99 I will end this message for you like i end my tribune at AA, I thank God for this past 24 hours sober and thank YOU for your tolerance! \ud83d\ude4f", "comment_date": "2022-06-14T07:02:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian Maddox", "comment_text": "I&#39;m almost 5 months without alcohol now....

An empty husk of the athlete and outdoorsman I once was that is now getting a gut because of the drinking, and the only reason I don\u2019t do harder drugs is because I can\u2019t have my family see me die of an OD and even more so a suicide. So I kill myself slowly with alcohol. <br><br>I want to stop hurting, I know the drinks and money spending isn\u2019t helping, I know if my family knew what I was thinking or doing they might help me, I know I should stop\u2026 This is for all the other \u201cI know\u201d people out there. I know what you\u2019re going through, I want that person back too, I want to go back in time and do things differently too, I want to die of old age with grandkids too. <br><br>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get any of those things, maybe I just have to die and restart.

The reason I mentioned my brother who was 34 years old is because unfortunately he didn&#39;t want to stop drinking. 1 week ago he was walking down the street drunk because he was afraid of driving drunk and was hit by a car, he passed away from his injuries and it was all over nonsense. Our society makes it feel like it&#39;s normal to drink alcohol and even makes it look fun but the reality is that it&#39;s a drug that kills you slowly but surely. I lost my step-dad to alcohol and I lost my only brother to alcohol. If I allow it to it will kill me as well but I decided to stop it right there and to not allow myself to be consumed by alcohol any longer. You have to find a reason to live, even if it seems stupid to others. The simple fact is that when we came into this world we came alone and when we leave this world we leave alone.

Worst decision of my life.<br><br>3 years later I&#39;m still struggling with the health anxiety and loss of coping skills that quitting drinking gave me. My anxiety now goes straight to 100.

He is a black man, so you know how that goes. He recently started going to see doctors because he&#39;s starting to have serious health issues and possible prostate issues, but still won&#39;t tell his doctors he is alcohol dependant. I wonder if they can tell... He looks terrible, and his abdomen is enlarged. It&#39;s like he doesn&#39;t want to let go of drinking. I knew that if he were to stop drinking, he would get very sick and possibly die. But this video helped me understand even better what would happen if he quit. Explains his behaviors me and my family have witnessed over the years. I remember he would get very angry and crazy if he couldn&#39;t get something to drink. It costed him is jobs, house, he got a DUI, ended up totaling a car in front of a school, which could have killed him, and he has no recollection of the incident. He doesn&#39;t eat right still, all his close friends are dead because of poor health and terrible diet. It&#39;s amazing that he&#39;s still alive. He&#39;s a walking time bomb tho. We want him to do better. Friends and family have tried over all these years, but he&#39;s stubborn and set in his ways. He seems to be wanting to do something about his health, just not enough and not trying to let go of that alcohol.. I can only hope he&#39;ll want to fully heal, but it&#39;s all on him.

It lasted a little over 6 months and I honestly felt amazing. In the back of my mind I knew I still wanted to have a drink though. When the Dr told me my liver was ok I started drinking again slowly. Couple drinks here and there no big deal. Eventually the addiction took hold and for about 2 months I was back to drinking everyday. I also have bipolar disorder so I realized recently that drinking simply doesn\u2019t affect me the way it does other people. I have to work overtime to take care of myself and drinking simply can\u2019t be apart of my life. <br><br>Therefore, I made the decision to stop completely and this time around honestly feels different.

We\u2019ve been together for 20 years now. And the drinking has accelerated at a great pace. We\u2019ve always drank together since day one. But, I noticed her drinking get really out of control right after both her parents passed away 6 years ago 2 weeks apart. To the point of her not being able to make it all the way home without pulling over to vomit. And within the past 2 years she would drink every day after work until 3-4 AM. I started to have a hunch of some misdeeds so I placed a GPS on her car and was amazed at how many times a day she would leave her job and go get alcohol. And on the way home she would stop at multiple gas stations to sit and drink at for sometimes an hour at a time. Then the total disbelief of when I caught her at another guys place. Turns out he\u2019s a homeless guy that only owned a garbage bag of cloths that was it. He also come to find out was a addict. My counselor advised me that she was with him cause he didn\u2019t judge her like I did. Finally it got so bad that I told her I had her followed and she got so enraged with me she ended up packing a small bag which consisted of just 3 changes of clothing. She\u2019s been gone now 3 months and has now completely withdrawn from our marriage and stated she didn\u2019t know what she wanted. I\u2019ve tried everything to get her help but she refuses to admit she has a dependency to alcohol. Now mind you she holds a very professional career at the moment. She also has history of AUD in her family both her parents were severe AUD\u2019S and her brother and brother in law are severe AUD\u2019S. I\u2019m at my end and not sure where to go next. I\u2019m fearful that divorce is the only answer going forward.

One month turned into two two turned into six and now it&#39;s a year later and everyone who is still drinking knows I could care less about it. though I did not plan on quitting, I definitely stopped feeling totally crappy the next day so to speak even if it was only a couple drinks.

The &quot;radio-hypnosis&quot; IS NOT a COMMERCIAL, but the complex of the Military means to demoralize the Military ENEMY and destroy ENEMY country. So, the US Nation Security system is USING the Military system to abuse and allow MANUFACTURERS MAFIA to sell mal-made or seldom used merchandises to the public. <br>If SOMEBODY have the information and the money, it would be possible to find that &quot;private police&quot; or NATION SECURITY guard, and SUE him for his trash to harass whole towns or City Boroughs with his radio-boadcasting.

It was the Saturday we had a going away party in the village at one of the clubs.  The guy who the party was for, myself and two others started what was called a &quot;thunder run&quot; about 3 or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOQxOthLSCA&amp;t=3m30s\">3:30</a> in the afternoon.  We drank at least two drinks at each club before moving to the next.  I drank mainly bourbon and Coke.  From the Maxim Club and ended up at the Galaxy Club where I was feeling pretty good.  I also invited a waitress I knew at a club to join me if she could get off.  She did.  Well, by the time curfew rolled around I was sober.  The next morning when I awoke I felt as if I had not been out partying.  Monday morning was different when I went to work.  One of my coworkers, Able Vidari, asked me why did I do what I did to his lady.  To this day I still don&#39;t recall.  Later on my Property Book Officer, Mr Bayless, asked me who was the girl I introduced him to and I didn&#39;t recall until a decade later as I was looking at photos one day showing them to a friend.  While in country I lived mostly on a Korean diet and when I came back to the States my system had trouble getting used to American foods.  Try having the trots every day for a month.  When I went out drinking it just made me sick.  It was either go out drinking and be sick or go out and not drink and don&#39;t be sick.  I don&#39;t like being sick.  My buddies knew I had quit and why and then I became the &quot;designated driver&quot; before it became popular.

I&#39;ll share a little too, why not. By the time I was 25, I went from drinking only while going out to blacking out every single night without exceptions. At 28, the only time I didn&#39;t have a drink in my hand was when I was at work. When sober my hands were shaking so badly I couldn&#39;t perform basic functions like brushing teeth, I couldn&#39;t form full sentences or even words, my brain had this weird pulsating twitch topped with extreme fogginess, if someone talked for more than few seconds I lost track, I couldn&#39;t eat or even swallow my own spit without throwing up when sober. And the psoriasis part hit home too, it got so bad even with treatment that my knees and shins looked like my skin was peeling off of them. The crazy thing is that somehow I was 100% it was just my depression. As I was getting closer to 30, drinking stopped working, no matter how much I drank I couldn&#39;t feel at ease,  and THEN IT HIT ME, I realized I had a problem, the only solution left was to kill myself. When I turned 30 on Jul. 23, 2020 few weeks later I was living out of my car in my parents driveway, the only thing on my mind was to end it all, I thought it was too late, I was in pain 24/7, mental and physical, my eyes were yellowish, my resting heart rate was at 180 bpm, I was depressed and I was scared of being alive. Then on July 30, 2020, my mom woke me up by knocking on my car window and took me to straight to rehab. I wouldn&#39;t be here if not for my parents and everyone at Ashley Hope House! Even after all this, my mind still plays tricks on me from time to time telling me it&#39;s ok, but I know how to fight it this time!", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T10:54:30Z", "likes_count": 1092}, {"comment_by": "Keyon Wilson", "comment_text": "Not an alcoholic but only had a couple beers in the past month or so.

I hope this video shows more people why a person with severe AUD (&quot;an alcoholic&quot;) isn&#39;t facing the singular choice of whether or not to put a bottle to their lips. Their body begins to torture itself when these people try to quit, especially those trying to quit absent a physician&#39;s care. I&#39;ve seen people do it with and without meds. It&#39;s hard work, but each and every one of them would tell you it was worth walking a mile barefoot over glass.<br><br>I should add that the other side isn&#39;t instantly rosy. There are a ton of social issues to content with, ones you wouldn&#39;t have even imagined. Even this is another reason to get a physician&#39;s help when you try to quit. The physician will help guide you to other professionals, who they&#39;ve vetted, that can provide effective assistance for you on the social and societal factors that you may find yourself facing. The people I saw come back to detox were most often the ones blindsided by some social circumstance. If you can see it coming, we can deal with it and gain you another sober day. <br><br>Lastly, if you relapse, it&#39;s not over. It&#39;s actually pretty damn normal. Sobriety is not some state that you scratch and claw to enter and BAM, you&#39;re in, or uh-oh, you&#39;re out. Sobriety is better thought of as more an activity that you do rather than some &quot;this or that&quot; state. Sometimes sobriety is easier to do, other times not so much. But you get better with practice. The key is figuring out what makes it easier and what makes it more difficult. A physician and their team can help you uncover those helpful and unhelpful things. Further, they can help you develop a game plan that will play into those innate strengths (what makes it easier) and mitigates the things that will make it difficult -- until you build up your strengths in those areas. Relapse is about learning, not condemning. This is actually true of all drugs.<br><br>Don&#39;t suffer alone. Please get help.

That was all largely tied to my religion as well. And as I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve decided that I will continue to not drink, and while I suspect part of that is simply me not wanting to be embarrassed or judged by the religious people in my life, it\u2019s also because I understand that they actually have a point on this one. I do not think alcohol is some work of the devil or anything and I do not judge anyone who decides to use it. In fact, I respect people who drink responsibly. I just do not trust myself to be responsible with it, and I know just how dangerous it can be when it\u2019s abused not just on my psychological and relational health, but on my physical health as well. I just don\u2019t need another addiction in my life. I don\u2019t need yet another maladaptive behavior causing me harm. I already have enough of those to worry about. <br><br>And I also think that alcohol just makes everything a bit riskier. Even going to the bar with friends is a bit riskier if everyone is drunk. The driver may not be 100% sober, you might make sexual decisions you don\u2019t remember and would never approve of normally, people are more likely to take advantage of you while in such a vulnerable state (while being drunk), and people are more likely to inadvertently ignore the boundaries of others in any context while drunk. You could even end up in a fight that makes no sense and get injured. I mean none of that is particularly likely to happen, but it\u2019s far more likely to happen when you\u2019re drunk. <br><br>But hey, I get it. I\u2019m just risk-averse, and that means I\u2019m a total party-pooper. In the end, I just want people to be okay, and I want them to be happy and healthy. So I think people should enjoy alcohol, but be smart about it and do little things to reduce the risks. Like don\u2019t go alone to a bar, and make sure at least one person is a true friend who will make sure you\u2019re okay. Look out for each other or have someone there to look out for the group. Have a designated driver you can trust. Just little things. And obviously if you have an AUD, then don\u2019t be afraid to get help for it. There\u2019s no shame in that, in fact it\u2019s very applaudable. Nobody needs to be ridiculous like me, I just think we need to respect alcohol and see it for what it is: a recreational drug. It\u2019s harmless and can even enhance life if managed properly, but it can very easily destroy your life if it gets out of control.
