Using the 1918 pandemic for a basis to compare to. It goes like this :<br><br>The 1918 Pandemic saw 500 million infected, 50 million dead, with a total global population of about 2 billion.<br>That&#39;s 25% infected, with 10% fatality rate.<br>The 1918 Flu had an R0 value of about 1, and this CV is estimated to be about 2.<br>Today, the global population is about 8 billion. With a higher R0 value, expect a higher percentage of the population to become infected compared to 1918.<br>So if R0 = 2, then 50% would become infected. I&#39;ll use a 40%-60% range since we haven&#39;t had enough time to really establish the true numbers.<br>With an estimated fatality rate of 3% that comes to about 100 million - 150 million dead before this thing is over with. <br><br>That is worst case scenario. There isn&#39;t a historic model to compare to with widespread social distancing, since it hasn&#39;t really been applied on a large scale ever before. On a smaller scale in 1918 isolation did reduce infection rate. But that was with a virus that was less infectious than CV. In the past pandemics really only end one way. That is through herd immunity. The recovered people need to make up enough percentage of the global population to provide herd immunity. It doesn&#39;t look like a vaccine will be available in time. Even if it is, it has to be distributed to most of the people on the planet to provide the same herd immunity.", "comment_date": "2020-03-17T23:16:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "theres no point in subbing to me.", "comment_text": "Asia.

Censorship (from Latin censorship) is the disapproval and consequent removal of the public circulation of information, aiming to protect the interests of a state, organization or individual. It consists of any attempt to suppress the circulation of information, opinions or artistic expressions. What is happening with this \u201cCorona\u201d Virus pandemic is exactly that. People want to know the whole truth about what really happened! This virus was not spontaneously generated and such a mutating virus has never been documented in human history. Medical science has already classified all existing viruses since the 19th century! Louis Pasteur was a French scientist, whose discoveries were of enormous importance in the history of chemistry and medicine. He is recognized for his remarkable discoveries of the causes and prevention of diseases. All viruses have been classified since the time of Pasteur. Among his most notable achievements are the reduction in mortality and the creation of the first rabies vaccine (rabies vaccine). The Human Being went to the Moon 51 years ago and now it will be a short while to go to Planet Mars. How is it possible that you haven&#39;t known the \u201cCorona\u201d virus since historical times? It was certainly an accident of unknown proportions in some chemical and genetic manipulation factory, which inoculated tons of chemical material contaminated with genetically modified laboratory viruses into the atmosphere! Nothing like this has ever happened in the history of mankind! The Chernobyl Disaster was also a catastrophic nuclear accident that took place between April 25 and 26, 1986 in nuclear reactor No. 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Factory, near the city of Pripyat, in northern Soviet Ukraine, near the border with Soviet Belarus. Was this \u201cCorona\u201d virus also a catastrophic accident that occurred in December 2019 at any Asian plant?

The disease has been spreading for weeks now and officials have been ignoring it completely. The school systems have completely mixed responses. In class there are multiple kids i see who are obviously sick, coughing sneezing or etc. and they are not sent home. My particular district, in their infinite wisdom has reacted the worst where some schools have canceled because of a student who tested positive for the disease, that school in which hundreds of students from other schools travel to everyday. They decided that the best course of action was not to cancel, but disinfect the schools, and then continue as if nothing has happened.      <br><br>The worst part of it though, is the people and the idiocy. The young people are not taking any precautions because they believe they are immune and won\u2019t be hurt, or they are being overly cautious which doesn\u2019t hurt but overwhelming smell of hand sanitizer. The stores are all bought out of supplies for when we have to stay at home for who knows how long because false information is spreading like wildfire. Shitty websites and facebook are spreading lies and mistruths and it\u2019s actually causing panic and could cause harm. <br><br>The scariest thing is that no one really knows what is going on if you are sick, and that you go to containment for a while. But what does that do to us? We don\u2019t get compensation for that time lost from work, that could be devastating for a lot of families, and people are actually telling others NOT to tell anyone if they\u2019re sick.

I also don\u2019t know a whole lot about the CDC but what kind of crap are they pulling? We only now got testing available, but only 1000 a day, and there are absolutely way more infected than that.

So I am always just touching things with my sleeve in public places, use purell when I uncomfortable and wasch my hands very often during the day. It&#39;s so strange to see all people behave the same way at the moment, making a behavior I was always kinda embarrassed about, somewhat normal atm. I am actually not in the least concerned about the virus, although I am working at the hospital grounds that carried one of the first Corona patients in Germany. It&#39;s just interesting how the fear can make people behave just like a &quot;mentally sick&quot; person like me. So I have empathy for everyone being afraid.
