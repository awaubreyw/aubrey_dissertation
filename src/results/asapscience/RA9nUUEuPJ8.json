In my novel, there is, by coincidence, a very similar observation expressed about humans and why they evolved to recognize faces. It doesnt have to do with eyebrows per se but im a little surprised that my fiction aligns with real life science.<br><br>Here&#39;s the paragraph if anyone is interested:<br><br>&quot;Human beings are social creatures by nature. Over hundreds of thousands of years, they, like many other species, have evolved and enhanced the ability to become better at what it is that allows them to continue to thrive. There are many different skills that humans have mastered over millenia that have aided in their survival. Of the many, one of them stands above the rest in many categories. That trait is the ability to efficiently socialize with others of their kind. Because of the massive benefits that comes from constantly continuing to use this trait, it is no surprise that mankind can\u2019t help but to want to interact with their fellow man on every fundamental level. One of the ways human beings have grown better at assessing how to approach others around them, is by first getting an idea of what those around them are feeling. Whether it is just a byproduct of evolution or masterful design, humans have been fortunate enough to been blessed with being able to express how they are feeling through their own eyes, and perhaps even more importantly, with being able to understand how someone else is feeling through theirs. What will then happen to a species that has spent the entirety of its existence, refining and perfecting this dormant trait that is by all means a key characteristic in defining what makes them human and thereby different from any other species and crucial to their survival, if they aren\u2019t able to use it to gauge the emotional state of another person? The answer lies within a famous aphorism that they have adopted for whenever such an occurrence presents itself: We fear what we do not understand.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tactile-Therapy-One-Durell-Arrington-ebook/dp/B0793LC6CT/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=tactile+therapy&amp;qid=1610645180&amp;sr=8-1\">https://www.amazon.com/Tactile-Therapy-One-Durell-Arrington-ebook/dp/B0793LC6CT/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=tactile+therapy&amp;qid=1610645180&amp;sr=8-1</a><br><br>EDIT: For further clarity, the particular chapter that this paragraph derives is about a group of people coming across a man with no eyes.
