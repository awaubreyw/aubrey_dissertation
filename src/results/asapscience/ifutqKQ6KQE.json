I&#39;m literally the most unassuming 22yr old female that has never taken a drug before, had straight a&#39;s and for fun reads non fiction &amp; goes on picnics like ur treated like a drug addict for no reason. We literally need it for basic functioning &amp; it manages my chronic illness by regulating the norepinephrine, without it I&#39;m in hospital. I was going to Denmark next month for 6 months and Japan for the next 6 to study on prestigious scholarships that I gave back yesterday &amp; I just canceled my flights because in Japan its illegal and in Denmark their is no access to it, without it I literally can not function. So yeah I just discovered that the life of travel I planned for myself is impossible now so it would be great if u guys could just stop using it to get high in the club and compensate for ur lack of intelligence. If its &#39;basically meth&#39; then JUST DO METH &amp; leave us alone.", "comment_date": "2022-05-19T06:35:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jason Ackerman", "comment_text": "Terrible video.

My other option is to suck it all up except it\u2019s incredibly difficult to focus on one sentence that way. My solution: stimulant medication.

I used to really love your channel, but this video made me stop watching and unsubscribe. <br>This video focuses almost entirely on people taking it who don&#39;t need it and only lightly touches on how it helps people who do. It seems like it is shaming people who take it regardless of if they need it or not. While you say it was made for people who have ADHD, you don&#39;t mention that it is ok or safe for people with ADHD to use(which many peer reviewed studies show that it is). <br>Demonization of Adderall across the board like this and Documentaries like &quot;Take Your Pills&quot; is why I am still afraid to tell people I take it for my executive function disorder. It is also the kind of thinking that prevents people like me from succeeding because my parents thought ADHD was made up to sell Adderall to kids. I was diagnosed in 4th grade and if my parents didn&#39;t think it was fake, I may have at least gotten some therapy to learn ways to live with how my brain works instead of struggling how to teach myself to learn in a world that was not built for me. I was unable to do well in school because of my symptoms and I was just told I was lazy, which caused  me to be very depressed and at times suicidal. I didn&#39;t have a chance to go to college because my family was poor and I &quot;wasn&#39;t smart enough&quot; to get any scholarships.  <br>I have a prescription for Adderall that I NEED to do the things neurotypical people take for granted. I don&#39;t use it to get an &quot;edge&quot; in anything because I need it just to be on the same playing field as people who don&#39;t. Getting diagnosed AGAIN as an adult and getting treatment changed(and probably saved) my life. I can start and actually FINISH projects. I can achieve goals I set for myself and engage in hobbies that are fulfilling for me. My relationships are better. I can hold down a job and actually succeed at it rather than treading water. <br>I really hope you think about updating this video because stereotypes like the ones in this video have damaged my life in ways I can never fully repair.

I found it embarrassing having to go to the office everyday at lunch and it was known by the class that I had to go do this. In grade 6 my dad started putting in my sandwich so we could be more discreet about taking the medication. I was absolutely killing it at school and never focused so hard and was driven to learn. But my social life took a big hit and I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone. So at that point I decided do I want a social life or grades. I stopped taking the pills and chose friends. Fast forward to now where I\u2019m 28 and have had an awesome life with tons of fun. But now I\u2019m back in online courses for law and started taking it again. Can anyone share their stories of long term use with adderall because I\u2019m over focusing on being social and now want to be successful. It honestly feels like the movie limitless when I take this stuff and as a prescribed patient I fit the profile, I take a low dose and only use it for study days.

Second, it is obvious how little the creator knows about millennials by calling us the adderall generation. Lastly, claiming that adderall is essentially meth is blatant sophistry and appeals to a large demographic of naive, arrogant, and simple minded know-it-alls which operate under a pretense of superiority by not using stimulants for ADHD. Stimulants like adderall have tons of empirical evidence which supports their therapeutic impact on ADHD symptoms and corresponding changes in brain structure that more closely resemble the structure of a normal brain. Genetic analyses show that there is also a set of genes which are linked to ADHD; one of which results in a dopamine reuptake transporter abnormality and a consequent lower concentration of synaptic dopamine levels. Adderall normalizes brain activity in ADHD patients and allows them to function in a competitive world. It&#39;s easy for someone without ADHD to conclude that those with it are simply undisciplined and making up an excuse for their behavior, but there are actual neuropsychological factors which are beyond their control.", "comment_date": "2020-03-12T14:22:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gavan Ransom", "comment_text": "I took 60mg xr and ain\u2019t really feel shit but a little focused", "comment_date": "2020-03-11T09:12:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sanchit tripattiwar", "comment_text": "Best ad ever.", "comment_date": "2020-03-11T07:28:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZUCC ZUCC", "comment_text": "Happy i got adhd", "comment_date": "2020-03-11T06:09:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caleb DeVore", "comment_text": "If you\u2019ve done meth before, then do a decent amount of Adderall (a couple 20mg instants for instance) they feel the same, so if you wanna do meth just do Adderall..", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T08:03:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "No Name", "comment_text": "Remember kids, it works faster when you snort it.", "comment_date": "2020-03-09T22:06:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Wasson", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifutqKQ6KQE&amp;t=0m27s\">0:27</a> &quot;Commonly known as MEEFFFTH&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-03-09T18:49:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Marosha Nawaz", "comment_text": "This literally explains my ADHD I cane to the comments just to find that I had already seen it and liked all comments", "comment_date": "2020-03-09T08:16:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Random Chanel 13", "comment_text": "10 mg I take 72 that\u2019s what I\u2019m prescribed", "comment_date": "2020-03-06T11:43:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HerobrineSLAYER", "comment_text": "Without Adderall I feel like a crack head and legit can\u2019t get anything done", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T03:15:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ruhama M", "comment_text": "I feel tired when I take it", "comment_date": "2020-03-03T03:31:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chekz z", "comment_text": "10mg ain&#39;t shit, 40mg makes the difference", "comment_date": "2020-03-03T00:25:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LocallyGone", "comment_text": "I do have ADHD and I did take Adderall when I was in college.

For people wondering, it\u2019s more like a very diluted and safer version of meth, but without a lot of the bad parts of it. Your body won\u2019t crave it as hard (unless you take high dosages of adderall for many years) and it also is way safer for your body (unless you have heart problems because it obviously is of course a stimulant, and will DEFINITELY put a strain on your heart). I am very disappointed in the scare tactics in this video because it could turn away many people to the wonderful bonuses that adderall could provide. The main problem America has with adderall is that not enough people go through the proper steps to get it, and many just buy it from a friend who has it. But you won\u2019t know if;<br>1.

It should also be noted that many science classes, especially those relating to humans (i.e. sociology and psychology), make it very clear that cultural biases are to be removed prior to observation or forming a conclusion. On top of the small sample size of college students, they don&#39;t explain how the mental facilities of each group were accounted for... such as dopamine levels being taken prior to the experiment. Giving extra dopamine to someone that already has a normal level of dopamine will have negative effects, and would many other unaccounted chemicals that make our brains function optimally.<br><br>Seratonin and Dopamine can be organically increased for extended periods of time as well. For example, exercising naturally increases the level of &#39;feel good&#39; hormones, as well as positive physical contact, sexual activity (i.e. masturbation etc), and close relationships. While there might be a study for it, I haven&#39;t heard of anyone proclaim that people that stop exercising or masturbating, after long periods of time will, effectively, be unable to cope with life... unless they continue with that activity.<br><br>The artwork, if you noticed, also shows blatant biases. The person that has an increase in blood pressure looks like they just witnessed a dog getting hit, and the student taking the pills... for some reason... is downing the entire bottle (FYI... that would probably cause an overdose and kill the person). It should also be noted that STUDYING for an exam, which is where a lack of focus can really hurt, is what requires repetitive learning tasks. I can&#39;t recall a single EXAM that required complex learning skills... I really should have already done the learning (and aptitude for learning can vary extremely from one person to the next) prior to the exam, and I reinforce what I&#39;ve learned by repetitively studying the learned material.<br><br>&quot;The benefits of Adderal in academic circles is still up for debate, but the long-term effects of Adderal abuse is clear...&quot; is extraordinarily generalized and misleading. People that take Adderal, prescribed by their doctor after testing, are not ABUSING Adderal. As he mentioned previously, people with ADHD have a shortage of the brain chemicals that Adderal helps supply, and it is thought to be genetic... not the result of poor life choices, etc. Taking Adderal lifts up the chemicals to an &#39;average&#39; level, but I really don&#39;t see why it would prevent your body from continuing to respond to the stimuli that directly produces the same chemicals as well (such as exercising etc). It could be hypothesized that, through homeostasis, the body will recognize the increase in dopamine/serotonin and reduce the innate production of the chemicals, but it&#39;s not like your body will suddenly forget how to make them. Did you know, for example, that a lack of calcium in your blood (potentially caused by a lack of Vitamin D, which aids in the absorption of calcium) will initiate a process that increases the dissolving of your bones to release more calcium into your blood (research osteoclasts and osteoblasts if you want to know more about that)? Your body is fantastic and will respond to most situations to ensure optimal mental and physical health.<br><br>Upon further research, you will actually find that many of the negative side effects he lists are in cases of Adderal ABUSE. This means that the patient took the medication when not prescribed OR took a continually excessive dose that was not prescribed by their doctor. The GOAL of taking Adderal, as a patient with ADHD, is to normalize the production of specific brain chemicals. Taking too much will, obviously, have the opposite effect and will, undoubtedly, lead to negative effects in a long-term scenario.<br><br>Now, for the seemingly unprofessional and culturally biased notion that methamphetamines and Adderal (amphetamine salts), by extension, are &#39;destroyers of humanity.&#39; There is one INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FACT that separates these two drugs that are eerily similar (methamphetamines metabolizes into amphetamines but goes through a &#39;double&#39; process):  Adderall is a controlled substance that is created in high-tech laboratories and specifically prescribed by a certified medical professional after a typically lengthy testing period to ensure the patient would benefit from the drug. The patient is required to see their medical professional on a regular basis, and they are often encouraged to use therapeutic methods (exercise, weight loss, time management, etc.) to reduce the need for Adderall. The patient&#39;s use and dosage are quite controlled. On the other hand, methamphetamines are recreational drugs that are created in... less than opportune areas, and... due to it being &#39;recreational&#39; the drug is not often taken with &#39;doses&#39; and &#39;controlled and systematic solution to a lack of particular brain chemicals&#39; in mind. Note that Adderall CAN and IS abused, but not everyone taking Adderall is ABUSING it. Using it as unintended and/or without a medical professional&#39;s guidance can have disastrous effects. They may be chemically similar, but their use-cases greatly separate the two.<br><br>As for the addictiveness of the drug, I can only say that there may be a large portion of that being fed by psychological aspects instead of purely biological ones. A person that takes Adderall after years of feeling stupid and lazy... finally feeling that they can be a productive member of society... able to better interact with their loved ones and properly prioritize and focus... It is easy to understand and empathize with a person when they feel like the medicine is their only hope. The same goes with other medicines that treat long-term mental quirks, like depression and anxiety.<br><br>Final thoughts... I still love AsapSCIENCE and how they take complex scientific notions and bring them to &#39;the masses.&#39; However, I wonder if there are times when the fine line between entertainers and scientists gets unbalanced. Topics that have deep roots in sociology, such as circumcision and mental health, have very specific audiences when biases towards one side or another are shown. I understand that citing research papers, debating the value of particular studies, and delving into the deep information of a subject is not likely to please a wide array of the audience. I do wish that the creators at AsapSCIENCE, however, understand how influential they can be on young minds. A person out there could be suffering from ADHD and could be really helped by taking Adderall, but they may feel too ashamed or vehemently against this &#39;evil&#39; drug after watching this video... where people that take Adderall are made out to be addicts that actively abuse the drug.<br><br>IF YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE ADHD, PLEASE TALK TO A DOCTOR AND/OR THERAPIST. TALK WITH THEM ABOUT THERAPY OPTIONS AND/OR MEDICINAL OPTIONS. THEY ARE TRAINED PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE STUDIED HOW TO BEST SOLVE A PATIENT&#39;S NEEDS. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. DO NOT FEEL ASHAMED.

Amphetamine is Not the same as methamphetamine. It&#39;s like saying drinking ethanol is the same as drinking methanol. Amphetamine is not directly neurotoxic, while methamphetamine is directly neurotoxic to the brain and neurons. Amphetamine(speed) releases dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain while methamphetamine(meth) releases larger amounts of dopamine and serotonin even in small 5mg meth doses. Speed(amphetamine) only releases serotonin if you take over 60mg of it. Stacking adderall with Memantine makes it completely safe both for ADHDers and Neurotypicals. In Neurotypicals, they have a normal sizes prefrontal cortex and don&#39;t need Adderall, but get energy from it. In ADHDers, the prefrontal cortex is smaller so in order to improve executive function, Adderall is needed and it&#39;s relaxing. Adderall does not improve mean intelligence levels, only executive function. So there are plenty of cases where average intelligence or even below average intelligence Neurotypicals don&#39;t get smarter on Adderall, only faster. And also plenty of cases where gifted ADHDers struggle to function but then excel when taking Adderall, due to finally not hyperfocusing on one subject and finally blocking out external distraction thanks to Adderall. So Adderall could mean the difference between life and death for an ADHDer. Further stigmatizing Adderall and Ritalin and Memantine and Selegiline doesn&#39;t help.

I understand the point you are trying to make, but as a science channel it&#39;s a bad idea to quote only studies that support the subjective narrative that you&#39;re trying to bring.

Adderall and other stimulant medications should only be taken by those who have been formally (via neuropsych testing) diagnosed with ADHD.<br>2. The dose makes the poison. Just because they&#39;re both &quot;Amphetamine&quot; does not mean &quot;it&#39;s just like meth!&quot; Dose size/frequency and delivery method matter.<br>3. Adderall and other stimulant medications have been shown to be effective and safe for long term use in over 400 large scale clinical studies going back way before there were brand names for these drugs (some 75 years). This includes data showing it works better than placebo, although the placebo effect shown in the video is important for those that use it as a study aid.<br>4. Stigma, misunderstanding, myths, and disbelief of individuals with ADHD is rampant, even among medical and mental health professionals,  and this type of myth and misinformation leads some to not get beneficial treatment.<br>5. Those looking for detailed empirical research about ADHD and medication should seek the books by Dr. Russel Barkley, the leading expert in the world on the topic.<br><br>P.S.

Adderall is highly addictive and I feel like not a lot of people understand what pharmaceutical meds do to your brain. <br>I was diagnosed with type 2 ADHD when I was 6. I spent the next 15yrs on and off of ADHD meds before subsequently switching to non-pharmaceutical treatment. Adderall was the hardest to get over. When I was first prescribed it, my recommended dosage was 20mg (which is absolutely absurd to me). 20mg was 4x the amount of what I needed! The first time I took the full dosage, I stayed up for 36hrs and couldn\u2019t eat. I really only needed about 5mg, so I started there. I used to break up my tablets into 4, but then I started to feel groggy and irritable all the time so I upped the dosage to 10mg, then 15, 20, 30...eventually I was crushing 60mg a day (3x what my initial prescribed amount was). It was awful! I became overly aggressive and emotional. If I went too long or didn\u2019t take enough Adderall, I\u2019d experience huge depression crashes. I also lost 15lbs from not eating enough, but my body started over producing Cortisol because I was too stressed so I had all this hanging fat that developed from losing weight too quickly in an unhealthy way. Additionally, my heart would race so fast from excessive use that I had started to develop heart palpitations. So eventually, in the middle of a huge slump, I decided I needed to stop taking Adderall because I was addicted and it was physically hurting me (btw Adderall is awful for your liver\u2014 prolonged use can cause a ton of complications). So I quit and haven\u2019t touched it in almost a year now, I highly recommend if you have ADHD\u2014 seek alternative remedies! There\u2019s a lot of natural based things (such as increased B12 intake, meditation, etc) that help so much more and allow you to feel like yourself still!", "comment_date": "2018-10-12T06:13:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bored Games - GeekRedemptionFTW", "comment_text": "Adderall induces development of 2 extra pupils (as seen in thumbnail)", "comment_date": "2018-10-12T05:03:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Parth Goenka", "comment_text": "NOT OUR FAULT.

The video made it seem so positive to me. ) But then today I saw the comments and tTHANK GOD THE COMMENTS! it made me search about the drug and I also saw interviews of people who have taken it .

It&#39;s cause your dopamine to be used up and so you have no energy in your brain to carry on with life. IS THIS HOW YOU WANT TO LIVE LIFE ? SUXH LOW QUALITY OF LIVING. ? This might seem like harmless . But the effects are similar and some cases worse than hardcore drugs. Just like any other drug it&#39;s addictive and life-threatning .

I graduated from college, by some grace of God, but when I entered the field of mental health case management, my cognitive deficits really became apparent. I believed that I was stupid, I had cripplingly low self-worth, and I would mentally punish myself and self-injure, because I just could not understand why everyone around me was able to get their work done on time and  how they were able to get so much accomplished. I started get in trouble for my work performance, and after speaking with my psychiatrist, he referred me for ADHD testing. The results made it glaringly obvious that I have ADHD, and to boot, the psychologist who performed the testing informed me that my IQ is in the average to above average range. I started receiving stimulant treatment from my psychiatrist, in the form of, surprise!, Adderall, and my world has done a complete 360. There is no magical bullet; I still have to make a concentrated effort to avoid situations that can get me off track, like overhearing and wanting to join in on an interesting conversation between coworkers when I have things to do, but Adderall gives me the ability to DECIDE not to get distracted. With any medication, there can be side effects, such as addiction, but it\u2019s a question of quality of life. And addiction involves so many factors, as not everyone who takes the same substance will develop an addiction.

I still needed the discipline to do it, and when I did try to study I found I was able to.
