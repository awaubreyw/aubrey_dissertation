I use no other drugs, never have, never will.  I don&#39;t do cigs, alcohol, dope....etc...just poppers.  I&#39;m health conscious and prefer feeling sober/normal 99.9% of the time.   Poppers have such a fleeting effect, that they have the huge advantage of maximum control regarding dose.  Whereas, when you inject or drink a drug, you have to let it run its course.  You could be under the influence for hours or days.   With poppers, once the last whiff is taken, the effects should be gone in less a few minutes.    I have found that the amyl group of poppers give the least side effects.... bad effects that can last hours or days.  Isopropyl nitrite always drops my blood pressure to levels that make me feel terrible.   Happens in less than 10 minutes and thereafter I can&#39;t take another whiff, not even a tiny one.   The butyl group(iso and n-butyl) causes less side effects than isopropyl nitrite, but they can still cave blood pressure, in less than 30 minutes.  Some of the unwanted side effects, such as headache, are due to impurities, such as acid and other degradation products, but there are a whole host of possible impurities.  A well made popper, suitable for inhalation and recreation,  should NOT have any unpleasant effect.", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T20:19:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Marco Resendiz", "comment_text": "gonna subscribe real quick", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T08:26:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex", "comment_text": "ew", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T05:20:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sai alonzo", "comment_text": "i like you hahhaha Ding! \ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T03:20:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pe na jaca", "comment_text": "Good \ud83d\ude03", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T18:34:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joker", "comment_text": "Sniffing chemicals.

I have been living on drugs just to keep my life going not until recently when i met this great doctor online, dr cozon in one of the HIV/AIDS international health care group. this doctor has set a great turn around in my life which i will always live to remember. words can&#39;t explain the joy and happiness i have been having since i tested negative because, from the onset, i never believed the deadly virus has a cure. Well, i got some herbal medications from him which i used as he instructed, just about two weeks after then, i went for a test and i was HIV negative. Indeed,  I got cured with the herbal medication. You can contact dr cozon on whatsapp or call on +13192094060 if you need him", "comment_date": "2021-07-08T15:41:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blakeaholics", "comment_text": "This channel has only gotten more fun the more open with your sexuality you&#39;ve become, with peace and love.", "comment_date": "2021-07-08T15:36:33Z", "likes_count": 65}, {"comment_by": "Ashton Simmons", "comment_text": "Irregardless eh", "comment_date": "2021-07-08T15:32:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sir Velociraptor", "comment_text": "I&#39;m honestly disappointed in this channel", "comment_date": "2021-07-08T15:32:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bara A.", "comment_text": "Bro what \ud83d\udc80", "comment_date": "2021-07-08T15:15:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke Forbes", "comment_text": "Better title lmao", "comment_date": "2021-07-08T15:12:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shelton DeLouch", "comment_text": "Went a little too far...", "comment_date": "2021-07-08T15:09:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niko Gill", "comment_text": "IRREGARDLESS??? asapscience. pls \ud83d\ude2d", "comment_date": "2021-07-08T15:07:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ScrogFPV", "comment_text": "Had me laughing!
