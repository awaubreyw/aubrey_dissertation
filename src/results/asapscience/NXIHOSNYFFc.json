They insisted that they had arrived here more like 60,000-100,000 years ago, but because their histories were kept and shared orally with no written records, they were basically ignored by the modern scientific community. The fact that we\u2019re finally finding so much physical evidence that directly supports the indigenous peoples claims makes me very hopeful that it will lead to more cooperation between the two groups. It gives me actual goosebumps thinking about what we could accomplish by combining the knowledge held by the indigenous communities with the powers and tools that modern science has given us.", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T23:16:43Z", "likes_count": 1197}, {"comment_by": "Danyaal khan", "comment_text": "Nice", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T23:14:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sofi Love...", "comment_text": "I love it looks so soft &amp; clean...good luck guy&#39;s...", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T23:08:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Artismylife", "comment_text": "With all the separate videos I thought you guys broke up", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T23:08:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "StudiOdara", "comment_text": "I love this channel", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T23:04:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jebowlin", "comment_text": "Ginger Boy is gonna need to be careful, hes gonna get a sun burn from the ground", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T23:00:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "maoam 2002", "comment_text": "\u201cYou know we are in white sands because boom white sand\u201d truly inspirational", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T23:00:33Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Kristin", "comment_text": "I think this pandemic has taught people the importance of multiple streams of income, unfortunately having a job doesn&#39;t mean security rather having different investments is the real deal...", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T22:58:38Z", "likes_count": 31}, {"comment_by": "Vishal Gohil", "comment_text": "good", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T22:58:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Dubois", "comment_text": "This is a really great channel.", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T22:56:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rebecca Starr", "comment_text": "Those foot prints look unbelievable like really like fresh step hmmm", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T22:55:56Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Shubham Dixit", "comment_text": "The amount of knowledge used to analyze the subject \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T22:54:57Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "taiyouchan \u2600\ufe0f", "comment_text": "Happy Earth Day!!!!
