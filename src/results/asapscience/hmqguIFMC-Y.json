The whole time I was watching it, I kept thinking &quot;What about redheads like me?&quot; I know this is going to sound odd to the people whose hair is not naturally red, but everytime I go outside during the day, the sun does not feel &quot;warm and inviting&quot; to me as I&#39;ve heard just about everyone around me claim it is for them. Instead, it causes an instantaneous, dull, constant PAIN that lasts until I&#39;ve gone back inside. This is to say, I can literally FEEL the sun burning me before I&#39;ve even developed an even close to visible sunburn. Also, the vitamin D thing, I would love to see a video regarding the science behind whether or not redheads actually NEED sunlight, because (I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s true but) I&#39;ve heard from several sources, some of them science professors, who say that redheads have the unique ability of being able to manufacture our own vitamin D WITHOUT the sun as a result of our ancestors living in such sun-less climates. Basically, I&#39;m asking you to make a video about redheads. Do redheads NEED the sun like everyone else? Or are we the exception? Also, what are some other facts about redheads, backed by science, that you can find? I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only redhead watching this channel who&#39;s curious about redhead-biology.", "comment_date": "2016-10-28T16:48:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Depressed_ Spaguetti", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmqguIFMC-Y&amp;t=2m14s\">2:14</a> <b>sits for all afternoon</b> yaaaay", "comment_date": "2016-10-27T23:17:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caramel Boi", "comment_text": "i lay down when watching youtube.", "comment_date": "2016-10-27T12:31:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drynk", "comment_text": "i have osteoporosis!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>too old of a meme? not funny? sorry gotta go kms", "comment_date": "2016-10-24T22:10:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christhel 23", "comment_text": "Hey you!

When I do go out I go out in the night time. And I hate sun light.  I can feel it burning me which only feels good when it&#39;s very cold. Otherwise it just feels like I&#39;m sitting too close to a heater or fire. I don&#39;t hate nature. I&#39;m not obese.  I definitely do not have immune deficiencies.  Although I do lapse into depression from time to time but I know what the cause is and it&#39;s not from lack of yellow plasma ball exposure. Also I do some pretty stupid/extreme stuff from time to time. I&#39;ve never broken or fractured a bone though I have dislocated joints a few times when I didn&#39;t quite nail a landing or trick. I&#39;m probably as pale if not paler than Daniel Radcliffe.  All in all I&#39;m healthier than majority of people.  I don&#39;t have any allergies, or I haven&#39;t discovered any yet. So yeah.  I&#39;m a freak.  I do donate blood and after losing a pint I don&#39;t feel light headed in the slightest and I usually get up against their recommendation. I can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve seen a doctor.  I know it had been several years.  Last time was for a massive cut on my foot thanks to an exposed glass shard slicing into my flesh.  He just examined it and said I should return if I get any problems from it. I didn&#39;t thus I never returned.  The only thing that I really take as medication is aspirin for headaches. But that&#39;s usually the fault of birds that won&#39;t shut up.
