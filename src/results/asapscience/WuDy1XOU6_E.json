There were boy\u2019s around me who were in relationships I would ask them how matured are you ?do you even know the meaning of love? I used to think everybody is silly but then during my last 2 years I met a girl I don\u2019t know if was destined or it was an accident. I was trying to hit one of my friends with a chalk and it accidentally hit her and it almost hit her in the right eye the area turned red i was sure she would slap me or complain to the principal but no!!she came to me I said I\u2019m very sorry and she made sure that guilt that I had goes away she just told me to smile and forget whatever happened. I told her I was trying to hit my friend but i accidentally hit you she just told me it\u2019s okay I believe you. The way she spoke it still feels like it just happened 5 minutes ago the mannerisms the voice the way she was looking at me my God she was just an Angel..I had never seen a girl in this world who was that beautiful God!!everything about her was like a dream be it her face, her eyes, her aura,her hair.. I don\u2019t know when and how I fell in love with her Now it was our last year of school that\u2019s the 10th year \ud83d\ude15I used to sit behind her so in some time we became friends. We exchanged numbers started messaging this was before WhatsApp i mean like text messages late night chats..Then my friends knew how much I was crazy about her so they forced me to propose her and foolishly I did she rejected me..I went into serious depression like really why did she reject me? I don\u2019t drink I don\u2019t smoke what\u2019s wrong with me ? somehow I gave my exams and I passed...<br><br>Then suddenly after 3 years I saw her walking on the road while I was in a bus my God I still remember how happy I was to see her that day she didn\u2019t see me but I was so energetic so nice to everybody around me. Everyone wondered why I was so happy? To be honest she makes me feel like I\u2019m the strongest person In this world I can achieve anything I can defeat anyone...<br><br>But then in reality she was in a committed relationship with a boy who was older than her I was like this is not serious and they are going to break up at some point but no..just to see her beautiful face again I started to find out where she stays so that I could just see her once again..that would make my day or even my life..but I never got to see or talk to her again she\u2019s just not interested..People tell me to forget her but it\u2019s not that easy I don\u2019t know why all these years she has been coming in my dreams even when I don\u2019t think of her she\u2019s just there!! in my subconscious mind. I pray to God to let me forget her like i just never met her or these events never took place. I\u2019m a lonely guy who wanted nothing but companionship I respect women I\u2019m a virgin and I look at girls in a very respectful manner..people say rich guys get beautiful girls..must be true I\u2019m decently rich but that\u2019s got me nothing. No girl looks at me!!forget about having a conversation they just ignore and walk away..well girls just don\u2019t appear from the sky I have been told !! I was advised to use a dating app. I was on at least 10 dating apps and 2 marriages making apps for 6 months like imagine I tried so hard to get a girl...but no girl approached me back. Now I feel my existence is worthless i don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still alive why I\u2019m breathing..? I don\u2019t celebrate any festivals including birthdays it\u2019s been years now every year I come up with some excuse to not celebrate because my parents are not aware of how tired I am of living..<br><br>what I know is that I\u2019m a cursed soul so I\u2019m just waiting for death now.Even if I die there\u2019s no one who will shed a tear even my parents they\u2019ll forget me in like 2 days after I\u2019m cremated. I have no purpose to live but I do have a carrier but no idea for whom I\u2019m studying for whom I\u2019ll earn and on whom I\u2019ll spent?? Since the day I was born I saw nothing but sadness now I\u2019m completely damaged I hope I leave this world soon.. no one can understand my agony and pain I\u2019m so lonely and abandoned that\u2019s why now I\u2019ve detached myself from the world", "comment_date": "2022-07-09T07:10:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peezy Or PJ", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve lived through more inflations than relationships.  \ud83d\udc99", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T19:04:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lunarlino", "comment_text": "The answer to the title question is that I&#39;m aromantic.", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T01:16:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Any Ram", "comment_text": "Oh why am i single?

From the age of 10 to 24, I was bullied/rejected and had no in real life friends despite many efforts to reach out and connect with others. Then I moved in with a roommate and had many, many social interactions by proxy. I thought they were my friends. I was insecure and naive due to my inexperience. I finally came to the realization that I was being used and moved out of roommate&#39;s place, then all those &quot;friends&quot; immediately cut ties and spread rumors about me. I moved states several times since but have remained alone since. Likely due to my fear of being used again.  I don&#39;t necessarily have a problem with talking to others but I tend to only do so out of necessity like a work setting. I do have trouble expressing myself at times, and I have trouble interacting with groups of people. I am far more comfortable in one on one. I do get lonely but I rationalize that it&#39;s better to be in my current situation where I have control, than to put myself in a situation that I don&#39;t have control over. I guess I have trust issues and a fear of being betrayed if I were to commit to someone. I also have trouble with flirting and interpreting flirting from women. I honestly can&#39;t tell. Moreover, most women my age are or have been in long term relationships. I also have a fear of being abandoned or having my property acquired (split) by the courts in the event a woman wanted to break it off. Another fear I have would be a partner falsely accusing me of wrongdoing in order to mess my life up. It all might sound irrational but I&#39;ve heard many stories from coworkers and family.

Growing up that was one thing that I struggled with. I had very low self-esteem and I believed that I was going to die alone. I used to look at couples when i was in middle school ( I know its stupid) and longed for someone to love me for who i am. Took me until I was 16 to be truly happy with myself. Still, i ended up rushing into things  when I was in high school cause my  sister met her husband in high school and I thought that ill at least date someone in high school. But since in an awkward introvert,  I always ended up being the one that takes liking someone to a whole new level ( running away when they&#39;re in view) and making it obvious. And since I never had things to talk about to get close, nothing happens. Now I&#39;m 18 and I never had a bf. Lesson of the story: Work on yourself first. If you become attracted to someone,  take your time to get to know them and  learn how to talk to them without freaking out. If they feel the same it&#39;ll happen. And you dont need someone to make you happy. That&#39;s why I&#39;m still friends with the guy I like right now. I can talk to him fine and I want to get closer through time.", "comment_date": "2018-09-05T02:15:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "It\u2019s just life", "comment_text": "You gave me the ugly", "comment_date": "2018-09-05T00:45:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RGors", "comment_text": "\u2639\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2018-09-04T04:18:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Savage Cabbage", "comment_text": "Why am I single?<br><br><br>Cause im a sarcastic cunt with a meme account", "comment_date": "2018-09-03T02:55:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hugh Jass", "comment_text": "I&#39;m in my forties and have never attracted a woman.
