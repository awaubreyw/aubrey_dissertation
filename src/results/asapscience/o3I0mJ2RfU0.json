I decided to quit in November of 2021 and ever since I stopped getting out of breath so easily when carrying groceries. Ironically enough afterwards I smoked cigs for a couple of months but I quit that as well. <br><br>Obviously the best thing for your lungs are oxygen, and while I am on the side of smoking being worse than vapor, there are serious side effects from long term vaping. Aside from the improved respiratory system, another thing that motivated my quitting was realizing the baffling amount of nicotine in those pods (Juul, relx, and the like), that I used to use so frequently. Practically 24/7 in fact.<br><br>After researching and even doing more or less correct calculations using a formula I found once on the relx site, I have concluded that each pod contained way more nicotine than a standard full flavored cigarette (like marlboro red for example). Reds are already high in nicotine in the American market, so I&#39;d say those pods are probably 5-10 times that compared to a pack of reds. Also each puff or two from a pod contained probably the same amount of nicotine from one marlboro red cigarette, and each puff or two probably contained multiple light cigarettes. I say &quot;probably&quot; because I don&#39;t know the exact numbers (and I always hated math). Nevertheless I believe I am in the correct ballpark. <br><br>Don&#39;t start smoking and don&#39;t start vaping. The only tobacco I would consume now would be the occasional cigar, because I fully believe there is a difference between smoking tobacco for the nicotine, and smoking tobacco for the flavors. True cigars are always higher quality than any cigarette tobacco. <br><br>If you&#39;re reading this and you want to quit vaping and smoking cigarettes I would highly recommend looking into snus. Real swedish snus, not that camel snus you saw at 7/11. <br><br>Thanks for reading my summed journey through vaping.", "comment_date": "2022-06-28T01:50:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RedRadioDemon", "comment_text": "u will save Money. <br>Spend it for drinks.", "comment_date": "2022-06-28T01:43:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Jackson", "comment_text": "BULL SHIT", "comment_date": "2022-06-28T00:00:33Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "PAISE KAMAO 24", "comment_text": "Stay strong and quit smoking \u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T21:26:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shaun Lunn", "comment_text": "So if smoking is that bad why don\u2019t the government stop selling cigarettes then ?

Long term, which was especially true for a lot of people during the height of the pandemic, was to be stronger mentally and physically. Short I wanted to participate in a 5k marathon. As soon as I started seeing results, it was extra motivation to stay on the path. That was the  difference between the other time I had tried quitting and this time around. My body looked better than it ever had, and I could breathe clearer for the first time in almost 15 years, and the last thing I wanted to do was reverse all the progress I made. Those first few weeks were a challenge. But eventually the thoughts of wanting to smoke a cigarette begin to fade away with every passing day.

People with Delirium can experience permanent brain damage, cognitive decline and even need institutionalization because of how their body has had to stop using Nicotine. <br><br>Sadly, I wanted to quit &quot;cold turkey&quot; after smoking a pack and a half per day.

I sleep/nap for 2 hours but my brain tells me that I&#39;ve been out for 8 hours. Pretty much list off the side effects of Delirium and I have them.

The least effective for me was hypnosis. Others were better\u2026 gum helped me last a week, pills lasted 6 months, etc. Nine years ago I hit rock bottom. My life was in turmoil due to a split household so I figured why not try to better myself in regards to smoking while working to improve other areas ?! It worked ! With my head completely in the game I was able to simply put the cigs down and walk away. Now I can look back and know that my health is better and I wasted so much money and time on it.

I am a 30 year smoker. My heart rate at excited state is  on average 45 bpm which is low and along with that it does and at average at rest is 30 and does dip to high 20s . My blood pressure is ultra low also. I am full of energy and am on my feet as a mechanic for up to 18 hours 7 days a week between my full time job and my own side shop. My blood is normal thickness and clots normal when cut. My memory is above average and skin does not look stained or discolored. I also have no problem running or jogging an extended period of time. My lungs function normal. I am not the only one like this tho my heart rate is unusually low for a so called healthy none smoker. I on average smoke a pack to pack an a half a day and drink any where from 3 to 8 12oz redbulls daily and have no sleep issues. Now I agree if you have never started smoking don&#39;t do it it can cause health issues. However I have had a good debate with a number of doctors at freadaurt hospital which is also a medical college about the affects of long term smokers quitting . I say and believe that for a long term smoker one above 10 years should not stop smoking period. If you look at the history of lung disease and cancer to people that currently smoke vers the ones who quit you will find that the quitters are the ones who have the higher risk of cancer and any other issues. The smokers have a far less chance of getting terminally ill. I bet you think I&#39;m just trolling you but I am not. Look up the facts and you will see that I am correct. Now also on that fact vape is supposed to be a healthy alternative to smoking. This is also a problem as vape promotes pneumonia as a short term issue and long term causes far more harm to the body then cigarettes. Once again a proven fact but no one has the balls to state the real facts.

I have to say that it is the best thing that I have done in entire life, and even now I can&#39;t believe that I managed to do it.

If you can show patience to read this that&#39;s mean you have patience to stop cigarette as well so let me tell you why I think &#39;the decision&#39; is the key. As I heavy smoker previous years I attempt to stop and it took maximum a couple of days Or weeks to start back. But I guess in my mind I was never quitting smoking, I was counting days and I was smoking in my dreams. So I was waiting for a moment that I can start back to smoking. This time when u see that it even effects my daily routine like walking or climbing a few stairs, I felt very bad. I felt like I have a machine that I didn&#39;t care enough and now in age of 29-30 this machine is collapsing. I imagined myself in the worst condition and I said &#39;this is not what I choose for myself&#39; and decided definitely stopping and after that decision I start the work. I start to talk Myself whenever I wanted to smoking and I gave myself reasons why I stop and always talked to myself as if I&#39;m advising someone else. This time even in my dreams when people offer me cigarette I was rejecting, after rejecting even in my dreams when I wake up I said &#39; I did it I am not a smoker anymore&#39; . Today I&#39;m much healthier and little heavier cause some snacks sometimes came to my help first couple of months. However I&#39;m feeling much better by alllll means... See if you really read till here that&#39;s mean you already decided, tell me you wanna leave your prime times (30-70 years old) with coughing pain and erectal dysfunction or really want to &quot;live&quot; Your life...

I started mixing tobacco with marijuana probably 2 or so years ago. Idk why but the combo just simply hits different.

This was the equivalent to approx just over half an ounce of the Mary a fortnight and about a 25g baccy pouch once a month or so, maybe a lil longer. Can easily say that when I decided to quit, or &quot;break&quot; I had literally at most a 2% craving for the first week or so and that was it. Honestly I feel this was due to the habit of smoking, not actually craving the nico etc.<br><br>Now I have a majorly addictive personality type, been over a month and its been SO Goddamn easy to stay away. I understand clearly that everyone has their own individual experiences and perspectives and in turn are affected differently. But COME ON I swear the majority of people who fail at quitting either have no idea how to cease a habit or they are just straight up weak. Will power is not hard, its an active decision to just go, nah or yes pls. 100% conscious choice. So if you want to stop just drop it cold Turkey.

But if you smoke, you know that.  I finally made it off them on my eight try!  I started when I was 29 and finally quit when I was 59, with 2-3 year periods of quitting and going back to them.  What madness..... not a one of all the brands i tried, which was near all of them over the years, really &#39;tasted&#39; good, and all of them left me with every physical problem I could think of...... Get this, from the top down I had headaches, food taste problems, nose problems, throat problems, lung problems, indigestion and stomach problems, problems with my bowels, and of course, hemorrhoids!....... ask anyone who smokes about the problems they&#39;ve experienced.  And, likely you&#39;ll die young like my wife, at 64, and even the Reynolds of the cigarette companies have died at 59 and 60 years of age, look it up........  So I developed the concept of a &#39;Smoke Out&#39;, which goes like this:  On the designated day to quit you buy a couple of packs of your favorite brand and start smoking...... one right after the other, and you keep smoking with as little break as possible between them, until you start to choke up.  Then keep smoking until you really can&#39;t smoke another one, then make one big last effort and smoke your last one, ever.  Believe me, you won&#39;t want another for awhile, for me it was just enough to get me into the next day.

I&#39;ve been a smoker since I was 16, and has been for the last 22 years. For me quitting was like breaking up a toxic relationship with someone. I got married 2 years ago, and I feel like my relationship with cigarette was harming my family physically and emotionally, so once I started looking at cigarette as a person, like an abusive ex or mistress, it got a lot easier. The reason for this approach is, as long as we see cigarette as an object, we&#39;ll always feel like we&#39;re in control, but once you start looking at it as a person that&#39;s manipulating you to burn your money and your years, chances are you&#39;ll stop seeing that person. I started seeing her (cigarette) less and less, and at some point I feel like I was just keeping her because I simply got used to having her around for certain things, it became clear that she was doing more harm than good, I started visualizing certain daily routines without smoking, once I feel I was mentally adjusted I knew it was over, there was no reason for me to keep seeing her. Then one day I just walked away from her and never looked back. Easily one of the best decision I made in my life. I hope this comment will be helpful to some people who&#39;s trying to quit.

At the tail end of 2019, pressure of work was mounting and shit was about the hit the fan. It didnt, but it did turn me towards cigarettes. I was a social smoker for years, smoking at most 10-15 a month, at the height of it. Usually it was less than 10 a year. But when I started smoking regularly, I was averaging 5-6 a day. <br><br>Then the covid lockdowns happened and there was no cigarettes being sold anywhere, at least legally. Some people were selling their stocks at very steep prices @300% costs, in shady alleys. I got some. Soon regulations were relaxed, and cigarettes were selling legally. I bought 4 packs, just in case.<br><br>After a few months, I gave up on denial and accepted that I am now addicted. I am not really that good at quitting bad habits. I looked at my pack, and saw a couple of last cigarettes left. The only way I could quit was to never buy any ever. And thats what I did. Smoked the last remaining ones and never bought another pack. What followed was a shit show.<br><br>WIthin 48 hrs, I suffered the first ever anxiety attack in my 23 years of life, at the dead of the night. It felt like I was dying. A week later, another, and soon they started being frequent. It was hard to get hold of a doctor due to the pandemic so had to wait another few weeks before I could visit one. The doc prescribed every blood test under the sun, along with an ECG. Gave a  bunch of antidepressants and statins. It turns out that was a very bad idea(and the doctor should have known better) as that combo gave me statin induced myopathy. Went to another doctor who was more experienced, an this time it worked out slowly over the last 6 months. <br><br>Though my health has deteriorated over the course of the lockdown and WFH for close to a year, I dont crave cigarettes or get anxiety attacks anymore.", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T16:26:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZERO719", "comment_text": "I got a vape now I can breath.", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T16:24:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DJ Hams", "comment_text": "1 month of quitting smoking after smoking for 6 years.", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T15:59:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bijay hero", "comment_text": "I quit smoking \ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T15:52:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shaun Gray", "comment_text": "Have stopped now, but when the pubs and biergartens open.

The rules of the Ramadan is that you are not allowed to eat or drink when the sun is risen and tabacco / alcohol is not allowed at all. It takes about a month.<br><br>Well the first days were quite hard because of the constant desire for food and water. This was actually a good thing. Because my mind was mainly focussed on these primary things I kinda forgot about the desire of a smoke. And because of the no alcohol rule my selfcontrol wasnt challenged.<br><br>After a couple of days I was really used to my new temporarily lifestyle. The hungry feeling was gone and so with it the desire to smoke. Haven\u2019t had that desire come back since last April. I can proudly say that I quitted smoking. (And also lost some unnecessary bodyfat)<br><br>Now I understand that there arent alot of people who wish to do an entire Ramadan to stop smoking. Therefore the advice I want to give you is that you need to find something that will distract your mind. Find a bigger desire then your smoking desire and you will soon forget the taste of a cigarette and replace it with a proud feeling.<br><br>Ps.

The PET scan lit up which typically indicated cancer, a bronchoscopy was performed at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit confirming that I had lung cancer.\r<br>Within two weeks, I had surgery scheduled with thoracic surgeon, Dr. Michael Marshal. Everything happened so fast and no one dragged their feet. On October 26, I had surgery to remove the upper and middle lobe of my right lung but unfortunately my condition was worse than the doctors originally anticipated and they experienced complications and ever since then my cancer kept getting worse. I thank God for Dr Harvey Propolis Lecithin Capsules, although I doubted it at first but I had no other choice than to give it a try and that was how I got cured after using the herbal products for about a month and some days. This means a lot to me and I pray God blesses Dr Harvey for his good works.

It wasn&#39;t at all easy and I still occasionally fancy a smoke, but it is not the extreme craving that it once was and the feeling passes within seconds. Most of the time I no longer think about smoking at all. I know just how hard it is for smokers to quit and I absolutely never criticize a smoker. It is very hard to quit but so very satisfying if you do beat the habit. Never stop trying, but don&#39;t feel weak if you fail. Just be determined to try again...and good luck!", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T08:02:47Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "Marife Delfin", "comment_text": "I already stop smoking.

It is not like my body demanding it, I just made habits like &quot;before dinner&quot;, &quot;after dinner&quot;, &quot;after watching TV&quot;, &quot;before sleeping&quot; etc. So it was just a task like other daily routine task. <br>I couldn&#39;t left that during pandemic as well. <br>One day, I felt breathing issue &amp; due to pandemic I thought I got Corona so I got scared, so I didn&#39;t smoke for 2-3 days and I was normal again. So I started smoking again. <br>Now, I started feeling some weight on my lungs, in silence I was able to hear bubble sound from my lungs and of course I am no more an athletic person that I used to be because I exausts easily.<br><br>So on July 16th, I quit smoking (cold turkey). First 2 days were pretty normal and I was able to control myself by thinking about the health benefits I will get but on 3-5 days, I got bad urges to smoke at least 1. (This happened for only 2 days)<br>From day 3-5, I drink tea couple of times.<br><br>On coming day or two, I slept for long (14 hours a day), if I am awake I will feel like smoking but if I am sleeping my body won&#39;t demand.<br><br>Now its September end. i don&#39;t even get any feeling about smoking. <br>I am not sure about focus and health improvement but I can observe that I am much energetic than before. <br><br>So, if I can stop smoking after 20 years than you can also do it. <br><br>Do it because there is no fun in dieing via lung cancer.", "comment_date": "2020-09-22T13:06:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dennis Njuguna", "comment_text": "Depression...

Because I have a problem with food and nicotine helps me control my craving from food. See I have a problem when I eat food makes me sick and does something to my body that I can&#39;t control. See when I eat I can&#39;t go anywhere in public. So when I go to work or have to go to the store I make sure I don&#39;t eat anything. Because I don&#39;t know how food will react to my body. But nicotine controls that earge and I can go three or four days without eating but I do try to eat once a day. And it is usually a bowl of soup a slice of bread and butter.  I also found out that cigarettes are cheaper than buying food. Because I have bills and I can&#39;t afford to buy food and pay bills. But it is cheaper to buy cigarettes and pay bills. Because everything in the grocery store is expensive. You can&#39;t buy nothing meat wise with out spending over seven dollars or more. That is why I go to the Dollar Store and buy can goods because everything is a dollar and I don&#39;t know how they do it but thank God there are still stores that you can go to and spend Twenty dollars and get Twenty dollars worth of food. See I refuse to buy ground beef, steaks or seafood because of the price. And another thing I don&#39;t cook anyway all my food goes into a microwave.

There are principles, however, that definitely apply to smoking. First, the Bible commands us not to allow our bodies to become &quot;mastered&quot; by anything. &quot;Everything is permissible for me\u2014but not everything is beneficial. Everything is permissible for me\u2014but I will not be mastered by anything&quot; (1 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3I0mJ2RfU0&amp;t=6m12s\">6:12</a>). Smoking is undeniably strongly addictive. Later in the same passage we are told, &quot;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body&quot; (1 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3I0mJ2RfU0&amp;t=6m19s\">6:19</a>-20). Smoking is undoubtedly very bad for your health. Smoking has been proven to damage the lungs and the heart.<br><br>Can smoking be considered &quot;beneficial&quot; (1 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3I0mJ2RfU0&amp;t=6m12s\">6:12</a>)? Can it be said that smoking is truly honoring God with your body (1 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3I0mJ2RfU0&amp;t=6m20s\">6:20</a>)? Can a person honestly smoke &quot;for the glory of God&quot; (1 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3I0mJ2RfU0&amp;t=10m31s\">10:31</a>)? We believe that the answer to these three questions is a resounding &quot;no.&quot; As a result, we believe that smoking is a sin and therefore should not be practiced by followers of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Some argue against this view by pointing to the fact that many people eat unhealthy foods, which can be just as addicting and just as bad for the body. As an example, many people are so helplessly addicted to caffeine that they cannot function without their first cup of coffee in the morning. While this is true, how does that make smoking right? It is our contention that Christians should avoid gluttony and excessively unhealthy eating. Yes, Christians are often hypocritical by condemning one sin and condoning another, but, again, this does not make smoking honoring to God.<br><br>Another argument against this view of smoking is that many godly men have been smokers, such as the famous British preacher C.H. Spurgeon, who was known to smoke cigars. Again, we do not believe this argument holds any weight. We believe Spurgeon was wrong for smoking. Was he otherwise a godly man and fantastic teacher of God\u2019s Word? Absolutely! Does that make all of his actions and habits honoring to God? No.<br><br>In stating that smoking is a sin, we are not stating that all smokers are unsaved. There are many true believers in Jesus Christ who smoke. Smoking does not prevent a person from being saved. Nor does it cause a person to lose salvation. Smoking is no less forgivable than any other sin, whether for a person becoming a Christian or a Christian confessing his/her sin to God (1 John 1:9). At the same time, we firmly believe that smoking is a sin that should be forsaken and, with God\u2019s help, overcome.", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T10:26:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Near Future", "comment_text": "Stated smoking when i was 16 i am now turning 21.

I remember how strong each cigarette was when I started, just one would satisfy my daily dose of nicotine, and yet I wasn&#39;t even addicted. I started smoking out of curiosity. The first cigarette had a bad effect on me. I started being dizzy and felt like I would collapse, but I still continued just to feel tough in the group of people I used to hang out with. It&#39;s funny when you walk down the street and see a kid with a cigarette, surrounded by some friends, thinking he&#39;s cool. I was just like that! Later on it turns on you, both the cigarette and people you hang out with. I never smoked to feel any influence of the cigar, there wasn&#39;t any! People who tell that, tell lies. I have a strong mind and I used to leave smoking for like 5-6 months, but I would eventually return back to it. One of the key factors was the group I was in. When all people around you smoke and defend the idea of smoking, you cannot even argue with them. You cannot tell them that you want to stop, because even if you do, they would continue and you would end up as a passive smoker if you plan on hanging out with them. They would not stop smoking because of you! I have been there. It took me a while to finally admit that I was addicted. It was always like &quot;I had a bad day at work&quot; or something like that. It wasn&#39;t even about friends, it was about my personal time with a cigarette! Over the time I smoked more and more until it started to interfere with my health and it became obvious to me how bad that is. Coughing every day, feeling unwilling to do anything, even grumpy a bit - those were the starting symptoms. Then I started having headaches, and coughing becomes a reflex, you don&#39;t even control it anymore. So one day I was drinking water and I started coughing in the middle of it so I almost choked. It happened at least 5 times until one day I woke up and told myself: that&#39;s it. The worst part is when you need to break some relationships in order to save you from the smoke, but it&#39;s worth it. People who support your smoking habits are not your friends, because they support you killing yourself and a friend doesn&#39;t do that. I stopped and will never return. Only after 2 weeks you will start feeling much better and energized. Do it! Stop smoking and drop the f bomb on all the people who say you shouldn&#39;t!

I was a smoker of 18 years.  So my first day in the class, the first thing the instructor says is, your quit date, will be February 24th 2015.  First thing I said to myself, there is no way in hell, it&#39;s only going to be 6 weeks, I&#39;m not quitting.  I think it started on 1/12/2015 or 1/19/2015.<br><br>So I had already planned a trip out of state, already had bought the plane ticket.  So I missed the second class, and as I was coming back home, I seriously debated, just not going to the class and continuing to smoke.  By this point, I had just been laid off from work, got my severance pay, or was collecting it, and I figured, well I&#39;m not bringing in any money, let&#39;s see what this class is about, so I did go, and continued going until the end.<br><br>We were given a book, just showed like, how much money you would spend on cigarettes over X years, and different things you could do to help change your mindset etc. etc.  What was really nice however, was that, about 2 weeks out from the class ending, we were given a free months supply of quit smoking aids, lozenges, patch, gum or the medication you can take for it (forgot the name).<br><br>So, I ended up getting the 2mg lozenge, and I used them for about 2 to 3 weeks.  After a while, the cravings just were no longer there.  It is possible to quit, and I think for me personally, this was the best way, because I had no idea about how to quit.  For me, the cravings were very strong.  I even took a piece of paper, rolled it around an ink pen, taped it together, because in my brain, I was so used to getting up, going outside and having that movement of bringing the cigarette up to your mouth, so I did it with the rolled up piece of paper, with the lozenge in between my cheek and gum, and that really helped me along the way.<br><br>To this day, I have been smoke free since 2/24/2015 and we all got a certificate of completion, dated 3/16/2015.  It was right when I started the class, I had been laid off from work.<br><br>Do I feel better?  Hell yes.  And at my new job, I can tell who the smokers are.  When you smoke, you do carry a disgusting odor around with you.<br><br>Oh and lastly, I quit because after 8 months of constant coughing up phlegm, I was getting worried.

However, I have a chronic sporadic cigarette habit, the only time I&#39;ve ever had luck to quit, is either supplement tobacco with weed or cold turkey tobacco. Weed is too expensive and I don&#39;t smoke it anymore, just tobacco. The only logical way to quit smoking, is to chew copious amounts of none nicotine chewing gum, and exercise. Get an urge to smoke? Do a 100 push ups and get an endorphin high, and slam about 16 oz of water. The faster you get the nicotine out of your system, the faster route to recovery. Meditation helps too, if you can get to it. Continuously tell yourself that the shit is bad and every cig is going to take 10 minutes off your life.

That&#39;s when he decided that he could not live like this for the rest of his life. He decided to cut his hair, go back to school to boost his grades, and most of all, he quit smoking cold turkey (with no vapes, nicotine sprays, or anything like that.) It was not easy, but he said it was worth it. He now works in Fort McMurray Alberta at the oil sands testing levels of pollution in water and air to help regulate the air and water quality for the wildlife and the locals, but in his spare time, he goes camping, he hunts, plays lacrosse and he frequently runs marathons in sub-zero degree Albertan weather.\u00a0 (Fahrenheit) Quitting smoking cold-turkey is not easy, but it is not impossible, and when you have been without smokes for about a year, you will be able to notice the amazing difference it makes.

All of this is BS people.I&#39;m 56 and I smoked for more than forty years. Before quitting, 7 years ago, I was smoking 2 packs a day and more. I quit cold turkey and IT WAS VERY EASY TO DO since I was really fed up with tobacco smoking and I was fed up of being seen as a CRIMINAL, because I smoked. I have to mention also that financially, I couldn&#39;t afford it anymore. Never took even a single puff since and I&#39;m pretty sure I won&#39;t for the rest of my life ! Seven years later, my lungs are still wheezing even though I walk 1 hour a day and i even do some jogging in the summertime (around 8 kilometers 3 times a week). It&#39;s the same for my blood pressure. It was hi when I smoked and it is still hi to the point that I need medications to lower it. Exercising and healthy eating ain&#39;t enough ! So....the only true thing is I feel better because I decided to do so and not come back to smoking. Now, I&#39;m the one looking at the smokers as criminals.....lol...not at all. I respect smokers and I even let them smoke in my home, it doesn&#39;t bother me at all. If, in certain cases, the secondary smoke is too much to handle (makes me wheeze), I&#39;l open a window to let the smoke out and that&#39;s it. I have no kids at home and I&#39;m single so.... Never will I make smokers feel UNDESIRABLE as a was made to feel by society. By this I&#39;m not saying it is not ok to quit, but if you believe in the crap shown in this video and you&#39;ve been smoking for a while. You&#39;re in for a very deceptive surprise ! Sorry to spoil the fun...and between you and me, weed is much worth smoking than tobacco.

The worst for me was month 1-3 where I was depressed, suffering from inexplicable stress, mood swings and irritability. It is this stage that needs that extra resolve to avoid relapse. And you really have to be determined that this habit no longer suits you or represents you. It was my 5th attempt that was the successful one, everyone is different and responds in a different way, but it really helps to learn about the science of addiction and what to expect. That way when the severe withdrawal kicks in you know what is going on in your brain and you manage it better.

"Akshay Jadhav", "comment_text": "guys as a science degree student i agree with this but i would suggest you not to quit smoking directly if you are smoking like 5 cigs a day continue for 1 week and then second week -1 so 2nd week you will smoke 4 cigs and still if you feel like having 5th cigrate instead keep chewing gum for 15 mins and keep doing some sports activities that will make your lungs force for oxygen and don`t forget to drink atleast 1/3 of water a day to retain oxygen and keep depleting your 1 cig a week so after 5th week you will drink warm lime water  empty stomach (make it your lifestyle though)  you can add 1tsp of apple cider vinegar too in your daily life have atleast 1 citric fruit a day so now this will start breaking a chain and make lungs clear it will take atleast a year to fully clear with this process you may feel low on breath during this process but trust me you can make healthy lifestyle eating healty and having 1 cheat meal a week for an average person even i used to smoke long time ago but i retained most of it having a good and healthy lifestyle have some good quality multivitamins everyday chew 3 to 5 peppermint leaves each day you can also add some lemon for more flavor and benefit you can also add paper mint leaves in your tea with ginger the inflammation will start decreasing of your lungs paralyzed cilia will start working soon

As in the flesh and blood, we like to drink, smoke, curse, slander and pocess material things, all of that is good to the flesh, however it completely destructs our soul, at the end of your life you either go to hell or heaven, imagine not feeling rest or relief EVER, eternal GUILT and NEVER ENDING PHYSICAL PAIN, and not being able to feel BETTER EVER, thats HELL. When you go to heaven you are given a NEW body and blood will no longer exist, we will never feel pain, sorrow, sadness, anger will eat and not get fat, bond with our loving Savior who MADE US and gave us LIFE, we will bond with animals and they ALL will be completely tamed. The devil, which you cannot see because he is spiritual, puts thoughts on your mind to believe a LIE wants you to believe a completely different story other than what im telling you, because satan will be going to hell and he wants to take you with him, he wants you to believe anything but SALVATION. He is completely envious and jelous of us because we are made in Gods image and Jesus loves us so much He willingly came to die for us, so we don&#39;t have to go to hell, HELL was made for the Devil ONLY, but there is so many of his followers that will follow him to hell, God does not send ANYBODY there, people send themeselves there, for rejecting JESUS. All glory and honor to the power of Jesus Christ alone. BE READY, the RAPTURE is coming and all whom don&#39;t get saved will be left on earth to suffer SO MUCH, you will know you got left behind and the only way to go to heaven if you are left on earth will be to be KILLED AS A MARTYR for JESUS CHRIST. SO PLEASE KNOW once you have trusted in the Gospel of Jesus Christ to saves our souls, we are instantly made SAVED under GRACE, not works, because if you think you can get to heaven on your own terms and &quot;works&quot; you are deceiving yourself and Jesus death and blood would have been in vain, JESUS CHRIST came in flesh to make a NEW LAW, the OT Moses law is invalid, we are JUSTIFIED by trusting and believing in Jesus death, blood and resurrection only. Once we trust in the Gospel, we are saved and our past, present and future sins are FORGIVEN. So does that mean we can continue to sin? NO! we are to be obedient to the spirit that dwells in us and we have to walk in the SPIRIT and not the FLESH.

Its true that almost everyone is saying that you only live once but for me, I agree with you that since we only live once, we want ourselves to be at our healthiest state as we age. We only live once and people who smoke should consider that quitting will not only save themselves but also the people who would want to still see you doing what you love in your 80&#39;s and not in a wheelchair wearing an oxygen mask with an inhaler in one hand or not be able to speak. Think of your grandchildren people. It is selfish to say that you smoke because you&#39;ll die anyway. What we know for sure is that we only regret things we&#39;ve done when it&#39;s too late. It&#39;s just sad because I lost my grandpa 2 years ago due to a lung cancer. He was completely aware that&#39;ll kill him but he continued it and only tried to stopped when it was too late for him or when he was unable to move his arm to reach a cigar due to extreme pain and weakness. I wished he would&#39;ve seen me and my brother graduate at the same time. He would&#39;ve been the happiest grandpa.  But he was late. And I miss him. Along with the hate I feel for him because he never tried quitting at least, I miss him. Smokers should realize that if they don&#39;t care for themselves anymore, think of the people who cares for you. You just need to be honest to yourself  that you&#39;re being addicted to it, lessen the use until you quit it, stay committed and live a better life with your family. We only live once.

I only have anywhere from 3-8 cigs a day now (it depends on if i&#39;m home alone, how cold it is outside, if i&#39;m in my car, etc) but for a while I smoked up to 2 packs a day if I was partying. I still crave more often when i&#39;m drunk but I&#39;ve cooled it down. I&#39;ve found living in Canada really helps because I just really don&#39;t wanna go outside lmao IT&#39;S COLD!!! I&#39;m hoping to quit soon, but I don&#39;t think I can go cold turkey. My biggest hurdle is just trying to figure out what else to do. It&#39;s really hard to explain but it&#39;s been my socializing crutch for so long and as crazy as this sounds I&#39;ve made a lot of friends chillin at the smoker&#39;s area in bars and stuff. If i&#39;m at a party and everyone goes outside for a cigarette I just don&#39;t know what to do if I don&#39;t. It probably really helps to not have friends who smoke (obviously) But all of mine do, and i&#39;m not just gonna chuck them to the side for it lol.

Not only is stopping this debilitating habit good for your health, it is better for your overall happiness and peace of mind. <br><br>For those of you who are not yet convinced to stop smoking (which is hard to do facing the facts presented in this video) I hope to offer you an alternative way to think about the subject. Smoking is a choice, and like all choices, it can be made autonomously or non-autonomously (Autonomy = the ability to self-govern). The criteria for an autonomous choice include intentionally making the decision at hand, understanding of the decisions risks and benefits, and lack of control on the decision by external or internal forces other than your own. So is smoking an autonomous choice? It depends on the individual. If it is a minor who is choosing to smoke, with limited understanding of the long term repercussions discussed in this video, then it is not an autonomous choice, and should not be respected. However, an adult with clear understanding and intention to smoke may also not be making an autonomous choice due to controlling  forces beyond their cognition. <br><br>But how is this possible? No one is forcing a cigarette into their hand or mouth, and they are not surrounded by second-hand smoke constantly.  The controlling force in this situation is the addiction to the nicotine that is internally turning them to yet another cigarette. So how can we combat this urge to smoke with our own cognition?<br><br>The Split-Level Theory of Autonomy states that we can make decisions based on our preferences, that are of higher or lower level. For smokers, the lower level decision, also called the first-order desire, is to smoke cigarettes. On the other hand, the higher level decision, also called the second-order desire, is to live a healthier life and reap the benefits explained in this video. As we make more second-desire decisions, we live a more productive and positive life. Some argue, however, that as we make more first-desire decisions, we are reverting to the life of animals. <br><br>The bottom line is this: If you are a smoker and are choosing to do so on your own will, think about the risks of your choice and the potential long-lasting benefits of making your second, higher level choice. You will reap more than the physical benefits displayed in this video. <br><br>Thank you.", "comment_date": "2017-02-06T23:52:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke Todd", "comment_text": "It&#39;s kind of sad but I notice the cigarettes in the ashtray in this video are Belmonts...AsapSCIENCE I didn&#39;t realize you are Canadian :)", "comment_date": "2017-02-06T23:40:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Francisco", "comment_text": "i stopped like 3months ago and i tell you something: you still poor if you were poor.", "comment_date": "2017-02-06T23:39:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andy Chaplin Music", "comment_text": "I asked someone why dont they stop smoking and they said &#39;ITS FUN!&#39;, with that kind of attitude some people just dont want to quit.", "comment_date": "2017-02-06T23:28:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Snufkin224", "comment_text": "Smoking doesn&#39;t seem so bad.
