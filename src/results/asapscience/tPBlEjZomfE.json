We have to give all the info through to our clients before we sell anything. We also have different ways to classify cosmitics, you have cosmectics, derma-ceuticals, end medical. Depending on your qualification and training in certain cosmetic houses, are you allowed to work with a certain class. For example only a fully internationally qualified somatologist may work with derma- ceuticals and the treatments that go with it, you may also work with medical but with a doctors supervision or as an assistant. South Africa has a few product houses that try to invest in medical studies to promote better quality products that you can only get from clinics. Some of these houses are in my opinion leading the way forward in the industry especially when it comes to dark skin. It would be good for you guys to have a look at some of these houses and ask them about their research.", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T11:58:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ALWolf", "comment_text": "Youtube suggested this video after I watched the original, but it was quite down on the list.

She&#39;s disturbingly unscientific and leans heavily on the fact that she&#39;s got a P.h.D. (in an unrelated field) which many people (who don&#39;t have the time or interest to research) interpret as &quot;she&#39;s automatically right and all others are wrong.&quot;<br><br><br>In one of her videos, she makes a case against wearing sunscreen daily. In a long back and forth, I dismantled each of her arguments (while being highly deferential) and citing the research.\u00a0<br><br>The end result? She blocked me from her channel.<br><br><br>That&#39;s deeply problematic for someone who pretends to be a scientist since it shows a huge lack of scientific integrity. I can understand blocking trolls. But blocking people that respectively disagree with you... that is exactly how science works.<br><br>She also shows this scientific moral defect in situations where she makes highly clickbaity content on matters where X is good 99.9999% of the time.\u00a0<br><br>Her video will give viewers the impression that &quot;it depends&quot;. While that&#39;s not an outright lie, it is highly deceitful. Again something that demonstrates a worrying lack of scientific integrity. Every domain of science (mathematics excluded) functions more like a Bayesian process where you judge something based on trade-offs, not absolutes. E.g. We advise people not to smoke, even though there may exist a person that somehow benefits from it because of some genetic mutation.<br><br><br>For those who might wonder about the aforementioned sunscreen issue, see research such as McKenzie &amp; Lucas (2018) which states:<br><br><br>&quot;If a sunscreen of SPF 30 was correctly applied on days with UVI\u2009&gt;\u20093, but not applied on days with UVI\u2009&lt;\u20093, over the course of a year, the cumulative dose to the skin on the low UVI days would exceed that from the high UVI days by a factor of 3.Thus, the messaging unnecessarily increases risks to health, such as the development of skin cancer. Advice that \u2018no protection is required\u2019 for UVI\u2009&lt;\u20093 should be removed from public messaging. Furthermore, because skin damage depends on both the UVI and the time of exposure, that is the dose rather than the dose rate, behavioral messages should be further tailored to reflect the time needed, rather than having a simple binary message such as \u2018protection required\u2019 (for UVI\u2009\u2265\u20093) or \u2018no protection required\u2019 (for UVI\u2009&lt;\u20093).&quot;<br><br><br>Her comment sections may seem overwhelmingly positive (which is another worrisome point since many people use those to see if the OP is BSing/overlooking something), but that&#39;s not because there are no people who disagree, but rather because she blocks anyone who&#39;s anything less than a sycophant.", "comment_date": "2021-07-26T20:04:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Barely Noticeable", "comment_text": "Yes!
