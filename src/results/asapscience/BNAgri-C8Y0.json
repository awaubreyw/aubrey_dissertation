It&#39;s based off of death reports of rural \r<br>Inuit hospitals and admission figures (by Hans Olaf Bang and Jorn Dyerberg), these researchers didn&#39;t actually study a single Inuit person. Westernization (SAD diet) of the Inuit \r<br>populations decreased their CAD mortality. Current clinical evidence such as X-rays, ultrasounds and autopsies disprove that &quot;Inuits are free of CAD&quot; claim.\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25064579\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25064579</a> - Researchers that have studied the Inuit prior to Bang and Dyerberg were ignored, even though all of them have proved that the Inuit\r have frequent occurrence of CAD events. Despite that, government organizations even to this day are recommending people, specifically people with heart disease to eat several servings of fish per week, and it&#39;s all based on these 2 researchers that didn&#39;t even study the Inuit people. 20% of those death certificate reports were completed without a doctor having examined the body. The doctors also had limited diagnostic facilities and most of the population were very far away from hospitals. This study reviewed all the previous studies done on the Inuits and once again found that westernized countries are healthier. Similar CAD rates compared to western countries, double the mortality rate in strokes compared to western countries and their life expectancy&#39;s 10 years shorter compared to western countries.\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1561651/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1561651/</a> - A study done way before the Bang and Dyerberg &quot;research&quot;, over 30 years prior, found the Inuits to be in extremely poor health.\rThe majority were pale around the ports with reasons to suspect anemia. While Inuits in the northern parts were plethoric, meaning their skin was swelling with blood. These Inuits in the north had epistaxis, which is bleeding from the nose which is subsequently found to be due to polycythemia, suggestive of cyanosis which is caused by low oxygen levels in the red blood cells or problems getting oxygenated blood to your body. Hypertension and several other issues, specifically to do with blood were found in the northern parts. Tuberculosis was also common (disease caused by bacteria that attack the lungs, causing coughs, sneezings and so on) in the northern parts. Several cases of bronchitis and other illnesses too. Atherosclerosis and high blood pressure were common. Artery calcification was common. Seen through x-ray scans. Several cases of epilepsy, insanity, rheumatoid arthritis, hydrocephalus (fluid within a childs brain, causing pressure in the skull), exophthalmos (terrible eye disease, check some pictures). Worms were commonly found in the animals they eat, putting them at higher risk of infection. Many eye and teeth issues and poor resistance to infection were found among the more primitive Eskimos. Inuits are not healthy and disease free as claimed.\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC325106/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC325106/</a> - Autopsy performed on found frozen mummified Inuits.

I switched to a purely protein diet that day and started lifting weights. That first month was the toughest month of my life. I pushed myself and went from barely being able to do 1 push up to reaching 15 push ups, i gained a bunch of muscle (my arms were huge) and I also lost 40 lbs, muscles started to show through the fat and my whole physique started changing. I got horrible constipaded at first and then after 3 weeks or so would have bouts of diarrhea but it wasn\u2019t horrible and the pros were far better than the cons. Initially I had a very difficult time thinking on the diet like my brain was constantly in a fog but after a few days I got this kind of extra control over the amount of effort I could put into things like thinking clearly (also carried over to lifting weights) so they balanced themselves out in the end. After the month and a half I broke it because I js had enough at the time so I went out for a slice of pizza and to my surprise I didn\u2019t get any kind of joy from eating it like I used to. I tried to drink some root beer as that had been my go-to drink before hand but I couldn\u2019t do it because it was too sweet. In total I lost 60 lbs all of which and more have stayed off since I stopped the diet after 45 days. I am now 225 lbs and much healthier than I had ever been.

Unfortunately your conclusions are in conflict with reality.  There are a lot of people (not just Inuits) currently eating a carnivorous (no plant) diet.  Yes, you get enough vitamin C (see link).  Yes, gluconeogenesis makes all the glucose you need.  And no, you dont get nitrogen poisoning from the protein.  And if it does anything to cholesterol (in most people there isn&#39;t much effect), it improves your profile, usually by raising HDL and lowering trigs.

My bet is on beans, and nuts/seeds.  You can supplement these two food groups with quinoa, buckwheat, brown rice and amaranth, etc., as gluten is not really that great for you...  This stuff can give you fuel for the day, without having to go for the steak or chicken route, etc., for some meals...  (Yes, there are all kinds of food allergies with these foods for some...)<br><br>-We might think we can skip animal foods altogether (and my bet here is on skipping dairy, or just consuming a little bit of grass-fed butter and/or milk to help the teeth, etc.), but then we are going to have a little bit tougher time feeling full, without all that animal fat and protein...  Without that tryptophan...  We&#39;re going to have a rougher go of it, unless we truly want to be slim and trim, bordering on kinda physically weak and unfocused at times...

Two years before, he had suffered a mild cerebral thrombosis, from which he had practically recovered. But he had not yet succeeded in losing the ten pounds of overweight his doctor wanted him to be rid of. By will power and near starvation, he had now and then lost a few of them; but the pounds always came back when his will power broke down. Doubtless partly through these failures, Stef had grown a bit unhappy, at times grouchy.<br><br>My first reaction to his Stone Age diet proposal was dismay. I have three jobs. I lecture, in and out of town, and enjoy the innumerable extracurricular activities of our New England college town of Hanover, New Hampshire. Forenoons I write books about the arctic, \u201cfor teen-agers and uninformed adults,\u201d to be able to afford the luxury of being librarian afternoons of the large polar library my husband and I acquired when we were free-lance writers and government contractors, which library now belongs to Dartmouth College. I take part in a course called the Arctic Seminar, and last winter was director. I sing in madrigal groups and act in experimental theater plays. Only by a miserly budgeting of time do I manage these things. \u201cIn addition,\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cI am now supposed to prepare two menus!\u201d<br><br>But aloud I said: \u201cOf course, dear.\u201d And we began to plan.<br><br>To my astonished delight, contrary to all my previous thinking, the Stone Age diet not only proved effective in getting rid of Stef\u2019s overweight, but was also cheaper, simpler, and easier to prepare than our regular mixed diet had been. Far from requiring more time, it took less. Instead of adding housekeeping burdens, it relieved them. Almost imperceptibly Stef\u2019s diet became my diet. Time was saved in not shopping for, not preparing, not cooking, and not washing up after unrequired dishes, among them vegetables, salads, and desserts.<br><br>Some of our friends say: \u201cWe would go on a meat diet too, but we couldn\u2019t possibly afford it.\u201d That started me investigating the actual cost of the diet. Unlike salads and desserts, which often do not keep, meat is as good several days later as the day it was cooked. There is no waste. I found our food bills were lower than they had been. But I attribute this to our fondness for mutton. Fortunately for us it is an unfashionable meat, which means it is cheap. We both like it, and thanks to our deep freeze, we buy fat old sheep at anything from twenty-two to thirty-three cents a pound and proceed to live on the fat of the land. We also buy beef, usually beef marrow. European cooks appreciate marrow, but most people in our country have never even tasted it, poor things.<br><br>When you eat as a primitive Eskimo does, you live on lean and fat meats. A typical Stefansson dinner is a rare or medium sirloin steak and coffee. The coffee is freshly ground. If there is enough fat on the steak we take our coffee black, otherwise heavy cream is added. Sometimes we have a bottle of wine. We have no bread, no starchy vegetables, no desserts. Rather often we eat half a grapefruit. We eat eggs for breakfast, two for Stef, one for me, with lots of butter.<br><br>Startling improvements in health came to Stef after several weeks on the new diet. He began to lose his overweight almost at once, and lost steadily, eating as much as he pleased and feeling satisfied the while. He lost seventeen pounds, then his weight remained stationary, although the amount he ate was the same. From being slightly irritable and depressed, he became once more his old ebullient, optimistic self. By eating mutton he became a lamb.<br><br>An unlooked-for and remarkable change was the disappearance of his arthritis, which had troubled him for years and which he thought of as a natural result of aging. One of his knees was so stiff he walked up and down stairs a step at a time, and he always sat on the aisle in a theater so he could extend his stiff leg comfortably.<br><br>Several times a night he would be awakened by pain in his hips and shoulder when he lay too long on one side; then he had to turn over and lie on the other side. Without noticing the change at first, Stef was one day startled to find himself walking up and down stairs, using both legs equally. He stopped in the middle of our stairs; then walked down again and up again. He could not remember which knee had been stiff!<br><br>Conclusion: The Stone Age all-meat diet is wholesome. It is an eat-all-you-want reducing diet that permits you to forget you are dieting\u2013no hunger pangs remind you. It saves time and money. Best of all, it improves the temperament. It somehow makes one feel optimistic, mildly euphoric.<br><br>Epilogue: Stef used to love his role of being a thorn in the flesh of nutritionists. But in 1957 an article appeared in the august journal of the American Medical Association confirming what Stef had known for years from his anthropology and his own experience. The author of this book has also popularized Stef\u2019s diet in England, with the blessing of staid British medical folk.<br><br>Was it with the faintest trace of disappointment in his voice that Stef turned to me, after a strenuous nutrition discussion, and said: \u201cI have always been right. But now I am becoming orthodox! I shall have to find myself a new heresy.\u201d<br><br>Evelyn Stefansson<br><br>April 22, 1959.", "comment_date": "2018-01-06T21:07:11Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Sanctioned Taco", "comment_text": "Explain the success of the carnivore diet?", "comment_date": "2018-01-06T21:05:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PandemicLui", "comment_text": "the average person in the US eats 55lbs of meat a year, but in texas we eat almost twice as much or even more, do we have a higher health risk?", "comment_date": "2018-01-06T21:00:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ethan Du", "comment_text": "i would die... but i would die happy", "comment_date": "2018-01-06T19:00:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan Waters", "comment_text": "High fat is definitely the way to go.", "comment_date": "2018-01-06T16:35:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "althea blanco", "comment_text": "i dont ander stand\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude13\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e\u270a\u270b\u270c\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc50", "comment_date": "2018-01-06T15:35:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nofan Felani", "comment_text": "1K vegans dislike this video", "comment_date": "2018-01-06T13:58:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "leethan campbell", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNAgri-C8Y0&amp;t=1m08s\">1:08</a> humans are one of the few animals  ?? wtf", "comment_date": "2018-01-06T12:57:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cecille ferrer", "comment_text": "Alternate title: how to piss of vegans.", "comment_date": "2018-01-06T12:52:40Z", "likes_count": 166}, {"comment_by": "Kosmo Kramer", "comment_text": "I know a few girls that only eat tube steak.", "comment_date": "2018-01-06T11:36:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Berk Arslan", "comment_text": "Nah, I&#39;ll be ok..", "comment_date": "2018-01-06T09:11:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian McCrimmon", "comment_text": "Slow down r ancestors didn\u2019t just randomly start eating meat.

I medicate the user so that he can then fall asleep and I medicate him regularly every 4-6 hours. Once the user is in the trance, it will almost be as if you are being reborn, the memory on the hard drive for all patience is very distorted and the memory is very fuzzy and choppy until around 2 years of age in the simulator, so around 20 minutes in of watching the memory footage, that goes for all the patients. It is like starting life over again completely new. To the user this simulator feels like an entire life time of 65-80 years but it only last 22-26 hours in real time. Every 10 years goes by every 2 hour and 8 minutes, you would think that 10 years of simulated footage would go by so fast on the computer that I can&#39;t even see what&#39;s going on but I can actually slow the footage down while they are in the trance and after they are out of their trance and off the simulator bed. When they are being put in the trance It uses the knowledge that they already know about the real world and creates them a new life in the simulated world, the simulated world they live in looks identical as the real world. I have tested 9 different patients and sadly every one of them came back with memory loss not remembering simple things like &quot;what day is it? Or &quot;what is your name?&quot; Or &quot;what are you doing here?&quot; This creates the user to go psychotic and have mental breakouts. Test subject 7 managed to break his own left arm trying to get out of the simulator bed. Once they are out of the simulator I can then go back to the computer plug in the chip and I can then watch their simulated life in a first person view on the computer or any tv or phone. In the simulator they feel and smell everything just like in real life. They feel physical pain and emotional pain while living the simulated world. Also while they are living in the simulated world, they don&#39;t know that they are simulated they think they are just living the everyday real life. I think that&#39;s why it always causes them to have memory loss and psychotic behavior after taken off the bed. The simulator is still a prototype and will not be released to the public because of the negative effects such as memory loss and creating psychopathic behavior.

I&#39;m very disappointed in ASAP Science. I used to think they were unbiased. I decided to check their sources\u2026<br><br>In the source article, the &#39;berry and flower&#39; diet was referring to a rat-like creature, a very early &#39;proto-primate&#39;, called Purgatorius. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatorius\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatorius</a><br><br>This article (ASAP&#39;s <b>only</b> source for the theory) goes on to say for the next &quot;tens of millions of years&quot;, this tree-rats&#39; descendants, &quot;from small monkeys to gorilla-size apes\u2026 survived mostly on tropical fruits, spicing their meals with occasional worms (often by accident). Around 15 million years ago, they diversified a bit, adding hard seeds and nuts to their diets, but stayed true to their vegan roots.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s a direct quote \u2013 highly unscientific language and glossing over massive timespans (even by evolutionary standards). It bunches together animals with diets and body structures very different from ours. Even 2.5 million years ago (when we know our ancestors ate meat), we still looked like apes, not the ginger-haired millennial holding up the ancient tree-rat&#39;s diet in this video.<br>Here&#39;s the early-human timeline, FYI: <br><a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-evolution-timeline-interactive\">http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-evolution-timeline-interactive</a><br><br>Also, 2.5 million years ago is when we are SURE we started eating meat \u2013 only because that&#39;s the earliest evidence of stone tools, and we cannot reliably link fossilised carcasses to hominids unless we see signs of butchering with tools! <br><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/evidence-for-meat-eating-by-early-humans-103874273\">https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/evidence-for-meat-eating-by-early-humans-103874273</a><br>So\u2026 We could easily have been eating meat before then.

This &#39;source&#39; they used seemed to have a vegan agenda. It referred to the tree-rat as a vegan, and that up to 2.5 million years ago we &quot;stayed true to our vegan roots&quot; (wtf??). They lifted that first scene <b>straight</b> from the article as if they simply read it, liked it, did no cross-referencing or read any other sources about early hominid diets, and decided to use it to set the context of a video about how dangerous meat can be. <br><br>I thought ASAP Science were more\u2026 well\u2026 scientific than this. And it matters. Some people are at risk of permanently damaging their dopaminergic systems (which are responsible for positive emotion!) by going completely meat-free for long enough. It has to do with the severe tryptophan deficiency of veganism. So by implying so strongly that meat is unnatural (because some ancient tree-rats didn&#39;t eat it) and dangerous, this video could send some folks down a bad path.<br><br>Don&#39;t be afraid of meat, people.

This is established by the World Health Organization FYI. Elevated cholesterol and a diet high in sat fat/trans fats cause heart disease and raise overall mortality. Animal proteins raise levels of IGF-1 which enables faster cancer growth as we only need low levels after childhood. I don&#39;t understand why people don&#39;t look past the paleolithic era, what were we doing waaaay before cooking/eating meat for an even longer time ? foraging for nuts and seeds and eating primarily fruit/veg in the jungle that is what our body adapted to. A long digestion system to extract nutrients from fiber rich food and naturally low pH (which has to be balanced when eating acidic foods like meat and dairy/resulting in a net calcium loss). We CAN eat only meat but the ill effects of getting nutrients second hand from animals is not only wasteful but doesn&#39;t make sense TODAY, when we have access to an abundance of fruit/veg/nuts/seeds we dont have to spend our days searching for. Our ancestors have been shown to eat somewhere upwards of 100g of fiber a day and today people barely meet the RDA of 30g, we&#39;ve strayed far away from our natural diet and focused too much on what we had to do to survive once we migrated around the world, mixed with what only the rich could afford.

The reason you probably didn&#39;t mention it was because it&#39;s only really common if you drink beer or any alcohol really with it, which isn&#39;t really what the video is about. This keeps purines in your body which turns to uric acid (since you essentially pee water when drunk) and builds up in your joints causing swelling and sharp pain.  I can eat meat now I just make sure to have a salad with it and watch the drinking with red meat.
