Although that&#39;s pretty bad, don&#39;t forget there is even more antioxidants in it protecting our progeny, therefore more than totally cancelling the effects of the free radicals. Now what&#39;s good? First, all the nutrients necessary to keep a cell running because you know, running the equivalent of the moon to the earth distance requires great electrolytic balance. On the energy side, it doesn&#39;t have fat or glucose, it has glycogen which is greater than fat if you need to use energy and better than glucose if you need to stock it. Need to build muscles, don&#39;t worry this shit is full of proteins to, thus helping get those sweet guns. So next time, don&#39;t let your wife keep it all.
