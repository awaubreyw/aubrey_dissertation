Guess where in the world lives more healthier people? :)<br>I am not saying that all this information in this video is bullshit as nothing in biology and physiology is just a constant thing but lot of information is just took from the same source and wrapped in different sauce. Whether it is lazy science video, whether there are deeper problem... 99.9% of scientists living from projects which are financed by 3rd parties. So independent science discoveries almost on 100% becomes conspiracy theory, fake science or at least appears somewhere where only 1% of people are following and society does not accept it as it is not appearing on main news or big websites. For some discoveries there is no strict evidence (if we look from classic side) what in terms of nature does not mean it is not correct just because we people can not prove it in terms we understand or was trained to accept. Example: before Magellan discovered that earth is not flat, it does not mean that earth become round stright after Magellan approved it.<br><br><br>1. On today gluten almost for 95% (US) is different in molecular level than 50-60 years ago. It is just a hypothesis taken from lot of sources, discoveries and observations. In EU it is bit different but just wait for some years and we catch US. Basically todays seeds are uneatable for insects as that was the reason there were made a changes in gluten in the first place to save or grow bigger harvest. So why we need bigger harvest in the first place? Not enough food? Of course as couple of decades ago we changed our lifestyle from farming to City living. So we society not producing anything. We became parasites (just came in mind from various crazy movies - ex. Matrix :))) Yes! Everything was started for a good reason to feed the world. But when you realise what happens after 25-35 years (health problems) you are unable to change anything as in that long time lot of companies grew big. Lot of businesses changed because of that and thousands of new jobs were opened. Enormous corporations grew from the ground. It will never flip back so we just continue to research how to deal with consequences because of previous discoveries which we put in work. Those perhaps in couple of years or a decade will bring us new consequences but society in todays rush life forgetting everything that happened year ago. Good example is the 2019 movie &quot; Yesterday&quot; (thoughts just from looking trailer). Should see a movie. <br>2. At those molecular levels is all the difference. One - your body can recycle are at least pull out through digestive system (with help of balanced diet) and second version will sit in your stomach as a glue which can not be pulled out so easily and human body does not recognise it + unbalanced diet. Consequences... new problems which of course will be researched and farmacy will come up as heroes with new solution. And this wheel will spin and spin... we call it progress :))<br>3. The magic word &quot;Detox&quot;. This is the same as with words &quot;Sport&quot; on the back of the car and word &quot;Rave&quot; which is common in electronic music community. Those words are so overused that main meaning of them are forgotten long ago. Word &quot;Detox&quot; basically means one day of fasting. It is enough if you move a lot throughout the day and eat balanced diet. But as most society (those who are working for others) move just from house to car -&gt; to office -&gt; to car -&gt; to home -&gt; to gym (on 01st of January) and eating what they can &quot;afford&quot; (another big topic) in terms of money or mindset, for those one day fasting is almost nothing. And it is &quot;normal&quot; because they do not see results of that kind of movement. So &quot;Detox&quot; for such part of society is just everyday (or 2-3 times per week) movement to relax and unload your digestive system. It can be done with help of food and drink diet or with nutritional supplement. Where first is quite &quot;hardcore&quot; for those people as you need some kitchen tools, some knowledge, some time to explore what works for you, etc. So basically give up. Second is quite interesting as there are so many traps :))<br>Basically people who found their way how to &quot;Detox&quot; on regular basis, mostly live more balanced lifestyle, are more deliberated and healthier as those who think it is &quot;Myth&quot; because science said that. You can not prove it, but you can see and feel it when you come accross with such people.<br>Ok!

But did you know that a &quot;gene defect&quot; was recently discovered called MTHFR that concluded ONLY HALF of the population can properly metabolize it in the body? Go look at the ingredients in your foods in your fridge and pantry. I guarantee you will find an abundance of foods containing folic acid. This is due to the law passed in 1990 that made fortifying certain foods with folic acid and other questionable synthetic vitamins to become mandatory. And did you know there is a such thing as &quot;folic acid poisoning&quot;? Side effects include digestive problems, nausea, loss of appetite, bloating, gas, a bitter or unpleasant taste in the mouth, sleep disturbances, depression, excessive excitement, irritability and a zinc deficiency. More severe signs include psychotic behavior, numbness or tingling, mouth pain, weakness, trouble concentrating, confusion, fatigue and even seizures.

Gluten is often called an anti nutrient because it negatively affects the absorption of many other nutrients. Research leaky gut. Is your channel funded by the FDA or something?? I thought that only the government believed this crap. When gluten is digested it forms a polypeptide that crosses the blood - brain barrier and pings your opiate receptors. This causes addiction and overeating. What about the little known fact that breads and pastas contain amylopectin-A which the body turns into blood sugar faster than eating table sugar? I know this last fact isn&#39;t gluten in particular,  but most people don&#39;t know that eating whole wheat bread spikes your blood sugar more than table sugar. Paleo is the way. Just don&#39;t replace your gluten - containing foods with gluten-free versions because these will spike your blood sugar as much or more than the ones that contain gluten.

Staying on a gluten free diet will limit this unhealthy gluttony simply because it is more difficult to find and/ or prepare food.

I mentioned this to the doctors multiple times over the course of about 2 years, and no one did anything.<br><br>SO, after this BIG issue, they finally checked and said he was &quot;light possitive&quot; which was not an actual positive and to not change his diet. Instead insisting that it had to be something else. Is his insulin good, are his ketostrips good, do his needle tips work, is his meter working, are we adding everythign up correctly... etc.<br><br>Yes to everything. So finally, I said forget it and cut out gluten. Within a day and a half, ketones were gone, and stayed gone for nearly a month. WELL, the day before yesterday, they told me that there is absolutely NO WAY that a gluten allergy (no, they said celiac disease) could cause ketones, that it was impossible, and to put him back on a regular diet.<br><br>Ok, fine. Back on a normal diet he goes and he had a regular sandwich for lunch and we had pizza for dinner. By dinner time he had light ketones, and by bedtime they were high. The following morning they were still high, as were his blood sugars and he was in extreme abdominal pain and throwing up.<br><br>He had no gluten at all yesterday and we pumped a great deal of insulin into him to bring down his numbers and get rid of ketones (all with the doctors on the phone with me of course) and they finally had me bring him into the ER where they basically just pumped him full of fluids, checked his ketones once and sent him home.<br><br>SO, my question is, if gluten is NOT the cause of his high ketones, then what else could I have possibly taken away when I make him gluten free that WOULD cause the problem?", "comment_date": "2014-05-16T17:23:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "villegas24", "comment_text": "I have a stupid gluten allergy :(\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-05-16T17:21:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "psychedelicpiper", "comment_text": "Gluten is a big reason I used to feel like crap, even after eating going out of my way to eat organic bread and noodles.
