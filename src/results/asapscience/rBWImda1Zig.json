At the very inmost roots of our being - everyone is united in ONENESS.<br><br>Therefore - where do the differences lie?<br><br>They arise out of the development of species - genetics - conditioning - traditional teachings - customs and educational and family habits of relating with others and the differences in thought patterns.<br><br>It is not the color which divides us. A small child of every race and color because of its innocence and spontaneity of self-expression will find acceptance in the heart of most adults. It is the CONSCIOUSNESS which divides us and which is felt on every level of our being - for we are all - despite our materialized bodies - CONSCIOUSNESS FORMS expressing consciousness patterns and CONSCIOUSNESS FORMS receiving consciousness patterns from others.<br><br>The consciousness of each individual is their reality - not their skin or appearance - and it is the consciousness of people which either attracts or repulses others.<br><br>We can rest assured that we will only overcome our sense of racial differences when our mental/emotional thought patterns are in sympathy - and when our VALUES by which we choose to live throughout our day - are the same. Until that time comes - it is useless for people to be angry with one another for experiencing racial differences. They are endemic to the human condition.<br><br>If we want to be accepted completely into another race - we have to change our values - our perceptions - our ideas - modes of living and of relating to others to match everyone else&#39;s in that race. Racial differences then die a natural death.<br><br>If we are not prepared to take on the &quot;consciousness&quot; of the race we wish to join - then acknowledge - accept and RESPECT with LOVE the differences in consciousness. No one has the right to demand we should ignore the differences.<br><br>MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL: Choose the highest standards on offer in the world - work to embrace and use them - and then all skin colors will take on a new and inner beauty which none will be able to resist. All people will then willingly bond in perfect harmony.<br><br>Physical appearances of every color will also change and take on new inner beauty.<br><br>When LOVE is distributed throughout the world and groups of people bond together to live within the spiritual Laws of Existence - such groups will find they are living harmoniously protected lives - although there may be mayhem going on around them.\u00a0<br><br>Everywhere - those who bond together to learn how to enter - and live within - the Wholeness of Being which Jesus termed the &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; over 2000 years ago - will discover that their circumstances are surely changing.<br><br>I urge people to meet together on a Sunday to speak of our many blessings - give sincere wholehearted thanks and raise our minds in praise of That Which has given us Being.<br><br>Let us meditate together to draw Divine Consciousness through our minds into world consciousness that the nature of the Divine may - more and more - imbue the nature of the world psyche with Its own transcendent Love.<br><br>Our groups will emit spiritual consciousness energy which will influence mind energies around us.<br><br>Remember that the world was not in such a dangerous predicament when the churches - worldwide - met on Sundays to worship God.<br><br>Those days are now past. We will not worship God.<br><br>We will build up a strong awareness of Divine Consciousness universally present. Its universality and scope of creativity will be ever more firmly entrenched in our minds by means of sincere praise. In the silence and stillness - we will all reach out to DIVINE CONSCIOUSNESS and invite IT lovingly to take possession of our minds and hearts. Thus - little by little will we become unified - and the Divine Consciousness will - more and more - take possession of the world as was Its earliest intention.", "comment_date": "2022-06-20T08:44:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GSSG", "comment_text": "So doctors learn that black people has thicker skin in medical school?", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T06:09:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mikey james", "comment_text": "as a white man, i find the song &#39;white men cant jump&#39; offensive. can we change it to &#39;yellow, black and white men cant jump&#39;? thank you.", "comment_date": "2022-06-15T08:23:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Franklin Hazzard", "comment_text": "Here is some science for ya.

But about a year ago this man thought that it would be hilarious and profitable to openly use the N-WORD on this platform. Before this this man has made a comfortable career attacking, mocking as well as sending death threat to the Autistic Community. And in recent months this man started selling LOLLI PORNOGRAPHY using Gamesworkshop\u2019s Intellectual property without the company\u2019s permission behind his patreon pay wall. This man has constantly gone against Youtube\u2019s Terms and Services. When YouTube took down the video where he laughed at using the N-word, this man re-uploaded the same video with a minor edit so that he could have a second laugh. When the community tries to cancel him for his horrible behavior that is exactly when he discontinued his cartoon avatar and started Parading in front of the camera. He doubled down constantly saying phrases along the line \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I want\u201d. For a hobby with a recommended age of 13 and older this can not be helpful for the community. I was 13 when I stepped into the GW for the first time, and over the years I saw other unhinged man-children in the shop doing saying the exact same things as this individual. And every single time a parent would hear the exact words from those men come out of their children\u2019s and they all received life bans. How is this any different? YouTube\u2019s platform allows him reach kids on an international level, he is directly responsible for creating the future RACISTS, SEXUAL PREDATORS, and CHRISCHANS. YouTube, Gamesworkshop and the sponsors that allow this behavior to continue are allowing themselves to associated with criminal activities. To any other critics who have also received death threat from this man, call his local authorities for questioning. And let me remind everyone that these actions of his are only the tip of the iceberg. To Gamesworkshop, he has made a following on YouTube that is close to your very own. On YouTube. WHY? Because your lore videos are boring(no offense), leaving parts of the community to funnel into this channel. On his live feeds he getting large donations from individuals, that money could be going directly into your own pockets. If you want to direct your customers into profitable lore videos, then GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT. Write a script that you are passionate about, cut the check and sent it to Superman. If you can some how pull that off, you will make a believer out of me and many others. I would even help with the cost by going back to my local Warhammer store and buy me some blood angels. <br>To my close friends that were offended and then told by this man to shrug it off, I\u2019m sorry.

I think, outside the general population,  there are 2% - 3% of the population that are anti race that are causing most the commotion.  And I find that those people of that attitude come from all races.  White priviledge that is being emphasized in news media and left wing politics is a means to a poilitical end.

As I stated in the beginning I was a racist, full of hate and anger towards people of different color. I was a completely different type of my own being, to put it lightly, a monster in the making. Although I never physically harmed anyone &quot;thank God&quot;, my mindset at a time was to the point where I wouldn&#39;t care if I did, it&#39;s just that The right opportunity never presented itself. I am 38 years old let&#39;s go back almost 7 years ago. I got a job at a casino and basically fell in love the moment I met a girl, I mean I fell hard and still falling everyday lol. Anyways, getting to know her over a couple weeks after already being in love she had recently told me she had a child, and that didn&#39;t bother me. One day we were having a conversation at work and she tells me that her son is racially mixed &quot; I&#39;m pretty sure she was afraid to tell me at first because I told her about my racist family&quot; So needless to say I got very confused in my mind and in my heart.. but I asked myself what was so different about this woman that I had already fallen in love with? Was I going to convince myself and tell myself that the fact her son was mixed that I couldn&#39;t love her anymore??? the first time I met her son was when she came to get me and I believe we were going to get something to eat. Neiko was in his car seat, tiny adorable little thing \u2764\ufe0f lol. I felt very uncomfortable and still very confused about what to do with this situation already loving her and not wanting to hurt her,.. so I &quot;played along&quot; so to speak. So a couple weeks go by and we go to the park to play at the jungle gym, we are playing and I remember his tiny little feet and legs going over the ladder from one part of the jungle gym to another, I&#39;m guiding him till he gets Midway through the chain fence and asks me for a kiss. To be honest I was reluctant, I was raised a completely different way, in my mind I was doing something wrong but I chose to listen to my heart and I leaned in and he gave me a kiss on the cheek. The putrid stone that was encasing my heart completely shattered and ever since then I have been a completely different person. The hatred I had in me was such a waste of energy.. anger that was bottled up for no reason, it was all gone. I instantly felt so much better mentally I know this sounds like a made-up fairy tale but it&#39;s true, love saved me. Think of racism as a small fire burning in your heart, your first racial thoughts are the kindling, left alone that fire will burn out in time leaving the soil rich in nutrients for new and beautiful things to grow. But the more racial thoughts you have that&#39;s just another stick thrown on the fire, Before you know it the fire gets so big you cannot put it out and it destroys  everything. From where it started, and continues to destroy everything around it. Racism needs to be studied more now than ever we have studied psychopaths, serial killers, suicidal people, and all of the outcomes usually turn to medicine to help one&#39;s cope with either being crazy, extremely angry and or depressed. People aren&#39;t just born suicidal or born being a serial killer and what not..so it&#39;s not that you&#39;re born racist, it&#39;s seems to be linked to some type of traumatic episode that happened, or as in my case the way you are raised.. not to say that they can actually create a magic pill to get rid of racism but maybe something that can tone it down and help one see the lighter side of things because not everybody is as lucky as to have the situation I did. But being someone who can relate to the damage this mentally does was incredible, I would be just fine and then just by merely seeing someone of a different color, all of these emotions would mix up inside of my mind and completely ruin anything good that was inside of me. It would start with anger and then just run itself into a snowball effect of all of these other things that I would blame on others even though they had absolutely nothing to do with me.. it was crazy and it could really mess somebody up. Maybe this was all wishful thinking but I really hope that someday others can get this putrid darkness out of their souls and learn to really live and love.

HS level mostly, but also youth leagues.   I love hanging with the kids.  Great times. <br>Several years ago, I coached youth (12-13 yr old) baseball in a white neighborhood.  We had a very good team and we had 2 black kids on the team.  One of them was a tremendous player.  He was smallish but hit like a demon.  I batted him 3rd of course....one of our best hitters.  Great kid too.  Always laughing and hanging with the other kids.  He had one flaw tho. When he&#39;d hit a ball a long way, he&#39;d miss touching a base causing him to be called &quot;out&quot;.  He&#39;d get so excited and try running so fast that he&#39;d miss bases....A LOT !!  <br>To take some pressure off him and try to relax him on the bases a bit, I dropped him in the batting order to 6th one game.  There was a very specific reason for doing this.....and my other coaches agreed. <br>After that first game, his father confronted me on the field and LOUDLY (and publicly) called me a racist for doing this.  I should have walked away, but I asked him &quot;Did I suddenly TODAY become a racist ?   He hit 3rd for 6 games and you didn&#39;t have an issue with me then .  Why am I suddenly a racist ?&quot;   <br><br>He just turned and walked away waving his arms and repeating....&quot;racist coaches&quot;.  This is a common tactic.  Walk away from logic. <br><br>THIS is what many whites are angry with.  We do not disagree that there is racism (and in certain parts of the country LOTS of it).

This makes what I am saying law, not heresy or hear say.<br>2) The bride shall resemble the husband <br>3) The life of the flesh is in the blood<br>4) Believers are as salt and light<br>5) Salt and light are white<br>6) Black equals darkness and is defined as the absence of light<br>7) God created light and saw that it was good and divided the light from the darkness. The law and practice of segregation is and was established by God.<br>8) White declared believers<br>9) Blacks declared unbelievers<br>10) Whosever believes in the Lord and is baptized is saved and whosoever believes not is doomed.<br>11) There is no darkness in Christ<br>12) He is without spot or blemish <br>13) Satan has no place in Christ<br>Establishing a religious establishment after the law if God.<br>1)Bride must resemble the husband<br>2)A nation under God means his bride which is the Church<br>Since the bride must resemble the husband then we build America in his likeness. First we must establish his likeness based upon witnesses and testimony.<br>1st witness) Words of King Solomon the Son of King David. Jesus is called Son of David so these are the words of Jesus. &quot;I am swarthy by reason of the sun and my beloved (wife) is white so by his law he declares that he is white for the bride resembles the husband.<br>2nd witnesses) The flag of Israel stating the bloodline and flesh of King David. The flag is made of blue stripes that make the Star of David. The Star of David is imposed onto a white background. The law states that the life of the flesh is in the blood, the blue stripes are the bloodline and the white background is the flesh. The flag stands for the flesh and blood of King David so therefore again Jesus is without argument white. Jesus is also a jew so this also declares Jews to be white people. These white jews are the nation of Israel and are also America.<br>3rd witness) Jesus sent as the Lamb of God. Lambs are white but swarthy.<br>4th witness) The pure white dove symbolic of the Holy Spirit. Christ is born of the Holy Spirit therefore is born pure white like that of a dove.<br>5th witness) The jewish prayershawl which states the flesh and blood of King David, Jesus and the Jews. The prayershawl is fashioned by Gods word and commandment to be made of pure white wool with blue stripes.<br><br>America established as a religious nation called church as one nation under God.<br>1st witness) The all white cabinet members of our founding forefathers stating &quot;We the people of the United States of America.&quot;<br>2nd witness) The flag as a symbol of our republic. The stars represent the states which are the people of the United states of America. They are all white, no there is not one black or mixed racial ethnicity. The star is a Christian symbol as it is the opposite of the sigil for the devil which is an inverted star that forms the image of a goat. The goats are used in Christian religion to symbolize the devil and his a gels that will be destroyed. The stars symbolic of Christian&#39;s and the people of the United states of America comprise and make up what is called the Puritan Church. The flag also states that we are a Pentecostal Church as the red stripes stand for the shed blood and the white stripes stand for the lamb. This is called Pentecost which is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit by Christ and his atonement at Calvary. That makes the flag and it&#39;s people the Holy Spirit. Whosoever sins or speaks against the Holy Spirit is endanger of hellfire and cannot be forgiven.<br>3rd witness) The White House as a symbol of our nation. The White House or the House of White people.<br>4th Witness) The word of our judicial court decisions that you must be white in order to have citizenship. This follows Gods law that you must believe a d be baptized to have citizenship in Christ and belief is denoted by white flesh.<br>5th Witness) Our Supreme Court decision, Dredd Scott decision of 1866 ruling that blacks cannot have citizenship by any means. This includes by means of the 14th Amendment which is Federally unlawful therefore the Supreme Court decision still stands.<br><br>An all white nation Under God is a religious practice and establishment. It is also the Civil and Human rights of a human being to have and live in such a place if he enters through Christ as  a believer. Since blacks don&#39;t have citizenship by the Supreme Court decision and by God&#39;s law and ruling that there is no darkness in him then blacks don&#39;t have Civil rights. Gods law warned them thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife or any of thy neighbors things. It does not belong to them. They have violated our civil and human rights and they say that we violated theirs. They don&#39;t have any rights here as the flag tells them every day they have no place here.<br>Law: <br>1)Satan is the Prince of darkness, Father of Lies and Ruler of Demons. (A prince is both father and ruler of his people so Prince, Father and Ruler are the same here as well as darkness (blacks), lies (blacks) and Demons (blacks).<br><br>2)Satans Children are black people called the tares.<br>3) Satan cometh only to steal, kill and to destroy and his children will do his lust and will or the same in other words.<br>4) They are a terrorist organization  and are liars<br>5) It is deception.<br><br>Jesus the way the truth and the light was asked by the Pharisees  If you have sown good seed into the field then where do these tares come from.&quot; Jesus replied &quot;An enemy sowed them whilst men slept.&quot; In other words we never went to Africa and brought back slaves to America, that is Satans lie. Truth his they are here by breaking and entering and their only intent is to steal, kill and destroy. That is the truth according to the personal testimony of God.<br><br>This is grounds for an arrest warrant and court trial. It is written to take place at Megiddo and is called the Battle of Armegeddon.<br>Michael and his Angel&#39;s fought and the devil and his Angel&#39;s fought but did not prevail and Satan, the original serpent that decieveth the whole world was cast out of Heaven and no longer was their place found written therein. Any among you that in anyway speaketh against this order will without fail be doomed by judgement and execution of the Law.<br>Oh, and hate speech....<br>I hate robbery says the Lord and the Lord hates those that work iniquity and lies. Hate is not a evil unless it is for no reason. The bible says &quot;If you hate your brother for no reason you are in danger of hellfire.&quot; <br>Animal, you are in serious danger. A land that sins against God will be destroyed.<br>What I have written unto you are the statutes of God, man and the nation. You though are behaving in defiance of all three. God will destroy you, the nation will remove you and man will beat any animal to death that mauls a man to death as stated by Leviticus. You are mauling a man to death animal. From what I can tell you are an absolutely insane and rabid animal because you don&#39;t line up with Gods law and image therefore are not man or of man&#39;s seed. Therefore animal or demon.<br>14th amendment is a parasite as seen in nature. It infects the host insect and has been seen to cause the infected insect to protect the parasites brood from the rest of the insects colony. That is the <br>Equal protection in the 14th amendment..", "comment_date": "2021-01-15T00:12:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emanuil", "comment_text": "<b>Why are all the hosts black, y&#39;all realize anyone can be a racist or a victim of such?</b>", "comment_date": "2021-01-14T15:22:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "king doge", "comment_text": "Racism is pretty racist", "comment_date": "2021-01-13T19:41:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zkittlez Tha Banditt", "comment_text": "So, can anyone tell me how I&#39;m supposed to do this when I live in a city that is almost 80% white?

The word latino is something that people from the U.S. created so they don&#39;t bother to know our differences, everyone of those countries beyond the mexican boarder have their own amazing culture to share and it would be nice to be recognised by nationality for once. It is quite confusing growing up peruvian and then travel to the U.S. to discover that people mixed your culture with a bunch of other cultures like scrambled eggs and consider you all the same. Do correct if I&#39;m wrong, but I think the same thing happens with people from Asia. They are chinese, or japanese, or korean, not just Asian.

However, we are not able to translate our results into gaps in hiring rates or earnings<br><br><i>&quot;Another weakness is that the resumes do not directly report race but instead suggest race through\r personal names. This leads to various sources of concern. First, while the names are chosen to make race salient, some employers may simply not notice the names or not recognize their racial content [...]. Relatedly, because we are not assigning race but only race-specific name, our results are not representative of the average African American (who may not have such a racially distinct name).&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;Finally, and this is an issue pervasive in both our study and the pair-matching audit studies, newspaper\r ads represent only one channel for job search. As is well known from the existing literature, social networks are a common means through which people find jobs and one that clearly cannot be studied here. This omission would affect our results if African Americans use social networks more or if less discriminating employers rely more on networks.&quot;</i> (This study is from 2003, so &quot;social network&quot; as we commonly understand it now is a bit different than it was back then, 15 years ago)<br><br>_&quot;While these names clearly signal race, perhaps they also signal some other personal characteristics. More specifically, one might be concerned that employers are inferring social background<br>from the personal name. When employers read a name like \u201cTyrone\u201d or \u201cLatoya,\u201d they may assume that the\r person comes from a disadvantaged background. In the extreme form of this social background interpretation, employers do not care at all about race but are discriminating only against the social background conveyed by the names we have chosen&quot;_<br><br><i>&quot;Consistent with a social background interpretation, the African American names we have chosen fall below the African American average. For African American male names, however, the gap between the experimental names and the population average is negligible. For White names, both the male and female names are above the population average.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;Names might also influence our results through familiarity. It might be that these African American\r names simply appear odd to human resource managers and that any odd name faces discrimination.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;Perhaps what appears as discrimination is actually\r the result of reverse discrimination. If qualified African Americans are thought to be in high demand, then employers with average quality jobs might feel that an equally talented African American would never accept an offer from them and thereby never call her or him in for an interview. Such an argument might also explain why African Americans do not receive as strong of a return as Whites to better resumes, since higher qualification only strengthens this argument.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;These facts suggest that perhaps other models may do a better job at explaining our findings. One simple\r alternative model is lexicographic search by employers. Employers receive so many resumes that they may use quick heuristics in reading these resumes. One such heuristic could be to simply read no further when they see an African American name. Thus they may never see the skills of African American candidates and this could explain why these skills are not rewarded. This might also to some extent explain the uniformity of discrimination since the screening process (i.e. looking through a large set of resumes) may be quite similar across the variety of jobs we examine.&quot;</i> (this is about the fact, that black sounding names with a higher quality resume do not have a much higher chance of getting a callback (9% increase) compared to a white sounding name (30% increase). This could be due to racial discrimination, but could also be due to the point mentioned further, about names implying social background)<br><br>*Now let&#39;s look at their findings: *<br><i>&quot;Resumes\r with White names have a 10.08 percent chance of receiving a callback. Equivalent resumes with African American names have a 6.70 percent chance of being called back. This represents a difference in callback rates of 3.35 percentage points, or 50 percent, that can solely be attributed to the name manipulation.&quot;</i> 10% White vs 7% Black resumes got a callback. Doesn&#39;t sound that impressive now, doesn&#39;t it? <br><br>Also, it&#39;s noteworthy to say, that no, resumes WERE NOT IDENTICAL, they were JUST ON A SIMILAR LEVEL. Also - the researchers sent up to 4 resumes in respons to each ad (two higher quality and two lower quality ones).<br><br><i>&quot;As Table 2 indicates, equal treatment occurs for about 87.5 percent of the help-wanted ads. As expected,\r the major source of equal treatment comes from the high fraction of ads for which no callbacks are recorded (82.5 percent of the ads). Whites are favored by nearly 9 percent of the employers, with a majority of these employers contacting exactly one White applicant. African Americans, on the other hand, are favored by only about 3.7 percent of employers.&quot;</i><br><br><br>See? It&#39;s not so simple as &quot;50% more callbacks&quot; now, is it? And yes, what the study finds is most likely accurate (or was, 15 years ago), it&#39;s only uncertain if the real reason is racial discrimination or is there any other factor (few of which the researchers themselves mentioned and I&#39;ve cited them here).

This video is garbage, i made a select few rules for myself that really make life easier. When i meet a new person i do not look at their face, i look them in the eye and shake their hand. The way they respond to the friendly gesture tells me a lot about their personality, i treat them with respect and see if they bounce it back. Ive grown up around plenty of different people and constantly moving kinda helps you learn about people. I will always respect someone when first meeting them no matter what i have heard, and see how they respond then i will start a conversation, keeping eye contact and watching their face for what they are thinking. I let them finish what they say before saying what i would like too. I am not political but i am polite. I don\u2019t open with anything more than the weather. I do my best not to stereotype. And above all else when you greet someone, smile. It makes things easier. With that said, racism in my own opinion (yours may differ but that\u2019s fine!) is ridiculous, we are not very different, where you were raised makes a difference, like maybe more used to cold or dry climates. And some home laws (by that i mean morale compas) for the most part we all want to be good or great but circumstances change things. The only way to \u201cget over racism\u201d is to get over ourselves first, realizing that we are all different even if we are the same \u201crace\u201d that differences make life interesting from the cut and dry mortar.

When I say something that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with race or at least no meaning to, and get accused of being racist.<br>4. When I avoid people on the sidewalk that just happen to be a different race, I get accused of being racist. I avoid everyone outside, unless they&#39;re children, regardless of their race because I have trust issues and hate people.<br>5. I&#39;m white with a white name, and I still can&#39;t get a job.

Another is the study where black boys got worse punishments than white boys. the study wasn\u2019t of what the kids actually got punished for, it was what people with a teaching background said they\u2019d do. if you look in the same study as to what the kids actually got punished for, you\u2019ll see whites got punished more than blacks, and asians were punished least of all.

Later in this video they claim that black names received 50% less callbacks, but that again, isn&#39;t true, looking at the data of the study, it states that white names received 7.8% callbacks out of 62 attempts (5 calls), meanwhile, black names received 6.6% callbacks out of 62 attempts (4 calls), so the difference is... ONE call. But we all know that if you have a certain statistic framework, you can make all type of conclusions, and this is what this study did.

Pleas like this comment so AsapSCIENCE and Nuance Bro may see This. Enjoy :)<br><br>Ok, I&#39;m Black and Japanese, but I thought this video was completely contradicting the point to acknowledge racism. While I do believe we live in a partly racist society I strongly disagree with this video in many ways, but at the same time we do share some views. I will acknowledge all MAIN points in this video from start to finish, and while you may have a different opinion than me, it is very important to keep an open mind, or you will not understand where I come from. <br><br> The first main point starts off with the research on the \u201cResumes\u201d. The video states \u201cBlack sounding names\u201d receive 50% fewer callbacks, now I\u2019m just a 15 year old kid writing this so i&#39;m not going to go all out like I could, but their are so many variables that can change which could lead to these outcomes, don\u2019t believe me, well let me explain. Many jobs have different interview rates, which you can see on a post made by \u201cTalent Works\u201d, so unless the \u201c1300 Fake Resumes\u201d were sent to the same job you must account for this. Now let&#39;s talk about timing, if you ever worked a night shift at a fast food restaurant you\u2019re probably not doing your best, this apply for all jobs, including employers. And if there is one thing I learned in my sociology class it\u2019s that humans are unpredictable so we must not give the benefit of the doubt to 1300 resumes in proving a racist society in the world of the jobs. <br><br> I\u2019m going to keep this section short and simple as it was in the video, \u201cClassism\u201d. While I do believe we have a unfair punishment act in prison and school. I can also see where other people may come from. For example a black male vs. a white male in 1st degree murder. While studies show, at least what this video suggest, black males get a longer prison time then white, we must account for, just because they did the same crime does not mean it was the same circumstances, what I mean by this is a person getting shot vs. a person getting brutally stabbed, both are murder but one is much worse. So I can see were different views can come out of this. <br><br> The next subject I will touch is how racism affects health. This video states and I literally quote, Racism = Health Disparities. I can see how this may be true but again I will talk about how I see it. Like I said this video shows how racism can create health risk, yet in my opinion (no study) I can argue racism enhances health risk already there. So let&#39;s not exaggerate the truth guys. <br><br> While the video touches on many other points these are what I thought to be most important, not to prove my argument, hell if I care, but to show how we perceive as racism and life. <br><br> Now before I finish lets not forget my main point, how I thought this video was completely contradicting the point to acknowledge racism. While I do not have a degree in psychology, sociology, etc I can guarantee this video uses physiological cues to persuade audience to their side, ex, music, people used etc. But what I found contradictory was the use of white males to be portrayed as the only racist group of people, because if you go back into the video they do not portray in other race to be racist. What I also found contradictory were the actors only being black. But it&#39;s just a \u201cvideo\u201d. <br><br>At the end of the day I do not want you to side with me, I want you to look at both pieces of the equation and then pick your choosing. Like I said I didn\u2019t do much research but this is my opinion. <br><br>Have a good day y&#39;all!<br><br> <br><br>Source:<br><br><a href=\"https://talent.works/blog/2017/09/22/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-job-60-days-if-youre-in-hr-or-sales/\">https://talent.works/blog/2017/09/22/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-job-60-days-if-youre-in-hr-or-sales/</a>", "comment_date": "2018-11-23T12:11:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ronnie", "comment_text": "Just statistics<br>There no real science here.", "comment_date": "2018-11-23T12:01:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Athesia Man", "comment_text": "Please, stop misleading people with these lies", "comment_date": "2018-11-23T11:38:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kalman Linietsky", "comment_text": "Oh, for G-d&#39;s sake, I am a Trump voter who never voted for a Democrat in his life, and I agree with parts of the video- specifically the psychology of racism. Why? Personal experience. I used to be very racist- I actually supported &quot;Reenslavement&quot; and used the N-word regularly. I know the contact effect is true, because all this changed when I spent time with a mixed race person of my religion. That helped me realize  that I was thinking in a twisted manner. And I have OCD. The therapy that is used to treat OCD makes, trains one to recognize their subconscious.  I now see that things that are remnants of my racist days as they are- I recognize I have not totally reformed. This is what they are speaking about in the end of the video. A lot of my coreligionists are casual racists, and almost all are strong GOP and I have  been accused of &quot;liberalism&quot; which &quot;is not compatible&quot; with the religion over my protests of the casual racism. <br>And yes, discrimination causes psychological and physical effects. About a month ago, I was a victim of a horrible hate crime on the bus because my religion wears certain identifiable garb. I am now afraid to get on a bus- to the point I am using Uber, even though I don&#39;t have the money to.

I know that it was used in the past to describe people of colour when racism was forced on people of colour everyday (as in slavery and things like that), but now I hear people say it all the time to describe their best friends, but then when a white person says it (not being racist, like calling there best friend the \u201cn word\u201d) they are deemed as racist...

First, science is all about about the comparison of multiple findings and, as such, critique as the very core of science. Second, science is often about the details as opposed to the conclusions, which was the only aspect of these studies that was shown. This is primarily because the methodology of how the data is acquired is the presentation of such data is the limiting factor in what a researcher can conclude about it. Third, science is all about the consensus of data pulled from multiple studies so there could be plenty of other sociological studies challenging the ones you see in this video and they could very well offer more robust methodology/data/conclusions. The video didn&#39;t go over anything except the conclusions of the studies, not even the limitations of the studies, and tried to pass these conclusions as fact when it may very well not the case. For example, the data of different names on resumes being indicative of racism isn&#39;t clear cut and there are other studies that fail to replicate the results shown here or give alternative rationales as to why first names, as opposed to last names, create this effect. This would, of course, seem racist to anyone who hasn&#39;t been exposed to any other studies or isn&#39;t prone to critical thinking, which is why videos like these are rather disappointing coming from a channel that purports to be scientific. Let&#39;s be honest and admit virtually none of us went through the trouble of even reading the abstract in these studies, much less the methodology, so stop saying that these studies can&#39;t be debunked, because all you&#39;re showing is your confirmation bias as opposed to any real scientific intellect.

A prime example this is all the drama around Airbnb guest and homeowner associations. An even larger example of this is of course immigration and nationalism.

Pls realize that the solipsist never sees himself or herself as the heart of the problem. The projections of the solipsist are hurled upon others as graffiti is hurled upon a free society,  but the graffiti artist never reflects upon the origins of smear; thus, to be honest with yourself, you must be willing to see in yourself the racism you hurl upon others. The cult of the black racist never see themselves as the problem; a mutual admiration society is self-perpetuating and will say and do anything to protect its interests; this is the heart of that grand hoax called racism. The proof? Start with denial of the principle of self determination as outlined by me in my first comment; and pls notice, as many others have done in this comment section, to eschew the necessity of self determination opens the barn door, wide, for another twelve generations of black dependency. Apparently this is just peachy with you, Cameron. In summary conclusion it must be observed that all stereotypes have a cause and a source. The video presented in this section puts a face on a most surreal abstraction called stereotype of the black racist. They name themselves. We can see who they are.

I\u2019m in a genetics class and we discussed this topic the other day about if there is a gene for racism. There isn\u2019t. It is more of a mental thing because the more you look at society, there is a survival of the fittest ideology still lingering in modern humans today. If you look at any cultures throughout history, you see different groups of people pitted against each other for land and resources. In other words, there are still fights for the most dominant ethnicity. There is no science behind racism besides the fact that we inherited certain ways of thinking from our ancestors which could be further influenced by environmental factors. Nowadays there is the black lives matter movement which was designed to raise awareness for black people when in turn it just caused a war between blacks and whites, especially white cops. Society is messed up and there are groups of people (the Democrats) that pit people against each other which raises the presence of racism in society", "comment_date": "2018-11-16T00:29:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos.i", "comment_text": "Ok folks, you (who made this video) knew this was a hard topic and that comments will rant so please don&#39;t take it the wrong way for some negativity or criticism.<br><br>I will try not to talk much by simply saying: This is too complex for a 6 minute video.<br>I really enjoy your channel but to be fair, this video needs equilibrium, more data and transparency in sources.", "comment_date": "2018-11-16T00:16:43Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Ariel", "comment_text": "Notice how they are all black.<br>YOU DO REALIZE EVERYBODY CAN BE RACIST OR EXPERIENCE RACISM<br>ex.

That means there is only one race! We are all different shades of brown depending on the amount of melatonin in our genetic profile. I find it very interesting that the Human Genome Project has finished its study on Races awhile ago but nobody seems to Focus on the fact that our genome scientifically shows that we are all One race No matter what culture. Humanity is 99.9% the same. They found that the genes that controlled the color of our skin or the way we looked was so insignificant it wasn&#39;t even worth talking about. Actually what I&#39;m trying to say is races were focused on but nobody seemed to care. I&#39;m using actual science down to our DNA not psychological studies that tend to be flawed. The real problem is that people constantly focus on race. You could probably get rid of racism in one to two generations if everyone stopped focusing on it. Nazi group&#39;s, KKK, Black Lives Matter, Black Panthers, BET and any other channel that only shows one culture and denies other cultures access to their station. Every single person on Earth is embedded with the same DNA with tiny, tiny differences. If someone asks what race you are just say human don&#39;t check off white don&#39;t check off Asian don&#39;t check off black. Sure people are going to lose certain privileges that are scientifically undeserved. When you have programs giving one group of people something but denying another group of people that same thing Envy ensues. People always interpret that Envy and anger as racism when it&#39;s really not racism it&#39;s just a group of people sick of being treated unfairly. This goes for every single people group. If we dumped every program that is designed to serve a certain group of people the jealousy and envy would start to reduce probably very quickly. Like I said quit talking about different groups of people as if they are different because we aren&#39;t. When the older people that started these separating problems start dying off and we forget their legacy and the horrible things they have done and don&#39;t speak of race anymore the race Vine will begin to wither until it dies. Will you get rid of it completely? No. But we can&#39;t help that because the Earth has always been filled with idiots. Maybe it&#39;s time to bring up the results of the Human Genome Project once again and let the media speak about it as much as they talk about the president.

Not racist per say but my Chinese best friend would rant at how finding your own race more attractive than the other racists is racist when biologically and scientifically we as a race empathise with and find people of our own race more attractive.   I do understand though that modern society is still largely white washed in media and positions of power. Also in uk and USA black people/ poc are treated with more suspicion in airports for example or by police or given dirty looks or bigoted comments by the small percentage of out and proud racists because these days, racism is politically incorrect, socially unacceptable and fundamentally morally wrong. I guess as a white person when looking at racism as a topic talked about everyday in the media, I feel on the defence as my race is always painted as the evil one, the racist, the oppressor. I am the opposite to this yet I feel I have no right to talk about my view because of my race and the past none of us mere mortals had any control over. I also find it offensive when poc are allowed to say black power proudly when it relates to the oppression of white power and to me signifies the division rather than empowerment. Also poc can speak more openly about race and the differences and make jokes and light of things where as white people are made to feel evil or awkward if they ever bring the slightest thing up.

If you think about the way people have been educating white kids about racism makes them terrified of people not liking them for being white, pairing that with being poor and it spells out disaster. Instead of talking about racism you should try your best to ignore peoples characteristics instead of creating an uncomfortable conscious recognition of it that leaves a bad taste in everyones mouth. I think the bias crap is bs too considering everyone is &quot;biased&quot; even these asap science guys have one they use to understand the world around them. You shouldnt speak too soon. People need benefit of doubt because being conscious of all this horse shit makes you biased about bias and how it all works, it i doubt a lot of what is said in the video. The idea of people being racist is a threat to people but my solution is you shouldnt let paranoia destroy you and even if society is to blame, everyone is at odds with the world at one point too, you should maintain a stoic character. Adversity sucks im not saying we should look out for eachother but what are we saying to our kids? That they should be MORE responsible than someone whos different than them, that they should recognize themselves as biased against people and worst of all that their anxiety isnt as important as others anxiety. Racism ends when its no longer part of the conversation, when we ignore the small things that hurt us and defeat the greater threats through a refined stoic attitude that recognizes adversity from an individuals perspective instead of through collectivist ideology that has little understanding of the difficulties it creates for people they arent protecting.", "comment_date": "2018-11-13T20:36:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Iam Theewalrustoo", "comment_text": "The hoax of racism is defeated by the principle of self determination.

Unlike this video. Racism is just one of many forms of bias against a specific group of people, ie because of the colour of their skin. Racism in of itself is therefore unjustified, and widely considered foolish. The problem is that the word racism is often used incorrectly to define cultural bias, and religious bias. Religious and cultural bias is (in a Nutt shell) judging someone for their beliefs. Many cultures and religions have a predominant race, therefore racism can exist by assuming someone&#39;s cultural or religious beliefs based on their skin colour. More often than not someone who disagrees with religious or cultural beliefs are at best considered intolerant, and at worst labeled as racist. This is the problem, because cultural and religious bias&#39; can be justified. There are very evident differences in certain belief systems that do not, and cannot, coexist. There is nothing wrong with you disliking another cultures way of life specifically if it threatens your own. These days however, in an age of hyper self segregation, there is a movement pushing a fascist form of anti-free speech which seeks to label white people who dislike anything about any other minority culture or religion as racist/ bigots. It&#39;s gotten so insane that videos like this one exist, masquerading as progressive all the while being racist towards white people by insinuating that most racism is performed by whites.

However, we scientists often provide the best supporting evidence for causation through experimental studies, and you can&#39;t ethically and practically do that with these variables.  To my knowledge, you couldn&#39;t assign people randomly to different treatment groups (i.e., a group which experiences no racist behaviors, a group with minimal racist experiences, one with more such experiences, and so on) and monitor them for physical and mental health changes over the course of years.  If you could, that would probably provide decent support of causation, based on the results, but we can&#39;t do that kind of study.  So the best we can do is see if there is a relationship between those variables (i.e., as one goes up/down, so does the other) based on the data available or ethically/practically obtainable.  There may be other variables that account for those correlations (e.g., genetic traits, neurological changes, early life experiences, or hell, even their astrological signs for shits and giggles), but it&#39;s likely that the researchers have taken a good amount of those into account when looking at the relationships.  So, congratulations, you remembered a thing that a teacher once stressed to you in a class you probably couldn&#39;t care less about now.  The reality of human behavioral research means that a lot of what we&#39;re interested in learning can&#39;t be supported by experimental evidence (as a doctoral student I had to learn that sad reality and lost a little of the passion I originally had for research).  As such, the best we&#39;re often left with is seeing which things statistically relate to each other and making sense of those relationships with the knowledge we already have.  A responsible scientist also wouldn&#39;t outright claim that they have &quot;proved&quot; that one thing &quot;causes&quot; the other, but state that they found this statistically relevant relationship and there is a good chance that if you alter one variable you might see changes to the other.  The scientist might also offer up that it is entirely plausible that some heretofore unconsidered variable could be responsible for this relationship, and further investigation would be helpful.  In the end, we have evidence that there is something going on here, and it is rather irresponsible for you to toss out the whole idea that anything is happening simply because you can recite a phrase.", "comment_date": "2018-11-12T19:26:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BuddyL", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve gone through the resume\ud83d\udcc3 thing<br>I&#39;ve gone through the school punishment thing\ud83c\udfe2<br>I&#39;ve gone through the health and stress thing\ud83d\ude37<br>I&#39;ve gone through the &quot;Why do you look so \ud83d\ude21?&quot; thing<br><br>Racism is real and representation matters.\u270a\ud83c\udfff", "comment_date": "2018-11-12T19:25:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tran Son", "comment_text": "wasn t it that black people have a better chance to get into university than asian with the same score.

Also the fact that it&#39;s from 2003 doesn&#39;t help, in fact 15 years is a lot of time for the job market and political climate to evolve, so its results might not be relevant today.<br>This doesn&#39;t mean the study is useless, it would be great to attract fund for a bigger study (Nationwide and that encompasses a large amount of jobs), as it might indicate a trend that is worth studying on, but by itself it can&#39;t be used as an effective argument for systemic racism.<br><br>2) What strikes me from this study is that black women have no problem concerning income when compared with black men. I find it extremely difficult to believe this is due to systemic racism, because it doesn&#39;t make sense that males experience it, while females don&#39;t.<br>A factor, that is also discussed in the article, is that most black families are composed of single mothers, and we know very well the effect that this kind of situation has on children, females might not feel it as much because their mother might empathize, and therefore have more care) more with them than boys, also the lack of role models is crucial.<br>It&#39;s interesting to note that similar trends have been found for native Americans boys, and in fact they have similar percentages of single parent kids to blacks (54% vs 66%).<br>(See <a href=\"https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/107-children-in-single-parent-families-by#detailed/1/any/false/870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38,35,18/10,11,9,12,1,185,13/432,431)\">https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/107-children-in-single-parent-families-by#detailed/1/any/false/870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38,35,18/10,11,9,12,1,185,13/432,431)</a><br><br>3) see 2), the lack of role models when growing up leads to aberrant behavior, that can explain why teachers tend to escalate reactions towards black students. Does this mean that there aren&#39;t biases? Of course not, but we have to apply Occam&#39;s razor: what&#39;s more likely, that black kids get harser punishments because teachers are overwhelmingly biased against them (which is an assumption), or that black kids grow up unstable because of lack of role models (which is backed up by statistical data)?<br><br>4) I&#39;ve read the paper but I can&#39;t understand how they are drawing their conclusions, for the first study at least: they basically assigned a score for each age group and each race, but they don&#39;t specify how they calculated said scores, so it&#39;s impossible for someone else to determine whether or not differences in score are significant (which don&#39;t seem to be that bigger anyway).<br>For what concerns the second study (the one with the police officers) it could be explained by the simple reason that black communities are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime, so they may be acting based on their experience. Though possibilities of actual discrimination can&#39;t be excluded, since the police in the United States has a lot of anecdotal evidence about being way to violent when it comes to blacks.<br><br>So these 4 don&#39;t really convince me that systemic racism exists.

There&#39;s actually a growing body of scientists who&#39;d argue that, despite everyone&#39;s desire to believe that all people are created equal, the unpleasant reality is that races and ethnic groups are unequal in many significant ways. While it&#39;s true that every individual should be evaluated on his or her own merits and deserves the same respect as everyone else regardless of race, tens of thousands of years of natural selection seem to have made some races better on average than others when it comes to certain abilities. People of African descent, for example, are much more likely to suffer from lactose intolerance and diabetes than white people, but they have greater immunity to certain diseases like malaria. Black people are also more likely to excel at sports like competitive running, whereas white people are more adept at sports like weight-lifting and swimming. When it comes to intelligence, black people as a group tend to score much lower on IQ tests and other measures of academic aptitude such as the SATs, GREs, ACTs etc. (For evidence of this, see the following sources: <a href=\"https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_general_test_score_information_by_ethnicity_2009_2010.pdf\">https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_general_test_score_information_by_ethnicity_2009_2010.pdf</a> and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf)\">https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf)</a> This so-called IQ gap persists is in spite of large scale efforts to boost black test scores through a variety of social and educational programs. Of course, there are many brilliant black people out there, but statistically brilliance is much rarer among those of African descent, at least as measured by standard metrics of intelligence.<br><br>Finally, blacks are statistically much likelier to act impulsively and commit crimes, particularly violent crimes, than their white or Asian counterparts. Wikipedia has this to say: &quot;The rate at which crime is committed varies greatly between racial groups. While most homicides in the United States are intraracial\u2014the perpetrator and victim are of the same race\u2014the rates at which African Americans (blacks) both commit and are the victim of homicide is about six to eight times higher than that of white Americans. The incarceration rate of blacks is more than three times higher than their representation in the general population.&quot; Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States</a>. African countries, or countries with large populations of African immigrants, also tend to exhibit much higher murder rates, as is evidenced in the following article: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate</a>.<br><br>As long as these differences between races exist, there&#39;s always going to be racism, in part because such racism corresponds with large-scale behavior patterns. Unfortunately, it seems natural selection may itself be what some would call racist, in that it inevitably causes a species to adapt in different ways to different environments, and this in turn leads to sub-species with different abilities and disabilities.<br><br>(On a side note, it seems pretty obvious that scientific papers with authors of different ethnic backgrounds will have more citations for reasons other than those given in the video. There&#39;s no special synergy that occurs when people of different backgrounds work together, as this video implies; instead, they&#39;ll simply have more exposure and often more funding and resources than researchers who all come from the same university with similar backgrounds.  It&#39;s for the same reason that musical artists from different genres who collaborate on a song will tend to have more listeners than musical artists who stay confined within the same genre.)", "comment_date": "2018-11-12T17:16:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "HANDS OFF MY MACARONI", "comment_text": "U should do a video on sibling rivarly", "comment_date": "2018-11-12T17:16:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Belik", "comment_text": "Oh yeah? well...

Racism starts to become a thing when one or both of the groups seems to be dangerous, or is interpreted as being lesser by the other. one of the big Issues now is that a lot of Minority dominated area&#39;s have high crime rates, which is due to limited education and job oppertunities and overall higher likelyhood of being arrested in the first place, but people who grew-up in the nicer Area&#39;s near there make the connection that Black people or hispanic people are Violent...

It is difficult for native speakers of one language to pronounce the names of another language and many do not want to come off as being an offender for not pronouncing foreign names corrects or by referring to someone without even using their name. although this can be solved by asking he person how they pronounce their name, it will often cause issues between you and new staff, or customers who want to give you a positive review.)", "comment_date": "2018-11-12T13:47:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drainakon", "comment_text": "<b>Grabs pop corn can</b><br>&gt; Pop corn can empty<br>Dammit...", "comment_date": "2018-11-12T13:47:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gizno126", "comment_text": "Here\u2019s an idea, let\u2019s take responsibility for our own actions and stop pulling the race card every time something doesn\u2019t go our way.<br><br>Asians actually get rejected from colleges and jobs because of their skin color.
