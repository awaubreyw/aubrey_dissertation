Coping strategies are things you do, or could do, to help you reduce your stress!<br>3. Change your thinking. Most stress is simply about the meaning of stress. Changing your thinking won&#39;t eliminate stress, but it can reduce the &quot;weight&quot; of the stress.<br><br>None of these will make all your stress disappear, but they can help you cope a lot better.

I made it my mission to learn more and now as a health coach, I&#39;m able to work with others to find relief and get the their energy back and health on track. Chronic stress doesn&#39;t have to be (and shouldn&#39;t be) present in your life. Take time to acknowledge what&#39;s causing you to stress out and why. Perception plays a big role.

The golden law of capitalism is profit seeks the lowest cost of labour. Which means<br>a) Employers stagnate wages as best they can and bring cheap labour to the jobs, but if unable<br>b) Employers send the jobs abroad but if unable,<br>c) Automation<br><br>2. Capitalism prevents democracy in 70% of life, which we spend at work. The only choice a worker has is to go to another job where the same top down anti democratic relationship exists.<br><br>3. Under our current system, the few employers are given the right to take the value everyone produces per hour and decide what to do with it with no input from the workers. Those at the top give the worker back a dribble and pocket the rest via large pay increases, dividends and rent.<br><br>4. Employers then hand these wages to institutions called hedge funds who manage the money of the wealthy, some of which the hedge funds lend to banks, who lend to workers, who take the money with a smile as their wages have gone no where fast for 40 years. Effectively, employers globally by proxy have been loaning their workers the wage rises they should have gotten, to be repaid in full with interest. A global hustle that worked well until enough failed to repay that it caused a collapse of capitalism and the symptom of financial crisis.<br><br>5. There is no end in sight to the erosion of the economic conditions of most in the bottom 70% of a given advanced nation. So they break left and right in search of anyone promising change without really understanding just what changes are needed and why few politicians are offering such changes. The left rightly blames capitalism, the centrists say all is fine, the right blames migrants / muslims / jews / insert minority, to deflect blame from capitalism and the media backs the right and centrists up, as do the wealthy who own politicians and media of both sides, simultaneously, in order to distract people from the message of the left, and crush them. Resulting in fascism unchallenged, taking office all over the world.<br><br>6. Everyone is stressed due to the above points, which you can see in increasing suicide rates, increasing child mortality, decreasing life spans, increasing poverty rates, increasing inequality, skyrocketing anti depressant usage, and the occasional drug abuse epidemic, such as opioids.<br><br>7. Capitalism is also incompatible with solving climate change.
