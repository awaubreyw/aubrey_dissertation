Also before this video was even made a large pizza in the U.S.A. went from 20&quot; or more down to what used to me called a small! And now most places have like 2 sizes only and only a 2&quot; difference. Also they now charge a delivery fee which is supposed to mostly go to the driver who already gets paid more without that charge. And then that driver gets all STUPID if they don&#39;t suck free money off you even more in the form of a &quot;tip&quot; which they dis not go out of their way to earn so why even expect it or care for it!?!??!?! The U.S.A. Is the worse place to get pizza now days maybe. I mean all the large pizza places have gross pizza or is super over priced. It is now the standard for them to make all thin crust and call it normal crust. Also they barely put any sauce on there anymore and now they almost all chop the ingredients into disgusting cubes or scrappy bits. Then the more &quot;upscale&quot; places are focused more on poser trends instead of the actual product. So they use real pepperoni instead of spiced salami. Real pepperoni does not work on pizza. They also like to do those pasty pizzas which burn all to hell on the crust and on the bottom and act like that is so good or cool. Then they put random large chunks of stuff that does not work so there is huge gaps when you bite only sauce or nothing. I guess it looked good in a magazine but it was a bad idea in real life. Also fruit NEVER GOES ON PIZZA!!!!
