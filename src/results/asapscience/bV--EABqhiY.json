I wish I could stop them, or at least explain them, but I\u2019ve never been able to break them. <br>1- Being touched. I can not be touched by anyone without panicking. If anyone, even a close friend or parent, tries to touch me, or even just brush against me, I\u2019ll panic. There is only one person I know who I am mostly okay with, and sometimes enjoy, being touched by. I can not give hugs for too long without having to pull away. I\u2019ll get very uncomfortable with even handshakes.<br>2- The elderly. Possibly because I have never been close to any of them on a social level, or maybe because of how handsy they can get, I will get paranoid every time I see an older person. One time a group I was with for the summer had to go to a nursing home, and I had to go with them to make bracelets for them. Even walking to the building from the transport vans was stressful. Getting inside and seeing everyone hooked up to these machines was so much worse. People left and right were either in beds, in wheelchairs, using walkers, or something else, and they were all elderly. I start to panic. Then they put me with a blind woman to make bracelets with, even though they knew I can\u2019t move my hands correctly with most tasks. I\u2019m over there trying to help her and be as nice as I can, but I\u2019m struggling severely. So she was over there, touching my hands with hers, I didn\u2019t know what to do, and it scares me just thinking about it. <br><br>Now everyone thinks I\u2019m an awful person for not wanting to help out with the elderly, give hugs or handshakes, or not wanting to meet their parents or grandparents.", "comment_date": "2018-03-28T10:25:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Iris", "comment_text": "I&#39;m afraid of heights ,spiders and needles ;_; OH GAWD", "comment_date": "2018-03-27T07:22:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wimlet", "comment_text": "Oh no, I&#39;m feeling cloture phobic, better hide in the closet", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T23:49:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sama Osmani", "comment_text": "So riding a roller coaster can kill me?

I&#39;m also middle aged, and missed my chance to get married and have kids. I lost my career and will never work again. I have no purpose, no hope and basically have to waste the days away while fighting off general panic over nothing. Because of the impact anxiety has had on me, I reached a tipping point- nothing really matters anymore since I can&#39;t get back my youth, so the things that I once would have done to combat the impact the anxiety has on me- eating well, exercising, etc.- I have given up on. I mean, if you&#39;re not going to have kids or a wife or a career, is there really a reason to go out of your way to avoid a heart attack at 50? Not really. It&#39;s like slow suicide, basically- and it all stems from being scared.\u00a0<br><br>The worst part is, anxiety is not helped by the amount of knowledge you have toward the disease, or your general IQ, or other coping techniques you learn. Everything you learn/know goes out the window as soon as the next panic wave sets in and makes you once again feel like you&#39;re having a heart attack or stroke.
