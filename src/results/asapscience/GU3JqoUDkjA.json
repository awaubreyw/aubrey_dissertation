Low to zero testosterone causes increased fat gain especially in the abdomen, and a vicious cycle of further low testosterone, making fat loss near impossible. It hinders the ability to gain any lean mass and can make muscle breakdown/atrophy easy. Can cause osteoporosis of the bone. Mentally it will cause depression, anxiety, lack of drive or determination, mood swings, fatigue (from prolactin) you&#39;re also programming yourself to get reward hormones with no effort, and tricking yourself into being in a time of plenty. Plus while there&#39;s little no testosterone, what little there is may be turned into estrogen. It can also make hair fall out easily as it increases sebum/dandruff and premature telogen phase of a follicles cycle. This means thin hair until it grows again, or potential premature hair loss in those whose mother&#39;s father had balding.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU3JqoUDkjA&amp;t=1m00s\">1:00</a> this is because masturbation nullifies androgen receptors, the method of treatment for prostate cancer are anti-androgens.", "comment_date": "2022-05-31T15:26:40Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "Chrishagen", "comment_text": "Polishing the pearl \ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2022-05-28T09:11:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary A Winthrope", "comment_text": "You all need help.", "comment_date": "2022-05-28T08:13:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JawaKing", "comment_text": "Honestly it\u2019s ok to masturbate.

Yea it doesn&#39;t necessarily take your testosterone on weakens your physical legs or abilities.  But for men it takes will power to control those desires and keep oneself from spilling seed after some time;     So what it does do it strengthens the willpower of a man.  When someone is fighting, it all goes down to being a test of wills, usually someone equally matched goes down to who has the strongest will to win,  Now its not 100% always the case, there&#39;s timing, speed, technique, power, and etc.  But in any combat the test of will is what&#39;s really being tried and tested. \r<br>So again, willpower which is someone spiritual legs, is what&#39;s being strengthens by not giving in to a FAP.\r<br>\r<br>Now this is just looking at it from willpower standpoint.  \r<br>There&#39;s also the guilt of disappointment, when one commits these acts of an imagination; knowing that one gives himself in to something that&#39;s not real. It&#39;s also degrades oneself morally, because its not right, and a moral conscious tells us that itself.\r<br>It encourages and influences anxiety. How? Because when we give into impulses, subconsciously we&#39;re telling ourselves that we cant stop internal impulses, loosening ones own ability to control what he wants to feel, thereby when feelings of fear or apprehension enters our thoughts, our own mind doesn&#39;t think it can control it. \r<br>And there&#39;s really much more to this, but I&#39;ll stop there.", "comment_date": "2021-09-28T17:58:56Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "empty", "comment_text": "Lawyer:<br>to prove that my client wasn&#39;t involved in this crime I would like to show his browser search history from that day<br><br>Me: <br>I confess the crime", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T21:41:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gezus T.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it! God bless you and feel free to ask me any question about this.<br><br>Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU3JqoUDkjA&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a>\u00a0New International Version

It elaborates the importance of semen preservation in human body and negative effects of wasting semen. Actually this book is based on the spiritual discourse of a reputed Indian saint Asharamji Bapu. He says in your life till now you have checked with wasting semen, you have long life please try just one year with preserving semen then you will know the meaning of life, you will know the difference. You will know the reason behind the successful personality. Actually life is experiment, if you don&#39;t succeed with one way you should have to try with another way. I am going to write some important excerpts from his book. You can study it, think it. It is in your own hand to follow this or not, because life is yours and nobody has to do nothing with your personal life, but always it is beneficial to make the habit of thinking from the flip side.\r<br>\r<br>      VITAL ENERGY IS THE ESSENCE OF YOUR BODY PRESERVATION OF IT IS KEY TO LONGEVITY OF YOUTHFULNESS.\r<br>\r<br>THE SECRET OF ETERNAL YOUTH:\r<br>\r<br>All worldly actions are performed through the body. If the body is weak and sickly the mind becomes similarly afflicted. To attain success in any enterprise, it is essential that both body and the mind are healthy and function in harmony and synchronicity. The unbridled gratification of desires over the years drains away mental, vital and physical energies. Even if such a person posses a strong will power, his body would not assist him. On the other hand, sadly, today&#39;s youth, in spite of having the physical ability to proceed on the path of success, are distracted by the objects of sense of indulgence and fall a prey to carnal pleasures. Not appreciating the prime importance of sexual energy, they recklessly fritter it away through sensual indulgence, a folly that would later become a matter of life-long repentance for them.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>       Many young people, who are badly perturbed, come to me for guidance and help. They open up their hearts before me. They confess that through uncontrolled sexual indulgence they have lost mental, vital and physical energies with the result that their mind becomes sluggish, will power is lost and body becomes languid and sickly. They live a miserable lie seeing no way to redemption. They lament that, for them, self-realisation will remain a distant dream and they have somehow to drag along the remaining part of the life, aimlessly.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>              Throughout history, great sages, saints, and seers have stressed the paramount importance of celibacy for leading a noble and sublime life. A person lacking in self.restraint and self-discipline can never make progress in any worthwhile endeavor nor can he be of any service to the society. Such degenerated societies disintegrate in the long run.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Lord Shiva to goddess parvati,\r<br>&quot;O Parvati! What is there on this earth which cannot be accomplished if one has control over his sexual fluid?&quot; That is, all powers reside at the divine feet of the Enlightened Urdhvareta (one who is able to sublimate his sexual energy through the practice of yoga). In fact, Siddhis (divine powers) become his facile servants. Such a Sadhaka can attain Self-Realisation within a short span of time. Even the gods (deities) have attained immortality through Brahmacharya&quot;.\r<br>\r<br>PRESERVATION OF SEMEN GIVES LIFE:\r<br>                \r<br>         Semen is found in a subtle state in all the cells of the body. Just as the buttermilk is thinned after the butter is removed, so also, semen is thinned by its wastage. The more the wastage of semen, the more the body deteriorates and weakens. The preservation of semen is the secret of good health and longevity, and of all success in the physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual planes. He who has even a little bit of  semen preservation will tide over a crisis of any disease very easily. It is also true that one who preserves semen striclty is usually not afflicted by any disease.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>After Dhanvantari, founder of Ayurveda (Herbal Medical Science) taught all details about this science, his students enquired about its keynote (essence). In the reply, master asserted,&quot; I tell you that semen is truly a precious jewel. It is the one most effective medicine-nectar indeed-, which destroys diseases, decay and death.

It doesn&#39;t reinforce the self-mastery that is necessary for a perpetual gift of self. Because the main objective is to ejaculate, sooner than later, it doesn&#39;t strengthen a person&#39;s capacity to climax with the other person, simultaneously. The attitude can then become &quot;I&#39;ll get mine and then you&#39;ll get yours.&quot; One of the benefits of refraining from masturbation is that you actually possess a self-control that is a pre-requisite to making of yourself, a complete gift, to another person (spirit-soul-body).

Could you guys do a video about Nofap? The initial goal of NoFap, was to relieve men of pornography addiction, which seems to be a noble goal, mainly after high speed internet and HD porn became available. However doing recent years a lot of people took control over the NoFap community and filled it with nonsense pseudoscience. Not only pseudoscience but old-fashion moralism as well. These guys claim a lot of non-scientific stuff. one of them even told me that scientific evidence doesn&#39;t matter since NoFap saved his marriage, and this is all people need to know.   This movement does cherry-picking with science, Publishing only material that corroborate their ideals. For instance they seem to know very little about brain chemistry, they focus only on simple things like the dopamine cycle, forgetting about prolactin, oxitocin and endorphins, and also claiming that if you do not ejaculate, your body has the ability to recycle what your reproductive system does not &quot;send out&quot;. That seems contradictory if you consider nocturnal emission and daytime spontaneous ejaculation, a couple of things that happen to me if I stay away from masturbation for a week or so (10 days sometimes), though it was far more common when I was younger.... If you see those NoFap Reddit topics, they even claim you can develop new cognitive abilities after 30 days or so without touching yourself. This is already too far gone. They invoke even transmutation of vital energy, resurrect the theories of Wilhelm Reich, and other embarrassing stuff for people that love scientific and the search for the truth (or as close as we can get to it). Well, thar is it. I totally support therapy and group therapy against pornography addiction, however keeping it inside scientific boundaries.

It&#39;s like a drug addiction. You can&#39;t stop, so you look for ways that are more hardcore. You keep doing it &amp; it gets worse. You get to a point were you don&#39;t see woman as woman anymore! You start to see them as objects. You become enslaved &amp; that&#39;s all you think about. As it grows, you realize it&#39;s not enough anymore. You want a real woman. You now have a #1 priority: you do whatever you have to do to get them in bed. Before you know it, you have a baby. But you didn&#39;t mean to have the kid, you just wanted the pleasure. So the kid grows up fatherless.

Not to mention the fact that most (if not all) men will be masturbating to porn, which can mess with a person&#39;s views towards sex. I don&#39;t think masturbating is bad but I do think that blanket statements which say that masturing is good are frankly idiotic, which is even worse coming from a &#39;science&#39; channel. There are also plenty of spiritual disciplines that believe that ejaculations drains a man and that certain types of clitoral orgasms drain a woman. I don&#39;t think this is as clear cut as masturbation is good, or bad. But I think people (men mostly) should err on the side of caution if they&#39;re masturbating more than three times a week. I can think of about a dozen &#39;nofap&#39; stories where reclusive young men manage to actually go out and live life because they&#39;re not spending all day watching hardcore porn. Oh, and if you want to exercise your PVC muscles then just do that.

Ejaculation is just the most physical component of it, and there my friend is the key to EVOLUTION OR INVOLUTION &quot;During the sexual act, our seminal substance descends into its corresponding cavity... When this seminal substance is spilled, we then lose millions of Christic solar atoms. Instantaneously, these solar atoms are substituted by millions of demonic atoms, which enter into the Brahmanic cord by means of the contractions of the genital orgasmic movements. Thus, if we strengthen the three vital airs of pure Akasha by means of our willpower, then the mixing of Akasha with these demonic atoms, which were collected from the infernos of the human being, result in the awakening of the luciferic serpent (Kundabuffer). Hence, this is a negative and demonic way... Accordingly, with the awakening of tantric powers, the inferior quaternary ends by divorcing itself from the Divine Triad. This is how such a quaternary converts itself into a perverse demon of the abyss. The sexual organs collect satanic atoms of the secret enemy with the genital orgasmic contraction during the seminal ejaculation (tantric orgasm), which is advised by the black magician Omar Cherenzi Lind and by the lost and tenebrous Parsival Krumm-Heller. Therefore, when these atoms attempt to ascend upwardly towards Urania, they then are violently rejected by the Akashic breath, which throws them downwards towards the coccyx. This sexual practice awakens the Muladhara negatively and causes a certain atom of the secret enemy to enter into activity. This atom then exercises control over the Kundalini, directing it downwards towards the submerged worlds of consciousness, thus forming the famous (Kundabuffer) tail of demons. This is how the disciples of these black magicians separate themselves from the Divine Triad, Atman- Buddhi-Manas. This is how they convert themselves into tantric personalities of the abyss.&quot; - Samael Aun Weor, Igneous Rose", "comment_date": "2015-09-16T20:54:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DarkDynasty", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know why people call me and many others who don&#39;t masturbate liars.

And after a while of doing it so much there comes a point where you simply cant get off as easily even though you want because again at this point you need it just to balance your brian chemicals.

Also, a lot of adult women with families hardly ever have any time to themselves due to working and caring for their children and the household, so they simply don&#39;t have any time for it!<br><br>Additionally, depression can reduce sex drive in anyone (men, too!).

I think the problem in our modern world however is that masturbation is usually coupled with watching pornography, and that&#39;s where the dangers are. Many people masturbate to pornography from a very early age and before ever having sex, and your brain begins to associate sex with staring at other people have sex... not to mention, in high-speed video with multiple tabs open... so, many variations and types/fetishes all within a short amount of time. While you may reap some physiological benefits, psychologically you are wiring your brain to associate these things with real life sex. And can very well be the explanation behind the rise in erectile/arousal difficulties in both men and women. Possibly even infidelity or growing bored of the person you are romantically committed to. <br><br>When you masturbate, yes, you release dopamine in your brain. However, coupled with the excitement during your orgasm at your favorite porn scene, you flood your brain with high levels of dopamine which in turn damage your dopamine receptors and leave you needing more sexually (many porn watchers begin to need more taboo porn to get off)... and more out of life in general. This is why so many people feel depressed and bored with average life, and are also frequent masturbators who don&#39;t pursure real-life relationships as much as they should to be optimally healthy. <br><br>When you have sex, you release dopamine as well, BUT you also release other chemicals that regulate the dopamine so it doesn&#39;t burn out your receptors, and you also release chemicals that help you to create a bond to your sexual partner. The danger now lies when you&#39;ve trained your brain to achieve arousal by watching other people have sex, then you have sex with a person. There is a chance that when you have sex with that person, in a way you are really just masturbating with their sex organ because the only way you can perform/get off is to imagine you in third person having sex with them or imagine what the scenario looks like as if it were in porn. You also run the risk of being unable to fully commit to your partner sexually in a monogamous relationship because you no longer excrete enough of the bonding chemicals you&#39;re supposed to during sex, and in general are really only aroused by the abnormal standards in porn.<br><br>So with that said, I find masturbation to be healthy... but only in moderation of frequency and length, and without pornography. Females seem to be able to do this easier than males, probably because males rely heavily on visual stimulus for sexual arousal. For males, this can be quite difficult. Perhaps not spending a long time watching porn and having your brain bathe in dopamine for hours at a time would be better, or maybe not masturbating as much in order to harbor those natural instincts to seek out a mate and actually have sex. Avoiding a tight grip on the penis shaft would help avoid issues of erectile difficulty when penetrating another person&#39;s orifice. For females, staying away from high-powered sex toys would help keep nerves sensitive to regular stimulation during intercourse.
