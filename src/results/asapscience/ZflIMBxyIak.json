For example if there weren&#39;t shadows, or you didn&#39;t see the represented pattern of the checkerboard. If you take the shadows first your brain automatically assumes and makes you believe the color underneath the shadow is actually a lighter shade, its one of the reasons we aren&#39;t able to comprehend the shade as the same as the darker one. Then thinking about the pattern, our brains when learning things are similar to some computer programs in the sense that they are able to detect patterns and make connections based on those observations. I think its kinda similar to how when we look at something, disregarding the light levels, things look a certain way as they are supposed to, or rather how you&#39;ve made the connections. Diving deeper into the neurology, the action potential fired when seeing something after recognizing patterns and context takes your previous encounters with things like this hit and so what you see really depends on those factors. This is just my guess based on what I know about these things :)", "comment_date": "2021-10-28T21:56:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pentagon", "comment_text": "LOL i tried it with my photoshop, i checked the color hues AND THEY ARE THE SAME!!! <br><br><br>I can confirm this video is legit XD", "comment_date": "2021-09-15T02:43:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Red Yoshi", "comment_text": "I was 5 when this video was made so if I watched it when I was 5 I would have probably called you a liar", "comment_date": "2021-08-28T04:39:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "RINZLER", "comment_text": "Can this &quot;amalgamate&quot; nature of our eyes make straight lines bend?", "comment_date": "2021-08-11T05:12:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "{\u00f8ph\u00e9eb\u00f8p}", "comment_text": "Wow I don&#39;t trust it", "comment_date": "2021-08-08T23:39:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CreativityZero", "comment_text": "It had seen this phenomenon before, but, you know, it sounds a little far-fetched.", "comment_date": "2021-08-04T02:00:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Qiqi Qiu", "comment_text": "Bind blowing video.
