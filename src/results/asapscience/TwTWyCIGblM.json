Know what messed up my body image? That dann teacher in 1st grade that wanted to send me home because &quot;You&#39;re looking sick.&quot; I wasn&#39;t sick. It was just how I looked. About the age 12 I started to wear super heavy make up to hide my pale skin because I was afraid of looking sick. It took me years to understand that I don&#39;t need to do that in order to look healthy. People just have to come to terms with me being very pale. I felt that my knees were ugly for years because some PE teacher asked if I am alright because he thought that my knees looked weird somehow. I still feel uncomfortable wearing pants with holes or shorts. And I had the same thing with so many other things about my body. But mostly those comments were made by people I trusted. Like doctors, friends and teachers. Yes, even teachers who asked my father if I am suffering from an eating dissorder because they felt like I was too thin. I didn&#39;t suffer from an eating dissorder. I am just a naturally thin person. <br><br>Social Media and TV and stuff can be super bad for your body image. But it&#39;s not the only thing and sadly most studies only focus on that because it is easier to blame some Model instead of looking at the people around you. <br><br>Another thing: since my mother is a psychatrist, I never really got to watch TV shows with unrealistic body images and I wasn&#39;t really allowed to play with Barbie and whatever. She considered it to be bad for my body image. So most of those factors weren&#39;t as present in my life, especially during the first few years. And I still had some major problems about my body. And as I said, mostly because of comments from people whom I trusted and as a child looked up to. And not bad or mean comments either. Those people were usually worried. But if your teacher asks your parents if you&#39;re sick because you look different, it makes you feel like absolut shit. So people should seriously start to consider that and maybe just stop judging kids for how they look. If you feel like someone may look a little sick, stop saying &quot;You look sick.&quot; Just ask &quot;How are you?&quot; Because chances are that the person always looks like that.", "comment_date": "2019-12-12T05:29:56Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "UczuciaTM", "comment_text": "The stupid thing is, when i see people with my own damn body type im like &quot;yea she a cutie&quot; but me having my body?
