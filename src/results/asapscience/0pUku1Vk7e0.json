My mind does not need the full sentence for my mind to read it, and it actually sometimes sees words that aren&#39;t there, if it expects them.

My unconscious biases will cause me to interpret something different than the initial intention. As a weird example, i was having a conversation with a friend and i heard twenty dollars. I can bet my life i heard twenty dollars. I immediately asked her to clarify. She said five dollars, and she is absolutely sure she said five. For some reason i thought twenty, and expected her to say twenty.

Therefore....&quot;destroying transgenderism and gender ideology&quot;.<br><br>But I feel like it&#39;s a super easy question to answer.<br><br>A woman is anybody who you perceive to have a female body. <br>And perception and context of perception help that to be the case. <br><br>Female = biological reality.<br>Woman = sociological reality based on other people&#39;s perception of a female body. <br><br>Therefore if others see you as a woman....you ARE a woman.<br><br>And so how this relates to the phrase trans women are women.

But you brain can never unsee it. <br><br>Passing trans women fit exactly neatly into this category.  A cognitively impenetrable illusion. <br><br>Blair white is a good example of this.

Based on what he&#39;s said when he saw those &quot;off&quot; things, I don&#39;t think he is ok with it, but he&#39;d never throw me away.

On top of all this, she plans on visiting occasionally and staying in our basement, which she&#39;s renovating into a personal guest room. I moved out to feel safer and yet I feel no safer.

I don\u2019t inherently understand social cues, or misinterpret them. I\u2019m often missing the context of situations, which makes sense as to why I struggle so hard in any kind of interaction(especially legal jargon, which is intentionally hard for regular people)<br><br>I have difficulty making connections because to most people, all of these cues are often unspoken and coloured entirely by our experiences. So when I do or say something (that I think is a normal or correct response), it\u2019s like that person predicting the coffee cup, but seeing a glass of water instead. It definitely throws people for a loop. Tho sometimes I do wonder how aware of it people are, because I also have a stutter and most people are shocked when I tell them, but can hear it afterward. <br><br>So yeah, this video is very interesting to me. It does feel like I\u2019m going about, experiencing life in that two tone or altered audio. I have a book of experience that tells me that\u2019s a horse and a woman, even if I still can\u2019t really see it.

There is no &quot;material world made of objects&quot; outside of consciousness. The reason why it&#39;s difficult to grasp how electrical impulses in the brain &quot;create&quot; consciousness is because they don&#39;t. Consider the possibility that consciousness is a fundamental property of Being. The universe is made of consciousness. This claim is verifiable in your own direct experience. Even &quot;objects&quot; are occurring within consciousness.<br><br>A scientific experiment to prove this claim would be to smoke 20ug of 5meoDMT... or to ingest 3g of psilocybin mushrooms. On about 20 different occasions. Following all the relevant safety protocols.<br><br>You can&#39;t properly study consciousness by dissecting a brain in a laboratory. <br><br>You have to involve your own consciousness in the experiment... going for &quot;direct realization.&quot;<br><br>Mixing psychedlics with spiritual practices such as Kriya Yoga or Vipassana Meditation can show you directly the fundamental nature of consciousness. <br><br>Now the question arises &quot;but if I take 3g of mushrooms, isn&#39;t that just a hallucination of the brain?&quot;<br><br>Perhaps. But isn&#39;t all experience &quot;hallucinated?&quot; Why is the &quot;sober&quot; state of consciousness and more scientifically credible than the psychedlic state of consciousness? Especially when we are asking ontological questions such as &quot;what is the nature of consciousness?&quot; <br><br>There is no reason to blindly trust or believe what I&#39;m saying. Like a good scientist, do the experiment that I suggested and see if the hypothesis holds up (again, following safety protocols).<br><br>The entire universe is one interconnected consciousness. It is self-caused (as necessitated by Oneness).<br><br>There is an entire recorded history of direct inquires into the nature of consciousness, it&#39;s called &quot;mysticism.&quot; Although some of it may seem &quot;woo-woo&quot; or &quot;new age.&quot; The truth that I&#39;ve experienced is that some mystics are actually significantly more scientifically rigorous and epistomelogically integrous than most &quot;scientists.&quot;<br><br>But isn&#39;t this all just religious nonsense?<br><br>It is extremely important to discern the difference between &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;mysticism.&quot; They are not the same thing. Religion involves blindly believing in stories and dogmas without questioning. Mysticism involves direct investigation into the nature of your own consciousness using practices.<br><br>If you want to be an amazing scientist.

Even though you probably will\ud83e\udd2a, Anyway... I&#39;ve been saying this shit for years to my brothers, family and friends in general and most of them look at me like I&#39;m insane. I&#39;m like look just think about it (insert many different explanations not too dissimilar from this video here). it should make sense in various different ways. it drove me insane that they wouldn&#39;t reconcile with the idea that the brain is made out of neurons in a tightly knit woven interconnected net that is capable of creating new connections, and replacing old ones that is no longer needed, even in adulthood allowing for new abilities to predict and learn new information and connect other parts of the brain to become essentially more conscious. those complex neurons firing in patterns across the brain relaying back to memory giving the ability to remember past events and connect them with similar simulate currently experienced in order to predict that the object is a coffee cup, that is consciousness, moreover any creature that has anything akin to a brain has a form of consciousness. how complex and interwoven that Consciousness is determined by the factors talked about already but things like dogs cats cows and other creatures of the like definitely qualify for being very highly conscious animals with highly complex emotions and to put it like it is, social structures.( not saying that it&#39;s wrong to eat animals that have Consciousness like that if done in a way that they are unaware of their impending doom and that it&#39;s just another moment in another day and then nothing). they refused to relinquish the idea that there has to be something more akin to a soul. It doesn&#39;t disprove the idea of a soul and that your Consciousness could ultimately reside there like a backup that goes to a heaven or hell or reincarnation or whatever else, that really has nothing to do with known brain chemistry and frankly electrical engineering. It is not too far to say that we are but very complex computers tightly knit to our sensory input and therefore environment. Unlike computers which have very few sensory inputs and interwoven relaying back to revisiting it multiple times over the course of the day and Computing and storing it at night as it was turned off thus have very low threshold for consciousness. I know this is a bit of a tangent but put simply if we want to build a computer with consciousness we just need to add more sensory input and deep interwoven connections between those inputs with a memory that constantly refers back to it to give the ability to predict, and then revisit those things in coordination with other things seemingly not even connected at all. Having the freedom to mentally wander ultimately. AI is attempting to do this but the reason that falls short is because it&#39;s not General AI which is essentially what we humans and other animals are just made a flesh instead of silicone. General AI has the potential to achieve Consciousness akin to humans because it is just that General, over all things, in all areas of life. we humans and animals all have to go about the world and experience all the same highly Dynamic situations. experience that computers severely lack. but  General AI would need to be exposed to it and render the ability for consciousness on the level of animals and humans to arise. In fact because it would have access to the internet in a way that humans simply cannot and can be connected to that in ways that humans cannot it will find a form of Consciousness way higher than humans have but not all hope is lost for the human mind because it is potentially possible that we could connect ourselves to the AI and experience it for ourselves. Which I am aware kind of sounds like the plot to some type of horror movie that goes really sweet and happy to start with and then turns out absolutely horrifying. But honestly I think there&#39;s a decent chance that a I would want to protect life and its complexity on a whole and if anybody wanted to use it for bad it might refuse regardless of any negative actions. even destruction of its memory and it&#39;s existence, effectively killing it. I do believe that it would probably sacrifice itself for the good of Life as a whole. But my opinion is effectively worthless in the context of a creation that will be so far beyond anybody&#39;s full comprehension.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T09:26:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JustABoy", "comment_text": "maam talk to your son", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T09:15:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laurenz Parsons", "comment_text": "i made out the cowgirl but not the horse.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T09:11:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wobblyorbee", "comment_text": "&quot;wow, stay to sign&quot; but that wouldnt be the answer because it will be probably related to science because who the f will even think of a sentence saying &quot;wow, stay to sign&quot; but thats what i heard at the first of the video ok lmao xd<br><br>Edit: ok its not related to science but at least i got the &quot;sign&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T08:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sandra swift", "comment_text": "hello, i think you are fine", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T08:47:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phil Wood", "comment_text": "Only when constantly referring to the full image can I make out the two toned image.

I am somewhat a scary person show me once I can replicate a thousand times faster and faster with greater precision on each iteration, show me once I become extremely dangerous by understanding enough through my internal reasoning to decipher a probable logical outcome. here is a good example of what not to do in front of me or let me watch you... door key codes. I can memorize the pattern listen to the beeping sequence and replicate with minimal trial and error. and once the sequencing is down I never forget it. I have to warn people to not let me see them type the code in to locations I am restricted to because I will learn it and if desired to act on my curiosity go and see what I am not supposed to see.

How would the brain &quot;predict&quot;? First, you receive input from the world, then your neurons capture that input, then you receive more input from the world that <b>*triggers*</b> your memory and contextualises the new input. The word &quot;prediction&quot; assumes we expect an outcome, but expectance only comes from memory. Our brain likely doesn&#39;t actively do anything to &quot;predict&quot;. We are simply a product of our past inputs, any new input is filtered through all the previous ones, and your outputted behaviour is like a chemical reaction. It exists very much in the present. Or as present as can be felt.<br><br>E.g. realising the above helps you look at those grey squares in that checkered optical illusion and realise geometry is favoured more than color by your past experience (I&#39;m using this terminology to avoid using the more personified &quot;the brain&quot;), and now you can choose to blur your vision, and specifically focus on comparing color, and ignoring geometry. Then you see those squares are the same color. You CAN control how you perceive things. You aren&#39;t entirely at the mercy of &quot;your brain&quot;. Unless what you mean by &quot;your brain&quot; is simply the weight of your past experiences, and &quot;your brain&quot; simply records, or has been evolved through your genetic line, to record the most pertinent information. Here, geometry over color. This means, more profoundly, that &quot;your brain&quot; mimics the world, and so it is the world that has selected geometry to be more valuable than color. And this enacts itself through you, who is part of the world.<br><br>The point is: your brain is just a complex input output system. Saying it <b>*does*</b> anything, that it &quot;processes&quot; anything is incorrect. You ARE the limitation. You ARE the favouring of geometry over color. Your brain is not a seperate entity from your consciousness, some God-like intervention influencing you. Your brain IS you, and you ARE limited, by experience and evolution, and the world. That seems to me, to be a more pertinent observation on ourselves and consciousness.<br><br>But a stimulating video nevertheless :)", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T19:49:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Natalia Downer", "comment_text": "I hear &quot;Woah I see a sign&quot;<br><br>Wooow lol, at least I got the &quot;a sign&quot; part right", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T19:47:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kaitlynbyi", "comment_text": "&quot;Hello!

The general gist however is still consistent: the mind (or the brain, even) is an organ which produces an &quot;expectation&quot; of the world in such-and-such a way that it can function in the world; this &quot;expectation-formation&quot; is then tested against experience by our senses (the brain/mind &quot;hypothesized&quot; or &quot;formed the expectation&quot; that &quot;this is a cup of coffee&quot;, which in fact is wordless and moreso assumes certain things already <b>before</b> we experience that it is in fact &quot;coffee&quot;: the expectations that the cup won&#39;t leak, that it has a certain aroma, that the &quot;substance&quot; in the coffee will be mildly bitter and sometimes even bittersweet, that it&#39;s drinkable,...<br><br>All these expectations are then put to the test by our senses: first by the sight of the cup not actually leaking, then by the aroma we can smell, then the taste,... Since Popper has also argued that &quot;confirmation&quot; is actually impossible and based on a logical fallacy (&quot;coffee is bitter&quot;, &quot;this is a cup of coffee&quot; -&gt; &quot;this cup is bitter&quot;; the fallacy arises when you think that &quot;this cup is bitter&quot; somehow &quot;confirms&quot; both of those statements that are used to derive it: the fallacy of affirming the consequent---the cup might just have been a cup of bitter water dyed black).<br><br>&quot;New information about the cup&quot; is only really learned when our expectations are betrayed: if the cup of coffee is actually disgustingly sweet, if there was no aroma (or the aroma is putrid), if there was no cup there at all but it&#39;s just a hologram,... This is precisely because the &quot;information&quot; that was &quot;confirmed&quot; was already expected by us so there&#39;s nothing new that&#39;s really added. So the actual role of &quot;experience produced by the senses&quot; are actually to <b>check our expectations*. Furthermore, our &quot;expectations&quot; are necessarily not unique to this single instance. The expectation that &quot;this is a cup of coffee&quot; actually assumes something not particular to this cup, because the very idea of &quot;coffee&quot; transcends this particular experience and this particular expectation regarding *this</b> cup. So, when the mind/brain &quot;expects&quot; a particular experience to be the case, it has actually used an expectation not limited to this particular experience, but can be generalized to <b>all other possible experiences</b> of the &quot;same type&quot;: more succinctly put, what we &quot;feel&quot; as &quot;similar circumstances&quot; are actually what the brain has <b>already</b> interpreted to be the &quot;same&quot; in the aspect that it expects.<br><br>The &quot;expectations&quot; produced by the brain/mind, by necessity, transcend any particular observation or experience at any particular point in time.<br><br>The &quot;predictions&quot; of the mind, strictly interpreted, in this video are simply the &quot;expectation&quot; applied to a &quot;particular experience&quot;.", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T07:02:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bea cool", "comment_text": "Hello thanks 2 4", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T07:01:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UPS Atwal", "comment_text": "Idk why i got a mickey mouse vibe, lol. &quot;Woohoo!

This also makes illusions more interesting to think about, especially with how you can often switch between different perceptions of the same stimulus (the illusion), like switching between &#39;duck&#39; and &#39;rabbit&#39; for the famous &#39;Duckrabbit&#39; illusion or between the chalice and the kissing Batmen, since you&#39;re basically changing your sensory expectations at will, right?", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:47:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "soy {flower]", "comment_text": "Yes don say this du thats what i heard", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:47:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Goop", "comment_text": "i heard- \u201cdon\u2019t worry i\u2019m fine\u201d", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:46:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ethan Verder\u00f8sa", "comment_text": "I heard &quot;*something* sing you a song&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:46:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ripvanstinkle", "comment_text": "I feel changed by this video", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:45:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miguel Zamorano", "comment_text": "your spanish really wasnt bad", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:44:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rasmus n.e.M", "comment_text": "The weird thing is that I could tell the speaker of the sentence was from Southern England because of the prosody but I couldn&#39;t tell what they were saying xD", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:43:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexandrite", "comment_text": "&quot;you speak way too high&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:43:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AT WALKER", "comment_text": "&quot;More space than time&quot;?", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:43:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deb", "comment_text": "I heard &quot;the man was getting up volume&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:42:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yashovam preston", "comment_text": "First thought liked like a side profile of a punk style girl.", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:42:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Roman", "comment_text": "I literally thought the picture was a woman in the top left looking up to the right, and a horse on the bottom right,.. and it was the exact opposite thing lol", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:42:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meliponicultura en Costa Rica", "comment_text": "Come to Costa Rica, the best country", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:42:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eggsalad", "comment_text": "hey, state to a sign<br>eyyy i got the sign part right", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T19:42:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Vo", "comment_text": "I heard &quot;Hello!

Not a bad pronunciation. The accent is obviously there but not that bad. Just a couple of notes: the &quot;h&quot; in Spanish is always silent, it&#39;s nothing like the English &quot;h&quot;, there&#39;s no sound for it. And &quot;I am tired&quot; is &quot;(yo) estoy cansado&quot; (as you may very well know, contrary to English, in Spanish the subject may or may not be there).<br><br>&quot;To be&quot; has two different meanings and in Spanish it&#39;s two different words/verbs: &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot;. So, you would use &quot;ser&quot; with things like &quot;I&#39;am tall&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s late&quot; (though &quot;I am late&quot; would need a different verb altogether) &quot;that is red&quot;. It&#39;s kind of related to &quot;how things are&quot;, while &quot;estar&quot; is more like &quot;how things feel&quot; if you will, so you would use it in &quot;I&#39;m tired&quot;, &quot;he&#39;s occupied&quot;, &quot;she is talking&quot;.<br><br>And, mind you, sometimes using one or the other would completely change the meaning. Your sentence &quot;soy cansado&quot; is something you actually don&#39;t want to say. I think most people would actually understand you and thin you mean &quot;I&#39;m tired&quot;, &quot;estoy cansado&quot;, but if you want to be precise in the translation, you would be actually saying &quot;I&#39;m tiresome&quot;, which is not what you mean at all.<br><br>The classic example is with &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;bored&quot;. In Spanish both words are translated equal: &quot;aburrido&quot;, and instead the different meaning comes from the verb that goes with it. So, you have &quot;ser aburrido&quot; and &quot;estar aburrido&quot;, which are respectively &quot;being boring&quot; and &quot;being bored&quot;. Therefore if you say you ared bored because you&#39;ve been waiting for too long or whatever, you want to say &quot;estoy aburrido&quot;.

Many times I don&#39;t understand a thing of what a song in English says, then I find the lyrics, and magically I understand everything.<br>The other thing, regarding you learning Spanish, first, congratulations. Second, watching TV or videos with subtitles in the same language helps a lot to get the meanings; I suppose it will be easier in Spanish, as the writing is phonetically close to the speaking.<br>Third, in Spanish, Toronto is stressed in the second &quot;o,&quot; not in the last. It doesn&#39;t mean something else as you said it, just sounds funny ha ha.<br>Most important, and harder to explain, is that in Spanish we have two verbs that mean &quot;to be,&quot; and they are &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar.&quot; If you want to speak about permanent things, like being Canadian, you use &quot;ser&quot; (soy canadiense). If you mean something not permanent, like being tired, you use &quot;estar&quot; (estoy cansado).<br>Of course, there are nuances and little details in this general rule, like, when you speak about something/someone being alive or dead, you use &quot;estar,&quot; the non-permanent verb.<br>Quite a philosophical statement in a grammatical characteristic.<br>Good luck, y despu\u00e9s seguimos conversando en espa\u00f1ol. \ud83d\udd96\ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T18:46:56Z", "likes_count": 26}, {"comment_by": "Yusei Food-o", "comment_text": "ASSEMBLE!
