The only Covid is the one in your head there\u2019s no such thing. If there was a pandemic which there is not. We would all be dead right now and the reason I say that is because our body is like a sponge. The pores in our body would absorb the problem in the air and you would die from that. The only thing that would protect you is a suit called a hazmat suit. Our bodies are biological and we live off of the pollen in the world. Our immune system is built up strong by rejecting different pollens in the air and that\u2019s how we stay strong and fit. If any of you people were alive and kids 40 years ago and you watched anything about any type of pandemic or any type of disease. You will remember that they always wore a hazmat suit to protect themselves from getting the problem that was in the air. So as far as it goes you\u2019re being fed a lie the mask that you wear collect your bad bacteria. Your body goes into hypertension and your immune system is lowered. As you keep wearing the mask your immune system keeps dropping lower and lower. As your immune system gets lower and you go home and take your mask off the pollen in the air gives you a regular cold and sometimes your system can\u2019t handle it no more because your immune system is so low. Doctors are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to say that there is this pandemic. Hospitals are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to say that you have this pandemic and if you die by the pandemic they receive even more money. So you gotta think about this almost 60 years ago we had a bunch of people having children and they were called the baby boomers. The government was happy because there was a lot of people being born and that means a lot of money in their pocket for taxes. Now all the baby boomers are all getting to the age of retirement. So the government decided we\u2019re gonna give back all the money we got from them so now we have to kill them. There is your pandemic it is a man-made lie. Now the reason I know all this stuff is because I am an OSHA instructor and I teach safety one hour out of my class is only about mask. The mask are only hurting you when a person works on the job in an eight hour day they wear a mask for two hours if they need it they take a break they throw that mask away and get a new one. So every time they have a break or lunch they discard the mass that they\u2019ve been using and they get a new one. So wearing a mask all day and saving it for a week or whatever that has so much bad bacteria in it that it is killing you by itself when you wear two mask that\u2019s just making it double Jeopardy for you. Do some research online about pandemics in our societies. You will find out that they have this pandemic in 2020 they had another pandemic in 1920 they had another pandemic in 1820 and they had another pandemic in 1720 and each one it was some new type of disease. They even have photos of 1920 with people wearing a mask with a written sign on their chest saying wear a mask or go to jail. That\u2019s called government control so you believe it and they could build the numbers so that you believe it doctors are bribed and paid thousands of dollars for each patient they put in the hospital for Covid. And especially if you die from that they received maybe 2 or 3 times the amount of money. In a real pandemic that started two years ago this world would be empty there would be nobody left everybody would be dead think about it don\u2019t let somebody tell you that this is real because it\u2019s not.", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T23:11:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FEnCSERX", "comment_text": "Ironic how all of the sudden when truckers start honking \u201cTHE SCIENCE has changed and supports reopening\u201d", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T21:51:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mwsqz", "comment_text": "Did it ever start ? ...", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T18:26:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danielle V", "comment_text": "It will never go away !

Do NOT expect &quot;equally possible&quot; to correlate remotely or at all with equally probable.

Its evolved entry point is inherently dangerously virulent, if you did not comprehend this from my example). A species that refuses to change its density AND its herding behaviors is in for a longer, meaner time, until it is reduced in overconnectivity or host population size.

Other cellular parasites far larger than viruses, like malaria, are now and have overcome resistance to drugs, changed in response to immune adaptations, and &quot;endemic&quot; kill at much higher rates than COVID. So, do NOT suggest that diminution of virulence is associated with endemicity.<br><br>One of the likely incubators of the Omicron variant is rodents, those associated with humans. this INCREASES the likelihood of continuing variation, and by this i do NOT mean &quot;like the flu.&quot; Influenza repeats and repeats because humans refuse to engage in behaviors that end it. <br>THey don&#39;t have that luxury with viruses using ACE-2 receptor entry. Proteins used for certain physiological purposes  are more conserved, and the ACE-2 receptor proteins of mustelids, some other carnivores, and omnivores, as this one is, offer larger host interactions and populations.<br><br>Until human populations are significantly reduced worldwide, this virus will be here, always taking effective shapes to make itself from us.<br>The Omicron variant binds more firmly to ACE-2 receptors than previous variants.<br>Yes, we DO understand how and where to attack its traits to stimulate our immune response - but Canadian truckers and US republicans desire to die rather than be inoculated. Polio, a fecal-oral and oral-oral virus was knocked out only because people chose NOT to die rather than be vaccinated.<br><br>What we MAY be looking at will be sympatric speciation in response to virus - but humans being the armed haters they are, this will be veery possibly one tie in which communicable disease leads to violent war, rather then, incubateed in Kansas/Nebraska pig farms, as the so-called &quot;Spanish&quot; flu was, spread by mass human movement to Europe to make war.<br>The antithought occurring in much of the world is precisely due to the stressor effects of overpopulation and overdensity. Our medieval response to this virus IS a result of overpopulation and its inescapable stress.<br><br>Even though we now appear to have induced the world&#39;s Sixth Major extinction event, which our braggadocio pretends to &quot;Anthropocene epoch&quot;, we just MIGHT reduce our overpopulation before it surpasses the Permian Event. There is no other comprehensible way to avoid our massive extinction of other life on earth, except reduction of ourselves, and we are refusing to engage in ANY reasonable behavior. <br>Brains are evolved to gather and store sensory and motor experience, and correct the heuristic errors occurring individually, due to limited experience. Since it is OBVIOUS that we are ceasing to correct, instead deluded into fantasy experience avoiding reality,  do not expect human engineering to succeed in correction of such cognitive errors.<br><br>So long as we overaggregate, expect only increased microorganism adaptation to a most truly massive trophic niche : us. SARS-2 is not the last, and with the significant refusal occurring, combined with a population greater than when SARS-1 and some other communicable diseases occurring in the early 2000s,  EXPECT a novel communicable disease event to occur, which may, should we continue to CHOOSE destabilizing ourselves and ignoring basic common sense and science, add to the chosen continuance of disease among us.<br>We hav NOT conquered AIDS, only developed drugs to control it. Our heating of the atmosphere and refusal to mitigate it, invites numerous vector-borne tropical viruses, to add to presently temperate climates. When those diseases and/or vectors adapt further, they WILL reach the excess pressing human population, until it is reasonably diminished.", "comment_date": "2022-01-30T00:04:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "harribo2005x", "comment_text": "Never\u2026", "comment_date": "2022-01-29T23:50:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rachael Mize", "comment_text": "When you say that delta &#39;came out in spring 2021&#39;, it becomes confusing for people as this season depends on the hemisphere you are in.

Guess who made plans that got ruined because of her? I know this may sound bratty but as a very pro-vaccine person it pissed me off so much. I get that she&#39;s worried about the long term affects, but if everyone thought that we&#39;d all either gain immunity naturally of be wiped out.

In my mind, it&#39;s not enough to claim that delta is special because it outpaces the body&#39;s immune response. If I&#39;m not mistaken, any time one starts to show symptoms of a cold, it&#39;s because the germs are outpacing the initial immune response. So, every &quot;cold&quot; that a person has ever caught is the result of the germs outpacing the initial immune response.\r<br>\r<br>From what I understand, when germs get in the body, the germs meet the &quot;first line&quot; of defense. If the first line succeeds in fighting off the invasion, then the battle is won and the host shows no symptoms. This is why one can get surface cuts and often not show symptoms of infection. This is also why sometimes (not always,) people can eat food and drink of questionable quality and be perfectly fine. There probably was contagion involved, but the first line of defense fought off the invasion.\r<br>\r<br>However, should the disease outpace the first line of defense, then the body starts to show symptoms. This is because the body&#39;s full immune response has to be specially tailored to fight the invading disease. This takes time. So, unless the body knows what it&#39;s dealing with (aka, the body has immunity,) then disease multiplies quickly. \r<br>\r<br>Once the body figures out how to combat the disease, then it&#39;s a race against time for the body. The disease has multiplied, and the body must deploy its solution before it becomes overwhelmed by the disease and the host dies. This is why people have cold symptoms. The symptoms are signs of the battle going on in the body.\r<br>\r<br>So, diseases that outpace the body&#39;s initial immune response are common. <br><br>By extension, this is why people have immunity. When the body has immunity to a disease, then the body already knows how to combat the disease during the initial stages of infection. So, if the body is immune, then there is no &quot;learning period.&quot; Instead, the body&#39;s immune response quickly ramps up to full during the initial stages of infection. As a result, the disease should get wiped out quickly, so the host never shows symptoms, or may show minor symptoms.\r<br>\r<br>If, however, the claim is that delta outpaces the body&#39;s full immune response (what comes after the first wave,) then delta should have a much higher mortality rate than the mortality rate that other COVID strains. (I&#39;m talking rates statistically more significant than 7% mortality. Think at least 50% or greater.) This is because, if the claim were true, then delta would outpace the body&#39;s initial response, then continue to outpace the body&#39;s full immune response, so the body wouldn&#39;t be able to &quot;catch up&quot; with the disease. As a result, patients who catch the delta variant should almost always get worse (never better) until they die. \r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1R_pg5QasA&amp;t=6m07s\">6:07</a>. I believe this is partially true. I believe that if the whole world got vaccinated, then the current strain of COVID would die out, in much a similar way that smallpox was irradicated. However, I believe that the coronavirus is zoonotic. In other words, it jumps the gap between animals and humans. This means that even if the current strain of coronavirus is wiped out in all humans, it would still gestate and mutate in animals, then jump the gap to humans again. And, when it does, I believe it has a pretty good chance of attacking the body in a new way. This would mean that the body would probably not be immune to the new strain of coronavirus, even if it were immune to the previous strain of coronavirus.\r<br>\r<br>This is the reason why people need to get new flu vaccines every year. The flu is zoonotic, and frequently a new strain of flu jumps the gap between animals and humans. When it does, the previous year&#39;s vaccine usually does not work against the new strain of the virus, thus it requires a new vaccine.\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1R_pg5QasA&amp;t=6m13s\">6:13</a>. I do not agree. If it were true that getting vaccinated against a previous strain of a virus could protect the body against new strains of a virus, then getting a certain amount of flu vaccines should protect the body against all future forms of the flu virus. This would mean that a middle aged man, who got vaccinated against flu every year since say... high school, should have taken 10+ flu vaccines in their lifetime. Does this make them immune to all future flu variants? I honestly don&#39;t know, but my guess is, no.\r<br>\r<br>Honestly, I think the COVID pandemic will end when people start questioning some of the scientific claims behind it. One of the big ones in my mind is the idea that this disease cannot be tracked. I believe this is the bit of information that is driving everyone&#39;s response. The claim is that COVID (or the recent strains of COVID, as SARS is a Coronavirus which was tracked and contained within a few months, but I digress) is unlike every disease that has come before and cannot be tracked. \r<br>\r<br>If I understand correctly, this was based on the idea that the disease has a &quot;gestation period&quot; of up to two weeks, therefore anyone in the incubation period could spread the disease. Although I believe that people in the incubation period could spread the disease, this argument by itself is not an adequate explanation for the claim. Most diseases have a gestation period and can be tracked. This includes SARS, which has a similar gestation period, yet it can and was tracked and was contained. \r<br>\r<br>I have also heard the claim that this might (emphasis on might) be true because of a higher than usual amount of germs in the upper respiratory tract, which makes better sense, but if that&#39;s true then why wasn&#39;t that given to us at the start?\r<br>\r<br>In any case, because of the claim that this disease cannot be tracked, then it is asserted that anyone could have it and anyone could spread it even if they exhibit no symptoms. Therefore, the claim is that tracking the disease is useless. Therefore, the claim is that the only defense against it is to get tested, get vaccinated, and practice social distancing.\r<br>\r<br>This also the claim used to justify why symptoms are supposedly not a good sign to know if one is infected and spreading COVID or not. The claim is that asymptomatic people could spread it, so coughing and sneezing are not required to spread the virus.\r<br>\r<br>Somehow, I&#39;m not convinced. This disease is so unlike every single disease that came before it, including diseases within the same family of coronavirus, that it cannot be tracked? I am very skeptical of this claim.", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T01:24:12Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "SoylentSamurai", "comment_text": "Any citation of a study that has isolated the actual virus boys, or are you just quoting CDC guidelines...", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T01:12:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "achilles", "comment_text": "covers never going away. live your life.", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T01:11:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jed-Henry Witkowski", "comment_text": "When will the adds end?!

In other words.... A criteria of R0&lt;1 is only temporarily achievable.  If that is the goal, we will never achieve a permanent &quot;end-of-SARS-CoV-2&quot; state.  You have described an unattainable condition.<br> <br>I also dispute your sleight-of-hand with regard to prophylaxis.  &quot;Makes you a bit less sick&quot; is a world apart from &quot;helps you to not be part of the problem with regard pathogenicity of the virus.&quot;  Just the opposite when it comes to &quot;leaky&quot; vaccines.  Look up Marek&#39;s disease in chickens and tell me that interventions made chickens less likely to contribute to the problem of deadliness/spread/pathogenicity.  What seems to you to be a logical extension is actually a factual contradiction.<br><br>Your 6 different paths are all one path with different management strategies.  The virus will be endemic, it will continue to circulate, it will propagate in seasonal waves, it will be most dangerous in the immunocompromised (sick &amp; elderly) and naive populations (babies), it will not be a great threat to the vast majority of people with prior exposure.  <br><br>You talk out of both sides of your mouth on t-cell immunity issue.  No amount of vaccination or level of t-cell immunity will provide 100% lifelong immunity, but the t-cell immunity will be &quot;good enough&quot; to prevent severe infection in most people upon re-exposure, most of the time--enough so as to not be able to differentiate between this virus and other endemic viruses.  As with the other coronaviruses, there will be little to no value in vaccinating non-naive populations and there exists a danger of t cell exhaustion with continual boosters.  <br><br>The only thing I can rule out is a vaccine providing lifetime immunity.  You will need to provide even a theoretical basis for how that could even be possible.  If the pathogen itself cannot give lifetime immunity, by what mechanism would an attenuated, weakened, incomplete viral analog do so?  Perhaps if you inserted the genes into the body and somehow had the body continuously produce viral protein, but that would lead to all kinds of foreseeable autoimmune conditions.

However, there was another pandemic a lot more recent than the Spanish Flu, called the Swine Flu, back in the mid-late 1990&#39;s. It as well lasted around 2 years, had 4 major spikes, and even had a very similar hospitalization/mortality rate globally as both the Spanish Flu and Covid-19. Only difference with that pandemic compared with Covid-19, is the level of nonsensical, inflated hysteria is exponentially greater now, which has lead to greater damage socially and economically, comparatively.<br><br>Nice how this &quot;fact based&quot;, &quot;non-biased&quot; video forgot to include the facts of 1) Face masks other than N95 respirator style (ones that completely seal around the mouth and nose) are completely ineffective at preventing the contraction or transmission of the Covid-19 virus.<br>2) The definition of the word vaccine was changed from something that aided the immune system in preventing the contraction of a disease, to something that prevents serious illness from a disease in 2021 when the data showed the Covid-19 &quot;vaccine&quot; wasn&#39;t fulfilling the original definition of the word. The anual flu shot was NEVER called a flu vaccine until the definition was changed.<br>And 3) the latest data shows that with the omnicron variant, those that have been vaccinated are almost even with the non-vaccinated for catching and spreading the virus, which leans towards the fact that the effectiveness of the &quot;vaccine&#39; is almost negligible, and therefore not something that should keep being pushed as one of the  factors that will definately help bring an end to this pandemic. <br><br>P.S. so the haters and trolls can&#39;t dismiss my comments as the ramblings of an anti-vaxer, I am 100% fully vaccinated and can prove as much to anyone that thinks I&#39;m lying. I even wear a mask every single day for 8+ hours while I&#39;m at work since it&#39;s mandated by my employer despite the knowledge that the ones they require all their employees to wear are as thin as tissue paper, and are nothing more than a false sense of security meant to appease the vast number of cry-baby snowflakes they unfortunately employ.", "comment_date": "2022-01-26T02:45:53Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Tommys Stuff", "comment_text": "Just tell me yes or no, stop with this 10 minute crap", "comment_date": "2022-01-26T02:41:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Metalworks Boilers", "comment_text": "Never going to end!<br>The elite and liberals love the chaos!", "comment_date": "2022-01-26T02:40:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alex Hein", "comment_text": "We\u2019re waccinated \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a", "comment_date": "2022-01-26T02:36:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Bramasco", "comment_text": "Never.

Yet within a year and a half 49 with 8 dead.<br><br>That&#39;s like saying you know 49 people who all got into car crashes and 8 had died all within a year and a half. How rare would that be? Super rare. Get vaccinated. Worth it. <br><br>We made it years without getting coronavirus until a few weeks ago. We broke our rule and let our teenage son spend the night at families house. He returned with covid and within 2 days the rest of us had it. That....sucked. we are all vaxxed so the nightmare part only lasted about a day and a half. But where my son came from, their household was unvaxxed and the nightmare lasted about 7 to 9 days for each if them. Tha fully they didn&#39;t die. <br><br>It was strange. I&#39;ve had migraines before.....but not like this. I&#39;ve had sore throat and even strep throat...but not like this. Every symptom was different than I had ever experienced. Fever shot up past 103. My final symptom was strep throat infection. Thay first day and a half i was curled up shaking hard. It was hell. Then the worse just stopped and the next week was slight ache here and there. It beat the mess out of me.<br><br>My 6 kids got it and the worse was report of slight cold bones body ache. My teen son got sore throat. They all did amazingly well. Wife showed no symptoms until after we all were done. And even then it was slight. Nothing to worry about. So them being vaxxed made it laughable to them. I was the only one who got it bad but again, only lasted over a day with the rest being slight symptoms. Allllllll while 2 different households of family who were unvaxxed went darn near 9 days of NIGHTMARE.

So many people have been comparing the Spanish flu to SARS-CoV-2.  For example, the Spanish Flu took place over two years, between 1918 to 1920, and consisted of four waves, so here we are, almost two years later, and there have been four waves, so it&#39;ll end in 2022?  Right?  Right?  Today, we&#39;re going to break down how this all might end, with specific predictions based on expert opinions, past virus trajectories, and up-to-date research and models.  Let&#39;s go.<br><br>First off, a reminder: that this novel coronavirus carries its genetic info as RNA, not DNA, and is considered an intracellular parasite, which is a fancy way of saying it can only reproduce within cells.  So SARS-CoV-2 may think she&#39;s &quot;that girl&quot;, but it&#39;s like, &quot;Are you even alive?  Call me when you have your own cells or a metabolism, hon?&quot;  Although maybe we shouldn&#39;t be making fun of her, &#39;cause currently she&#39;s doing a great job infecting us all.<br><br>Even though the flu is also an RNA virus, it is different than the current RNA coronavirus that we are all talking about.  So to understand what is going to happen to us in the future, it&#39;s also worth looking at the coronaviruses or colds that infect all of us each year.  A new Genius study went back to look at blood samples over multiple decades for the seasonal coronavirus 229E, because this virus is able to infect people repeatedly throughout their lives.  But what they realized, through the blood samples, was that individuals in the &#39;80s had different immune markers than those in the &#39;90s, and even moreso from those in the 2000s.  This makes researchers think Coronavirus 229E might also be mutating throughout these decades.  That&#39;s maybe what&#39;s causing reinfection -- it&#39;s not just fading immune response.  So the big question is when will SARS-CoV-2 virus join the other four coronaviruses that circulate throughout populations and cause relatively mild colds -- how does that happen?  Now THAT is the big question.<br><br>On the one hand, it could become endemic, meaning infections stabilize without these unexpected spikes.  That would require a low reproduction number, like R1.  Meaning an infected person is likely to infect only one other person -- not like this Omicron variant, which is making graphs of COVID cases look like a comedic joke, straight line up.  On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 could become something more threatening, like a bad flu or something even worse.  It&#39;s a myth to say that viruses only evolve to become more mild, which is a narrative that keeps getting pushed.  It&#39;s possible, but the reality is far more complex.  The RNA inside is a blueprint that needs to get its genetic material into the cytoplasm of your cells, then the ribosome starts reading the blueprint three nucleic acids at a time, then it strings them together and creates the protein.  But, occasionally, the wrong nucleic acid will get added to the chain.  This can sometimes lead to changes, making an offspring virus different from its parent.  And these random changes can sometimes be advantageous to the virus.  Early genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus showed that it was picking up around two single-letter mutations per month.  <br><br>There are two importants to think about how mutations affect the virus that we are currently all freeing from.  One is its transmissibility.  Like mutations that make it replicate faster, or make it more contagious to others.  And, two is its ability to evade immune response.  Like mutations in the spike proteins that make it sneak past our immune system.  Gamma and Beta had a slew of mutations in the fame-fame spike protein we&#39;re all talking about that made it bind more easily to Ace2 receptors in your body, and that made it more easily absorbed into your cells, meaning, boom, it&#39;s more transmissible.  It&#39;s more likely to gain these effective mutations the longer it replicates in a host.  So the longer you are sick, the more likely these mutations can happen.  This is why these mutations are more likely to happen in people who are not vaccinated, or in people who are immunocompromised.<br><br>King Delta, I then divine in spring 2021, was 60% more transmissible than any other strain before, because the mutations that researchers think caused it to replicate faster in the airwys of infected individuals, outpacing the initial immune response, especially again in those unvaccinated.  So, boom, you have increased transmissibility and evading immune response.  Delta is more transmissible than the current flus we deal with, or any of those four common colds that we talked about earlier, but it&#39;s less transmissible than measles and polio.  It&#39;s also nice to know that this transmissibility of a virus can just increase forever.  We&#39;re dealing with the laws of nature, and there are certain parameters on our biology.  The virus needs to toy with the ability to replicate in thine airways and lungs, but also with making sure we&#39;re not so sick - it wants us to be out there and spreading it, it doesn&#39;t want us to be sick at home in bed, not able to move.  The virus wants to infect my family.  And when we say &#39;want&#39; here, a gentle reminder that the virus isn&#39;t sentient and doesn&#39;t consciously want these things.  It&#39;s just that the more optimal versions of the virus will spread more effectively, out-competing other variants that might be too deadly or not transmissible enough.<br><br>Omicron came out of left field, like, she&#39;s stomped on the scene.  This baby has 30 mutations in the spike protein and has involved to infect people who are immune through vaccination or previous infection to Delta.  But as gains in transmissibility slow, it needs to figure out ways to continue to overcome immune responses, which is probably what&#39;s happening right now.  Experiments and lab sequencing of variants circulating right now have identified a bunch of mutations in spike proteins that weaken your body&#39;s immune response which has been boosted by vaccination or prior infection.  But the important thing that we do know is that vaccines continue to protect against severe disease.  Your T-cell-mediated immunity created by the mRNA vaccine is a huge step in speeding up and overcoming this pandemic, and that&#39;s why getting the world vaccinated is so important.  That doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;ll just go away overnight, but being vaccinated continues to make you more resilient to any mutations in SARS-CoV-2 over time, as it&#39;s proven to make you less sick.  Perhaps even more important is that it allows you to not contribute to the problem of it becoming even more transmissible or evading immunity.  So continued vaccination can build up a wall of immunity that the virus can no longer overcome.  Essentially - if the whole world was suddenly vaccinated at once - the overall T-cell-mediated immunity would be high enough to help us be more resilient to any upcoming changes of the virus, and as a result, it wouldn&#39;t be able to spread as fast and likely become more endemic as easily.<br><br>Of now, there are six scenarios that experts think about our future for COVID.<br><br>One, we do a better job vaccinating the world, the overall T-cell immunity of humanity increases, making the virus more likely to be endemic, resulting in outbreaks and epidemics of varying sizes, like other respiratory infections we already have, more likely the current coronaviruses and flu we all deal with.<br><br>Two, though considered endemic, we have small changes in the spike proteins that open up parts of society to re-infection.  The virus continues to evolve, but we combat waning immune responses with annual vaccines, like the flu shot, and the only people who are highly susceptible are those who are unvaccinated, and children borne without immunity.<br><br>Three, this one&#39;s good, but not likely - we invent a vaccine like the measles vaccine that offers lifetime protection, and the only people who are susceptible are newborn kids.<br><br>Four, it ends up like respiratory syncytial virus, meaning it&#39;s around, like maybe forever, but in the far future, most people get infected in the first two years of life.  It is mild for most kids but it does cause high hospitalization rates over all for infants.  As it spreads or evolves, adults have mild symptoms due to their exposure they already had as a kid.<br><br>Five, it ends up like influenza-A, the little bugger that drives global flu each year.  This baby has rapid evolution and spreads with new variants that are able to escape the immunity elicited by past strains.  This results in seasonal epidemics largely spread by adults, who can still have severe illness.  Like the flu vaccine, our annual coronavirus vaccine will decrease transmissibility and decrease severe disease, but the quick mutation means that these vaccines aren&#39;t always properly designed for the specific strains of the year, and will need to continually be updated.<br><br>Six, it ends up like influenza-B -- evolves more slowly, and is driven largely by infection in children, who have less immunity than adults, who are more immune from prior infection and vaccines.  It&#39;s important to remember that how quickly SARS-CoV-2 evolves in relation to immune response will continually explain how often we need to be updating these vaccines.", "comment_date": "2022-01-25T00:41:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NitroShadow", "comment_text": "Throught the pandemic I&#39;ve lost two family members.

Lmao let me tell you a true vaccinated story of my own mother. December 17th 2021 my mother was 1 week into her diagnosis of covid and 4 months into her fully vaccinated status. At around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1R_pg5QasA&amp;t=12m30s\">12:30</a>ish she calls me and states she&#39;s feeling a little light headed but that she can still breathe. I head over to keep an eye on her and within 3 hours she was on being evacuated to our nearest hospital. Now I&#39;m not gonna reveal my location but I will say I&#39;m close enough to Columbus Ohio that If these hospitals were full like they said, it would be. Anyways my mother is checked in, they look at her, and before long they had her on a ventilator. They kick me out for the night and say only 1 visitor at a time. A week goes by, and she seems to be better except one thing, she somehow now has COPD?! never a day in her life has she smoked... so now she has copd and most of you would probably blame covid right? Well for one. I am unvaccinated, was in very close contact with her for over a week and nothings happened to me or my father (also unvaccinated). And two, in October of 2020 I had covid and no lasting damages happened to me whatsoever. How does a women who&#39;s vaxxed get copd and nearly die from covid when my father and I who aren&#39;t vaccinated have been able to continue our life like normal? Haven&#39;t worn a mask in a year by now. All I&#39;m saying is there &quot;science&quot; is just not adding up. Because if I go by the statistics of my mothers hospital, they were at 100% vaccinated patients with only 1 covid patient in the wing, and I know, we were in the covid wing. They had a whole area set up for it and for once I was in a hospital and I heard no beeps. No talking.

Those most at risk are those who are elderly, overweight, have high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. Regardless of vaccination status those people are at much greater risk than a 20 year old. Omicron has shown to be mild and evades boosters. It will spread regardless of vaccination status among the population. Young people will develop immunity effortlessly and with few deaths and complications while those who are older will experience some hardship as the vaccines do not provide the same protection against covid as it used to. The best course of action is to have people come in contact with omicron. With how fast it spreads abs how mild it is, it is in the interest of those at low risk to be infected as having the body get a taste of covid 19 so mem T cells can count a better response when the new variant comes around. It has been proven that previous infection and vaccination is the strongest form of immunity one can have, and healthy people should not shy away from it. Covid will become endemic. And with strains being unpredictable right now and vaccine not being developed effectively to counter covid there is little reason for young healthy people to get vaccinated other than the mandates which force them to take them in order to go to school. Flu is in many ways similar to covid, it should be looked to as a guide for how we should handle covid. Vaccination should be a choice but strongly encouraged for those who are in bad shape or elderly. People in general should be encouraged to exercise more, eat healthier, and take vitamins as these are cheap and have proven to support immune system health. With that comes shorter times of being sick and thus a lower chance of you being the one to create the next variant. So yes healthy living is something we should all Peruse as it not only benefits ourselves but everyone around us as well. Also early treatments for covid 19 need to become more mainstream. Antivirals, ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies have proven effective they should be leveraged the same way someone with the flu can receive a prescription for tamiflu from a doctor this too will do a great deal and will help counteract the ineffectiveness Vaccines can have. The problem here is money. Vaccines are making big pharma billions and cheap pill with expired patents are not in their interest. You don\u2019t have to look far back to see pharma companies don\u2019t care about people. Just look at the opioid epidemic or the price hikes of epipens. Or look at how Fauci handled the aids epidemic (the lgbt community wanted him hung in the street basically) he\u2019s handling covid very similarly now, I guess people never change. All this is to say the public is skeptical of the vaccines as institutions and companies have bred mistrust within the population.  There needs to be more transparency and more openness to the other legitimate options that exist to fight this pandemic. People will die regardless it\u2019s a fact of life. Those old and overweight are just hard to save. What we really need to worry about is young adults facing a situation similar to the Spanish flu.

Not just to covid ofc, but covid and other severe respiratory illnesses are especially dangerous for obese people. So the western world, especially the US, might wanna consider combating a much more dangerous epidemic too, not just covid. Time to end the obesity epidemic, and you can do that with better consumption practices. I&#39;m sorry, but snacks are waaay too cheap, and healthy eating is waay too expensive..

What appears to be happening is exactly what is happening. No need to overcomplicate or spin around an already impossible situation. Coronaviruses among other flu-like viruses (including common human coronaviruses) have been notorious for not triggering any kind of long term immunity...this has been known for decades now. That is why we can&#39;t eradicate Flu, Rhino, RSV, Metapneumo, Adeno, etc. They only trigger short term immunity and the strains quickly mutate to beat the immune system protections. <br><br>Vaccines and eradication strategies work perfectly with viruses that trigger lifelong or very long term immunity and that mutate very slowly. What the data is showing is that COVID vaccines add a bit of protection for severe symptoms in the most vulnerable individuals, but fail to stop transmission or symptoms. The virus WILL SPREAD no matter what. Even with a booster by the 3rd month you have a 50/50 chance of getting it if you are exposed, by the 4th month you are already on the losing side of that battle (around 40% effectivity) according to the latest studies in UK. It is simply unsustainable to vaccinate billions of people every 2 or 3 months. <br><br>For more evidence of the glitch see that we have the highest amount of individuals fully vaccinated since the pandemic started and the virus is now spreading at its quickest pace so far. The Omicron wave 7-day average for deaths is overtaking the Delta deaths numbers even when we are now conveniently rethinking who should qualify as &quot;dying of COVID&quot; vs &quot;dying with COVID&quot;...we already know that 2021 was a deadlier year than 2020. The evidence is all around. We can only cross our fingers with future trends and mutations, but I would be careful to suggest we have COVID by the throat...the virus is nowhere near finished mutating.  <br><br>If you are not afraid of getting sick and you are in reasonable health...move on with your life, there is little we can do to actually stop the virus, it is mostly placebos and social theater. If you are afraid of the virus and/or you are in poor health ...brace yourself and take good care of yourself (vaccines, prevention, and prompt initiation of therapeutics if you get infected).

You can still get any sickness that was serious in the past, it\u2019s just that now we have cure for it, and because of that it\u2019s not serious anymore. The more people are vaccinated/already had covid, the more normalized the virus will be. I\u2019m aware of the differences between USA and European mindsets featuring this topic, but in the end the outcome will be same. 2021 was basically a year highlighted by fights between vaxed and non vaxed, when both sides were equally right. When I had covid for the first time in 2020 I didn\u2019t transfer it to anyone around me. When my mom had it in 2021, the same thing. Because we were isolated nicely. She had both shots of vaccine later on, plus booster, caught it again and brought it home to me. I wasn\u2019t vaccinated but still had the symptoms easier than normal flu\u2019s ones. The point of it is: the reason why I cought it again was because she, as a vaccinated person, was able to do whatever she wanted and even when she showed symptoms the society didn\u2019t really care since she had the shot, BECAUSE we normalized vaccinated people transmitting the virus since they did their part. So if we want to go back to normal, most people need to vaccinate or go out and catch the virus so they would be immune enough for global society/organizations to say that transmission of the virus isn\u2019t deadly/serious enough for world to panic.

If the first variants were to stay next to a person with covid, the next ones were to touch something with a big amount of the virus, and now, omicron, you have to enter a space where a sick person just PASSED without staying for long!

I dont think i believe that. Making a &quot;hypotheses&quot; isnt dangerous because constructive criticism is needed in order to make sense of the world. There are many scientists that also give a hypothesis that people who take a preventative measure to stop or &quot;lessen&quot; infection (such as how antibiotics in cattle help initially in infection but dont completely stop it.  This makes the virus evolve to go around the preventative blockade the antibiotics give bc it STILL infected the host and so the virus effects evole to worsen. This is why less and less cattle farmers use antibiotics. The same science applies to those who are vaccinated. Which would be exactly opposite of what he is saying. Insinuating that it never ends unless 100 percent of people are vaccinated doesnt sound logical but to me it sounds like big pharma opening up their wallets.

I&#39;ve been careful and only got infected cause my boyfriend&#39;s coworkers are irresponsible, going to clubs for new years, getting back to work testing positive, and since our car broke down we went to pick him up with my dad, since he was picking me up from class and all 3 of us got infected. All 3 of as have a chance of this turning vary bad! my boyfriend who has asthma just tested negative and is out of harms way. My father who has COPD is still sick spiking 38\u00b0C fevers. And I that exhaustion and common colds can leave me with reoccurring bronchitis, have a bad cough and I&#39;m worried it will turn to bronchitis, if it hasn&#39;t already and the cough will be long lasting. we are all fully vaccinated, and me and my father got our boosters too, my partner got infected Tuesday before his booster shot. I need this to end! the old times seem like they were all the way back in 2012, very distant. people don&#39;t realize what an insult it is to the young people who stayed in, who rushed to take the shots, who lost productive years of their youth to protect them. Care free years of teenagers and early 20s, starting careers and graduation ceremonies, giving birth with your entire family sitting outside waiting for the baby. These moments came and went and we didn&#39;t get to live them like anyone in their late 40s and over. And how grandparents in their 60s didn&#39;t experience the birth of their first grandchild. The second is important sure, but you couldn&#39;t get the full firt time grandparent experience. All that because half of us, especially the older people sensitive to infection, are being stubborn. these things only happen once in a lifetime. My first nephew was born and I couldn&#39;t be by my bestfriend&#39;s side, my second nephew came, I couldn&#39;t travel to go be by my only cousin&#39;s side that I first held in my arms when she was a baby just as small as her son, actually smaller case he was born 10 pounds. I got incredibly depressed and needed medical intervention, my school completely shut down during 2021, and 2020 quarantines. and I didn&#39;t graduate last May. I was working customer support lines holding my breath until the finishing like, hearing people screaming bloody murder on the phone and waiting for my diploma and my first job in my field. And last February my contract run out and I was left without a job due to covid lockdowns and low call volumes. It all started couple days after my 26th birthday, 11th of March 2019 I went out with couple of friends, on the 14th we were on full lockdown. I can&#39;t realize that I&#39;m turning 28 in less that 2 months and it&#39;s like I was in a coma. I feel 26 and I&#39;m so mad for these 2 years that nothing changed. Nothing happened, 2 empty years out of my 20s I was planning to spend traveling and falling in love, working for a job I love, completely empty. I was just crying for 2 years. And at 28 I haven&#39;t worked 1 day in the field I&#39;ve studied for and spent so much money in my tuition. my university was free, but trade school to get an extra certification wasn&#39;t. We&#39;ve lost a lot, we&#39;ve lost dear friends, we lost relatives, this virus took lively, health people and turned them in urns and headstones and people that will permanently live on oxygen, can&#39;t walk, can&#39;t smell, can&#39;t taste, have parosmia, their hearts don&#39;t work like they used to and they are all very young people. I feel offended having lost that much, I&#39;m offended on behalf of all these people who watched their health strong relatives turn into nothing in 10 days, who lost their health and will live with disabilities. I was born disabled, I was born with a &quot;learning&quot; disorder that affects more than just my learning. It sucks! and these people where healthy and now they will experience what I&#39;m experiencing and worst cause physical disability is very limiting. when people put their ego and fun over everyone else&#39;s life and quolity of life, that&#39;s extremely disrespectful. My unemployment benefits expire soon, I still have no job in my field and I&#39;ll return to the same 9 to 5 yelling and screaming in my ear and it&#39;s all because of the stubborn people not realize how much harm they are doing and capitalistic societies putting money over people.  That same denier will call the help line and yell at me cause I&#39;m not American and don&#39;t bent overbackwards to their needs, ask for the manager. No I&#39;m not talking about the scared ones who are waiting to make sure it&#39;s safe to getting the vaccine. on the meantime keep the rules as their holy religious book they swear by.

She had to pause her research due to the fact that her lab is one of few in canada with the clearance to work with the virus) and when talking about this she said that this is a flawed logic concept. The virus doesn\u2019t \u201cwant\u201d anything but to replicate, it has no consciousness or will. The idea that virus evolution is correlated with \u201cnot making us too sick we die\u201d is not correct.

When everything is locked down I Think people can more easily lose hope that they&#39;ll be living in a world that can get better. I&#39;ve been experiencing this loss of hope and, it&#39;s not as bad as dying from covid, just making living in this world questionable. I&#39;ve been suspecting that as time goes on that the virus as more people seem to catch it, it generally seems to pose less of a threat than when it was first caught by people. Both less of a threat from the fear because people are less afraid and also possibly less of a threat as an actual physical body response to the virus. The other thing is that unfortunately a lot of people have been forced to take the vaccine especially those in higher positions in society. It seems as though the more money you make the more likely you&#39;ll be forced into taking this thing. And yet I and a lot of other people have either noticed or suspecting sudden deaths as a potential effect for some of taking these. When a virus kills someone, no one is responsible because it&#39;s just a sickness that has less of a blame. If someone is vaccinated and than they die, reguardless if the vaccine causes it, it&#39;s going to cause distrust of what is being forced on people. The rise in cases is higher than it ever has been at least in canada and this is post vaccines, so it doesn&#39;t look like at least from the covid infection rate that it&#39;s lowering cases(). I don&#39;t want to live in a world where were constantly starting up and restarting the economy every couple of months, so many business have closed down because that sort of restart start up , it doesn&#39;t foster security or hope in anyones mind. Finally it seems as though certain companies like Phizer are looking towards more treatment based methods, rather than a panacea solution if that makes sense. I Also hope that science can start more looking towards the facts, of reality, rather than being coerced, into going along with what the state says. Do you know that doctors will have their medical license revoked if they spread any misinformation or disinformation ? It&#39;s not that it isn&#39;t a good idea, to say doctors shouldn&#39;t lie to people, which they shouldn&#39;t. But, Misifnromation and disinformation is kind of hard to draw a clear hard line of what defines it. And it seems to be, anything that goes outside of what the state is saying about the covid vax. Now the state could be right. But unfortunately, If the state came out and said that we&#39;re actually giving something with the potential to harm you, that would cause an uproar, and so there are some truths the state cannot admit. And from what i&#39;ve been notcing it looks like the state has been coercing &quot;Science&quot; to bend more towards the state narrative rather than the truth&quot;. I as a person Just saying, would rather live and work, with covid and stay home if i feel sick, and than go back to work as I feel better, and just accept covid as a part of life. Because i would rather have a world with covid in it, where i might get sick, than a world where I get to live without covid but the outside life is basically nonexistant and on the verge of collapse and hopeless.

I&#39;ve been experiencing this loss of hope and, it&#39;s not as bad as dying from coW1d, just making living in this world questionable. I&#39;ve been suspecting that as time goes on that the virus as more people seem to catch it, it generally seems to pose less of a threat than when it was first caught by people. Both less of a threat from the fear because people are less afraid and also possibly less of a threat as an actual physical body response to the virus. The other thing is that a lot of people have been forced to take the nax especially those in higher positions in society. The way I see it is that it seems as though the more money you make the more likely you&#39;ll be forced into taking this thing. And yet I and a lot of other people have either noticed or suspecting sudden deaths as a potential effect for some of taking these. When a virus kills someone, no one is responsible because it&#39;s just a sickness that has less of a blame. If someone is naxed and then they die, regardless if the nax causes it, it&#39;s going to cause distrust of what is being forced on people. The rise in cases is higher than it ever has been at least in Canada and this is post nax, so it doesn&#39;t look like at least from the cow1d infection rate that it&#39;s lowering cases(). I don&#39;t want to live in a world where were constantly starting up and restarting the economy every couple of months, so many business have closed down because that sort of restart-start up, it doesn&#39;t foster security or hope in anyone\u2019s mind. Finally, it seems as though certain companies like Pfizer are looking towards more treatment based methods, rather than a panacea solution if that makes sense. I also hope that science can start looking more towards the facts, of reality, rather than being coerced, into going along with what the state says. Do you know that doctors will have their medical license revoked if they spread any misinformation or disinformation? It&#39;s not that it isn&#39;t a good idea to say doctors shouldn&#39;t lie to people, which they shouldn&#39;t. But, misinformation and disinformation is kind of hard to draw a clear hard line of what defines it. And it seems to be, anything that goes outside of what the state is saying about the cow1d nacs. Now the state could be right. But unfortunately, If the state came out and said that we&#39;re actually giving something with the potential to harm you, that would cause an uproar, and so there are some truths the state cannot admit. And from what I\u2019ve been noticing it looks like the state has been coercing &quot;Science&quot; to bend more towards the state narrative rather than the truth. I as a person Just saying, would rather live and work, with cow1d and stay home if I feel sick, and then go back to work as I feel better, and just accept cow1d as a part of life. Because I would rather have a world with cow1d in it, where I might get sick, than a world where I get to live without cow1d but the outside life is basically nonexistent and on the verge of collapse and hopeless. Maybe some people may disagree. Best to everyone out there.<br>Extra Edit: Honestly my hope is that, similar to the Spanish flu, that ended after 2 years, It\u2019s my hope I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll happen but it\u2019s my hope that we can transition out of this and things for every country can genuinely improve and keep on improving.

We can&#39;t just let the world keep slipping into economic despair while we wait and see what happens with this 5th wave of the virus. We need to get the world back on its feet. People who are vaccinated will see less consequences when and if they catch the virus, because their bodies will be better able to adapt to fighting off the virus quickly.

I don&#39;t think transmissibility means what you think it means or were led to think. The same goes for strain. Granted transmissibility is defined differently by virologists and epidemiologist so that can get confusing. Regardless, the epidemiological definition (which is what many have relied on) does not provide sufficient evidence for an intrinsic change in the virus biology resulting in increased transmission. We cannot discern between biology, human behaviour, environmental factors, etc. with just a reproductive number. Sure, omicron does appear to be more immune evasive but that does not equal increased transmissibility. A recent preprint out of Denmark evidences this well by showing that there is no difference in odds between unvaccinated people of getting either Delta and Omicron, but there is a difference among vaccinated people, where vaccinated people had a higher odds of being infected by Omicron than Delta. I understand that some studies show better binding to ACE-II receptors, but they should be interpreted with caution, because while they provide clues, they cannot be so simply generalized to humans as whole, complex beings. It also doesn&#39;t necessarily equate to more transmissibility.<br>We are seeing increased spread driven by an increased overall fitness of the virus largely driven by immune evasion in addition to changes in human behaviour and contraction of neutralizing antibodies. <br>As always, I admire your sci comm videos, but I think it needs more nuance and fact-checking.

However, obviously it isn&#39;t a complete picture.<br><br>For one thing, it&#39;s important to understand the unique immune response pathway of a SARS-COV-2 infection. One reason it&#39;s generally not appropriate to compare this virus to other respiratory viruses is because it has the ability to mess with your innate immune response, which usually kicks in pretty quickly after infection. Infected immune cells express certain key molecules less: molecules responsible for recruiting the adaptive immune system. This is why you can be infectious without having symptoms: there is a period of potentially several days where the virus is replicating rapidly without immune intervention.<br><br>Without getting too far into the weeds, this one aspect of SARS-COV-2 infection is a hugely important distinction that makes it completely unlike previous pandemics. It makes a lifetime vaccine all but impossible. It also makes it easier for the virus to continue to spread and mutate even within a largely immunized population. Vaccinated people would be much less likely to see severe illness, but that could still spread it, allowing it to continue to mutate and evolve to become unrecognizable to prior immunity. And because of the lack of lasting immunity, the virus has a lot more &quot;options&quot; for how to mutate.<br><br>So without COVID-zero strategies, it seems much more likely that we&#39;ll see a constant stream of new variants, some of which are less harmful, some of which are more. It won&#39;t be relegated to outbreaks like the flu, but rather a continuous cycle of waves.<br><br>Again, this is only if we continue to fail at implementing COVID-zero strategies.

Most mutations are not and therefore quickly die out as they are out competed by the dominant strain. A mutation that provides vaccine resistance will not be useful in an unvaccinated individual unless it provides other benefits as well. Therefore it is reasonable to expect vaccine resistant strains to appear more quickly in a highly vaccinated population. The Omicron variant took a completely different route and spread through mice before jumping back to the human population where the mouse appropriate mutations also happened to sidestep our immunity.<br><br>In other words, vaccines will not stop this virus and I think it&#39;s better to just focus on vaccinating people in risk groups rather than trying to push it to every single person on the entire planet. The vaccines haven&#39;t even been able to stop Delta in places with a 97-100% vaccination rate and Omicron is 3-5 times as contagious, thus it&#39;s better to just focus on decreasing hospitalizations to levels that the healthcare systems can handle. Most who have died have had comorbidities and more than 95% of them have been older than 50. Hospitalizations follow a similar pattern with around 90% being people over 40 (at least in my country).

I went to my family doctor with my only initial symptom being a sore throat and figured I had strep. My doctor asked if I&#39;d been fully vaccinated and boosted, which I had been. She tested me for strep and it came back negative. I was prescribed allergy medicine and antibiotics and sent home. I was not tested for Covid-19. Luckily, I was on a school break for 9 days and was not in close contact with people outside of my household. The following week my mother started off with congestion and a fever and shortly after lost her sense of smell and taste. She tested positive for Covid-19 and since she isn&#39;t in close contact with many other people and I was just sick, I think I was the person who gave it to her. She changed nothing about her daily life around my father- they still shared a bed and everything. He did not show any symptoms whatsoever. Now, nearly two months later, he has symptoms very similar to what I had- sore throat, hoarse voice, cough. He just tested positive for Covid-19. My question is: How did he not get sick immediately after my mother? Could he have contracted it and been asymptomatic the first time and now caught a different strand? Could he be more susceptible to one of the strands over another?<br> I don&#39;t know if this is useful information, but he is 72 years old and his blood type is O negative.", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T03:14:14Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Space Mutiny", "comment_text": "It ended a year ago for me because I don\u2019t live in fear.", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T03:12:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joren Mathews", "comment_text": "You give short shrift to natural immunity.
