This is a massive, massive misconception. And at the point an outright lie. Artificial banana flavor doesn\u2019t taste like banana, because there are over 40 different molecules that contribute to the flavor in actual bananas. The most volatile, is  isoamyl acetate, and this compound is whats used in artificial banana flavors. The reason that we don\u2019t use the other 40 or so compounds to make a more realistic artificial banana flavor, is because it would be expensive to synthesize, among other things. Isoamyl acetate happens to be the most banana\u2019y (yes I know that\u2019s not a real work) of the compounds on it\u2019s own, and it also happens to be really cheap to produce. So no, it\u2019s not based on the Gros Michel, this is just a myth made up to explain the disparity between the flavor of real bananas, and artificial banana. Please do some research guys.
