I said. &quot;he did not look me in the eye. I don&#39;t <br>think he likes women. I think he is a pedophile.&quot; I did not know why I <br>said that last thing, having never knowingly  been faced with a <br>pedophile or contemplated pedophilia at all. It just came out of my <br>mouth. Over the next year, I noticed many strange things about that <br>teacher, as if my brain was watching out subconsciously. He had pizza <br>delivered to his classroom for male students during lunch period. He <br>offered money to boys to clean his classroom after school. He had a <br>weird paper clip on boys jeans zippers as some sort of &quot;friction&quot; <br>experiment. He asked my son to wash his car on the weekend for $50 (I <br>said &quot;no.&quot;). He put my son on the varsity basketball team but refused to<br> play him even tho he attended every practice, per district rules. I <br>started going to every practice to make sure my son was participating <br>fully, and to make sure he was never alone with Mr. McP. I thought he <br>was trying to bargain sexual favors for playing time. Mr. McP phoned me <br>at home, thinking he could shut me down. I told him outright that I <br>thought he was a pedophile.  I wrote a letter to be put in his district <br>file, specifying what I thought were inappropriate at best behaviors and<br> pedophile grooming behaviors at worst. I discussed him with the <br>principal and other teachers. My son hated me for being a helicopter Mom<br> where Mr. McP was concerned because all the boys thought Mr. McP was <br>the best teacher ever. Fast forward three years...Mr. McP was arrested <br>and convicted for sexually assaulting 11 boys. Two of them were in my <br>son&#39;s group of friends. One of the victim&#39;s was a cops son (and <br>neighbor) and one&#39;s parents even testified on his behalf at his trial! <br>The FBI agent that called me said I was listening to my primal brain and<br> it was alerting me to protect my son. He said &quot;in our too polite <br>society we have stopped listening to our primal brain.&quot; I asked him if <br>he called me because he hurt my son (they had troves of evidence but <br>none involving my son) or saw the letter I thought the principal had <br>placed in his file. He said he could not confirm or deny seeing any <br>letter. He said he called me because they were calling all parents of <br>male students. He then added &quot;parents that wrote a letter would have <br>been contacted first.&quot; I asked where I was on his contact list. He said <br>&quot;in alphabetical order.&quot; That proved the principal did not put my letter<br> in that pedo&#39;s teacher file. Funny, she retired the day after Mr. McP <br>was arrested. My son apologized to me when he heard of McP&#39;s arrest. My <br>son is now a doctor and father and doing great in life.
