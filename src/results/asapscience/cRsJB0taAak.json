The LSD and DXM opened my eyes to realize that there is more to reality than what just meets the eye.  Because of this experience, I started to take religion seriously.  I stopped abusing alcohol and using LSD  and DXM because, in God&#39;s eyes, it is a sin.  Why is it a sin?  Because it makes us not able to take care of our loved ones, drive a car, interact in society, make decisions, etc.   In other words, a lot of bad comes from it.  Using illegal drugs and alcohol is a sin in God&#39;s eyes, as seen, in the Christian Bible, in the books and chapters and versus: [(Ephesians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRsJB0taAak&amp;t=5m18s\">5:18</a>), (Genesis <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRsJB0taAak&amp;t=9m21s\">9:21</a>), (Galatians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRsJB0taAak&amp;t=5m21s\">5:21</a>), (Proverbs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRsJB0taAak&amp;t=23m20s\">23:20</a>, (1 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRsJB0taAak&amp;t=6m10s\">6:10</a>) and many more.<br>In high school, I had a secular course on the major world religions.  The only religion that says that  we all sin (commit crimes, even as simple as driving over the speed limit or drunk driving) and, therefore, cannot be in the presence of a sinless, righteous God who must judge (sent to Hell where there is torment forever) sin is Christianity.  Most of the other religions believe that it is through good works that gets us into Heaven.  But the problem is that we already have sinned, and will continue to do so in the future because it is our fallen nature.  We have to have led perfect lives.   So we need a perfect sacrifice to take our place.  Killing a person or animal is not a sacrifice, for the Lord says in His Ten Commandments &quot;Thou shalt not kill (people).&quot;  The perfect sacrifice to take our place and become sin himself, die, descend into Hell, and rise again conquering death could only be God himself.  So, as sinners, we are separated from the perfect Lord and must be judged for our sinful acts and go to everlasting Hell.  But Jesus Christ (God in the form of a man and tempted but never sinned) is that perfect sacrifice who died for us.  We are still going to sin in life, after all it is our nature.  But, in order to go to wonderful Heaven, all that we have to do is have belief and faith in what Jesus did for us.  All you have to do is pray: &quot;God, forgive me of my sins.  Jesus Christ come into my heart.  I&#39;ll make you my lord and savior.&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-11-01T11:30:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pedro Amaral", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRsJB0taAak&amp;t=2m31s\">2:31</a> - \u201cCauses vomiting\u201d - draws vomiting<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRsJB0taAak&amp;t=2m36s\">2:36</a> - \u201cCauses Diarrhea\u201d - decides not to illustrate that", "comment_date": "2020-10-30T19:19:50Z", "likes_count": 513}, {"comment_by": "Toadally Man", "comment_text": "I wonder if because of covid ceremonies are currently banned...seems like it would be a covid cesspool.

Made me really question myself and consciousness in general. What purpose is, what life is. What feelings are for. Lifes journey and my goal in it has changed completely. I want to learn everything I can about the true, objective reality we live in. And help people who&#39;ve seen behind the curtain like I have.

Because of my training in\u00a0 exorcisms and spiritual warfare I would see interdimensional\u00a0reptiles\u00a0on my friends while we\u00a0were\u00a0high\u00a0and I would take them through exorcisms at the middle of parties by declaring the name of Jesus Christ over\u00a0my possessed friends. Many witnesses,\u00a0were there and\u00a0have verified\u00a0publicly on\u00a0social networks that these exorcisms were authentic.\u00a0\u00a0I now know that evil spirits\u00a0can enter people through\u00a0hallucinogenic experiences, grey aliens=reptilian demon,\u00a0there is much research that suggests this as well, i.e CE4 Research Group, and\u00a0many\u00a0others.\u00a0 I\u00a0will no longer partake. A psychedelic comrade died in a car wreck and I saw him in hell in a dream. I began studying near death experiences and found people that have a near death experience usually return to tell of Jesus Christ or hell. Which makes perfect sense because nearly every major culture around throughout history and around\u00a0the world(Mayan, Hopi, Egyptian, Roman, Greek to name a few we all know)\u00a0all believed when you died your soul belonged to the gods of the underworld....Jesus Christ is\u00a0God and\u00a0King and he will save you from the underworld and the demons that will try to attack you on\u00a0hallucinogenic experiences.

They explained to the newcomers like myself how the evening would follow and the expected effects of the beverage - including the nausea and vomiting. One thing they said - and that really happened - and is not said in your great video, is that the ayahuasca makes us feel cold - they even provided blankets.<br><br>From my experience, I found that drinking it was not unlike having a high fever - including the sensation of cold. I was lightheaded and drowsy, and I only hallucinated when I &quot;slept&quot; - the same kind of weird minutes sleep we have when with a high fever. The effect lasted almost exactly the time they explained us it would, and I did felt nauseated afterwards. Apart from that, I didn&#39;t experienced any long-lasting effect and, since I look over the experience with a objective mind, didn&#39;t had any &quot;revelation&quot; or &quot;mind-lightness&quot; sensation as some other newcomers shared with me. My &quot;hallucinations&quot; also weren&#39;t as strong as some of the descriptions other people gave me - but again, I was probably less influenced by the ritualistic aspects of everything.<br><br>The beverage itself was just a small glass half-full with a thick dark green liquid which we were oriented to drink all at once - about 200ml or so.
