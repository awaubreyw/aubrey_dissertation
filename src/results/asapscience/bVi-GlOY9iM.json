My scientific theory may be explaining the reality and true cause of this bizarre phenomena. ::: Lets start off by focusing on Graphene Oxide ( GO for short ) as I strongly believe that the waxxine contains a large dose of this highly toxic substance. Graphene Oxide contains the building blocks needed for creating life. It is mostly made of Carbons and Metals and possesses some unique Qualities and Properties like DNA Mutagenesis, Electro magnetism, Metabolic activity and a few more. ::: The Graphene Oxide uses Mutagenesis to edit some of your DNA while allowing their Metabolic demand to be changed. This may allow a form of Hemochromatosis to drive your body into an Iron Metabolic Overdrive. The normal human body roughly contains 3 to 4 grams of Iron, but this Iron Metabolic Overdrive allows your body to demand more and more Iron. This Iron will be circulating throughout your entire body, including the area as where you received the waxxination, allowing the Iron to stick to the Carbon and Metals, contained within the Graphene Oxide, which are still concentrated within your upper arm. The accumulation of this different materials will not only create a charged battery, but will also be forming a paste-like magnetic clot within the muscular tissue of your upper arm and thus allowing metal objects to be sticking to it, while in some cases, allowing an electrical current to be measured on the outside of your skin. In fact, I wached a video as where a magnetically charged, paste-like clot had been surgically removed from a patients upper arm. ::: Please note that this phenomena do not appear in all the people who got waxxinated as our DNA and Metabolism are Unique to every individual person. We are simply not the same.

Magnetic manipulative nano medicine for covid-19 epidemic/endemic. Graphene. I&#39;m already a minute in and you are seriously irritating me. Like really. Let&#39;s see, are you intelligent? <br>Or are you one of those ego types. <br><br>Actually vaccines have been happening since around the 1840s. China was the first to do them. Back in the 1880s. Yeah they went hand in hand with the blue milk and polio. Nobody ever got it from a cow they actually got it from them playing God. Like they&#39;re doing now. Go ahead what are you saying about people being afraid of needles. Do you know that some people carry SNP gene mutations. Do you know they can&#39;t methylate properly. I myself spent 16 days in the hospital 10 days on a ventilator and three and a half weeks of physical therapy to walk again. That was whenever I was 19 from a forced flu shot. Another forced flu shot in eighth grade to even graduate no less that was psychotic. Only three kids in my school got them. Yay we were poor.<br><br>Thank goodness my doctor Dr Rojas saved the syringe the vile everything. She knew that I reacted. Got the shot at 7:36 a.m. is back in her office by 1:30 p.m. with 105.9 fever. And you don&#39;t die at 105 or 106 it&#39;s actually 108. I&#39;ve actually been 106.9.<br>Anyways I spiked 105.7 and climbing fever. had a fever so bad my great grandma was with me although I am gifted and she actually could have been there but since I was so feverish I&#39;m going to blame it on the fever. I&#39;m too logical. So these are new correct. New mrna. You realize that this is basically gene therapy. Do you not know about gene therapy? Do you know about paramagnetic medicine? Magnetic manipulative medicine. Graphene, nano oxide particles? Probably not because within 2 minutes and 16 seconds all you&#39;re talking about is shots in people&#39;s emotions. You&#39;re not seeming too bright. Even though you&#39;re bright. You are not the brightest star in the sky. <br><br>Bad needle experiences like having the CDC come to your house every Monday Wednesday and Friday and collect your blood. Bad needle practices like the hospital yelling at Dr Rojas claiming that she was a liar and she never gave me that shot because the virus wasn&#39;t in me anywhere. Oh my God I have never seen this before but it was pretty cool doctors in the ER screaming at each other. My doctor produces syringe the vial everything. Then all of a sudden everyone had on their little air space suits. My mom was kind of panicked because she was like well God what about me and they&#39;re like you&#39;ve been around her you&#39;re fine aren&#39;t you?<br><br>For 3 months I had severe fevers. So bad my mom had to change my sheets up to five times a day. Was pretty crazy. She went out and bought a whole bunch of like white cotton t-shirts and white bottoms man I would soak myself. My body hurts so bad there wasn&#39;t a place on my body that didn&#39;t hurt. <br>When I was 19 the one that kept me in the hospital for 16 days, 10 days on the ventilator, 3 and 1/2 weeks of physical therapy. And let me tell you what, I was no weakling. I&#39;ve been dancing since I was three I studied at the performing arts school of Pittsburgh. I worked part-time for the Pittsburgh ballet doing the nutcracker. Sad I was too tiny to get any very big parts. But I had total of 21 parts in 3 years it&#39;s pretty good. I was the backbone of my family. I made excellent money at 19 actually at 18. I need for Karen and Richard Porter. It was actually President Bush senior&#39;s personal advisor.<br><br>That shot knocked me to my knees. At least the one after 3 months I was able to walk and move around I didn&#39;t have to go through physical therapy. It took me a year to work 4 days a week non-consecutive. I&#39;d work for and then I dropped at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVi-GlOY9iM&amp;t=3m00s\">3:00</a> to then I would be back up to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVi-GlOY9iM&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVi-GlOY9iM&amp;t=3m00s\">3:00</a> to. Sorry I don&#39;t mean to put times I&#39;m on talk text.<br><br>For people that can&#39;t methylate properly, any shot can be a bad shot. MTHFR SNP gene mutations.  If you&#39;re truly an intellectual you look into that. I suggest starting at beyond MTHFR Dot com. <br><br>Have you seen the elderly lady in Italy, with magnets Earth magnets all over her forehead. And they&#39;re using an EMF reader to see which region the graphene is going to show up in her brain. Well it&#39;s in the neuro cortex back left hand side. Also on the right. In these direct areas these are where we get our dopamine release. Now have you seen the studies on mice that they have done, with graphene. And directing the graphene to the dopamine region to help release dopamine and keep them happy. How they wouldn&#39;t leave the magnetic circle? I bet you haven&#39;t. Because if you did you wouldn&#39;t be here so smug at 3 minutes and you&#39;re still not touching anything. <br><br>You&#39;re absolutely wrong about measles and death and you&#39;re absolutely wrong about your vaccine facts. Absolutely wrong all right I&#39;m done here let&#39;s see if you can be a good little nerd and actually study something that makes sense.

Charasso means to &quot;sharpen a point&quot;, I find that interesting regarding the vaccine. I also find it interesting in Revelation 18:23 it says ALL nations will be deceived by sorcery... oddly the Greek word is pharmakia....Meaning drugs aka big pharma. Also in another verse Revelation 19:20 KJV says&quot;he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast&quot;! So both scriptures prove people will be deceived into taking it. There is an ingredient LUCIFERASE in this vaccine henceforth &quot;Lucifer going into you (the temple) declaring himself to be god&quot;. Its already starting to be mandatory like Quantas airlines reported and many other companies. When you are reading about the mark of the beast look up all the greek words in the verses. In revelations 13:18\u00a0 when it talks &quot;wisdom&quot; regarding the mark of the beast it comes from the greek word &quot;sophia G4678&quot;. That Greek word means &quot;knowledge of very diverse matters; worldly and spiritual&quot;. So people WILL need diverse knowledge to understand what the mark is... ex: science ( doctor&#39;s exposing this but being silenced), laws being passed like (HR 6666), patent numbers such as (202060606), ingredients like (luciferase, hydrogel, nanotechology, aborted baby tissue), and OF course Scripture. Then the next word in that verse above is &quot;understanding&quot; in the Greek means &quot;the intellectual ability and will to know.&quot; So people have to have the intellectual ability and willingness to consider the facts behind all this...rather than saying &quot;im sick of conspiracy theorist&quot; and being closed minded. And finally in the verse where it says he &quot;causes&quot; both small and great. &quot;Causes&quot; in the greek is &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%234160\">#4160</a> poieo&quot; which means &quot;makes/executes&quot; so yes there will be a level of force behind it eventually. As a matter of fact a military General already said while being interviewed by &quot;60 minutes&quot; about how he will be &quot;executing/forcing&quot; this vaccine. There is a video by Revelations of Jesus Christ on YouTube that was removed and censored by youtube,vimeo, and bitchute. The video exposes all this evil they have planned. This video interviews scientist, doctors, army generals, and of course ties in scripture. The facts are there but the enemy doesn&#39;t want you to know. If you want to see this banned video go to... RevelationsOfJesusChrist .com and watch his video on the homepage called &quot;The temple of baal&quot;. <a href=\"https://rumble.com/vcdz93-the-human-temple-of-baal.html\">https://rumble.com/vcdz93-the-human-temple-of-baal.html</a> Pray before watching because the devil is trying to keep people from watching this through technological warfare against the video.

It was reported to at least a dozen directors at the CDC.  Two are taking it seriously.  One CDC epidemiologist is moving it up to the CDC medical staff, as of two days ago.  The problem is extremely basic.  There doesn&#39;t seem to be a path for the COVID neutralizing antibody from the blood where it is formed through the alveolar wall (the blood lung barrier) into the alveolar sac where the virus is infecting lung epithelial cells.  But, my experience so far with public officials in the health field, they need to know that lots of people are watching them ...  it seems to encourage them to do the right thing.  The way to find the contact number for the CDC directors is to google &quot;hhs employee look up&quot; and you can find the directors names separately on the CDC web site.  Find their emails and their direct office numbers this way (took me forever to figure this out) and keep the pressure on the CDC to evaluate the potential fatal flaw in the vaccine paradigm.<br><br>Incredible as it sounds, there is not a single published paper on earth that shows an active transport mechanism for IgG antibodies across this wall from the blood side into the alveolar sac side.  It seems a water molecule can barely cross this wall (if water fills our lungs, we die) and a water molecule weights 18 Daltons.  If a water molecule can barely cross this wall from the blood through the alveolar wall into the lung alveolar sac, why would an antibody molecule that is 150,000 Daltons (8000 times heavier than a water molecule) be able to cross?<br><br>If these concerns are true, then the benefit of the COVID vaccine is drastically reduced. Dr. Fauci and all the directors of the NIH and FDA were informed in a 73 page letter.  Not a single reply.  I called many directors at the CDC.  More information at <a href=\"http://www.lungvirus.com/\">www.lungvirus.com</a><br><br>If in fact the current theory is fatally flawed and so far no one has been able to find a published paper showing an active transport mechanism that moves antibodies from the blood into the alveolar sac and since Dr. Fauci was warned about these concerns late last year in a very well documented email letter (and certified mail), Dr. Fauci committed a huge error in scientific judgment by not vetting my concerns or it was calculated on his part to try to sweep these concerns under the rug.  He was informed in a 3 page letter  WELL BEFORE the COVID vaccine roll out, yet he didn&#39;t address this huge potential fatal flaw in &quot;the science&quot; behind the vaccine mechanism of action.  Since he was warned (Dr. Fauci) about these concerns late last year in a very well documented email letter (and certified mail), Dr. Fauci committed a huge error in scientific judgment by not vetting these concerns. Or, was he just being malicious?   He was informed in a 3 page letter BEFORE the COVID vaccine roll out, yet he didn&#39;t address this huge potential fatal flaw in &quot;the science&quot; behind the vaccine mechanism of action.<br><br>If no one can find a published paper on an active transport mechanism for IgG antibodies from the blood into the alveolar sac, &quot;the science&quot; behind the vaccine mechanism of action is in serious jeopardy.<br><br>If the benefit of the vaccine is much smaller than previously thought, the risk/benefit ratio starts to look a lot worse.  <br><br>Think about it.  What if the COVID neutralizing antibody can&#39;t get into the lung alveolar sac where COVID and all its variants are infecting the lung alveolar epithelial cell.  That is the primary cell infected in the lung.  Then, please tell me how any vaccine will result in a neutralizing antibody that actually makes a difference in the rates of lung infection and the rates of COVID spread?  Herd immunity?  Have Dr Fauci describe scientifically what &quot;Herd immunity&quot; is.  I&#39;ll tell you what I think he thinks it is.  A &quot;neutralizing antibody&quot; that is present in the alveolar sac and binds COVID virus particles there, which prevents infection and thereby prevents transmission.  BUT, if the antibody can&#39;t pass the blood lung barrier, can it work?   LMAO.   Where is &quot;the science&quot;?   Science allows anyone with a good question to ask.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing.  I&#39;m part of &quot;the science&quot;.  <br><br>A correct understanding of how the human body reacts to COVID and understanding of the actual mechanisms are necessary to saving lives.  Throwing antibodies at COVID is not any different from using &quot;snake oil&quot; if this basic question can&#39;t be answered.<br><br>Remember, in January of 2020, 99.99 percent of the US population DID NOT have a COVID antibody in their system.  20 million people were infected with COVID and the majority recovered within 7 to 14 days.  COVID antibodies show up after two weeeks.  So, COVID antibodies had nothing to do with millions of Americans recovering from COVID.  AND, it doesn&#39;t look like the antibody can get into the lung alveolar sac (if I&#39;m wrong, show me an article showing how the antibody gets in).  So, COVID antibodies were LATE to the party and it doesn&#39;t seem like the door will open for it when it arrives.  <br><br>Forward this to the Top Health Officials managing COVID in your respective countries.  I have no idea how long it will take the U.S. CDC to review my concerns and then to issue a public scientific response.<br><br>The CDC was informed about these concerns in a 73 page letter.  The CDC was also informed that maybe they should interview the scientists at these vaccine companies to see what their thoughts are and to explain scientifically how the &quot;neutralizing antibody&quot; neutralizes COVID in the lung, IF it can&#39;t get in.  <br><br>If these concerns are correct, and it actually turns out that there is no path for the antibody into the lung alveolar sac, then when the scientific community looks back at this, it will be the most astounding thing in the history of medicine, that a potentially useless vaccine was used to inject PREGNANT women, previously a sacred area untouched by almost any researcher for almost any issue.  <br><br>Joe Lee, MD", "comment_date": "2021-06-26T18:34:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I'm Dum", "comment_text": "Im not gonna lie i actually like when i get injected by a injection it makes a weird feeling and i like that weird feeling", "comment_date": "2021-06-26T17:42:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Polar Network", "comment_text": "This is the first time on your channel and I would like to ask if you are a doctor?

Here in Australia Indigenous peoples have lived and developed rich culture continuously for more than 60,000 years. The great majority of Aboriginal people lived longer than they do now. Indigenous communities were described by Europeans on point of contact (albeit in mostly racist language) as having perfect teeth, incredible whole body health and were extremely hardy in comparison to the malnourished, far shorter newcomer settlers. Aboriginal people know how to dress wounds, just as every Indigenous culture around the world does. Just as we do \u2013 narrow leaf plantain is a common weed that cleans wounds, coagulates blood and soothes rapidly. It is our go to when we receive a wound or cut, and as we haven&#39;t shopped in a supermarket or chemist for 12 years we&#39;ve learned the right food, plants and breathing methods to prevent or heal ill health. That&#39;s why we know that the speaker in this video is suffering from a diet that is too acidic. If the body is in such ill health then something minor like a cut could reduce the body&#39;s ability to treat itself. Poor industrial food goes hand in hand with being reliant on industrial medicine, which may treat one thing while causing problems elsewhere, if taken long term. Plantain is no longer known about as a wound healing plant because it cannot be easily monetised and people have lost ecological knowledges on a scale unprecedented in human history. Therefore plantain has no status as a medicine in this culture of disconnection. People cut themselves everyday and are healed by traditional medicines and we know this because they are still successfully practised around the world. In fact most western medicine derives from stealing traditional plant medicine knowledge and then analysing it, synthesising it and marketing it. Nowhere in this video describes the difference between standard vaccines and these experimental mRNA gene therapies being used in Covid vaccines. Nowhere in this video speaks about the extensive corporate crimes of the main vaccine companies that are developing these so-called medicines. It would have been more helpful in describing why so many people are hesitant, rather than reducing everyone to anti-vaxxers. As it is this video is just a propaganda video, cementing one&#39;s own personal belief system onto the world. Lazy stuff.<br><br>When Industrial city diseases were brought to Australia with colonisation it rapidly decreased Indigenous populations. Natural immunity to these pathogens needed time to establish, but as Aboriginal people rebounded the massacres, dispossessions, competitive economy, private property and industry science \u2013 the hallmarks of disconnected western culture \u2013 smashed them apart and further eroded these long-lived egalitarian cultures. Thankfully, Aboriginal peoples have survived the arrogance and violence of modern western epistemologies, which still run rampant throughout the world. This video is another chapter of the colonial violence in this legacy. The world needs healthy connected people and to get this we need clean water, non-stressed working lives, clean food, distributed wealth, post-pollution ideology, distributed eldership (not egotistical &#39;leaders&#39;) and  we need to foreground again natural immunity. We don&#39;t need more snake-oil, greed-oriented Big Pharma products that more often than not make people more sick (esp in the long term), which are produced and distributed by climate-wrecking fossil fuels. This video is so smug, ungracious and wreaks of people who are completely disconnected from their local land and its complex biomes and processes. It is made by reductive folk who are followers of the religion of scientism, and who are not connected to the world&#39;s worlds, or the communities of life that makes our lives possible.

Worst experience was at a party were people asked me why I didn&#39;t like bloodwork. I passed while standing, fell with my head on a stone wall and got a rather severe concussion. At least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told. I have no memory of that day. I wake up in a hospital not knowing were I was or how I got there (thankfully my wife left a note next to the bed explaining the situation). That was 12 years ago. I did learn to take my fear seriously, and speak up about it. That took some time. Since that time I got about 8 shots or so. The good news, I am slowly learning how to cope with it. Last two times I didn&#39;t faint, including last week when I had my first vaccine. I&#39;m proud at myself, and really grateful for the vaccination staff who were patient with me.<br>There are some tricks to learn, first is to know that during the vaccin, you must relax, and afterwards you must not (in my case, that&#39;s the moment my body say &quot;oh, that wasn&#39;t so bad, you can drop the adrenaline levels now&quot;, and promptly my blood pressure drops so low that I faint).<br>So what are my tricks?<br>In the days before, find some good distractions that work for you (for me, music annoys me, though I generally like it. I downloaded 3 YouTube videos from The Tim Traveller, ensure no commercials, and I could just lose myself in something I enjoy watching). I also promised myself some ice cream afterwards, which I was looking forward to. My wife brought a couple of needles from the pharmacy, so I could put them on my skin, to get acquainted with the feeling of metal on my arm. That didn&#39;t really work for me, but it may help get back in control (I can examine the big needle which I found not scaring at all, or put back the cap on the small, more scary needle - tiny steps to feel in control).<br>On the day itself, come prepared. I went by bike so I had some fresh air beforehand (easy in the Netherlands were I live). Drink something before going inside. Some people suggested something sugary, though I preferred water.<br>Inside, clear tell the staff. Ask to lay down. I find myself stupid for having this fear, but no-one likes their fobia. It&#39;s the way it is, I try my best, but will no longer play it down, or accept stupid remarks like &quot;it is not so bad&quot;. Perhaps not, but I do need preparation. I got to see a doctor, explained my situation, and just needed a 2 or 3 more minutes.<br>At the vaccination station, I clearly explained that she could start once I took some deep breaths, not to tell when it started, but do tell when it finished. I also undress to my T-shirt, so there was good access. As a bonus that reduced some of my heat (it was hot that day and I was nervous). I did apologise for sweating a bit.<br>During the shot, I let my one arm rest on the table (not on my body, not to use any muscle), took some deep breaths, which reduces tension and pressure, focussed on other things, like asking the doctor if she lived in the same town (I prepared two such questions). She also asked where I lived -- I couldn&#39;t answer, because my mind was complete frozen, but that is ok. the purpose was that I could concentrate on the question, which I did. I doubt my answer was very coherent, but who cares.<br>For immediately afterwards, I brought a small tennisball and held in my other hand. I used that to squeeze hard when I felt like fainting. That worked for me at the dentist the previous time. As a bonus, I could concentrate on something else during the shot.<br>For immediately afterwards, I slowly sat up till I felt confident enough to walk away. Took 2 minutes. I walked away from the immediate place, but had to wait for 15 minutes for observation (which I disliked, but did endulge in the YouTube videos I downloaded), I added another 5 outside, before slowly heading towards the ice cream shop. (it was closed, but I took a detour and settled for prepacked ice cream from a super market)<br>All in all, bloodwork will never be my favourite pass time, but by taking control, and trying a few things that work for me, I now didn&#39;t pass out last two times.

Because the humans\u2019 shutdown of factories and their vehicles even reduced the exhaust of carbon dioxide (CO2) rising to the shield of earth\u2019s glob (mantle). So this means that coronavirus solved the climate problem; to the fact, it definitely reduced fifty percent of the rising carbon dioxide (CO2) from the earth\u2019s population to its upper climate shield, also this means it reduced much of the global warming. Indeed, this is good news, it reduces from natural disasters of floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters that they claim; because of global warming. Lo and behold! They are surprised that in the summer of twenty twenty of what they never thought, natural disasters were not reduced, a thing. In fact, floods, sea and land hurricanes, earthquakes, and others by what they call it (climate change disasters) because of global warming!<br><br>Allah by His might and His power belied them and invalidated the theory of global warming, in order for the sane humans to know that climate change disasters truly are not because of earth&#39;s global warming. In fact, the cause of it is the planet of chastisement (Nibiru) Saqar that the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni warns from it since sixteen years ago. For that Allah sent coronavirus to prove their falsification and shatters theory of global warming, in order to clear for the entire humans that what warns from it Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni since sixteen years ago that the cause of Allah\u2019s climate war is truly because of the approach of planet Saqar, then the skirmishes of Allah\u2019s climate war occurs prior of its passage as warning for the humans. Did the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni make contradiction or those who hinder (others) away from facts of Allah\u2019s signs?! The guilty criminals have contradictions and insist on their arrogance and their conceit, and whoever followed them they belittled their minds then they misled them, and they would never avail a thing from Allah\u2019s chastisement away from them, yet the coming is gravest.

Surely we were unjust.(14) And this cry of theirs did not cease till We made them still and silent (as ashes).(15)}Truthful Allah the Great; which means, their cry did not cease which is the confession about their wrongdoing but they did not ask Allah for his mercy until (Allah) made them still and silent (as ashes). the fact, belief in Allah, Him Alone, and their confession about their wrongdoing would never benefit them unless accompanied with it the supplication of mercy so they would say: \u201cOur Lord, we have wronged ourselves, if You do not forgive us and (not) have mercy on us we certainly would be of the losers\u201d; so this is an admission that they do not have except Allah\u2019s mercy the Most Merciful than all who have mercy, for the fact the argument has been held against them, surely belief alone and admission about their wrongdoing to themselves would never benefit them if did not accompany that; their supplication-prayer to their Lord by the fact of His mercy that He ordained upon HimSelf. So what do you think about the cause of the chastisement removal from the people of Allah\u2019s messenger Younus only that when the chastisement came to pass they admitted their wrongdoing to themselves, then a servant of Allah\u2019s righteous servants taught them to ask for Allah\u2019s mercy? Then they asked Allah by the fact of His mercy that He ordained upon HimSelf to forgive them and have mercy upon them and His promise is ever true by responding to the supplication-prayer and He is the Most Merciful than all who have mercy; despite that the sunna of chastisement came to them of which the belief alone does not benefit when chastisement befall nor the admission that they wronged themselves unless accompanied this asking Allah His mercy and His promise is ever true and He is the Most Merciful than all who have mercy. Verily, in this hides the secret of removal of chastisement of disgrace away from people of Allah\u2019s messenger Younus prayer of forgiveness and peace be upon him. They changed by the supplication-prayer to their Lord to have mercy upon them and His promise is ever true and He is the Most Merciful than all who have mercy. For that they change the sunna of chastisement in the Book, so Allah responded to them, indeed Allah has power over all things.

Surely we were unjust.(14) And this cry of theirs did not cease till We made them still and silent (as ashes).(15)}Truthful Allah the Great; which means, their cry did not cease which is the confession about their wrongdoing but they did not ask Allah for his mercy until (Allah) made them still and silent (as ashes). the fact, belief in Allah, Him Alone, and their confession about their wrongdoing would never benefit them unless accompanied with it the supplication of mercy so they would say: \u201cOur Lord, we have wronged ourselves, if You do not forgive us and (not) have mercy on us we certainly would be of the losers\u201d; so this is an admission that they do not have except Allah\u2019s mercy the Most Merciful than all who have mercy, for the fact the argument has been held against them, surely belief alone and admission about their wrongdoing to themselves would never benefit them if did not accompany that; their supplication-prayer to their Lord by the fact of His mercy that He ordained upon HimSelf. So what do you think about the cause of the chastisement removal from the people of Allah\u2019s messenger Younus only that when the chastisement came to pass they admitted their wrongdoing to themselves, then a servant of Allah\u2019s righteous servants taught them to ask for Allah\u2019s mercy? Then they asked Allah by the fact of His mercy that He ordained upon HimSelf to forgive them and have mercy upon them and His promise is ever true by responding to the supplication-prayer and He is the Most Merciful than all who have mercy; despite that the sunna of chastisement came to them of which the belief alone does not benefit when chastisement befall nor the admission that they wronged themselves unless accompanied this asking Allah His mercy and His promise is ever true and He is the Most Merciful than all who have mercy. Verily, in this hides the secret of removal of chastisement of disgrace away from people of Allah\u2019s messenger Younus prayer of forgiveness and peace be upon him. They changed by the supplication-prayer to their Lord to have mercy upon them and His promise is ever true and He is the Most Merciful than all who have mercy. For that they change the sunna of chastisement in the Book, so Allah responded to them, indeed Allah has power over all things. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: {And why was there not a town which believed, so that their belief should have profited them, but the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the chastisement of disgrace in this world\u2019s life, and We gave them provision for a while.} [Younus] 10:98<br><br>Imam Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni<br><br>04 - Rabi Awwal - 1442 AH<br>21 - 10 - 2020 AD", "comment_date": "2021-06-06T17:12:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alnaaem 100", "comment_text": "\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0641 \u062a\u0634\u062a\u062f \u0642\u0627\u0631\u0639\u0629\u064f \u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0643\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u0646\u0627\u062e ..<br>Disaster of corona war and climate war will surely intensify.<br>Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni<br>21 - Ramadan - 1442 AH<br>03 - 05 - 2021 AD<br>12:35 pm<br><a href=\"https://www.mahdialumma.net/showthread.php?p=348054\">https://www.mahdialumma.net/showthread.php?p=348054</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23coronaclimatewarcalamity\">#CoronaClimateWarCalamity</a>", "comment_date": "2021-06-06T16:56:30Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Nora Schwartz", "comment_text": "So I guess passing out due to needles is a real thing.

For such is an abasing chastisement.(9) In front of them is hell, and that which they have earned will avail them naught, nor those whom they take for protectors besides Allah, and for them is a grievous chastisement.(10) This is guidance; and those who disbelieve in the messages of their Lord, for them is a painful chastisement of an evil (kind).(11)}Truthful Allah the Great [Al-J\u00e3theyah] 45:6-11<br>{ \u062a\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e \u0622\u064a\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0646\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0643\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0642\u0651\u0650 \u06d6 \u0641\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0623\u064e\u064a\u0651\u0650 \u062d\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u062b\u064d \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0622\u064a\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u064a\u064f\u0624\u0652\u0645\u0650\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u200e\ufd3f\u0666\ufd3e\u200f \u0648\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064c \u0644\u0651\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0641\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0643\u064d \u0623\u064e\u062b\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064d \u200e\ufd3f\u0667\ufd3e\u200f \u064a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0639\u064f \u0622\u064a\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u062a\u064f\u062a\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u062b\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e \u064a\u064f\u0635\u0650\u0631\u0651\u064f \u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0628\u0650\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646 \u0644\u0651\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u06d6 \u0641\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0634\u0651\u0650\u0631\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0628\u0650\u0639\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064d \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064d \u200e\ufd3f\u0668\ufd3e\u200f \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0622\u064a\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0626\u064b\u0627 \u0627\u062a\u0651\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0647\u064f\u0632\u064f\u0648\u064b\u0627 \u06da \u0623\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0626\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c \u0645\u0651\u064f\u0647\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064c \u200e\ufd3f\u0669\ufd3e\u200f \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646 \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0647\u0650\u0645\u0652 \u062c\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064f \u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u063a\u0652\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0645 \u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0626\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u062a\u0651\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0630\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e \u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c \u0639\u064e\u0638\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064c \u200e\ufd3f\u0661\u0660\ufd3e\u200f \u0647\u064e\u0670\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0647\u064f\u062f\u064b\u0649 \u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u0622\u064a\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650 \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u0647\u0650\u0645\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646 \u0631\u0651\u0650\u062c\u0652\u0632\u064d \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064c \u200e\ufd3f\u0661\u0661\ufd3e } [ \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u062b\u064a\u0629 ].<br>Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni<br><br>21 -

And they would make a complete ablution to worship Allah the One, the Supreme, then they do not call on anyone with Allah, and you (should) know the sure knowledge that it is a hidden global chastisement as a cunning from Allah the One, the Supreme. And it is not a mere disease as you claim, far from, very far, indeed you shall know, so flee from Allah to Him, verily I\u2019m a clear warner to you from Him, and do not shut down His houses for who flee to their Lord to uphold prayer to their Lord, Him Alone no partner for Him, and he who enters Allah\u2019s Houses to worship His Lord he is secure from the virus of suffocation even if entered with him the infected ones who flee to Allah, surely it would not afflict the righteous worshipers who believe (trust) and rely on their Lord, so (trust) relying on Allah if you indeed are believers.<br><br>Know that coronavirus is a new chastisement of a mighty power; disease of chests, little by little until it cuts off the breath of whom Allah pleases, and who is healed from it let him know that it is not because of the physicians\u2019 treatment; rather because of his supplication prayer to Allah the most Merciful than all who have mercy, it should not be for them to find a cure-treatment for Allah\u2019s chastisement to the fact it is not an affliction for purging what is in your chests; in fact (it is) a chastisement that afflicts chests of whom Allah pleases of those whom among you turn away for they may return (to Allah), and some of you whom death makes him die by chastisement of suffocation that is what they call it [coronavirus] and it is only from the minor chastisement to many people for they may return and plead to their Lord so He would remove from them the evil of the chastisement consequently they would follow the grand Quran the True Book from their Lord.<br><br>By no means and never be removed from those who perform prostration on what they call it Turab Al-Hussein (Hussein\u2019s dust)! Indeed, Allah did not send down an authority with that; neither in the Quran nor in the sunna of the True explanatory-statement from their Lord, in fact; they innovated it out of themselves, also by no means and would never be removed from those who call on who are in the graves to remove the evil! Surely, they do not hear their call and even if they heard they would not respond to them, and on judgement day they will deny associating them (with Allah) and they would disown them and be against them. So how often we warned you and advised you to not call on anyone with Allah but unfortunately most of them do not believe in Allah unless they associate (others with Him). As well we warn the oppressors in general; their elites and whoever is next after them in countries of Muslims and the worlds \u2014from the minor chastisement of Allah and other signs of chastisement until the major chastisement overwhelm them; those who were tyrants in the land and oppressed their people unjustly then they increased mischief, indeed your Lord over them as a watchful tower.Imam Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni<br><br>10 - Rajab - 1441 AH<br>05 - 03 - 2020 AD<br>12:51 pm<br>(According to the official time of [Mecca] mother of towns)<br><i>______</i><br><br><a href=\"https://www.mahdialumma.org/showthread.php?t=39345\">https://www.mahdialumma.org/showthread.php?t=39345</a><br>..Corona-virus is from the minor chastisement before the major chastisement so they may turn (to Allah)", "comment_date": "2021-06-06T14:35:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Heba Elsawy", "comment_text": "Sungguh Akan Semakin Keras Pukulan Perang Corona Dan Perang Iklim ..<br>Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Alyamani<br>21 - Ramadan - 1442 H<br>03 - 05 - 2021 M<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVi-GlOY9iM&amp;t=12m35s\">12:35</a> siang<br><a href=\"https://www.mahdialumma.org/showthread.php?p=348332\">https://www.mahdialumma.org/showthread.php?p=348332</a><br>14<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23coronaclimatewarcalamity\">#CoronaClimateWarCalamity</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nationaldonutday\">#NationalDonutDay</a><br>vJG%NH", "comment_date": "2021-06-06T14:35:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633", "comment_text": "se intensificar\u00e1n las calamidades<br>de la guerra del Coronavirus y la guerra clim\u00e1tica.<br>El-ImamAl-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed El-Yamani<br>21-Ramadan- 1442 DH<br>03/05/2021<br>12:35p.m.<br><a href=\"https://www.mahdialumma.org/showthread.php?p=348403\">https://www.mahdialumma.org/showthread.php?p=348403</a><br>34<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B9%D9%87_%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8_%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7_%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AE\">#\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0639\u0647_\u062d\u0631\u0628_\u0643\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0627_\u0648\u062d\u0631\u0628_\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u062e</a><br>&amp;W1QOr", "comment_date": "2021-06-06T14:35:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "wael alkhamisi", "comment_text": "Quote\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47<br>\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf323\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf301\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf32021\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf3<br>O Joe Biden the new president for the American United States, you should know the sure knowledge that your masks and your vaccines by no means and never would benefit you, so do not be like the most evil of who stroke earth; Donald Trump, and I know that the difference between you and the president of the world zionist party; Donald Trump, is as the difference between those upon whom wrath is brought down, and those who go astray.

I remember years ago, when the HPV vaccine came out, there was this story about girls getting Epstein-Barr &quot;from the vaccine&quot; and it was in the news, so I asked older people in my life if they were concerned about the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and many referenced that instance as the cause of their fear of a &quot;new&quot; vaccine. <br><br>That whole thing was debunked. Actually, if I recall correctly, it was shown that of the girls that were vaccinated, they were underreported for instances of EBV, meaning there actually could&#39;ve been MORE girls with EBV in that group, and it still would&#39;ve been an average comparable to girls in that age group. The vaccine had literally nothing to do with them developing that illness. But. Most people seem to recall the crying mothers, the girls in wheelchairs, and their brains tied that into vaccine fears.<br><br>Not to mention the fact that the vaccines being given for SARS-CoV-2 are NOT new. They&#39;re just not. They&#39;ve been in development for like 20 years. People don&#39;t seem to compute that because they think it&#39;s impossible, as SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, and that part is true. <br><br>But the vaccines themselves, the tech, the way in which they work, is definitely not new. They had to figure out the spike proteins and stuff with this new virus, but they already had a solid understanding of SARS viruses. Because this isn&#39;t the first SARS outbreak, if anyone can recall the SARS outbreak about a decade ago, that was the same type of virus. They&#39;ve been working on this.<br><br>People also quote the recent recall, as if that was a bad thing, when the reality is, that should calm people even more! There wasn&#39;t even anything wrong with those doses they recalled, they thought there was a tiny chance something could be wrong, and they recalled them immediately. That demonstrates the heights of caution they&#39;re taking. That should make you feel better.<br><br>As should the accidental overdoses of these vaccines, there&#39;s been at least one in every country, a nurse/doctor wasn&#39;t trained correctly (given the immense strain they&#39;re under, everyone should feel compassion for these people, who&#39;ve given their entire lives over to fight this pandemic, many have had to live in campers to keep their families safe), and someone got 2,4,6 times the shot. And what happened? Nothing. They felt more achy than people who got the correct dose, some got a fever. And why didn&#39;t the medical community flip out in an abundance of caution and stop? Because, if you read the clinical trials of these vaccines (you should!) you&#39;d already know that they tested for this. They injected people with way over the dose they settled on, and way under, to find the minimum amount that is effective. Because the only downside of giving someone a huge dose is that they absorb what could&#39;ve vaccinated several people. It&#39;s wasted doses. That&#39;s it. You can&#39;t even say that about the bottle of Advil in your cupboard.<br><br>I feel like I type this several times a day when I venture into comment sections, but please read. Please. Stop listening to people around you, they don&#39;t know a goddamn thing. Anyone who says &quot;the vaccine&quot; is telling you they don&#39;t understand even the most basic facts about this. Listen to medical professionals trained in virology and immunology. Then go read about what they tell you. Your questions are hugely valuable. Skepticism is a good thing. But you need to seek out the truth. Questions that you don&#39;t answer simply morph into doubts. You can find the truth. You just have to read. I know we&#39;re coming out of lockdowns, and I personally find it sad that so few people took the time during quarantine to learn about this virus and the different vaccines, but you can still put aside like even 30 minutes a day to read. If I could have any impact on a person, I&#39;d want it to be encouraging self-education, because that&#39;s the spark that&#39;s sorely needed in this society. You can read and learn how you want, when you want, and you have access to all of human knowledge to cross-reference, fact-check, and arm yourself with the most powerful tool possible; knowledge.<br><br>Edit, for the record, I have been fully vaccinated since February. I got the Moderna vaccine. I&#39;m glad I got it so early (wasn&#39;t supposed to, long story, basically it was  vaccinate anyone who shows up or waste mass amounts of the vaccine) and I&#39;m glad I got an mRNA vaccine. They&#39;re not &quot;better&quot; or anything, I just closely followed their development, as DNA vaccines have been around much longer, this was my first chance to get an mRNA one. I had the typical-to-stronger response. Stronger responses tend to mean you innate immune system is responding more strongly, which is a good thing, that&#39;s why young people tend to feel worse after the shots. I am fully immunized, never missed a vaccination, and I&#39;ll definitely be getting vaccines like the shingles vaccine when the time comes. Vaccines are one of the greatest inventions in human history. We should all be eternally grateful for vaccines. Anyone who thinks differently is ignorant and simply doesn&#39;t understand. Not being mean, but that&#39;s how it is, if they understood, they wouldn&#39;t be against them. And I&#39;m from a race of people who&#39;ve had &quot;don&#39;t trust the government&quot; as a survival mechanism for centuries. I got over that hurdle by reading and informing myself.

Viruses are pieces of DNA or RNA along with another protein.  They protrude from the cell.  These occur when a cell is poisoned.  They are not the cause of anything.  The virus is not a disease it is just a symptom.  This happens every time we expose a new biological electrical device to earth orbit.  Many of you know what it is.  This is 5G.  Some just die, others suffer from it and go on with their lives.  The quote is meant to convey that people&#39;s idea of \u200b\u200ba virus as an infectious agent is wrong, and to look elsewhere for the cause of the disease.  Many dying and surviving bodies adapt to the new dangerous electrical environment and continue in poorer ways.<br>  Dr. Cowan then teaches us that the metals in the body increase the damage caused by microwave radiation.  How do you get heavy metals into your body?<br> Vaccines contain toxic heavy metals aluminum and mercury.  Nano-sized aluminum is also a prominent component of geoengineering aerosols. You can read it in Arthur Firstenberg: The Invisible Rainbow - The History of Electricity and Life  The point is also that if people understood this, the medical giants would collapse the house of cards and have no one to sell their toxic drugs and vaccines to anyone.  Big Pharma serves toxic drugs and vaccines even more than the military industries a year.

The companies and governments producing the vaccines literally have histories of conspiracies where they are willing to harm people for profit or experimentation. Without irrefutable evidence, we are left to theorize based on supporting evidence. Most topical conclusions in life don&#39;t actually have the solid proofs that people really think they do. And some theories are much worse than others. Lets be honest, the average person can&#39;t think for themselves and relies mainly on official narrative to craft their worldview. &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; was just a clever derogatory term coined by the CIA to discredit potentially legitimate ideas that stray from official narrative. They used to say the wuhan virology lab covid concept was a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; now it&#39;s treated as a possibility solely because the mainstream media/govt are allowing it to be. This is all part of a long plan to weaponize and make public the human body. It is the next frontier of global war.

She did it again after the first COVID vaccine; the nurses thought she was having an adverse reaction because she turned white, her lips went blue &amp; her hands were shaking. I was prepared for that though. The second shot, she distracted herself with a book &amp; she didn\u2019t have that reaction at all. So now she knows she can handle it.<br><br>And the magnetism didn\u2019t even occur to me after I got my vaccine. Why would I even think that? I\u2019ve had tons of vaccines for a variety of germs. Never thought about being magnetic. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-06-02T21:35:41Z", "likes_count": 230}, {"comment_by": "JM Castillo", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not scared of the needle but of the liquid inside \ud83d\ude14.", "comment_date": "2021-06-02T21:34:13Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "David Gerritzen", "comment_text": "the only time I almost fainted from a needle was because of a particularly bad stick. the phlebotomist was rather stressed and had to adjust it in my arm. the pain was the main thing that got me to pass out.

This is what is wrong with our society today you have a lot of people who can\u2019t think for themselves they let other people think for them and they can\u2019t see the big picture in the grand scheme of things they\u2019ll rather follow what big daddy government told them to do like some good boys and girls lmao this world is a JOKE!!! \u2026 but people will see in the near future that they have made a grave mistake by taking this and wish they never would\u2019ve \ud83d\udcaf y\u2019all don\u2019t like when someone brings truth y\u2019all like when people make you feel secure and safe you know big media outlets like CNN, GM AMERICA AND THE CDC AND WHO but notice how they don\u2019t tell you what you really need to know. I mean look at it now they never said before you went to go get the \u201cJAB\u201d that coins would start sticking to your arm now did they ? \ud83e\udd14 so it lends one to think what\u2019s in the vaccines ingredients but y\u2019all don\u2019t think like that though y\u2019all just some followers. Some sheeple lol Bible prophecy at its finest. The chosen ones from the most high didn\u2019t and won\u2019t by any means take that ish mandated or not. Y\u2019all people need to wake up out of this fantasy land y\u2019all in and think for yourselves and look at the reality of \ud83d\udca9, they don\u2019t want to help you they want to hurt you \ud83d\udcaf just think if the vaccine was so \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d like they claim it is then why is it gonna be mandated at some point ? If it really worked it wouldn\u2019t be mandated because people would already trust it and know it\u2019s good for them, for example when a person is hungry do they need to be told to eat ? No so why is that so hard for y\u2019all to get. Y\u2019all just don\u2019t know what y\u2019all got y\u2019all self into and it\u2019s sad but I know where my faith stands and it definitely ain\u2019t in no mans vaccinations.
