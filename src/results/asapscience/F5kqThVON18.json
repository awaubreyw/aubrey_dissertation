APE shrooms tend to cause fuzzy and colorful vision about 1-2 hours after consumption, an object or face on a person might begin to warp or appear moving in an unnatural manner compared to a fully lucid mind shortly after. Trees begin to seem more significant and a trunk may appear to vibrate and become 2D if focused on, branches may look like they\u2019re moving in an exaggerated manner like a strong breeze is flicking them up, down, and sideways. Honestly, shrooms make the world feel like a dream if taken in a bigger dose, which may seem either terrifying or very cool depending on you and your surroundings. Another thing I\u2019ve noticed is the change in perception of time. An hour may feel like 5 hours and 5 mins can feel like 30 mins, extremely weird and very slowed down. But then again, it does vary from person to person.<br><br>All in all, it is a fairly pleasant experience if you have a good spotter or two and your environment is good. I\u2019d recommend, for first timers especially, to sit outside with a couple of friends and just watch the sunset if you live more in a rural area, very peaceful, very awesome and gives a wide variety of sensations and pleasant hallucinations.<br><br>10/10 experience, but be careful and don\u2019t overdo it.<br><br>Edit.<br>Another noticeable hallucination is the \u201ccopy and paste\u201d hallucination, where things may appear to seem even more 3D than they already are, and almost seem as if they\u2019ve doubled into a colorful vapor, like the meme where things are copied and pasted on top of one another. The final hallucination is the perception of \u201cmore\u201d, where one thing may become many and that includes eyes, bugs, etc. dependent upon where you may be. Again, this may seem scary, but it\u2019s very fascinating and as long as you are aware that it\u2019s not real, then you\u2019re good.

I wanted to be comfortable and in nature so we had a little picnic in a park. Best experience in the world. We had the shrooms in tea with honey it was very yummy. At first I felt very drowsy and weird. But soon the sky looked friken beautiful, my friend looked like the coolest person in the world, all colors intensified, and perception looked different than usual. We ended up having the most deep conversations and crying happy tears, it really just made me realize that things aren\u2019t that big of a deal and calmed my anxiety. I don\u2019t think I took enough to have hallucinations, but I\u2019d love to try. I would advise not to try shrooms in a closed room unless there is something to keep you simulated or something fun to look at. Don\u2019t do it around people you can\u2019t fully express yourself around, and honestly I would suggest doing it with only 1-2 people. It\u2019s important to have a person with you in case you begin to hallucinate and freak out so they can calm you down. And overall I think it\u2019s best to do it in the daytime because colors look so beautiful. If your intention is to love shrooms, you appreciate things about the world around you, and you don\u2019t often think of dark dark scary shit all the time, I\u2019m almost positive you won\u2019t have a bad experience. I felt so weird at first but I just calmed myself down and my friend reminded me that it\u2019s normal to feel weird because it\u2019s a friken psychedelic.

We have these cool light things that look like moving space nebulas projected on the ceiling and we look at that and see some cool stuff. but that time when I pissed my girlfriend off, I started to see the villains from the 80&#39;s cartoons in the lights. It definitely was me telling myself that I was an asshole and after thinking about it when I came down, all the villains from the 80&#39;s were evil just to be evil. They are not the villains of today where they have reasons to be. So that hit me hard because I was being an asshole to my girlfriend just to be one. I came out of that with a completely different outlook on how I should bbe treating my girlfriend and I havent done something like that to her since. the 3rd time was a lot of fun but not as spiritual as the first. The weird thing about it is that you cry, A LOT. but not a sad crying, just your eyes are crying and you dont even know why. The thing about that is that your body releases all the stress chemicals through tears, so after you are done with your trip and you&#39;ve cried a gallon of tears without feeling sad but really happy, you are SO much less stressed in life.  There is also no hang over or anything and it feels like you are actually seeing things for how they really are, instead of other drugs or alcohol that mask how you see the world. My GF used to be on anti depressants and anti anxiety medication when I met her, and now she is completely off of them and she has said she is the happies she has ever felt in her life. All that after only 3 trips.

Looking at the shore, the hills were filled with red and blue eyes glaring at me (they knew..oh they all knew!). I crawled on my stomach, terrified, dragging myself along the sheets with my face buried and eyes clenched shut for what seemed like ages (on a 42&#39; boat.. maybe all of 10 feet), until I got to the cabin and just slithered over the side head first and tumbled down the steps.

I did it for the first time yesterday. <br><br>I had about 3g worth and I&#39;m considered &#39;normal&#39; (no mental conditions). It was honestly a good time. Personally, it was very different to my expectations. I expected this otherworldly experience, tripping out of my mind thing, epiphanies etc. Don&#39;t get me wrong the epiphanies did come, but not in this revelation type way the media puts it out. Rather than feeling like you yourself are tripping or being affected, it feels like the environment itself is having some alternations from reality. It is not like another world where everything is distorted but more like some distortions within the normal &#39;reality&#39;. You also feel very much in touch with ur environment, I spent most of it on the porch surrounded by my plants and even stepped into the rain for a bit. I can see the wanting to do it in nature appeal. The visual distortions were honestly beautiful for me, as people before said do it in a calming environment and with people, you feel comfortable with. I can see how people can &#39;tunnel&#39; as well, ie let a train of thought carry them away, one thought around an emotion can lead to other thoughts surrounding similar emotions, but it allows you to understand them and everything else in greater depth. For me the underlying theme was that everything is a process and whether things happen for good or for bad, it will all be okay in the greater scheme of things, and &#39;importance&#39; really isn&#39;t that important... basically, a sense of acceptance and your place in the world is manifested. That as I said before isn&#39;t a revelation type experience but more something that was cultivated just by doing you while going through the experience.

The walls, the floor, everywhere I looked. Proportions changed, everything seemed to move slightly back and forth or wobble a bit. The sensation was very shroomlike. Letters starting shifting and moving, becoming a blur of letters on a page. My hands had the same sort of aztec patterns as the walls, and I felt I could go infinitely deep into these patterns in my hands. They increased in complexity the closer I looked.<br> <br>Then it hit even harder. I realized I took way too much, and I was struggling to think straight. Things were very disconnected. I could not make sense of anything. At this point I just wanted the effect to go away, so I laid down and waited for stuff to calm down. <br> <br>While I was laying down and breathing, struggling to make sense of anything, I had some weird thoughts in my mind. I had the feeling all patterns in my life were destroyed, like the divide between days, the divide between work and free time, the divide between activities. I felt this feeling would last forever and my life would be totally without structure forever. Meanwhile I was focussing on breathing, waiting for the effects to wane. <br> <br>I decided to grab food, to wash down the shrooms and dilute them. Every step through my house was weird. Every step was a new world. When I had a glass of water, that crystal glass and clear water became my whole perception. I was in a crystal dimension. I put it down, back in the messy kitchen dimension. Everything I did was a dimension in itself. It absorbed into my entire being. I laid down again, absorbed into thought.<br> <br>This felt like hours upon hours had passed of me just laying, breathing and being in a very weird place mentally.<br> <br>When the effect eventually did die down a bit, I felt euphoric for making it through. I sat on the couch still seeing all the patterns and dancing wobbling things, but happy that I could finally think straight again. I felt a sense of profound euphoria, like I had just been on a journey and got safely back home again. <br> <br>It was pretty whacky, but nothing like some people report. I do realize though, just how scary this could be had I been in a worse place mentally. You can become ABSORBED by a certain thought process, even a subconscious one.

I have yet to have a bad experience but I do know and acknowledge that they are out there. I wanted to give my own anecdotes to provide others looking to walk the same path with information that might persuade them to do something that I think every consenting person should at least try once. <br><br>As explained in the video, they cause your brain to produce new patterns of thought. By doing so, it necessarily removes your thoughts from having to hurdle all of the cultural conditioning that played a determining role for you before you ingested the mushrooms. Without the effects of socialization determining how you identify with yourself and the world around you, you necessarily begin to understand that the nature of reality is far from what you have been cultured to perceive. Magic mushrooms force your brain into an ego death where you are able to reorient your identity with all of the knowledge you have gained throughout life, but absent of any of the external pressures that were present before. <br><br>My own interpretations of my experiences have led me to believe that life and non life are merely extensions of the same thing, the universe. Any ideas that posit relative value are entirely subjective to the human mind. There is no objective fact about reality that differentiates value between rocks and trees and people and galaxies. Rather, they are all varying symptoms of the spacetime continuum. This has allowed me to make tremendous progress in how I perceive the world around me. Morals and virtues I now understand to be subjective cultural constructs that are dependent upon the mind&#39;s capacity to conceptualize meaning. I now understand the extent to which personality is determined by social structures and relationships, especially parenting, religion, friends, partners, and the greater umbrella of cutlure. With this understanding I have crafted a new standard for my own identity to live up to that maintains a conscious acknowledgement of what it means to be human and how out of our control our brains actually are. <br><br>I now view myself as a being capable of virtue with the necessary biological mental faculties to produce the drive to be virtuous. I am born from the nihlism of the chaos of the universe and the quantum interactions that produce it, but instead of acting as though there is no greater meaning, I have been given the capacity to create it for myself. <br><br>however, our consciousness is not the only entity that stands in objection to nihilism, for the universe itself produces order amongst the chaos, but without a collective awareness for the awareness is within ourselves, in our egos. The universe is therefore god, and being that I am the universe, an awakened amalgamation of stardust, in this regard I too consider myself god. I am both of the void and naturally existing in opposition to it. Every human has this potential, and through normalizing the spiritual connection to the universe, I think we can also normalize a worldview that forces nihilism to submit itself to our will as we all become gods.

Think about it, all the Catholic traditions regarding the sacrament that make no sense for unleavened bread.  They fast before the sacrament, which makes magic mushrooms work much better.  They take it once a week to build back up tolerance.  They are forbidden to work or trade on their sacramental day, which no one wants to do while tripping.  They have to confess their sins before taking the sacrament, makes no sense for bread, but that would definitely keep them from having a bad trip in a religious ceremony. They keep the sacrament in tabernacles of gold and silver, dry dark places, perfect for storing dried mushrooms.  They continually refer to the bread as the body and wine as the blood, while a mushroom actually has a body and blood, and the blood can be boiled into water to make magic tea, or &quot;holy water.&quot;  <br><br>At some point in the Catholic history, the true sacrament was hidden from the people.  This most likely happened during the Second Great Schism when there were two Popes, and the French Pope usurped the real Pope around 1417.  Seventy years later the Inquisition happened, when they would have hunted down and killed anyone who still used magic mushrooms as the sacrament. It also makes sense that missionaries were able to spread the Gospel armed with a real sacrament like magic mushrooms, rather than some stale bread.  That wouldn&#39;t really impress too many of the people you are trying to convert.  Interestingly, they seem to have replaced the intoxicating effects of mushrooms with wine in their ceremonies, which actually has the opposite effects.  Mushrooms make you smarter and spiritually mature, but alcohol does the opposite.

The LSD and DXM opened my eyes to realize that there is more to life than what just meets the eye.  As a result, I began to take religion seriously.  I had a secular course on the major world religions in high school.  The only religion that says that we all have sinned and fallen short of sinless, perfect God is Christianity.  We can&#39;t get into Heaven because God has to punish us for our sins in order to be a fair and righteous God.  Don&#39;t you feel that the person in your life who did you dirty deserves to be punished?  I stopped drinking and using hallucinogens because the Bible says to stay sober.  God is a forgiving and loving God.  God came down among us as a human (God incarnate named Jesus Christ) to heal people and preach about love and God.  When Jesus was executed, he prayed on the cross &quot;Forgive them Lord for they know not what they do.&quot;  Jesus descended into Hell, and rose from the dead (from Hell) 3 days later, conquering death.  All we have to do to not go to Hell but Heaven forever is simply believe and have faith in Jesus.  Say this prayer: &quot;God, forgive me for my sins.  Jesus Christ, come into my heart.  I&#39;ll make you my lord and savior.  Other religions believe that it is good works that get you into heaven.  But how many good works?  What about our sin?

It felt as if my friends and i were in an isolated Utopian environment within nature. I also cherished the relationships i had with my friends at the time and how lucky we all were to have eachother and tbh i still have that feeling which i took away from the experience of a strong sense of gratitude for the friends i have and the life i live. I won&#39;t do shrooms again not because they were bad, but in my own neutral opinion that one experience was en lighting and meaningful enough for me, and i have no real craving to do it again.

I remember the feeling of my back slamming into my chair so hard that it actually aches to breathe today.  I was told I also yelled pretty loudly, but I don&#39;t remember doing this.  When my family came to check on me, I was slumped down in my chair. I could not hear or see at all during this and was unaware of how much time had passed.  When I started to gain consciousness, it took maybe another 10 to 20 seconds before I could move my arms and legs again, however it felt like a life time.  <br><br>Be safe and be with friends or family who can watch you and take care of you when you trip, guys.

A dream transitioned into something I perceived to be very real.\r<br>Of which I suspect the involvement of DMT. It started whilst I was in the midst of a dream, my dog that passed away long ago suddenly appears in this dream. After we greeted each other, I went with him knowing that we were about to transition to a world beyond what I knew, but I had no idea what to expect. As I went with my dog, I kept thinking how sure I was that I was going to leave this existence. There wasn&#39;t a single thought of doubt, It&#39;s like I was in the right mindset to trigger what was about to happen. I remember it transitioned from white to black, my vision stayed black for a little while whilst holding onto the thought. I was completely calm.\r<br>\r<br>And that&#39;s when it hit me. The dream suddenly transitioned into something that had such intense stimulus of all my perceptions. What I mean is, it wasn&#39;t a dream anymore. And It felt more real than being awake. I heard the sound of an explosion, rumbling, my mind expanded and my body vibrated. I remember complex visuals scattering, though nothing specific. Accompanied by high pitched noises. It very much seemed like I was in some kind of tunnel. At a certain point of going through this transition, I felt I was going to die if I went further. As soon as I resisted death, I woke up calmly and clear headed, in awe ofcourse of what just happened. Apart from my big shroom trip, this was the most incredible thing I ever experienced.

I was first curious about approaching this situation from a scientific standpoint, so I began an inquiry regarding the reactions that occur when using psychedelic drugs. I completed a fair amount of research on this and found the following:<br><br>According to the article \u201cThe Essential Guide to Psilocybin Mushrooms\u201d, psilocybin is the main reactor causing hallucinations in \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d. After consumption, it is metabolized into a substance known as psilocin, which then targets serotonin receptors that carry signals throughout the brain. It is mainly used for evoking more emotional response from the user, unlike antidepressants which decrease receptivity. For this reason, many scientists believe \u201cshrooms\u201d could take the place of antidepressants as a better solution to mental illnesses. To some, this might be the case, but others\u2019 experiences dictate otherwise. As mentioned in your podcast, several people have made dangerous, irrational decisions under the influence of psilocybin mushrooms. The brain is wired into an altered experience where it is unable to properly interact with its environment, so evidently, it can result in what users have defined as \u201cbad trips\u201d.<br><br>Some antidepressants, similar to psilocybin mushrooms, also interfere with serotonin in the brain. Others rely on neurotransmitters to balance chemicals which regulate the user\u2019s mood and concentration. Although different than magic mushrooms in many ways (price, contents, etc.), they both cause a distorted reality which will (normally) release users from suicidal or harmful thoughts. There are numerous types of these prescribed drugs, with the most popular brands including Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft, Paxil, and Lexapro. These drugs are often prescribed to help treat conditions such as depression and can improve the condition of patients. However, they have also been known to cause side effects such as weight gain, fatigue, and sometimes even seizures. Also, looking at Canadian statistics, around 86 per 1000 people take a daily dosage of antidepressants.<br><br>Looking at both of these drugs, I\u2019d say that neither are 100% safe, but can be of use to someone suffering from a mental disorder. With that in mind, it really depends on the individual, with each person undergoing a personalized experience. From a personal standpoint, I can&#39;t say I am familiar with either of them, but after listening to this week&#39;s episode of the Magic School Bus, I think I have an adequate understanding. Plus, I also thought it would be fun to explore more factors within this situation.<br><br>Another idea to consider is price. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, psilocybin mushrooms tend to average around $100-120 per ounce and $20 per eighth of an ounce. The brand Celexa, on the cheaper side of antidepressants, costs about $80-100 per month for a daily dose of 40mg (roughly 0.04 ounces total). A more expensive option, Prozac, charges $160-295 monthly for a daily dosage of 40mg (also around 0.04 ounces total). Examining these by cost in relevance to mass, magic mushrooms definitely have an edge on price. Perhaps something you may want to look into is the frequency that users consume \u201cshrooms\u201d and how that affects the overall price?<br><br>One last thing to add -what about counselling and therapy? In my opinion, it\u2019 seems to be a much more reliable way to cope with/fix a mental illness and I personally would put more trust in an interpersonal relationship than a prescription. Although I understand that everyone is faced with a different situation, I cannot comprehend why so many Canadians (8.6%) are using antidepressants (with others in possession of psilocybin mushrooms) when therapy exists. I suppose the right question would be: What factors cause mentally ill individuals to turn away from counselling and instead pursue questionable drugs?<br><br>Thanks for your insight on the topic, I hope that you\u2019ll consider my thoughts for a future episode of your podcast.

I would like to share my story of using shrooms for the first time ever but you must know my backstory. I was born to a teen parent, always struggling since I was a child, my mom could not pay for a licensed babysitter so in turn I was always going to random peoples houses to be looked after. Ages 6-14 I was always sexually abused by the people who were supposed to be looking and caring after me. This caused me to have severe depression, severe anxiety, and to be extremely anti social. I never went to therapy, we could never afford it. All my life after the sexual abuse and also the physical and verbal abuse from my own mother, it made me self harm and want to always kill myself. I tried 3 times before I turned 16. God wanted me to live so those attempts failed. My mom was never supportive ever. I had to tell myself to get good grades, to pass my classes and to graduate high school. I basically raised myself. My entire life has been a shit hole. I would cry every night until I was 18. I met a gentlemen who showed me what it\u2019s like to be loved. I never knew what real love was. I finally opened up another my past to him and he listened. 5 months before I turned 22 he sat me down and told me about the benefits shrooms can give you. I was very hesitant as I think if it is illegal I will not consume it. He convinced me to try it just once: I did. I took the shrooms 6 days ago. I do not cry anymore. I do no zone out like I always would and go to \u201cthe bad place\u201d, just my brain replaying all the abuse in my head from the past, it went AWAY. Now when I do zone out, I simply daydream about happy things. I can get out of bed every morning without thinking to myself \u201cwell if I kill myself I don\u2019t have to get out of bed\u201d.

Two things about bad trips.  First, taking Psilocybin under proper set and setting makes the probability of bad trips almost non-existent.  Set meaning the proper mindset.  For example, if you have a lot of negative thoughts they can carry over into and be amplified by the trip.  A trip should usually only be taken by someone of sound mind with a clear purpose (introspection, relaxation, party or whatever else).  Setting meaning you&#39;re in a comfortable place like your home and with people that you&#39;re comfortable with.   I don&#39;t know the details of how the trials were accomplished but I&#39;m willing to bet people where in environments they weren&#39;t used to surrounded by people they don&#39;t know studying them, and even with that only then 22%.<br><br>Second.  I&#39;ve had what a lot of people consider to be &quot;bad trips&quot;.  Though I chose to have these trips.  Specifically, I chose to face some military-related PTSD issues while under the influence, with a shaman and the trip helped me to be at peace with what happened.   On bad trips though, those deeply involved in the community tend to say &quot;There are no bad trips, only challenging trips.&quot;.  Everything a trip shows you is something that&#39;s in your head and sometimes facing the things in your head that you aren&#39;t comfortable with actually makes for the most therapeutic trips.  I&#39;d choose a challenging trip over a good trip any day as they&#39;ve always made me a better person.", "comment_date": "2018-09-14T01:53:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tonald Drump", "comment_text": "The way you see life changes forever after doing shrooms the first time , there is no way back... in a good way in my case.", "comment_date": "2018-09-13T03:31:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lil Wok igloo", "comment_text": "Who watchin on shrooms", "comment_date": "2018-09-10T07:21:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Orange Green", "comment_text": "He drew a good flying pig I tell u haawhaaat", "comment_date": "2018-09-09T23:08:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KroNick_Abundance Nikolaos", "comment_text": "Sooo fear and paranoia which can be managed with Xanax or valium always have benzos on hand!

The hallucinations and patterns which chamge every surface and landscape are beyond anything that&#39;s worth explaining bcs it has to be experienced. And bad trips don&#39;t necessarily have to alter those beautiful hallucinations at worst it can punch the colorfullness out of your trip and make it more greyish and stuff like trees can feel &quot;sad&quot; bcs everything points to the ground... hard to explain... anyways what a bad trip rlly is and what makes it so bad is the power of your thoughts during those trips. Every bad, existential or paranoid thought can during a trip suddenly take control over you and punches you in a dark delirious vicious circle of thoughts. These don&#39;t even have to make sense, on shrooms it can happen that for no apparent reason someone is convinced that all friends are secretly hating you or stuff like that which can rlly mess with your mind during a trip... that being said even bad trips can be teachers and can show you what your subconsciousness wants to put to the surface. Legalize shrooms and LSD! \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ufe0f This could even help avoid those paranoid trips which mostly happens bcs people are afraid that others will notice and call the police or shit like that.

They are also wildly unpredictable in terms of their effects and could result in some serious discomfort, or if taken in the wrong way or in too high a dose could cause liver problems. Some serious lack of research was done in this respect and if any other woefully uninformed people get inspired by this and go eat some Amanitas, thinking they are Psilo containing then that could be potentially damaging or at best completely misrepresent what this video is trying to achieve. The fresh mushrooms dropped in at the beginning also look more like common edible mushrooms and nothing like those commonly found to contain Psilocybin.

I\u2019ve done shrooms 3-4 times. Every time I tripped every trip seemed to start out the same way. First I would feel a strange sensation in my body then the trips started to kick in. The first few minutes of the the trip I would feel a bit sick sometimes my friends would even vomit (never happens to me) I would feel as if I were going too also but that would go away usually 20 so mins into my trips. I\u2019ve experienced two bad trips. The bad trips would make my adrenaline pump very badly and I would sweat and I seemed to get very anxious, also when you\u2019re tripping your visuals are modified in a strange way you don\u2019t hallucinate but everything seems intense, which also messed with me during my bad trips. But it seemed every time I had a bad trip was when me and my friends weren\u2019t stationary. If the setting changed like going around in public I seemed to get very paranoid and that would trigger my bad trips. Also when you\u2019re tripping it is very easily be messed with. Sometimes you\u2019ll miss interpret what someone just said to you. For example Like if you were sober you would completely be able to comprehend what someone just said to you, but when you\u2019re tripping it is easy to completely flip around what they just said and it will have you completely feeling insane. That\u2019s how I felt when I ate a cut and had a bad trip. But that\u2019s basically how your trip is on shrooms. It highly depends on your environment and the people your with because the action around you will affect your trip (if that makes any sense) My good trips tho were fun and I actually had a spiritual experience before. And also another very big thing you\u2019re mood before you go into the trip will also effect your trip. I have veered myself out of a bad trip before by just calming myself as much as I could and watching the stoned ape theory Lol surprisingly that led to more videos that led me into my spiritual trip. I\u2019ve also heard benzos stop your trip so if your tripping to bad Xanax may help but I\u2019m not completely sure about that. But I hope this helps in any way.

They accept illegal drug imports to fuel the underground drug market and then lie to us about how they will attempt to end the market. Just look at all the states that have legalized marijuana. All the states had one thing in common the year before they gained the privilege. They had decreasing cocaine, heroin, meth, and xanax users and increasing marijuana users, so they decided to legalize marijuana but tax the shit out of it and make you pay a ton to grow it. They will keep it illegal in states such as Texas that have increasing heavy drug use because marijuana honestly is a gateway drug, but it is only a gateway drug because the dealers usually offer a worse substance to the customer after some purchases.

Just a bandaid ontop of deep wounds. After 10 years of trying almost everything, I decided to tap into shrooms, which have been known to decrease anxiety and depression. What I experienced was nothing short of a miracle. During my first trip I began to experience emotions I hadnt felt fully since I was a kid (joy, wonder, awe) which I never thought id be able to have again. 3 days later I felt as though my brain was resetting itself. I can now experience life to the fullest. This plant has cured my insomnia and brought back meaning to my life. These effects last for 6 weeks and when I start to feel my anxiety coming back I&#39;ll go for a hike and trip on half an 8th of magic mushrooms. It&#39;s incredible.

The thought loops you have aren&#39;t in any language as well, when you think of someone&#39;s face that&#39;s partially what it feels like, you simply experience the thought you don&#39;t hear or think it. I remember I started having a trip where the entire world turned into insects (most of my bad trips involve insects since that&#39;s my main fear) I could only hear insect noises like crawling and buzzing to the point where I couldn&#39;t even Hear my friend talking to me and felt my skin being stung by millions of bees while maggots crawled underneath it. But you have to understand that you ultimately control the bad trip, these were all before I learned how to control bad trips, usually the only people who get bad trips are the ones who didn&#39;t have the right set and setting and didn&#39;t know what they were getting themselves into. Everyone should have one bad trip within shrooms as I saw mine as a lesson, I realized even though I was being infested by millions of bugs I came out fine and that ultimately they can&#39;t hurt you.

Closing your eyes lets your mind wander into imaginations and deep life thoughts while also experiencing a body uplift or repair of your troubles in life. In my experience; I closed my eyes while in bed and felt like my entire body had literally shattered into pieces with each piece reflecting each part of my life. I almost couldn&#39;t feel my body and felt detached from reality at some moments but keeping yourself intact is easy if you know how to handle yourself responsibly emotionally. My mind was trying to pick up the pieces to put back together slowly while questioning my inner soul and putting me at peace with some decisions I&#39;ve made. Overall, it&#39;s a funny visual high that slowly comes down to a spiritual understanding of your life. I recommend it to most but if you have deep emotional troubles or scare easily then don&#39;t do it; or at least take less than the normal dosage to see if you handle it. Real easy to overdose and spiral into a pit of doom with scary visuals regardless if you open or close your eyes.", "comment_date": "2016-11-13T04:24:25Z", "likes_count": 59}, {"comment_by": "James Henry", "comment_text": "Please do a video on LSD", "comment_date": "2016-11-09T14:35:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julian Delphiki", "comment_text": "probably cuz 22% are genuine pieces of shit...", "comment_date": "2016-11-08T07:26:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Listariadu28 Juli", "comment_text": "ok", "comment_date": "2016-10-31T12:40:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hassan Saad", "comment_text": "9000 years?

My girlfriend of 3 years and I took acid. We had already tried it about 5 other times and they were pretty amazing experiences. This last time was different though. While we were in our room tripping, i started noticing that she was saying some strange things. Obviously people say weird things while being on acid but this time it was different. Its almost like she lost her sense of reality. I tried to brush it off and tell myself that her behavior was normal but during mid trip i really couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it, so i turned down the volume from the music she had playing and I started trying to have a conversation with her, like asking her what was on her mind and how she felt, different things like that. All i got was a long blank stare and a &quot;huh&quot;. At this point i started noticing that she wasn&#39;t acting the same anymore. Ever since that day she has not been the same. She&#39;s very quite now and she&#39;s been day dreaming a lot. I can&#39;t have a deep conversation with my girlfriend anymore, she shows a lack of feelings. I feel as if she died that night and now I&#39;m living with a whole different person and all i can do is feel guilty about what happen. Lsd isn&#39;t a game, I use to think it was okay and would have very enlightening experiences, something like that could never happen to me. I would give anything to have the love of my life back. Take notice, i hope someone reads this and realizes that lsd isn&#39;t a joke. I wouldn&#39;t want anyone to go what im going through. All I ask is If you&#39;re going to take it, please don&#39;t give non to anyone else because you never know when something like this could happen.

The good trips reveal a lot and genuinely felt like they left a magical pleasant feeling, but even the bad trip also eventually left this feeling though it made me more aware of their different kinds of power.  Do not underestimate them and take way more than you&#39;re used to, go gradual for sure.  If you are new, start very gradual like 1g and wait 2 hours just in case you have hyper sensitivity.  If you are a very sensitive person, no more than a gram for starters.  My trips were usually fine with 2-3g. When I took 6g is when I wasn&#39;t used to the intensity and even the slightest anxiety could feel like a punch to the chest of panic.  If you&#39;ve had panic episodes already, then you have already experienced this sensation somewhat, at-least the fear part.  The hallucinations are not clear enough to be scary or pleasant really, just mild and your mind&#39;s interpretation of it&#39;s own hallucinations will determine if they shall be fun or scary.  You will learn much of how to relax if it gets intense and if it gets fun then you will learn more of how to express yourself.  If you are even remotely philosophical, the psilocybin will provide great joy in expanding these curious metaphysical wonders - take it as joy.

It does, admittedly, cause respiratory irritation in some cases. PG is also used, in many cases, as a flavour carrier in many artificially flavoured items. Contrary to popular belief, PG is NOT antifreeze, and should not be confused with the much more toxic POLYpropylene Glycol. Though PG is in fact <b>IN</b> antifreeze, it is often there solely to reduce the toxicity of the liquid. The fact that it has a very low freezing point is simply a bonus.<br><br>-Vegetable Glycerin (Also a humectant) VG is often the go-to for those with sensitivity to PG - meaning that, if you have an issue with PG, higher/100% VG mixes are available to you. VG is what will produce the visible &#39;smoke effect, or vapour that you see when you puff on your vape.<br>VG is commonly used in asthma inhalers, as well as incubation tanks for pre-mature infants. It is a chemical that has been widely used (as with PG) since the mid 1920&#39;s with no adverse health effects.<br><br>-Nicotine. Nic on its own has absolutely zero (proven) adverse health effects aside from its obvious, and highly addictive nature. If you drink coffee on even a semi-regular basis, then nicotine is about as dangerous as the caffeine is. Luckily, e-cigs afford you the luxury of stepping down in nic content as you go, effectively reducing your intake to zero over time, if you so choose.<br><br>-Flavouring. This is where things get complicated. Certain flavourings do in fact contain Acetoin and Diacetyl, which are both very much harmful substances. Luckily, this is yet another point that this video takes out of context. The e-cig industry, while not governmentally regulated, is in fact SELF-regulated. The common thread with most of the larger (and reputable) vendors is that any liquids sold are open to testing, and the results are often posted for anyone who cares to see.<br>The main flavours that you will see containing these harmful substances will be creamy/custard-like flavours. Even here, the industry is pushing hard for a new, non-harmful version of these flavours to be researched and produced.<br><br><br>So, in conclusion, I will never tell you that ANYTHING is 100% safe.<br>The components in e-liquid are some that have been used WIDELY for almost a century now, and have had zero resulting illnesses or deaths. These are truly a far safer alternative for cigarettes, but should be treated as exactly that: an alternative - not a cure.<br>You would be a fool to use anything in life without doing your research (in this case, both on vaping in general, and on whichever company you choose to purchase from).<br><br>NEVER let a video like this sway your judgement. Do your due diligence, and find out the truth for yourself, instead of watching a couple videos on YouTube, or any news outlet before passing judgement.<br><br><br>I hope this helps.<br>If you have ANY questions, feel free to ask, and I will reply when I have the chance (I work 3-11 EST).

Remember, although you can have hallucinations, tripping CAN actually give you a more authentic perception of many thing better than just being sober, especially the social human condition. It makes you feel more in touch with things going around you than if you&#39;ve never been high. Like the difference between reading about some war story on the news and actually being in Ukraine; you become more aware. To assume that just because you&#39;re sober, that you&#39;re experiencing the most authentic perception of reality, is an ignorant mistake. You can become so much more aware of certain things when you&#39;re tripping, its fucking crazy! &quot;this ultimately makes it harder to determine reality from fantasy&quot; thats bullshit. Is the world so greatly aware that we don&#39;t wage blatantly stupid wars for no reason or push selfish agendas just to satisfy our wants or personal beliefs? No!

For all those outside the Netherlands who saw this video and got curious about trying some, here&#39;s what I can remember from what I was told/experienced myself.<br><br>- Don&#39;t eat or drink heavily right before ingesting<br>- Don&#39;t eat or drink while you&#39;re high on them. The effects will wear off. Make sure you&#39;ve eaten enough a few hours beforehand.<br>- Do not, under any circumstance, mix the usage with any other drug (including alcohol). Things can get really bad. For example, those people who jumped off a roof in Amsterdam because they thought they could fly? Yeah. They started mixing stuff.<br>- The effects typically last up to six hours<br>- Have somebody sober watch over you<br>- Mushrooms are really gross, have some water near you to wash your mouth with afterwards (don&#39;t swallow the water, though!)<br>- Don&#39;t get on the road while you&#39;re still high on them, obviously<br><br>If you&#39;re experiencing those frightening visions or feelings, here&#39;s what you should do:<br>- Remember that nearly every one will experience such a &quot;bad trip&quot; (as they&#39;re called). They typically last ten minutes if you can take a hold of yourself. It&#39;s impossible for a bad trip to continue outside of the six hours the shrooms have an effect on you, regardless of what some movies or scare blogs/stories may say.<br>- Stay calm. It&#39;s a normal thing. It will be over before you know it.<br>- Get distracted, listen to some music, do something.<br>- Do not force yourself in trying to actively shape your thoughts. Don&#39;t tell yourself to think of happy things. This will only cause you to &quot;remember&quot; that you&#39;re having a bad trip, thus worsening or elongating the bad trip. Distracting yourself will help.<br>- If you really can&#39;t take it any longer, have some sugar and drink some water. The effects will wear off completely, though, so do use this as a last resort.<br><br>You are the boss of your own mind. The deal is that, especially on psychedelic drugs, the rules of how to take control tend to be a bit different from what you may expect. &quot;Mindfulness&quot; won&#39;t work, for example. You&#39;re far too clever, too psychologically insightful on shrooms to fall for it.<br><br>Also, know that you may realise or feel certain things you have never thought or experienced before. These things can be very personal and very painful (also very joyful, of course). Typically you get to know yourself a lot better, it&#39;s an eye-opener. For example, I learned that I find life exceptionally useless but also that I couldn&#39;t give a shit less about that. Also some other stuff, but, as I said, it can become very personal.<br>As for the hallucinogenic side of things: I started walking like a fucking madman, heaving my legs all the way up until my calves touched my breast and belly because walking felt funny; this one guy who got a lil ill from the foul taste of the shrooms started looking like a literal corpse (a greenish pale and a v boney face, nothing TWD-like); I got this near-panoramic view, as if I had switched from watching my own life on my phone to sitting in a cinema; the leaves of the trees above us started moving very calmingly, in line with the light that fell through them and idk it was just beautiful; and that was about it, I spend a good 4 hours staring at the leaves so yeah", "comment_date": "2015-03-11T16:04:29Z", "likes_count": 125}, {"comment_by": "Batman", "comment_text": "rubbing my dick atm", "comment_date": "2015-03-11T16:03:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "em1n3mfen", "comment_text": "OMG I was just gonna write you guys to make a video about this ;x;x", "comment_date": "2015-03-11T16:01:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack", "comment_text": "How can this video have 301 views when there is only 70 people on earth", "comment_date": "2015-03-11T16:00:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MattDaddy FatStacks", "comment_text": "I just remember laughing a lot and looking at a tree for an hour.
