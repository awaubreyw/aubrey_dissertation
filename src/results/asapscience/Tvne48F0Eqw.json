I messages Dr OKOYE a spell caster and he assured me there was no problem and that everything will be okay before three days. He cast the spell and surprisingly on the third day, my wife called me. I was so surprised, I answered the all\u00a0cand all she said was that she was so sorry for everything that had happened He wanted me to return to her. She also said she loved me so much.

Now I&#39;d like to stress just how awful my previous experiences with this guy were, we have absolutely nothing in common and I later found out an almost uncomfortable age difference. At the end of these questions my opinion of him - briefly - changed. Took a complete 180. We spent the next week almost inseparable, talking on the phone until 4 am if I wasn&#39;t already over at his place. My friends had no clue what had gotten into me, my dates with the guy were so bad they were legendary in my circle of friends and suddenly I went from thinking he was crazy to being crazy about him. Thankfully, he was in the process of relocating for work around the same time my friends came home for Christmas break and what I can only describe as temporary insanity came to an end.

Love is simply compassion for another and the willingness to make at least some sacrifice for them. You can love your wife to the point that you&#39;d die for them, your girlfriend enough that you&#39;d sacrifice a night out with your friends to stay comfort them through a tough time, or a girl you just met enough to shield them under your umbrella when its raining. The more we get to know someone, the more we are able to love them, as they change our lives and we really see the goodness in their character. So, of course a series of deep questions that&#39;s designed to explore a person&#39;s deepest thoughts or most secret memories will allow you to love a person much easier. It&#39;s basically months or years of friendship summed up into a 36 questions. <br><br>Love should be the basis of any relationship whether between a couple or friends. Not to mention that most people don&#39;t want to leave another person after talking with them for an hour, let alone learning so much about them. So of course they would set up dates, because who wouldn&#39;t want to meet up with a person again after doing this entire survey? Especially if they&#39;re not only attractive, but their both viewing this as a romantic experience, instead of just one that does not need to be romantic if not suggested to be such (and they&#39;re both single looking to be in a relationship). And personally, I would never kiss a girl after we just met an hour or so ago. I think they probably don&#39;t see kissing as that special of an act (or at least as special as it can be made to be), and therefore would probably kiss if they had been asked any other questions to simply break the ice and develop some sort of relationship.", "comment_date": "2016-04-19T23:14:28Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "love", "comment_text": "Oh Snap!!!

Of course, in a real date, special attention is (probably) payed to the way the other person answers questions, but it is very unlikely that a random first-date-couple would ask a set of questions to each other with the claim in their mind that that specific set of questions could &quot;make strangers fall in love.&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-04-06T23:45:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John", "comment_text": "Would this have to be in person to work", "comment_date": "2016-04-06T21:52:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aenetoniae", "comment_text": "I wouldn&#39;t dare...", "comment_date": "2016-04-06T17:31:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chill", "comment_text": "Guys i have a question ARE U FEMINISTS? plz say no", "comment_date": "2016-04-06T14:01:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Canodile Gaming/vlogs", "comment_text": "If you&#39;re in school still who is going to use this", "comment_date": "2016-04-06T02:13:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ShineyX", "comment_text": "fake because that end would never happen like that", "comment_date": "2016-04-05T20:05:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adrian Gonzalez", "comment_text": "damn I started to cry", "comment_date": "2016-04-05T19:16:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Annie Choate", "comment_text": "I like your face.

It&#39;s not a case of miraculous questions at work. These are the questions that come up naturally throughout various dates. All you did was handpick two seemingly similar people, probably both looking for someone to date, and forced them to know eachother. The fact that they&#39;re both good looking really just facilitates the whole thing, including the kiss at the end. Besides, the whole thing was rigged the moment they knew the point of the experience was to see if they fall in love with each other. they were conditioned to interpret the experience as courtship, and since there are these &quot;sciencey&quot; magic questions involved, the placebo effect is very likely to happen. Seriously, you just facilitated the interaction between two people who&#39;d proably date eachother anyway in a normal setting, if given the chance.
