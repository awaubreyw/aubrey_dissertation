mean they think it&#39;s cool, but it&#39;s way cooler to not do it I was basically in he&#39;ll for 1 year I was lucky to stand up and fight but my body is still healing I&#39;m only 18, so I know what it&#39;s like being young in this generation and how cool drugs looks, &quot;oh shit look that guy he&#39;s clinching he&#39;s teeth and he&#39;s pupils are so big I wanna know how he feels&quot; if u really wanna know then either see a video and I beg u to please look at the side effects, because if you don&#39;t do that before your cracked your gonna do it while your cracked and that gonna give u paranoia I learned all that the hard way and do listen to music with many words one word can ruin the whole song and your whole day/night can be ruined by that song, I listened to (my head is a jungle) the next day after doing cocaine and I had no side effects before the song but Boi when I realized what they said in the song I couldn&#39;t even open my door because I thought there where somebody outside,<br>If you wanna try buy 1g the u invite 1-2 friends not more because otherwise your gonna stress because your brain gets were active and your gonna notice every movement, when you buy that 1g you gonna take a okay sized line not to big not to small then u gonna split it in 2 and do it in each nostril when you have done that put that cocaine you have left somewhere long away from you so u want take it to fast people die because they don&#39;t realize it&#39;s only been 10 minutes and it&#39;s just waist of cocaine if u take another after 10 minutes your already and don&#39;t need to feel sick so take it slow, and always remember eat before doing cocaine because often you won&#39;t be hungry and drink alot of water but to much because then you&#39;ll sweat more, and I bet you don&#39;t wanna stand outside in shorts no t-shirt and still sweating my other friend did this stupid water mistake u have to drink like you would normally do but just slightly more take a sip every  7-10 minutes <br>Remember if you feel your trough is stoped just don&#39;t think about its the coacine making you thought numb you can&#39;t remove it, <br>Just promise me don&#39;t get addicted <br>It&#39;s not as dangerous like it is in movies but if you take enough I swear to God u gonna have hallucinations and u will think they are real u can&#39;t just snap out of it only for a second or 2 but that&#39;s it <br><br>Rule. 1 have a friend with u that u trust<br><br>Rule. 2 don&#39;t go to fast on cocaine your not gonna get a good high its gonna be a nightmare<br><br>Rule. 3 when you put your cocaine on the plate go around 1km away from your house and place your cocaine there trust me it&#39;s smart nobody wanna go so long everything but don&#39;t cheat and take it home once you want more of it<br><br>Rule. 4 drink like a normal person it&#39;s okay to drink a little more than normal but don&#39;t over do it your gonna sweat everywhere and everyone can smell your sweat cuz cocaine and amphetamine makes your sweat smell gross your sweat is never gonna smell more when snorting<br> <br>Rule. 5 eat before snorting <br>If you don&#39;t eat you can get a overdose by just a little bit of cocaine <br>Buy snacks too both salty and sweet give your body something to work on while snorting because cocaine makes your things but amphetamine it&#39;s the nr 1 best thing to get skinny on but don&#39;t even think about you gonna die before burning that fat<br><br>Rule. 6 if your TV og speakers begin sound like it&#39;s coming from behind turn it of talk with your friends and, cocaine can effect the brain to think that when a speaker is infront of you playing your can&#39;t figure anything out so the sound comes from behind but it&#39;s not directly the music you can also hear footsteps or you gonna feel someone is right behind <br>And if your feeling that then just put your back against the wall btw you should still turn of the music/TV because the sounds still come from behind and your just gonna look like an idiot lookin back at a wall 24/7<br><br>Rule. 7 if your stomach starts moving weird don&#39;t worry if you worry about it it&#39;s it&#39;s get worse and everything  is about if you start to think about stuff just for 10 seconds or so your making the paranoya bigger and then eventually takes over and u can&#39;t control it<br><br>Rule. 8 keep talking with your friends <br>Don&#39;t stop for the most part when you have got a okay amount your just gonna speak and u won&#39;t stop like u can&#39;t stop really only if your really thinking about because of family getting or sum, but yeah don&#39;t stop talking and tell eathother how you feel and what your experience a friend of mine didn&#39;t tell what he was facing when we were snorting cocaine, and I could just see he was about to be a goober so I said bro I need to speak up, and beacuse he hadn&#39;t spoken or interacted with me, he was completely stoned out so I went down in the kitchen got some water and I directly said to him, you ain&#39;t stupid I know so know your gonna drink this water I don&#39;t care how u do it you just need water in your body, so he drank it and he where fine 10min later<br><br>Take care guys hope u learned a little <br>And btw I&#39;m snorting rn with my good childhood friend<br>Pop that white stuff and you&#39;ll be cuffed by the cop but bruf they ain&#39;t tuff let&#39;s gather up and show them why we the boss<br>\ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2022-06-20T08:41:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YOUNG BOB PROCTOR",

JESUS SAVES EVERYONE IN THE END!!! THE LAKE OF FIRE IS NOT FOREVER(see links below for proof). DEATH IS REAL. Those that die have no consciousness whatsoever, there is no afterlife (Ecc 9:4-10, Psalm 6:5, Psalm 30:9, Psalm 88:10-12, Psalm 146:2-4, Psalm 115:17, Acts 2:34, Isaiah 38:18-19, Genesis 42:13,36,Lamentations 5:7, Psalm 39:13, Matthew 2:18 see below for biblegateway link) \r<br> \r<br>However, 2000 years ago a man named Jesus was born, he was the son of God. God, who always existed, begat Jesus, Jesus did not always exist. First there was the Father, God,  then came his son. Jesus really is Gods son. Jesus has been given office and title and powers of God (God the Father always had these, Jesus did not, that is why God the Father gives these things to Jesus) but he is not the same being as his Father. One is immortal and could never die, the other is mortal and can die. Jesus before he was borne made everyone.\r<br>Jesus lived a perfect life, and died on the cross as a substitute for you and all the bad deeds you have committed in your life, these bad deeds are called sins, we are all sinners, and the wages of sin is to suffer and eventually die.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>3 days and nights later after being totally dead (he ceased to exist and was in a lifeless corpse) in a tomb, God raised him back to life and Jesus ascended into heaven. \r<br>\r<br>Thanks to this he defeated death and sin once and for all for everyone. Since he was sinless he could die in your place. Jesus on that cross paid for all mankinds sins, the Father has accepted the payment. Everyones sins have been paid for, hence all are saved. At this momment though not all are justified (declared not guilty, sinless), justification is for all and upon all who believe. Eventually everyone will believe. Some sooner others later. \r<br>\r<br>Thanks to this, everyone will one day attain immortality and enter into the Kingdom of God, the lake of fire exists for some but it is not forever. Gods judgements are measured. In the end Jesus saves all. The cross grantees the salvation of everyone who ever lived. We have no free will. God gives faith to anyone he chooses. In the end he will give faith to all. \r<br>\r<br>proof that hell is not forever, the reason it says so in most bibles is a mistranslation of the words olam/aion/aionios (start here then go over to the 2 gospel section at the end)\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.hopebeyondhell.net/articles/further-study/eternity/\">https://www.hopebeyondhell.net/articles/further-study/eternity/\r</a><br><a

That&#39;s why a single cup of beer in your first try is really nice, but after some time, you can&#39;t feel any better even with 2 dozens of cans. As your brain becomes tolerant to dopamine high levels, you will look for heavier stuff and that&#39;s why beer lead to tobacco, then weed and then lead to worse things, all this while passively making you more apathetic, impatient, as if the simple pleasures of life, as to read a book, exercise or even a conversation with some friend weren&#39;t possible, because, well, your brain is literally rising the minimum level to be pleased (Yep, that&#39;s the tolerance). Anyway, i could tell there&#39;s no safe ammount of dopamine stimulants. You should just let your body use your dopamine system as naturally as it was built to be.

Crack is 5x as addictive as coke, lasts about a minute for a buzz vs the 30-45minute buzz for coke and is $20/rock. So that&#39;s 20 dollars a minute. A $100 gram of coke usually satisfies people for a whole night with a 3.5-gram 8 ball ($250) being the most usually for even hard addicts. The most I&#39;ve spent on crack in a night was $1500 (1/4 oz or 7 grams) vs $250 for a 8-ball of coke. If you know the right people you can get a gram of crack for $100, most of the time you&#39;ll be paying $20 for a &quot;piece&quot; (.1 gram) with 90% of dealers. Crack is often portrayed as a poor man&#39;s drug, its the exact opposite. Yes its $20 for the smallest amount, with cocaine usually being sold in half grams for $50 bucks but considering that half gram of coke will keep you high for 45mins max and that 20 dollars on crack will keep you high for a minute or two, which one do you think is going to cost more?", "comment_date": "2020-07-21T01:12:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Skinner", "comment_text": "And That is just One of the reasons not to do it", "comment_date": "2020-07-19T21:20:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WizardWrld", "comment_text": "I want some crack I want some crack marlone Webb I want some crack", "comment_date": "2020-07-19T03:44:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yung Psychonaut", "comment_text": "Hard to swallow pills:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\u00a0cocain/crack is objectifly a shitty drug", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T15:07:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "workingusername", "comment_text": "If it wasn\u2019t for the propaganda, people would have a totally different view towards amphetamines.

PLEASE READ.<br><br>On October of last year when i was 19, while i was very drunk, a 31 year old (who i thought to be) ex heroin addict i lived with at the time asked me if i wanted to try a drug called crack. She told me that it was safe and she wouldn&#39;t give me anything addictive, and i trusted her because she was the one who rolled my joints for me etc etc. She knows a lot about drugs. I spent \u00a360 on crack the first time i tried it and found out it was one of the most addictive drugs ever the morning after and never ever did it again. Ever. <br><br>Now here&#39;s why i need help. When i did crack i have a complete memory block. I remember parts of it like falling into the shower and took the doors off it, and banging my head against a sink; i needed her help to use the bathroom. I was covered in bruises the next morning and it took a while for me to remember i fell through the shower etc. I have another memory of me crying at the foot of her bed and her shouting at me but it&#39;s a split second memory and im unsure of it. all of it is blacked out. when i came back to consciousness or sobriety however you wanna call it, sorry i don&#39;t know much about crack, i looked down at myself and I was in a new set of clothes and i had no memory of ever taking my clothes off? I asked her what happened and she said i stripped off or something, i can&#39;t remember her excuse maybe spilled water. But she gave a reasonable explanation and i believed her.<br><br>Yesterday i had a fight with the next door neighbour, it was a pathetic verbal argument just a lot of calling names nothing serious. Typical scenario of one girl caling me a slag and me sticking up for myself.<br><br>But one of the things she shouted at me was, &quot;at least i didn&#39;t inject crack and you slept with her! She admitted it to me!&quot; referring to the 31 year old woman who i used to live with. I&#39;m not even gonna bother and say i didn&#39;t inject it, i smoked it i don&#39;t even think you can inject it anyway. just including that bit to show how stupid she was tbh.<br><br>Normally i wouldn&#39;t believe her about anything she says, but now it&#39;s been playing on my mind like crazy because i have no memory whatsoever and also just the experience of crack felt weird. Complete blackout memory, a compete gap. is this normal? because im starting to worry that something else was involved, as after i did crack and was sober, the 31 year old had another substance. Heroin. She did it in front of me, chasing the dragon she called it. I don&#39;t remember how she got it but i remember her smoking it. I&#39;m not saying i was injected with heroin because let&#39;s be honest why would she do that? But im saying she had more drugs, different kinds. <br><br>Can someone tell me if it&#39;s normal to have a blackout memory on crack cocaine? Please help.

There are harm reduction programs that can help people get off of their dependency.<br><br>The problem is that most people who use it consider themselves to be a part of a very large group of people who&#39;ve used crack cocaine in their life and that group of people are cruel to the people who haven&#39;t used it. In fact, many of these people are such goofs that they attempt to turn people who haven&#39;t used it into their garbage bags. You know, by using it near someone. By buying or selling it in a transaction while someone sees it happening. As if by doing so, the other person becomes responsible for those habits of other people. Kind of like transference and criminal substitution. If most people who get burdened in that way never figure out that they&#39;re being used in that way, it seems as if it remains a protected secret for a very long time. The incentive for most users is to make other people responsible for their habit. To carry the weight of that secret so they can live pressure-free with regard to their habits in that way.<br><br><br>Another problem is that the people who import cocaine and heroin tend to be anti-Government or a part of a minimalist Government based ideology as most organized crime is. In fact, many people in on that supply chain use that power to control the people who are addicted to those substances in order to use them as their army in society. If you control the supply chain for an addictive substance, you can control the people who are dependent upon it. Crack dealers have been doing that to prostitutes for ages. Much the same, the people in on the supply chain use their power to control the users of the substance. There&#39;s a lot of power in that circle and a lot of corrupt people who facilitate the movement of cocaine throughout society. Having an army of people who are dependent upon that substance must be quite the power to have in society. I&#39;d be willing to bet that if you got in the way of their goals, that you&#39;d probably become a victim of that army, especially being an enemy of the people who control the supply chain.<br><br><br>Consider that harm reduction reduces that power, and is, therefore, a tool to protect Government itself, though as I stated, the Government doesn&#39;t use their supply chain over methadone to control substance abusers the same way that cocaine importers,  couriers and dealers do. In fact, if any anti-Government groups were going to secretly overthrow the Government, I&#39;d be willing to bet that they would fund it with the proceeds of narcotics distribution like cocaine and possibly heroin. They&#39;d have the advantage of creating an army to protect them while they attempted such a feat, by controlling the supply chain of the people who depended upon such substances.<br><br><br>I&#39;ve never used crack cocaine or cocaine in my life, but I&#39;ve had people attempt to transfer the responsibility for their habit in that way to me and to the point that it nearly destroyed my life. When you&#39;re targeted by such an attempt, often it involves many people from the community. There&#39;s currently a secret underground economy that is protecting cocaine and crack cocaine, and attempting to hide it, and discredit anyone who exposes it, including by painting them as being a user of it and using the people dependent upon it to accomplish that goal. I mean if you supply it, you could likely pay those dependent upon it with the substance itself or deny it if they aren&#39;t doing enough to smite informants or people who expose their underground economy.<br><br>Most things of that nature would also work on a barter system for payment because it leaves no audit trail for investigators to track. I&#39;d be willing to bet that organized stalking is likely run by organized crime many of whose foot soldiers are people who benefit from this supply chain of cocaine (which can be cut and refined into crack cocaine through many different stages from source to destination). Each time it is cut, to increase its yield which doubles its profits. So if it&#39;s cut four times, it is 16 times its original value. A million-dollar quantity of cocaine quickly becomes twenty million by the time it reaches the streets. That&#39;s the power to control a lot of people and to build quite an army.<br><br><br>One thing that&#39;s quite noticeable about it too is that most people who become dependent upon it tend to be more concerned with breaking religious law than they are about breaking civil law. I&#39;d say there&#39;s a good indicator that some anti-Government religions are involved in its protection and likely benefit from the army of people dependent upon it. They probably mutually protect each other and would be against harm reduction because that undermines the power of the dealer over those dependent upon the substance and those who benefit from their power over the supply chain, who likely get rewarded for that.<br><br><br>Imagine if everyone dependent upon crack cocaine one day just stopped using it and only took methadone that they received from the Government. Can you imagine the shift in power that would happen as a result? A whole segment of the population who suddenly were in control of their own lives and getting what they needed to deal with their substance abuse issues without the people providing it controlling them or manipulating them by limiting their supply? What about all the women who ended up as prostitutes controlled by the dealers who were in charge of their supply. Could you imagine how many women that would save if they all stopped using crack cocaine and instead relied on methadone to help them get off of it?<br><br><br>I bet that would make a lot of cocaine distributors very angry, and help the honest members of Government and law enforcement immensely.<br><br><br>Something to think about.", "comment_date": "2020-03-17T08:59:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Campbell", "comment_text": "But that\u2019s not a crack pipe.", "comment_date": "2020-03-17T05:42:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M R", "comment_text": "Me: <b>Minding my business</b><br>YouTube: hey kid you wanna smoke crack", "comment_date": "2020-03-16T13:31:37Z", "likes_count": 1459}, {"comment_by": "Cory Lee", "comment_text": "What is drugs?!", "comment_date": "2020-03-16T03:24:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H60D Baby Snaps", "comment_text": "I\u2019ll just stic with LSD\u262e\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-03-16T00:37:46Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Olson", "comment_text": "this is why i stick to video head cleaner", "comment_date": "2020-03-15T21:49:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AlmightyAustin", "comment_text": "I&#39;m good with Mary Jane and Lucy.", "comment_date": "2020-03-15T11:09:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Loc Dawg", "comment_text": "So this is the cure for corona virus", "comment_date": "2020-03-14T03:13:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "McLennon Georingo", "comment_text": "Smh, you\u2019ll cowards don\u2019t even smoke crack smh \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-03-13T02:02:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Senzi Guru", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxI7PTVRfhQ&amp;t=1m07s\">1:07</a> Soo after all these years we still haven\u2019t noticed he misspelled energy", "comment_date": "2020-03-12T23:14:44Z", "likes_count": 51}, {"comment_by": "SirKalash96", "comment_text": "Junkies tfoe kheba\u2019s", "comment_date": "2020-03-12T14:37:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SBC KEV", "comment_text": "I like smoking once maybe twice a year, I do 1 an done.

They left out how bad that feeling of wanting &quot;more&quot; so much so you can quickly lose your belongings (I say this first cause addicts are self centered), Jobs/careers, family, friends, just for the next high. This all can happen really quickly too, like in less than 6 months or even in a week this can happen. When a crack addict is between highs they are extremely irritable, and can be violent just for the next high. So obviously they will; lie, manipulate, steal and fight for their next high. The feeling of wanting &quot;more&quot; is a ridiculously strong feeling right after the ten minutes of the high. To such extremities that they become utter careless of themselves thus they wouldn&#39;t care for you. Don&#39;t try to help a crack addict quit without them wanting help to quit. They don&#39;t tell you crack addicts can be junkies and inject with a syringe into a vein. Also run into similar problems as a heroin addicts, dirty needles, missing veins and dirty substance. If there is any other way to consume Crack there is very good possibly an addict is trying to do it right now. Each addict never sought to grow up as an addict and an addict once had family, and friends in their life. So many families have lost a family member to crack and many other drugs too, most likely you know a friend or family member already who does drugs. Maybe you know they do the drug or you may not know cause they hide it from you.

Stimulants enhance the effects of these chemicals in the brain. The associated increase in dopamine can induce a feeling of euphoria when stimulants are taken nonmedically.

I believe it&#39;s a social stigma effect, more than any other reason (cocaine seems to be the drug of the rich, while streets opiates, like heroin, are often associated with less glamourizable users such as homeless bums). <br>Opiates are actually NOT toxic and, despite the fact that their use leads to physical dependence, they present a vast number of beneficts, while most stimulants (like coke or speed) have little value beyond their (short) &quot;feel good&quot; rush. Opiates also create a slow release dopamine effect, wich is way more healthy than the fast up-down effect provided by stimulants. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s important to have dopamine in the brain, in fact the longer you go without good levels of dopamine in the brain the more likely you are to develop degenerative problems (like parkinson), but while opiates contribute to prolonged high levels throughout the day, stimulants not only hold it there for some mere 5 or 10 minutes, but actually burn out the capacity of the brain to absorb dopamine in the long run (it eventually comes to a point where the brain CAN&#39;T absorb dopamine, no matter the amount of stimulants you use). <br>Forget what society and media tells you. Opiates are NOT worse than stimulants.

Well the chemical compound that reaches the brain is, but there is a big, big difference in the actual neurological effects which make crack much worse. When cocaine is snorted, it slowly dissolves into the mucus covering the inside of the nose, and slowly seeps into the blood through the skin, meaning the brain will experience a slow gradual increase in the amount of drug it is experiencing during a 20-30 minutes period and then gradually decrease. That means the cocaine itself will protect the neurons from the oxidative stress the drug is causing. The brain will also have time to slowly adapt to the change. But when crack is inhaled, the brain is brought from zero cocaine to a full dose in 5 seconds. The end result is that crack is much, much more damaging to the brain, and its effects on one&#39;s mental health and abilities are also far greater.<br>I think it is a mistake to put crack and cocaine consumption in the same category, and also a bad thing for the purposes of prevention and education, as someone believing the two to be on the same risk level who already consumed cocaine in a festive context is more likely to try crack if it is proposed to them.<br>Also, and that&#39;s on the other hand more or less nitpicking, crack isn&#39;t smoked really, its inhaled as a vapor. Smoking would involve a chemical reaction resulting from the heat of an oxidative reaction (burning of a cigarette).", "comment_date": "2015-03-11T22:52:03Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Toni Cipriani", "comment_text": "IM IN LOVE WITH THE COCO!!", "comment_date": "2015-03-05T23:47:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr S Is the Best", "comment_text": "hope this video didn&#39;t inspire anyone to take up a crack habit", "comment_date": "2015-03-01T21:12:54Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Leonora", "comment_text": "Would be interesting if you could make a video in the future about how smoking affects your body.

But, people don&#39;t use drugs because of the downside.<br><br>My hope is that, in the future, we engineer designer drugs that offer all the positives of the best drugs...without any of the negatives like overdose, addiction, and withdrawal. If we can create such drugs, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how prudish control freaks react.

Wether its, hate, poor, stress, fear. We need to help each other out of it and have peace of mind. Not only us but the animal kingdom as well. Using psychedelics and meditation we can speak to the animal species with our spiritual voice. then they can speak to the animals below them, then them to them then them. etc. Then we will all work together to have food. and face each others differences. no matter how different. We can perfect the system and rebuild the base if needed. Then once when every one becomes self concious, using psychedelics we can surpass every bad feeling, and transform, together, into something unique. And help each other have fun with it. So we no longer have worries.<br><br>Post repost fuckin like!!! We need to make a plan, and forgive each other.

Taking these drugs changes your body&#39;s chemical dependency in a real, physical way - that is what addiction is and why it&#39;s so hard for people to quit once they start, because your body is ALTERED by these drugs into requiring more and more dopamine levels via when your body produces more receptors to anticipate intake of unnaturally elevated levels of dopamine. But what happens when those receptors get nothing because you&#39;re not on crack? Disaster. Depression. You screw up your own body&#39;s dopamine/reward system when you take crack cocaine so that it no longer functions normally and you become more dependent upon the synthetic dopamine high from crack.", "comment_date": "2013-11-22T02:34:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashley O", "comment_text": "all drugs are bad.", "comment_date": "2013-11-22T02:32:17Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "I don't comment often", "comment_text": "I dont smoke crack, i just cook it up and sell it!", "comment_date": "2013-11-22T02:31:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Caterina Eremondi", "comment_text": "Burning Question: How do pain killers work?
