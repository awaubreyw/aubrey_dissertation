My other buddy and I each split two pitchers of beer, so basically we both drank a six pack. Bar closes, and DD friend takes us to our buddy&#39;s place. I was still very hammered, but DD friend pulls out a bubbler they had in a stash box in their car and a grinder full of kief, packs the bubbler, and hands it to me. I took a huge hit, and within minutes I had the most intense episode of dissociation in my life, while puking my guts out over the balcony. Rambling like a madman about nothing while also bawling my eyes out, which never happened before. Legit was the worst experience I&#39;ve ever dealt with on both alcohol and marijuana.

One should never mix alcohol with weed. That just muddies the holy waters. If you ask me ( and it&#39;s not like I&#39;m jesus or anything), &quot;hi my name is Michael by the way.&quot; God made the cannabis plant unique to us/ gods children. The result is hungry, happy, Sleepy, and slowed motor and brain function overall. So with this in mind and the fact that you can not overdose on cannabis by smoking the flowers as intended. I mean you reach a certain point where smoking more is just a waste anyway. But yeah given the symptoms you should only smoke when your off work and or when the kids are in bed or at least on their way to bed or in the bath. It will slow you and your brain so don&#39;t go to work high or be around your kids like that. It doesn&#39;t leave a good impression. Sure you may tell them hungry, happy, Sleepy and weed never killed anybody. But you will be eluding them to use weed at work or school like you do. As if sobriety/ the way God made you isn&#39;t good enough. That&#39;s not the right way of thinking or living being high all the time. Sometimes sure like I said before bed or out for the weekend fishing trip. Nothing to do on this one occasion but relax and chill. Become one with nature and just melt into relaxation right. The same is true of drinking. You should not find comfort however, in drinking every night. This just leads to other problems and the potential for abuse will arise later in life I assure you of that. So keep them separate and live well. Play hard sure but don&#39;t be a junky. Life is good even when it is not good. So before you take a smoke or a drink. First tell yourself that my life is not going to bet better because I  smoke weed or because I drink. Your life, your wife, your job, and your kids can not be the reason you drink or smoke. Like smokey the bear said &quot;only you can prevent forest fires&quot; meaning that only you just as God made you sober. &quot;Only you can reach out beyond this flesh for the love of God and the love of all things. Only you can fulfill your life to do what it us your heart desires. Case and point the bible is B.asic I.nstruction B.efore L.eaving E.arth wrapped in parables to aid our understanding of our true divinity and destined purpose. Fulfillment can only come from the heart of God In you combining your faith and reason as we read the bible to unlock its parables and mysteries its truth and its allegory. In doing so we find God for all other questions within our own hearts. So gods given us all free will. So since it is just as impossible for the individual will to fight the universal will of God. So to is it impossible to leave this earth and gain eternal life without God. God is love. God is in our hearts. God wants us all to fill our lives with joy to our hearts contentment. To our hearts fulfillment. To truly harness free will we can not deny then, God in our own hearts. Each and everyone of us have tried to do so. When we lie or deceive one another or lie to ourselves seeking selfishness, and materlisim. Covetousness will not fulfill you, likewise the ego is the imagination of your own evil heart. None of us will ever live up to our own image. That is why like God, we must fulfill ourselves from the heart to be our guide. We must govern our hearts by the will of God as spoken by the son of God jesus and his wife Israel as we are her children  and the rest will fall into place. A disclaimer upon those who might worship jesus and not God. Jesus said in revelation chapter 19 verse 10 and they fell to their knees to worship the son of God and jesus said &quot; Do it Not.&quot; &quot;For I am thy fellow servant, worship God for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of gods prophecy on the earth&quot; to those who worship the devil or believe in hell please read the one true book of revelation the book of Jeremiah chapter 16-19 and remember that jesus was born and died a jew. Jews who do not believe in hell. Those who followed jesus at the time of his death were also Jewish. Because if you would but read the bible for yourselves you will find the teachings of christ will fulfill your life with greater purpose and responsibility to God and man. As jesus tought that when we die we rise into the heavens to serve God. Key word is rise into the heavens; plural is the word. God and eternity is their for those who seek it. So do not be misled or fed dogma after dogma by the church. God says in the book of Jeremiah 16-19 that wicked, the devil, and hell never came into gods mind to do or create. That those who would make alters to God believe in falsehoods. God says such alters, burnt incent and offerings up to God. They are all detestable to God. Saying that it is I who created you the heavens and the earth. What need do I have of such offerings or alters. God says in  the book of Jeremiah that God is the heart God says i tried the reins and giveth every man according to his works. Trust the heart of God in You and the rest will fall into place.

I gradually got more into it, I had family with substance abuse problems so it was a bad idea for me to tempt fate. I began drinking at the same time as drinking was apart of the college culture and ended up complimenting the weed perfectly. Once I graduated properly I got an almost 6 digit sum of money left over from my dads pension and my grandparents saving for me, I ruined everything with it, I spent thousands that first few weeks alone on weed, Alcohol and sometimes hookers.<br><br>I spiralled for over a year and it got worse, I rarely left my room, I was living the high life off this money and I was losing it faster and faster. A year turned into 2, I stopped communicating with people back home, I\u2019d ended staying out where I studied. The only family I have left is my uncle and aunt who I respect more than anything, but they saw my dad go down a similar path so I kept it from them to spare them the pain of history repeating itself. I\u2019d torrent all the shows and films I could ever want, bought the best consoles and video games and I have turned myself into a anxious wreck. I tell myself I was anxious before this habit and claims that the smoking and drinking relieves it, I can\u2019t tell anymore. <br>2 years turned to 3, I think my uncle has clocked on what might be happening. Still, every night, I drink the same amount of alcohol I would\u2019ve normally done on New Year\u2019s Day, except every day. I\u2019d stick to a system of 2 cigarettes then a joint, I\u2019d do that up to 10 times a night whilst drinking. <br><br>3 years became 5, I know I\u2019ve missed out 4 but that\u2019s because 4 may well have not existed, it\u2019s become a haze, I\u2019ve been on this sort of autopilot now for at least 2 years maybe 3 or more even.<br>The money began to properly run out around this time last year. Iv tried getting jobs (throughout the 5 years) but this habit destroyed every one of them, the amount of places I lasted a single day it would be ridiculous. <br><br>I started receiving welfare about 8 months ago, it\u2019s not enough to cover my addiction obviously, I can clean to my uncle and he was just as sorrowful as I expected. I sit here now on March 13th 2021, I\u2019m about to go into my overdraft and I\u2019m scared because I can\u2019t stop. Crazy thing is, this money I inherited came in 2 instalments, I remember when the first lot ran out and I got into debt I remember hating myself, all my money is gone I\u2019ll never screw up this bad again, thing is, I didn\u2019t know I was due to get any more money, it just happened that way, and I\u2019ve done the same thing again, this time there\u2019s no get out clause. <br><br>I have the last of my weed here rolled already now, which is enough to last me tonight, I plan on going out to get a gallon of 7.5% cider for tonight to drink along with smoking. Tomorrow I have a choice, in fact I have a choice now but I\u2019ve already decided to what I\u2019ve just said. I go into my overdraft if I pick up tomorrow, or I stop, but everytime I\u2019ve tried before I have failed and I\u2019m almost certain I will fail again, I say this because I needed to write something down about it.

Also sour cabbage soup (idk how to properly call it in English) is one of the best things you can eat during hangover. Google sour cabbage soup, it&#39;s very popular in my country, in Poland, in Ukraine, in Russia. Sour cabbage soup + weed during hangover is an ultimate cure, you will feel like a new person after. In the summer me and my friends were camping in the woods, by the lake, we all got drunk as hell the first night we stayed there, the next day everyone were as good as dead, but we had a lot of weed, everything we need for soup, everything we need to make food on campfire and we made that soup.

Somehow I found out that someone had weed on them so me and a few people went out and started smoking. When I got back in I felt very chill and relaxed, then suddenly I saw in tunnel vision. I tried to ignore it but it gave me the creeps. Somehow I managed to get into the bathroom and I fell over the toilet. I was throwing my guts out. When I was done I fell asleep on the floor, I don\u2019t know for how long but remember waking up and hyperventilating. I didn\u2019t know what was going on but looking back at it I know that I had a panic attack. I thought I was going to die. I chipped for air but there was no air to breath. Drunk and high I unlocked the bathroom door and ran into the kitchen. I sat down with some drunk friends at the dining table and I was freaking out. Both my arms and legs went numb and I thought I was dying, it was horrible. I started screaming for ambulance and someone to rescue me but people just stood there in shock. Today I don\u2019t blame them, they didn\u2019t know what to do. It was this one girl who helped me tho, she gave me a glass of water and helped me get outside to get fresh air. I threw up once again, I think I\u2019ve never puked that much in my entire life. Somehow I got into a car and managed to get into my friend\u2019s apartment. The rest I don\u2019t remember.

I&#39;ve been a daily weed smoker for 19yrs now! And Evry time I drink I want to smoke it makes me crave weed cuz it counters the negative effects from the alcohol. But I HAVE in the past ACTUALLY find it easier to vomit if u NEED to do so like if ALCHOHOL poisoning occurs I&#39;m sure the body will force u to vomit! As it&#39;s done with me and I&#39;ve seen several other ppl do so as well. But I don&#39;t plan on ever getting THAT drunk AGAIN!  To where I need throw up! ugh I hate getting drunk. But the thought of taking 2 shots at night to go with my nightly joint sure. Get 2x the THC maybe THIS FACT CAN HELP patients who are young n able to drink st ill and need to make their weed last longer as I&#39;m finding it hard to get 72 days out of my medical pot script so back to the Dr soon to double that amount I gotta huge tolerance. But the tolerance was less much so of an issue as it was when I had no tolerance I was the SAME as far as being able to vomit. So that&#39;s the ONLY part I disagree with that bit of speculation since it can help with nausea vomiting doesn&#39;t mean it 100% prevents it n makes it impossible. Especially when the coughing mixed with the stomach contents and I don&#39;t got an iron gut but IBS more like it  so I would assume I&#39;d be able to do so more easily perhaps? Idk but I&#39;ve been lit AF and stoned n drunk etc and STILL have been able to throw up if needed. I&#39;ve also used it to NOT throw up or <a href=\"http://stop.it/\">stop.it</a> but ya still MUST use mind over matter and control ur thoughts n EVERYTHING it helps it doesn&#39;t make it 100% go away or impossible to do.

In March 2012, one evening I went to have a beer with friends. That evening I drank somewhere 3 to 4 bottles of beer. Those friends had offered me some drugs which used a \u2018bong\u2019 where you inhale smoke. At this point, I was drunk and did not know how strong this drug was (I later found out that it was grass mixed with a large dose of bongo) and I tried it for the first time in my life I breathed out once. After one or two minutes as I triedI immediately started feeling bad and started panicking, time became very slow. The next day I was glad that I felt alright. And that evening a friend had a birthday and I had few beers with friends almost 6 to 7 bottles of beer and when i went home I felt like puking but did instead straight went to bed to sleep. The next day when I woke up my health became very bad, all the body felt heavy began to hurt in the right side of back of my head very strongly at one point as if knocking an axe in the head, when i walked it became very difficult as my coordination of movement was not right as I stood I felt like leaning towards my left side a bit. I had these symptoms for quite some time that I had to return back home to do some medical treatment as I did such as plasmapheresis, many IV drops against poisoning. I felt a bit better by the treatment of almost more than a month of duration. Still I had symptoms few symptoms that was bothering me like my body felt so heavy and there was a pain or something felt not right at the back of my head in the right side. I went to the mandatory military training for a year, after few months in the military my health became much more better and those symptoms went away. A year later, health improved began to work, involved in sports participated in various competitions lived normally. After 2 years of poisoning in 2015, after work, I went to drink few beers with friends and drank somewhere between 5-6 bottles and the next day my health became very bad again. The whole body became very heavy. It kept pushing down as if carrying a very heavy thing. Everything presses down on earth as if the gravity of the earth had increased. Feeling of a heavy body where the center of gravity is there and the pressure force when I stand all presses down on the foot and foot, when you sit on your back and back. Became difficult to swallow, since then this feeling of pressure of the body as if the body has become very heavy did not disappear disappeared, but despite this I lived normally and after that I never drank alcohol. After 3 years in 2018 in March, one day I saw my friend and he had a cannabis weed and offered me saying that it was actually used for some medical treatments and had little harm to someone. I took only one small puff and after few minutes when my body felt not right I started panicking. My body was not right and started feeling heavier. The next day I still had those feeling and I started becoming more distressed thinking that It may require quite some time to recover and in order to get better quickly I went to a hospital and they had given me treatments for cerebral circulation and nerve system, I was not feeling any better with the treatment and one day they had given me IV drop\u2018kaventon\u2019and during the IV treatment my body started feeling very bad that I had to tell the nurse to stop the treatment. After that my body felt worse. I left the hospital and after one or two days I had a diarrhea and after few stools in a few hours my body felt very weak and felt very heavy that I started panicking for help. The place where the head ached, it ached more, heaviness of the body was increased, even walking became difficult, it took a lot of effort to walk and something pulled to the left when i walked. All the time there was dryness in the mouth, difficult to swallow, weakness of the muscles of the legs, when i walked my body felt so heavy and with the uneven coordination to the left, my head span. So once again I did plasmapheresis in hope of getting rid of these bad symptoms but unfortunately my body felt worse and I had to take a IV drop treatment of \u2018Ringer\u2019 for few times and actually it felt better but the symptoms are still intact.<br> I saw some specialists and did quite many tests related to the brain structure and blood circulation. The outcome of almost all the tests that I had given they were quite alright and no serious illness was discovered materialistically. I did a MRI test in my brain structure and it was all normal. I also did the Romberg test, stood with two of my foot straight and togethered together with closed eyes and stretched my hands. I felt like falling just in 1 or 2 seconds after closing my eye. My head started spinning immediately. And to this day, these symptoms have remained still, and in my country I cannot find any solutions to my body. Few specialists said it was vestibular syndrome or toxic neuropathy or toxic encephalopathy. I ask for your help sincerely and I hope you would give me a reply anyways even if you could not please refer me to somewhere please. If you can help me, please let me know about the cost and duration of time. This is my whole truth and I am in need of medical help.

I don\u2019t drink very much or ever. I\u2019ll say that besides the typical buzzed feel seems to be the same for me. I only see a slight effect like that with my opioid pain meds. I\u2019ll say as a person obviously in favor of medical marijuana, after going to the pharmacy for years now, I see as many people older than me as I do younger ones. It\u2019s more obvious with the younger people in their appearance and actions. I\u2019ve sat with little old ladies that haven\u2019t ever used it that are now. They have found medication that works without side effects, helps them sleep better, and makes their traditional medication\u2019s side effects like nausea tolerable enough to eat and have a life. <br><br>It\u2019s so sad to see so many people being helped, when so many people have an opinion about something they\u2019ve never been around to see for themselves. So many people in different states aren\u2019t able to get access. So many people are suffering needlessly because of the state they live in.  So many people are afflicted in so many ways, and they will never give it a chance because of stigma and false information. <br><br>My mother has smoked 1 time in her life in the 60\u2019s and someone laced it with something. She\u2019s never gone near it since. After my medical problems and my license, she\u2019s gotten a different sense about it. Since my problems incapacitate me, my prescriber has made her a caregiver so that she can get it for me. She was so intimidated. She handed her id over and said it would be a few minutes. She sat and talked with many people her age, and older. They have all had the same feeling, so she felt more comfortable not being alone in her nervousness. She quickly wasn\u2019t nervous when someone explained what you do and what happens beyond the waiting room.  She was called and went in, she was instantly comforted by the staff. They\u2019re very nice, warm, and professional and wouldn\u2019t ever rush her. They helped her find what to get, she was going to call, but they remember me and what I get. She was flabbergasted, every time she felt the nerves creeping in, they alleviated instantly with whatever she needed. She left 180\u00b0 from walking in 10 minutes ago. She\u2019s never felt anything like that ever again. She now has gone to my prescriber to get her own license, and got a thc and a cbd pen. She\u2019s so much better in many ways. She\u2019s glad she gave it a try. <br><br>If you know of someone in need of help from medical problems, please suggest they try. We\u2019ve finally passed the 50% mark for public approval, they will all fall like dominos from here on out. We need this with the heroin epidemic. A friend of mine has gotten over his opiate dependence with marijuana.  It gave him enough of a damper to deal with cravings. He doesn\u2019t smoke it anymore, but will if he needs to.

I&#39;ll drink maybe 1 whole Mike&#39;s Harder Lemonade before I smoke in the mornings but the funny thing is you actually don&#39;t even feel the alcohol at all if you smoke everyday.  All alcohol does for me in small, normal, or medium amounts is &quot;recycle&quot; my weed high. It works best with 5-8% alcohol levels but honestly any amount of alcohol (*FOLLOWED* by small bowl of bong hits) will usually get the job done. It&#39;s important that you smoke AFTER you drink for the strongest effect, but there have been times when I was out of cannabis and drank a beer instead. I actually felt a little stoned after drinking it and got the munchies. A small bit of alcohol + any cannabis = 1000x stronger than any dab I have even smoked. I think the alcohol helps promote better metabolism of THC and CBD. If you Google what I&#39;m talking about there is actually studies out there which have concluded that those who drank a beer before smoking had an increased level of THC concentration in the blood than they would have if they only smoked. Maybe the alcohol breaks the cannabinoids down making them easier to metabolize. Another interesting interaction is if you pour hard liquor or rubbing alcohol on cannabis it will liquefy the resin.

Just to myself. Just one example of numerous binges I had in just freshers alone. However after dropping the bottle and switching back to pot during a whole summer of daily smoking with no alcohol I got the wise idea to mix the two and after only a bottle of wine (and a good meal beforehand) with two joints (mixed with tobacco) i spewed pure liquid into my bathroom sink. Felt a whole lot better after but I&#39;m sure I&#39;d have never felt bad in the first place if i&#39;d stuck to one poison that night. More research needs to be done on the compatibility of these drugs as they become legalised and videos like this help spread awareness.<br>I will say I tend to game a lot when intoxicated and I feel like games are a good way to probe different behaviourism and functional ability when in altered mental states. I found green made me more aware of my surroundings, want to play support roles and encourage communication and synergy with teammates on overwatch. on rocket league I&#39;d think differently at how to approach difficult manoeuver, I often found myself learning new things but it was easy to let my guard down and pass it to my inebriated muscle memory and I&#39;d soon be shocked at how I missed simple opportunities. Alcohol on the other hand got me fired up, I was more proactive and confident in my playstyle, to me whatever I did looked either genius or embarrassingly sloppy depending on how much I&#39;d drank.<br>Mixing  the two is a gamble. I can peak at a balance if I&#39;d had good sleep, moderated intake of both and ate well. That allows me to find some sort of euphoric balance and have good vibes and jam to music. Otherwise I get super sleepy and crash out after a game, and there was that one time i mentioned before that I puked.

As in the flesh and blood, we like to drink, smoke, curse, slander and pocess material things, all of that is good to the flesh, however it completely destructs our soul, at the end of your life you either go to hell or heaven, imagine not feeling rest or relief EVER, eternal GUILT and NEVER ENDING PHYSICAL PAIN, and not being able to feel BETTER EVER, thats HELL. When you go to heaven you are given a NEW body and blood will no longer exist, we will never feel pain, sorrow, sadness, anger will eat and not get fat, bond with our loving Savior who MADE US and gave us LIFE, we will bond with animals and they ALL will be completely tamed. The devil, which you cannot see because he is spiritual, puts thoughts on your mind to believe a LIE wants you to believe a completely different story other than what im telling you, because satan will be going to hell and he wants to take you with him, he wants you to believe anything but SALVATION. He is completely envious and jelous of us because we are made in Gods image and Jesus loves us so much He willingly came to die for us, so we don&#39;t have to go to hell, HELL was made for the Devil ONLY, but there is so many of his followers that will follow him to hell, God does not send ANYBODY there, people send themeselves there, for rejecting JESUS. All glory and honor to the power of Jesus Christ alone. BE READY, the RAPTURE is coming and all whom don&#39;t get saved will be left on earth to suffer SO MUCH, you will know you got left behind and the only way to go to heaven if you are left on earth will be to be KILLED AS A MARTYR for JESUS CHRIST. SO PLEASE KNOW once you have trusted in the Gospel of Jesus Christ to saves our souls, we are instantly made SAVED under GRACE, not works, because if you think you can get to heaven on your own terms and &quot;works&quot; you are deceiving yourself and Jesus death and blood would have been in vain, JESUS CHRIST came in flesh to make a NEW LAW, the OT Moses law is invalid, we are JUSTIFIED by trusting and believing in Jesus death, blood and resurrection only. Once we trust in the Gospel, we are saved and our past, present and future sins are FORGIVEN. So does that mean we can continue to sin? NO! we are to be obedient to the spirit that dwells in us and we have to walk in the SPIRIT and not the FLESH.

So here&#39;s the weird part: whenever I started thinking and taking to my friend I would begin to get nauseas and feel like puking. whenever I stopped thinking I would start to faint and I would begin to collapse til I started thinking again. So it was a constant cycle of trying to keep my heart rate at the right pace. Well eventually my friend came over and asked if I was okay and I started talking to him and my heart rate went up and I ended up puking twice and almost a 3rd time but luckily I figured out the trick on what was going on and how to prevent myself from dying that night.

Consider this: You decide to smoke weed for 6 months (i know i know just bare with me here). For the first two months you smoke once a week, kinda like a weekend thing. After the second month, you decide that maybe if I smoked some during the week after work or whatever it&#39;ll be fine, no worries right? So now you&#39;re smoking  up to 3 times a week. Not horrible, still manageable but now you start feeling tired while working the next day. Oh well, maybe I just stayed up too late last night and didn&#39;t get enough sleep, whatever. <br><br>Starting month 4, you start noticing that, the same dosage you have been taking each time you smoke, which hasn&#39;t changed since day 1, doesn&#39;t get you that high anymore (this is possible to happen sooner for a lot a people, like I said bare with me). So now you decide maybe I double my dosage and see if that helps... my my does it help. <br><br>Month 5, these drowsy after affects start lasting longer and longer and your high starts reducing to less than normal. You again, starting thinking, maybe I have a really high tolerance now and need to start taking higher dosages. Well, that&#39;s fine and dandy, I have the money I might as well just do it anyway. <br><br>Come month 6 you are likely to be smoking every day, your high might be lasting maybe an hour, and some paranoia like affects can start arising through high dosages ( not always but quite possibly). By now, its even likely you&#39;ve heard of and even consumed dabs of THC (high concentrate). This, not only gets you extremely high, but raises your tolerance levels even further, to the point where that double dosage of weed you were smoking doesnt really have an affect on you, it probably gives you a head rush for maybe an hour and you are left drowsy and lazy for the next day. <br><br>My point of all of this is, if you cannot control your dosage and how you consume it to a very moderate minimum, you are likely to want to move on to much harder drugs and chemicals that will actually damage your brain and cause severe memory loss and anxiety/paranoia. <br><br>Just be careful people, drugs are not to mess around with, even if its &quot;just weed bro&quot;.", "comment_date": "2016-12-12T21:06:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "logan", "comment_text": "If you&#39;re really drunk and get high good luck friends.

I am gonna say that it is awesome. But I have tried weed only with beer. So maybe less experience in general(like with vodka or whisky) but in beer+weed=awesome &lt;3. Just drink something to quench your thirst and give you a great chilled high. This is why I prefer weed + good beer. Cold water cools your body but just makes you more thirsty(I do not know why and how does that happen). But with beer, you will probably eat less because your stomach is already full.
