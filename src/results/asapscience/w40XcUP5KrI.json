The video portion wasn&#39;t even necessary, but would have enhanced the effect were it not for the constant interruption. My brain takes a moment to synchronize the audio with the expected lyrics, but the speaker&#39;s interruptions were so frequent that I was never able to do so in this video. An extended moment of silence, perhaps with the lyrics included at some point, would have really improved this segment.<br><br>The segment with the piano giving a speech was the best-presented of all the illusions, but it was still missing a moment where the presenter was silent while a clip played with the captions omitted or obscured, so that the same clip could be re-shown with the captions to reveal the words the piano was &quot;saying&quot;. Aside from that minor point, this was the best part of the video.<br><br>For the jumping pylon, the speaker was never silent for even one full rotation of the image, so I came away from it feeling like I had no idea if I could hear the illusion. Being silent for five seconds (at least three landings) would have made it clear to me. Similar to the All Star segment, I had to mute the video to confirm that I cannot hear the illusion.<br><br>For the Risset Rhythm, the speaker was quiet just long enough for me to recognize the increasing speed, but after hearing the explanation for how it works, I was expecting a segment where the presenter would be quiet long enough for us to hear the transition from rhythm A to rhythm B, accompanied with the animation slowed down to guide us through rhythm A fading out and B fading in. Unfortunately, this didn&#39;t happen. As with All Star, I had to look up the rhythm in a separate video.<br><br>Illusions, to me, are at their most interesting when one is able to see them both ways and also pick apart our brains as they happen - like that optical illusion where people can see a rabbit or a duck. For audio illusions, hearing them in the first place (or confirming the lack of an illusion) require an extended moment of silence on the part of the presenter, and for the most part, that courtesy was not taken in this video.

Just thought I should share. Here\u2019s how to do it: Make sure you are comfortable and your needs are filled. Put your feet flat on the ground. Start to get used to this position. Don\u2019t move your feet or toes from that point on. Close your eyes and imagine roots are growing out of your feet into the ground beneath you. They are long roots and they go very deep. Stay there for a moment. Relax. Now imagine a golden light of pure healing, peace, and serenity starts slowly climbing up your roots. Slowly it reaches your toes. Soon enough the light has spread to all of both of your feet. Sparks of the light shoot up to your knees and your legs soon begin to get filled. Like liquid, the light fills from your knees to your waist. Now take a break and relax there for a moment. Take a few deep breaths. Now it slowly climbs up your waist to your chest. Feel the light reaching your heart and healing you. Accept the truth that you are in the process of being healed. The light fills up from your chest to the top of your neck. Breathe. Let the light fill your head. Your brain is submerged in pure healing, peace, and serenity. If you can, picture yourself as a golden silhouette. Let your soul leave your body and reflect on the past minute, hour, day, month, year, or anything in between. Your heart, soul, and mind are now one. Re-enter your body, now reborn. Just a side note you most likely won\u2019t even be able to make it up to your waist the first 1-4 times you do this. This meditation takes patience. Bless you and have a great day. \u2764\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2018-07-06T08:37:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Very", "comment_text": "Freeeeeeaky wtffffff", "comment_date": "2018-07-06T08:36:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moose", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t hear smashmouth in the slightest. =\\", "comment_date": "2018-07-06T08:35:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tristan Muchwano", "comment_text": "The piano is all I\u2019m here for though.. that\u2019s freaky!", "comment_date": "2018-07-06T08:34:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Rolling Bear", "comment_text": "Do you hear Laurel, or hardy? \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18", "comment_date": "2018-07-06T08:34:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Justice", "comment_text": "2018 and we got speaking pianos what else is new", "comment_date": "2018-07-06T08:34:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rizwan Pallickal Moidu", "comment_text": "What is I havent heard the song.
