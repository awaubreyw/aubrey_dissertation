We read that hell has enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure. Beloved, this is not to swallow animals, or trees; but humanity. Hell is not a respecter of persons. It has swallowed people more richer, intelligent, and more famous people than you. Precious one, hell is eagerly awaiting the arrival of any sinner irrespective of the person. 2 Peter 2:4 KJV<br><br>Children Of The Most High God, Don&#39;t Go To Hell: If by reckless and careless lifestyle here on earth you make yourself available in hell, it&#39;s sad to say that you will have a space of torment to dwell in for eternity. Hellfire is never full. Please, avoid it at all cost. By the grace of God, I have been privileged to see a part of hellfire through a divine revelation. Brethren, in my revelation, I saw that hell is powerful, wicked, and never satisfied. Revelation 21:8 KJV<br><br>Here&#39;s A Question For You: Are you well prepared to handle the unbearable pain and agony in hellfire? Beloved, hell is not a place you can only use your mouth to reject, NO! Many people that rejected hellfire on earth, died and still found themselves in it. Please, strive very hard to live a holy and righteous life. Surrender your life to Jesus Christ today if you are not yet born again. John 3:3 KJV<br><br>Prayer: Father, have mercy on me in any way I have not been taking the life of holiness seriously. Grant me the grace to live for you; in Jesus Christ mighty name. Amen.\u00a0<br><br>Reflection: And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

I would ride my bike in the winter applying at stores and such. <br><br>I would layer up pretty good but one day it got bitterly cold and super windy on my ride back home. I was getting super cold and about halfway home I started to get really sweaty and hot. I almost wanted to stop and undo my scarf and unzip my jacket. I thought it was because I was pushing my self but I actually felt like I was getting really hot. I knew that it had to be the onset of hypothermia and pushed myself harder to get home as I was on the final stretch. <br><br>Got home and as soon as I got into the apartment building I felt a rush of coldness sweep over me, then followed by the burning hot sensation or actual heat from entering a heated environment. <br><br>I felt super numb and tingly.
