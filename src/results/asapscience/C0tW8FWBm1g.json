Because the the way the speaker presents \u201caddiction\u201d and the need to go to the streets is one of a more accusatory mode. <br>Example: I was competing in CrossFit for a year or so and am a little older than most in the sport. I had been really performing outstandingly and ended up pushing myself outside of my zone several times and not having proper recovery time overall or on the particular day of my catastrophic shoulder injury\u2026 I blew out 3 of 4 rotator cuffs and tore my labrum over 50%. Unfortunately I couldn\u2019t get the surgery until 1.5yrs later. I was prescribed opioids from tramadol to Vicodin that only got to 20mg of (hydrocodone)/day before the surgery. Not too high, but enough taken at the proper times helped me perform as a single parent, work and get some sleep. When the surgery came, it was more devastating and difficult than I had bargained for.. and I was prescribed around 60mg of oxycodone per day (1-2 5mg, every 2-4hrs). I could\u2019ve taken up to 120mg/day technically at the high end.. but did not.. because a great many reasons. <br>I was in greater pain for longer than I had anticipated and stayed in communication with my docs. I started to taper off when I could and physical therapy and having no one at the time help me made that very difficult and somewhat impossible at times.<br>The PA decided to cut off my pain meds cold Turkey with no warning and I had actually tapered/had left over 4-5 days past the refill (which one more refill remained) and the PA canceled my remaining refill before I had needed to refill it. I was very upset and fearful for I had known that I was physically dependent and still needed pain management. I could not go thru withdrawals and care for both of my kids (no coparent) one of which is special needs, go thru physical therapy, continue my studies working on my bachelors and work.. it was a moment in time where I was going to be desperate and do/get what had to be done in order to survive.. <br>Fortunately I had spoke w/my PCP and she understood the pressures and factors that I was under. She prescribed me enough to get through physical therapy and to taper/ween. She checked with me weekly and met my needs while being safe about the opioids. <br><br>Had that not been the case as a time before with a serious injury and lack of care, I would\u2019ve scored whatever I could from wherever I could so I could operate, heal and survive.. meeting genuine medical needs and doctors being communicative w/their patients can be the most effective way to quash a large part of the addiction piece and the need to seek street drugs to self medicate.<br><br>The war on drugs does not work.", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T02:49:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "geoff r", "comment_text": "The same thing as involvement with religion/spirituality", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T00:30:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sydney Hayes", "comment_text": "I overdosed on Xanax and fentanyl the other night and died and my boyfriend gave me CPR to keep me alive until the ambulance came.

Yes you might be able to overdose by inhaling its dust. That is why legal, pharmaceutical grade fentanyl is packaged in little, hard losanges that are designed to slowly dissolve between the cheek and gums, and designed to not produce dust. Also, each losange is a therapeutic dose, not a lethal dose. Because it is not well absorbed at all, through the digestive system, a small child accidentally swallowing one is not likely to get an overdose. S-he would have to dissolve the entire thing in her mouth in order to get an overdose. That said, the earlier &quot;lollipop&quot; verson might be tempting for a child to leave in her-his mouth.. It is <i>good</i> that fentanyl is needed in smaller quantities than, say, morphine. It is <i>good</i> that it acts quickly. Because of these wonderful characteristics, you can get the pain-relief speed of an injected opioid, by simply placing a losange between cheek and gums. I think it is best to avoid illegal fentanyl and take only pharceutical grade fentanyl if dosage units that ahve been carefully measured. I once had it prescribed for cancer pain. It did not get me high at all. It did cause my terrible terrible pain to slowly go away. It did not make me sleepy. Yes it causes constipation. It is advisable to take laxatives if that happens to you. Sennosides work very well, along with only a small amount of stool softener such as PEG 3350. Both are very safe. PEG 3350 has almost no toxicity, ha less toxicity than many commonly eaten foods..Fentanyl slows down intestinal peristalsis; sennosides speed them up, normalizing intestinal motility. <br>     The reason for increased numbers of overdose deaths is not due to opioids. It is due to the synergistic reaction of 2 or more CNS depressants. One of the depressants is often an opioid. If one of them is an opioid, medical examiners and coroners for some reason usually attribute the cause of death to the opioid to the opioid, rather than to the combination. This is a matter of supporting a cultural narrative, rather than being strictly factual, and scientific. The other is most often alcohol, but could also be a benzodiazepine, or a barbiturate. As Jonathon Swift wrote, the Big Endians crack their eggs at the big end, Small Endians crack their eggs at the small end.

The vast majority of opioid prescriptions do not lead to addiction. If it was as this video described, then the 24,000,000 prescriptions written in California in 2016 would have produced.... how many addicted? When people make these uniformed statements they somehow always fail to articulate an actual number that their inferred rate of addiction (very high) would produce. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has said that with pre-existing vulnerabilities like prior addiction issues, alcohol use or childhood traumas, addiction rates could be as high as 8% but for those not falling into that category, studies show addiction rates are 1% or less. (See a study by Dr. Scott Hadland) Also, the myth about touching fentanyl and dying is BS as well. Dr. Ryan Marino has explained this for anyone interested.<br>Opioid prescribing has declined over 50% since 2011-12 down to levels not seen since 1993. Meanwhile, drug overdose death rates are skyrocketing. This video did not delineate between legal pharmaceutical fentanyl and the illicit fentanyl produced by the drug cartels who care little for quality or consistent dosing. This illicit product is being put into fake pills and other forms, other drugs. In Sacramento county, 99% of the street pills are illicit fentanyl. Police drug labs have shown 4 out of 10 are potentially lethal. Russian roulette is safer.<br>California Society of Addiction Medicine and Dr Phillip Coffin with San Francisco Dept of Public Health have said that the crackdown on prescription opioids have driven more people to the streets, putting them at more risk with the illicit drugs.<br>The \u201ciron law of prohibition\u201d predicts exactly what has happened with America\u2019s failed drug policy. Drug prohibition equals escalating illicit supplies and escalating drug OD death rates. As long as America maintains its continued freak-out over opioids, stigmatizing both medical-use and non medical-use, treatment of acute and chronic pain will continue to deteriorate accompanied by ever increasing drug death rates.", "comment_date": "2022-03-23T11:09:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lex & B TV", "comment_text": "They gave my daughter fentanyl in the nicu. she was born 2 1/2 months early &amp; that was one of the drugs they used to keep her sedated &amp; out of pain.. reasons why i\u2019m here researching also lol.", "comment_date": "2022-03-23T04:02:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Damion(Lifted Legend 710)", "comment_text": "I really dont like synthetic drugs they are all very weird all the way down to a chemical structure of them", "comment_date": "2022-03-23T00:24:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KB", "comment_text": "Fentanyl comes from China to Mexico to your neighborhood .

It does more harm than good. The description and the cartoons accompanying it are nothing like the actual effect on your body. Simplistic and BS laden explanations like this do more harm than good. Do not misunderstand me. Fentanyl (the illegal kind, which is not simply fenanyl, but a dangerous mixture of god-knows-what), is deadly simply because is is so powerful and dirt cheap (the effect of $2,000 worth of heroin can be achieved with approximately %1 of illegal fentanyl analogues). No cartel will turn down a profit margin like that) and poorly mixed. You can&#39;t tell the difference between some pill from your pusher that has nothing in it and one with 100 fatal doses. Simply because the amounts it takes are very small and imprecisely mixed by some cartel person who doesn&#39;t underestand microgram dosing.  However, medical fentanyl is over 50 yesars old and it is clearly known as to concentration. Medical grade, it doesn&#39;t even come in pill form. &quot;To an anesthesiologist, fentanyl is simply a tool, like a screwdriver is to an electrician.&quot;  A very useful tool. It is used thousands of times a day across the country with no fatalities and no addiction. It saves lives. It releves pain.  It is used precisely because it is effective, controllable and one of the least side-effect laden opiates. HIstrionic videos like this do more harm than good. I have given thousands of doses over the last decades, again, saving lives and stabilizing critically ill  patients. My colleagues will probably give over a quarter of a million doses across the country today, with excellent effect. No fatalities. No addiction. <br><br>People do die from it. NEVER use it medically without a very knowledgeable doctor&#39;s supervision. (The same goes for insulin. It can save your life.  Or leave you brain dead if you use it wrong.) NEVER touch it without knowing this. Know that medical fentany does not come in pill form.  <br><br>Unfortunately, the depiction here of its effect on your brain also needs clarification. People vary greatly in thier sensitivity. One person may stop breating and the other may feel nothing at the same dose.  Space does not allow discussion here. That&#39;s why you neeed an EXPERIENCED doctor&#39;s supervision.  Fentanyl pleasantly calms you in the great majority of people,.  Some poeple like that, others don&#39;t. Unfortunately, with the potency, and lack of dosing control in recreational drugs, if you get a large dose (extremely easy to do in this uncontrolled illegal environment), you will simply feel so good that you will fall asleep and forget to breathe. Adios. Neither users or pushers seem to grasp quantitative dosing. And neither do the media. In this case, micrograms instead of milligrams or grams. That is why people die form it. As I&#39;ve said. Deadly in the wrong, ignorant hands, which is most of us.

It is impossible to overdose on fentanyl from simply touching it or being around it, also known as \u201cpassive\u201d exposure. This has been confirmed on multiple occasions, reported by expert toxicologists, chemists and pharmacists. The fact that you are telling the public they can overdose so easily is dangerous and negligent. Real victims of drug overdose are in danger of receiving delayed care under this myth, while first responders waste time acquiring PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) they don\u2019t need. Additionally, someone who is suffering from a medical condition that mimics drug overdose coincidentally after being exposed to fentanyl may not receive proper the proper diagnosis or treatment if responders falsely believe they are suffering an overdose. False overdoses have been reported by police departments around the country. These episodes have since been proven to have been panic attacks or other medical emergencies, further supported by laboratory analytical results that indicated there was no fentanyl detected in the officers bodies. Unfortunately, a few departments were revealed to have knowingly faked the fentanyl overdoses in effort to both bring personal attention to the officers (aww! The hero cop was almost killed by the scum drug dealer\u2019s fentanyl!) and to give fake testimony on why the departments should receive more funding.  Pathetic. Other times, first responders have suffered panic attacks from the idea they are working with the potentially deadly exposure. <br><br>Any doubters-consider the fact that a fentanyl is used regularly is hospital settings for pain control. Medical staff would be collapsing all day, all over the country, if simply touching or passive exposure to fentanyl would result in overdose. I personally received a fentanyl injection at the emergency room. No one who handled the medication was overdosed. In addition, if fentanyl was so deadly to just be around, you\u2019d hear about the burning down of buildings that once housed fentanyl. Never hear about how they deacon these homes and vehicles after drug busts do you? Get educated. Learn the symptoms of drug overdose. Learn CPR.

Upon further investigation I found out that she was coming from the hospital and had a fentanyl patch on.  I asked her if she knew she was on the wrong side of the highway and she said &quot;yes&quot;.  A trooper who had shown up to assist with the stop asked her why, if she knew she was on the wrong side, she didn&#39;t just slip through one of the turnaround openings in the median, and she replied that if she did that, she would be going the wrong direction on the OTHER side, AND she would be heading in the opposite direction of where she wanted to go (home).", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T19:11:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charlie Siefert", "comment_text": "I have had to take various opioids (all prescribed by doctors) for 22 years because of severe chronic back problems, a failed back surgery, and nerve damage in the same area. When I was prescribed fentanyl, my doctor (a pain management specialist) also circulated a letter to all of her opioid patients. My letter stated that because of my chronic, incurable, moderate to severe back pain and nerve damage that I would be required to keep taking these drugs (most likely) for the remainder of my life. Because of this fact, the doctor labeled me &quot;medically dependent&quot; on opiods to try and separate my usage from that of drug addicts. I lost the letter after several years but looked for it when the news about the opioid epidemic and criminal behavior of the Sackler family (among many others including the US Food and Drug Administration) started grabbing headlines, but could never find it. At my next doctor&#39;s appointment, I asked if I could get another copy of the letter, but suddenly they didn&#39;t know anything about any such letter and told me I was mistaken (basically making it up). That was really strange. The only reason I wanted to have a copy of the letter was to show to friends and relatives that there were legitimate reasons for my continuing to take these drugs and that I was not considered to be an addict. Kind of a cruel irony of my continued necessity of taking opioids is that I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict (30 years) so my dad and several of my friends were questioning me about all this crap. I am very much physically addicted to opiods. I have had to suffer withdrawals several times. The thing that I know that keeps me certain that I&#39;m not abusing these drugs is the fact that my overall dosage has not changed in more than a decade. One of the major symptoms of addiction in the &quot;drug addict&quot; sense is that people develop tolerance to whatever drug (or alcohol) they are using and need to increase dosages over time. This has not been true in my case and as of 2010 I have had what is known as an interthecal medicine delivery system - basically a surgically implanted pain medicine pump, very much like the pumps some diabetic people have. My medication level has not changed since then. The main difference is that I have absolutely no control over the working of the pump or the delivery of the medication. Because it is a continuously working pump, the administration of the medication (dilaudid) is continuous so that there is no waiting for pills to start working or &quot;clock watching&quot; for my next dose - because the pills and patches do not ever last as long as they are said to. The pump is refilled about every 6 weeks and is accessed via Bluetooth using special software that only the doctor has access to. For anyone else with chronic, severe, intractable pain - I couldn&#39;t recommend this system more highly. It has literally taken me from a pain racked, miserable person to someone who still has constant pain - but without the ups and downs of waiting for the medicine to work, or not having it work for the stated amount of time. I have a much better quality of life than when I was taking pills or wearing patches.", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T19:09:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doubleplus Ungoodthinkful", "comment_text": "Once again, big pharma has done so much for the USA.

Having a bit of powder on your skin for 10 minutes is incredibly unlikely to cause anything approaching opioid toxicity, it takes 14 minutes to deliver a therapeutic dose through a patch, which not only has a lot more Fent in it (usually 2.5-10mg), but it also has to be moist and in contact with the skin for a long time.

I\u2019m older, on social Security and Medicare, and for some crazy reason Fentanyl patches were the only pain med Medicare would pay for to at least dull the pain caused by my genetic disorder and spinal injury.  Despite how \u201cstrong\u201d it\u2019s supposed to be, AND the supposed \u201ceuphoric\u201d effects it\u2019s supposed to have;  I never experienced any euphoria, or being \u201chigh\u201d, and even towards the end, on 2 100mcg patches every 3 days, it barely touched my pain.  During my frequent hospitalizations for illness and injuries related to my genetic disorder, doctors would come in and try and figure out how my tolerance was so high and why I don\u2019t react to opiates in the same way others to.  Apparently it\u2019s a neurotransmitter that I\u2019m deficient in, and it\u2019s the same reason other medications (not all, but many), also don\u2019t work on me.  Believe me, when my pain gets to the point where I haven\u2019t slept in 2-3 days and spend most of my time wrapped in heating pads and lidocaine patches;  I WISH this stuff made me \u201chigh\u201d.  I switched to morphine about 4 years ago because they felt that was my best bet, that it needs less of that neurotransmitter to metabolize...and it DOES work better than Fentanyl, but I\u2019m still on over 400mg a day of long-acting and can take another 100mg short acting when needed.  Because it still doesn\u2019t work very well, I often don\u2019t even finish 1/2 bottle a month, so am voluntarily coming down on my dose.  Unfortunately, because I was a healthcare professional myself for 25 years, I refused to take opiates and jeopardize my career, opting instead for NSAIDS, which ended up destroying my stomach, intestines and kidney. (NSAIDS=non steroidal anti-inflammatories like Advil, ibuprofen, aleve, etc). Despite this, when I\u2019m in severe pain, I\u2019ve started sneaking Aleve and have gone to the local ER begging for toradol shots (another NSAID that bypasses most of the GI problems, although it still produces a lot of acid and effects my failing kidney).  What other choices do I have?  I\u2019ve actually TRIED to get ketamine-after doing a lot of research and passing it on to my docs.  In this time of people freaking out over opiates, local docs wont even consider ketamine.  I\u2019m moving to Colorado next year to be with my son.  Although I never liked the way cannabis made me feel, at least I\u2019ll have that option.  (Medical cannabis was passed in my state 4 years ago, but they\u2019ve refused to approve growers or dispensaries..)", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T23:57:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Chen", "comment_text": "Rip lil peep", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T12:39:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u0e47 \u0e47", "comment_text": "Just make \u201cyour brain on opioids\u201d it\u2019s all the same", "comment_date": "2018-06-02T23:43:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Hanson", "comment_text": "You don&#39;t die by touching fentanyl.

I would go to the current doctor available with my employer insurance.  They would tell me/confirm that I needed surgery immediately.  When I asked for two weeks off to have &amp; recover from surgery, I was fired.  This happened 4 times; hence my 5yr wait.  I finally had the surgery &amp; 9 months later started to feel a very, very achy pain, covering the entire part of my lower back into both legs.

Of course there are morally bankrupt doctors who will prescribe opioids for obvious addicts in a disgustingly immoral practice for extra drug money, but most pain specialists have strong probity and a purely humanitarian desire to take crippling pain away from patients. <br>From my perspective, the only reason opioids are so vilified is because it\u2019s white teenagers overdosing on grandma\u2019s oxicodone in large numbers, but no more so than inner-city communities with crack and other hard drugs. It\u2019s just that the nation\u2019s leaders and the media (both of which are made up of almost entirely the white and upper-class) aren\u2019t used to their kids dying the way kids in the inner-city, African-American, and other impoverished communities, are dying all the time. <br>I\u2019m not saying that opioid addiction isn\u2019t a problem, but a restriction of opioids for medical use probably isn\u2019t the answer. The exact same problem has existed in impoverished areas for decades, but the country\u2019s only in a panic about it now that it\u2019s impacting the wealthy and powerful. <br>Then again that\u2019s just my opinion, and all I have is my experience and observations as someone who needs pain medications to function. And with a \u201cwar on opioids\u201d seeming imminent, maybe I\u2019m just irrationally scared of a decrease in quality pain control for me and millions of other ill Americans who can\u2019t survive without pain control for chronic pain.<br><br>All of that aside, this is a very informative and accurate video about one of the most dangerous medically necessary substances ever created.", "comment_date": "2017-11-10T01:03:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lad Liam", "comment_text": "God damn...", "comment_date": "2017-11-08T21:45:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Ryan", "comment_text": "@AsapSCIENCE can you do a vid on your brain on N2O ( laughing gas/whip its)", "comment_date": "2017-11-08T21:06:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J V", "comment_text": "I went through 25mg of suwu fentanyl powder in a 3 day binge with no prior opiod tolerance.

Yes, it is bad when used in too high of a dose, for too long, illegally, or any combination of the above.  However, the proper dosing of administration of Fentanyl can be extremely beneficial to people suffering from chronic pain that doesn&#39;t respond to other opioids or for which short acting opioids are not appropriate.  For example, there are some cases of chronic daily migraine (where the person literally has a constant migraine 24/7/365) where a Fentanyl patch may give them back their life, at least in part.  That happened to me.  I was only on the patch for about 6 or 8 months, but if I hadn&#39;t been put on Fentanyl at that time, I probably wouldn&#39;t be here today.  It gave my body time to stop being used to other medications that had previously worked but which my body had gotten used to.  It also gave my doctor and I some time to figure out what new treatments we may try.  In addition, the relief I got from the Fentanyl allowed me to hold down a full time job during that period, which in turn led to me being able to return to college for my last semester!  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s for everyone.  And I&#39;m not saying that once someone is on it that they shouldn&#39;t be weaned off of it.

Politicians want to solve the problem by blaming doctors- simple to fix just pressure doctors to write fewer prescriptions, and foreign drug imports- simple to fix by catching importers and stopping the drugs at the border.
