want to learn how to ride a bike I also want to learn how to write efficiently because I cannot spell literally this is on the microphone that I\u2019m typing well I\u2019m not typing the microphone is translating this speech into text anyway also every time I do right where people can actually read it( my hand writing is very sloppy)<br>It takes me five hours( 25 minutes to write one paragraph)<br>And on top of that I cannot spell but I can read seventh grade books and I\u2019m only in fifth grade\ud83e\udd23<br>Do not use personal information against people<br><br><br>Anyway yeah that\u2019s why I clicked on this video thank you for the tips I am definitely going to use them", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T01:40:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by":

There, the tests that will actually require language skill instead of rote learning will ask you to understand texts, spoken language, write and perform orally. Writing a text or having a mock oral exam and failing tells you little about your actual mistakes. Reading might provide you with vocabulary that you&#39;re missing, but not with global reading skills any more than other reading does.

Self-testing early and repeatedly is more effective for recall than plain revision mainly due to:<br>a) the rehearsal of activating old and new neural pathways to specific memories from different perspectives and in different contexts, defining similarities and differences from other concepts (Spacing and Interleaving);<br><br>and, very importantly:<br>b) the association of personalised <b>meaning</b> to a memory, especially if the meaning is somehow relevant to oneself (Semantic Memory, the most stable form of long-term memory).<br><br><br>This second mechanism is active in the practise of &#39;embarrassing&#39; oneself through the hypercorrection effect, which assumes that a student who has recently learned information to be tested on will likely feel more confident in answering correctly than the student who learned it weeks ago.<br><br>The first article @AsapScience referenced for Hypercorrection (Eich, T. S., Stern, Y., &amp; Metcalfe, J., 2013.) stated that &quot;the semantic relation between the errors and the correct answer is stronger for high than low confidence errors&quot;, citing Metcalfe &amp; Finn (2011).<br><br>Eich et al. (2013) also said that &quot;While it seems intuitive that errors committed with high confidence should be more difficult to correct than less entrenched, low confidence errors, the data show the opposite result: correct recall performance is better for errors that were initially committed with high, rather than low confidence. This counterintuitive finding is called the hypercorrection effect&quot;.<br><br>I feel it&#39;s important to note that the main research finding of Eich et al. (2013) was that older participants (aged around 65) did <b>not</b> exhibit a significant Hypercorrection Effect, while young adults and children did.<br><br>P.S.: Here&#39;s an interesting study on Retrieval-Based Learning, where students who learned information once only and only self-tested thereafter, later recalled the information far better than students who self-tested not at all or only once before evaluation.<br><br>Karpicke (2012): &#39;Retrieval-Based Learning: Active Retrieval Promotes Meaningful<br>Learning&#39;<br><br><a href=\"http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/downloads/2012_Karpicke_CDPS.pdf\">http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/downloads/2012_Karpicke_CDPS.pdf</a><br><br>P.P.S: this whole comment is just the result of me practising retrieval of what I&#39;ve recently learned about memory ;)", "comment_date": "2020-04-14T04:22:33Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "aritra bose", "comment_text": "Did you say Epstein?", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T09:36:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Quilty", "comment_text": "LOL I wish we had a month of spaced study lmao", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T21:24:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josia Jacob", "comment_text": "What if you cannot find a practice test for a particular class?", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T15:43:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SARVESH P", "comment_text": "We gave a group of people one full apple and  we gave  another group of people a half apple and a month later we gave them the remaining half 10 years later the latter group was more healthy", "comment_date": "2020-04-07T09:37:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "percuss37", "comment_text": "Now I know how to study! <br>The only problem is<br><br>I don\u2019t want to", "comment_date": "2020-04-01T14:02:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bao Chau", "comment_text": "Please give us some study language hacks", "comment_date": "2020-04-01T09:33:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "learning tube", "comment_text": "I am a student.. my exams are soon and I am feeling so much tired ,burried under tensions ..

Oh, maybe you can stay mentallt sharp for an extra 10 years, how wonderful! Well, you are only pushing the inevitable; death. If you find something you truly enjoy then learning will take care of itself, but if you feel like a failure in life, remember this; its better to have lived a miserable life and welcome death with open arms than to be scared shitless of losing all the great things you have. Consiousness is an extremely horrible construct - Its the worst kind of torture I can imagine actually. We are born into the world against our will, and when we first have experienced life, we cant help being terrified of losing it. I wouldnt need to be consious, to be a thinking, depressed walking brain to reproduce if that is what I am intended to do. Humans could cooperate without consiousness, we could be intelligent without consiousness, I just dont see the need for this mental torture. A vast failure from an evolutionary perspective. What we humans should seek is a way to make people into psycopaths so that they could just experience life without the whole emotional package. I mean, when you realy think about it, if I did something horrible, lets say blow up the whole world with a nuclear bomb, if I were to kill myself just before it would explode, it might as well not have happened. I cant extend my empathy and consiousness to the purelt hypothetical - a world where I dont even exist anymore. Thats why I dont see the point in moving humanity forward. For What? I wont be alive to see it. All the work we put in might not even pay off. There is absolutely no reason to keep on fighting, no reason to do anything. No single human out there is special. Any one of us could die any minute, and in the big picture it wouldnt matter. Life would go on. Some people would be sad, but when you realize they will eventually move on too, or that Its just their brain reorganizing itself in order to survive, you will begin to feel disgust. All the people that love you are just wired to do so, that could be changed. Its not real. Love is not real. Nothing is. Humour is just a distraction from the seriousness of life and death. There are no real way we are meant to live. That means that you having a terrible time and stuff, there is no guarantee it will get any better. Life doesent care. Life does nor care if you suffer your entire life.

The generation effect :<br>Start by testing yourself with a practice test before studying and knowing the material.\r<br>The hypercorrection effect:<br>Do tests too early then fail so that when you learn the correct answer you actually retain the information better and learn it more effectively. Constantly challenge your inaccurate beliefs early, test yourself early and often and force your brain to generate an answer even if it\u2019s the wrong answer and then follow up by learning the correct answers. \r<br>\r<br>2. Spacing<br>Space out your studying by practicing the new material then wait long enough to almost forget the new material and then practice the new material again, you\u2019ll find that in the day of the exam you\u2019ll remember the new material more naturally.\r<br>For example:\r<br>Practice a day before the exam and in the day of the exam because the closer you are to the day of the exam the better you\u2019ll be at remembering the information. Practice for four hours and then (one day later or two days later) study for four hours, this will help with your long term memory when you space out your studying.\r<br>Don\u2019t study intensively for eight hours because then this won\u2019t help with your long term memory because you didn\u2019t space out your studying.\r<br>\r<br>3. Interleaving or mixed practice <br>These are 5 do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of interleaving:\r<br>1. Don\u2019t study the same thing repetitively (over and over again) \r<br>2. Don\u2019t study multiple things at once\r<br>3. Don\u2019t use a specific procedure\r<br>4. Do mix up and vary the things you study\r<br>5.

Interleaved practice probably takes more time, which isto say that students need more time to complete a par-ticular practice problem when it is part of an interleavedassignment rather than a blocked assignment. Althoughwe did not measure students\u2019 time on task, every teacherreported that the interleaved assignments took more timethan did blocked practice. To the extent that this was true,the observed interleaving effect would have been smallerif it had been measured per unit of time invested by thestudent. To our knowledge, no previous study of inter-leaved mathematics practice has measured time on task,which probably requires computer-based data collection.<br>2.  The test benefit of interleaved mathematics practicemight be smaller at shorter test delays. In fact, in the oneprevious interleaved mathematics study that included amanipulation of test delay, the interleaving effect wassmaller at the shorter test delay (Rohrer et al., 2015).Furthermore, the only previous study that did not find apositive interleaving effect used a relatively brief testdelay of 2\u20135 days (Ostrow et al., 2015), although some ofthe other studies found positive interleaving effects aftertest delays of one day or less (e.g., Taylor &amp; Rohrer,2010).<br>3.  Interleaved practice might be less effective or too diffi-cult if students do not first receive at least a small amountof blocked practice when they encounter a new skill orconcept. As explained in the introduction, the interleavedgroup in the present study likely received at least someblocked practice from their teachers before they receivedthe experiment worksheets, and this appears to be true forthe other math interleaving studies with one exception(Rohrer &amp; Taylor, 2007). In brief, the data do not suggestthat students should entirely avoid blocked practice.<br>4.  Interleaved practice might be effective only if studentsreceive corrective feedback. The students in the presentstudy were shown the solutions and asked to correct theirerrors, and it appears that feedback also was provided tostudents in every previous study of interleaved mathe-matics practice (see introduction). Thus, informative andtimely feedback might be a necessary ingredient of in-terleaved practice.", "comment_date": "2020-02-23T03:56:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "montyoso", "comment_text": "I recommend the coursera course Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects by Dr. Barbara Oakley to go in deep on the topics of this video.

Because I get bored easily I start a bunch of things at once and cycle through learning a bunch of things at once. For years, professors and teachers would tell me that&#39;s not how learning works but always stuck with it because it worked for me. I did a Ph.S in Philosophy and Logic in University. But in highschool I was in the French Immersion program but did night school for Japanese and Korean. I learnt Japanese and Korean side by side for 4 years and did extremely well in both courses. When I went to university I took Italian and Spanish side by side and again since super well. I have a weird habit of taking on things simply because they&#39;re difficult and the reason I started languages to begin with was because of my dyslexia with languages and kept doing interleaving learning for the same reason. I got lucky it actually worked out for me. I went from a 1.47 GPA to a 4.0 in 4 years simply because I was too stubborn to take the &#39;easy&#39; route of learning.

(I\u2019m an opera singer.) Testing I use for memorization all the time, forcing myself to try it without the music to see where the holes are and what I need to spend time on WITH the music, or writing out my lyrics for a new song in a notebook to see how much of the text I have solid. Spacing is super effective \u2014 I first started doing it when I was a kid, actually? Every year I\u2019d learn new pieces to compete with in my local music festival, and my teacher always had me learn them to a performance-ready standard, then I\u2019d \u201cdrop\u201d them for a month or two, and then about a month before festival I\u2019d pick them up again. Usually it would end up being a much more nuanced performance because of the time it spent percolating in the back of my mind without actively focusing on it. And Interleaving is perhaps the most important to me now as a professional musician, because it\u2019s not only way easier and more interesting to spend the time I need to practicing when interleaving, but I exercise my voice more completely (think only ever doing leg day at the gym vs a full work out), and split my focus between largescale works (an entire role in an opera), and smaller things (a single piece in a larger concert). I also am usually doing different levels of practice because I\u2019m preparing things for different times. So, I\u2019ll have something brand new I have to perform in 6 months, something I learned 3 years ago that I\u2019m bringing back up to performance standard, something that\u2019s mostly learned but needs some polish... and having repertoire in different stages of preparation means I\u2019m not just doing rote repetition of things I know really well to the point that they lose meaning (like repeating a word over and over until it sounds/looks like nonsense) OR only learning new repertoire which can be mentally and vocally exhausting because you don\u2019t have the muscle memory to sing it with the most ease nor are the music and lyrics memorized so your brain is working overtime trying to process 20 elements of what\u2019s on the page at once for what you will be singing next as you\u2019re turning what you just looked at into sound.
