I started stealing cigarettes from her, and ended up smoking 7, 8 cigarettes a day. until one day that during a prayer I was sincere to God, and said that I couldn&#39;t stop smoking and that I didn&#39;t really have the strength and that I really wanted to and asked God to help me and take the pleasure of smoking from me...\r<br>One day inside the church during a preaching that a pastor was doing, I heard a voice speaking in my ear clearly; - &quot;So far I&#39;ve let you try, to show that you&#39;re not capable. From today you don&#39;t smoke because I don&#39;t want to!\r<br>I was so scared that when my wife told me what I had heard, she saw in me a frightened and admired person, who started to cry because she saw that I was not delirious.\r<br>Upon leaving the church my car had been broken into and my documents and my wife&#39;s documents had been stolen, along with the vehicle&#39;s sound. But I knew that if I got over that nervousness and anger I felt at seeing my car like that I wouldn&#39;t smoke anymore (it was like a test to confirm my convictions in the voice I heard).\r<br>I called my wife and we went home , I took everything I had connected to tobacco ( tobacco , paper , lighter , matches , cigarette pack ....) I put it on a piece of paper and rolled it up we went to the street, and on a sidewalk I threw alcohol and I prayed to God; - Lord, trusting the voice I heard today I know that I will no longer feel like smoking, in Jesus name I set fire to all these elements linked to cigarettes!\r<br>And by the honor and glory of God I was freed, in the name of Jesus!\r<br>\r<br>Vinicius Cruz", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T21:24:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hazza45", "comment_text": "Everyine actually has cancer in them but they start with small cells of it and something can make them react e.g smoking causing them to multiply amd grow giving you cancer", "comment_date": "2022-08-10T01:10:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adrian Cuyubamba Diaz", "comment_text": "Nicotine &lt; Tetrahydrocannabinol", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T04:26:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LITTLERETROSHIP", "comment_text": "BREATHE AIR!!!!!", "comment_date": "2022-07-30T14:55:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Untitled Channel", "comment_text": "We\u2019ll look at it this way, they are both really bad for you, and I\u2019d rather be friends with a smoker than a juuler", "comment_date": "2022-07-29T00:38:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Thash Machine", "comment_text": "A pack of marboros im canada is 20$ now and a pack of pods thst ususlly have more than one ergo multiple packs of cigarettes is about $15.", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T00:00:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yero Yertmin", "comment_text": "4 days vaping free as of today, after 9 years of daily use.", "comment_date": "2022-07-20T05:59:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "its_daboyconnor", "comment_text": "Wait so your telling me they wanna ban TikTok but not cigarettes or vapes- like fr", "comment_date": "2022-07-16T19:05:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SNOWBALL THE LITTLE HAMPTER", "comment_text": "Me casually smoking green tea \ud83d\ude36", "comment_date": "2022-07-16T08:57:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dorami", "comment_text": "But what if you get nicotine free vapes like caffeine diffusers?", "comment_date": "2022-07-13T21:12:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wippy Gaming (F2P)", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t think enough research was done because as someone who has smoked both of these I can say vaping is wayyyy cheaper than cigarettes, by a large margin.<br><br>The pods are what makes it expensive, that&#39;s why you don&#39;t buy pods, those vapes specifically featured in this video are literal scams that people who first start vaping buy.

Not to mention american spirits have the longest cig life of any cig that i know, and i still go through one in about 20 puffs or so.  So dollar to dollar the pod is cheaper. Their disadvantages are in fact, that A. You can binge on them, typically more then cigs because you can typically vape in more places then smoke. B. Because of this, you risk burning the coil out (i&#39;ve wasted probably over 7 pods just from doing this. I&#39;m going to go back to a mod setup because i&#39;m wasting money at this point) So honestly, it&#39;s a toss up about money wise.

Diacetyl, when inhaled constantly over very long periods of time, can cause popcorn lung, but the amount in vape juices, and I mean the maximum amount found in any vape juice, isn\u2019t enough to cause it. According to whatever regulatory agency controls it (in the US), the safe working conditions for diacetyl are above the maximum amount of diacetyl found in vape juices. Cigarettes actually contain anywhere from 50 to 100 times more diacetyl than vape juices containing it. Cigarettes are worse than vapes, it cannot be disputed anymore. The evidence keeps piling up. However, vaping and juuling are not healthy in the least. They are a safer alternative to cigarettes, but quitting nicotine all together is better. I would like to note that children should especially avoid juuls. Adding nicotine (or any drug for that matter) into a developing body is a terrible idea.

Article 13 would make sites where users upload content (like YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram) responsible for copyright infringement that the USERS of the  site commit. This means that instead of the individuals (who use copyrighted content as their own) being punished, YouTube and the other sites are responsible for the infringement and can be sued by the copyright holders. Because of the sheer amount of content uploaded to YouTube every minute, YouTube can&#39;t manually search the videos for violations, and any mistakes their algorithm makes can cost them thousands in lawsuits. Therefore, the best option YouTube and other similar content sharing sites have is to create a &quot;bubble&quot; around the EU. NOTHING can get in, and only the largest companies like Warner Brothers can post content so YouTube knows that that content is safe. All this is made possible by the VAGUE wording in the current draft of Article 13, which allows lawyers of the copyright holders to sue YouTube on the basis of incorrectly interpreting vague laws.<br><br>You might be thinking: &quot;Well, I&#39;m in the US/Canada/India/Mexico so nothing bad can happen to me.&quot; It can. This sets the precedent for other countries and shows copyright holders in the US that if they can get a law passed, they&#39;ll make lots of money from lawsuits and have their content safe from copyright. They will pay senators and representatives big bucks in order to gain their vote in passing a law like this. We, as a collective internet, cannot let Article 13 pass. <br><br>So what can you do?<br>1: Spread the word. Copy/Paste this comment on every video in your feed. Tweet about it. Tell your friends. <br>2: If you are in the EU, talk to your representatives. Calmly and logically convince them that passing Article 13 in its current vague state is a terrible idea.<br>3: Share The Film Theorists most recent video about this issue.<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/GbXHrj8k7dg\">https://youtu.be/GbXHrj8k7dg</a><br>4: Spread memes while you still can.

But maybe my story is a rare case, and maybe i just have weak lungs. I ended up going to the doctor and was diagnosed with bronchitis, this was after only a few months of vaping.

Well I am here to tell you that you can depend on the Holy Spirit\u2019s constant help. You see, God\u2019s Spirit working in you will not only help you in every aspect of your life, but will also bring Him the glory He deserves. In the Book of John, Jesus knew His followers would need support after He left the earth. When He told them about His upcoming absence, He said they would gain a new kind of connection with God through the Holy Spirit. This Spirit would be a moment-by-moment helper\u2014a teacher and guide who would not only live with them but also be in them (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKXVtdkmZbs&amp;t=14m17s\">14:17</a>, 26).          <br><br>The Spirit would provide Jesus\u2019s disciples with internal help from God, which would enable them to endure what they couldn\u2019t handle on their own as they fanned out to share the good news. In moments of struggle, the Spirit would remind them of everything Jesus said to them (v. 26): Do not let your hearts be troubled . . . Love one another . . . I am the resurrection and the life.            <br><br>Precious one, the Holy Spirit can also work in your life. To help you overcome struggles and live your life to the glory and the will of Elohim (Father God) in the name of our Lord and Savior Yeshua (Jesus Christ). Understand that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Jesus Christ into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be justified in salvation and blessed abundantly with love.          <br><br>Please be comforted in praying the following prayer with me.....Dear Abba God, thank You so much for the ongoing support available through the Holy Spirit.

I smoked for a while, lungs clogged up and I was coughing every morning like most smokers. I stopped and now vape 24/7 (even sometimes in class at school) . I can now excercise just like before I was smoking and literally never cough. It\u2019s a way better option as most of you will already know. Also if your going to do it, get a basic one with coils which cost about \u00a35 a pack. Make sure you spend at least 30 quid because this means you\u2019ll probably be getting a higher quality one. I recommend the endura t22 kit. This is WAY cheaper than juuling because your using eliquid from bottles, not pods. When I was in America I bought myself a juul to keep myself going for my 2 week stay. It cost many dollars to keep up! Use one which takes eliquid bottles because this usually means better clouds, better taste, better throat hit and lower price etc etc. Also, I hear a lot of my non vaping peers saying \u201cvaping is just as bad, it causes pop corn lung\u201d. This WAS the case when vaping was new because eliquids often contained diacetyl. It no longer does. You can still get hold of diacetyl liquids because for some reason, some members of the vape community actually love it. I\u2019ll never know why but anyways... it\u2019s not permitted for your average eliquid company to include this chemical so NO VAPING DOES NOT CAUSE POPCORN LUNG.
