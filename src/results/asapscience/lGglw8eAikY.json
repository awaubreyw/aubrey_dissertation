The ex that cheated even made fun of us trying to say were a couple but then my friend says &quot;I only see him as friends.&quot; That broke my heart to :/ had some times i really though she liked me but guess its my imagination. Now new class and think a new crush on a quiet but nice girl she is 1.5 years older than me i think but she is really nice sometimes a talk but she is gonna speed to her exam cause she doesn&#39;t like the other classmates cause they are like extremely busy compaired to us.

I\u2019m thinking that she wanted me but she told me she didn\u2019t feel the same way and that we were just friends. I have bad attachment issues . Even though I was never actually in a relationship with these people it hurts because I was so close to them . Well at least the last 2 I mentioned. I thought this girl actually liked me but she didn\u2019t and she was just using me until she found someone\u2019s better . I also just kinda gave up hope .

Now the last couple of days shes been very dry all of a sudden, eventhough the last time weve seen eachother  (a week ago) was great, as always. So I was planning on asking if she could be my girlfriend the next time i saw her. But like i said shes been very dry the last couple of days, so i called her and asked whats the situation is. long talk short, she feels guilty by meeting me and cuddling me etc. So she said that it cant happen between us right now. But she also said that if i asked her 2 months ago at the beginning if she would be my gf, that we wouldve been together for 2 months now. But now not anymore cuz in just a few days without me knowing she has completely changed her mind out of nowhere. She told me its because her also musllim friends talked to her and her parents. But i really do like her and I know she likes me, we talk everyday and she talks to no other boys, so I dont wanna give up ya know. So what do i do?

She told me that she felt like she couldnt give me the time I deserved, with everything going on in her life. Even before then we didnt talk much so I never really got attached, as you should. It wasnt until recently that I found out she found someone else. First thing I did was well try to talk to her, which was probably one of the worst ideas. You know people change. So she was acting a whole differently. Saying that this would\u2019ve never happened had my friends not been involved so much. This was hypocrite to say as most of the time her best friend would make her decisions. I really did love this girl, don\u2019t get me wrong. First couple days I was sad. Then I though: If she was never sad about it, why should i? I surrounded myself with family and friends. Did things to get he off my mind. Accepted things and let her go. Im still going through it and still thinking about what I could\u2019ve done to prevent this. The fact is, this was never love. When you love someone, you try to fix things and it should be unconditional. Yet she walked away so fast for me to believe it was love. Im 15 and I mean love is love, so I was sad. Yea theres more things to worry about like school and future goals, but seeing the person you trusted and loved the most walk away. Its really sad and heartbreaking. Feelings and people change wether its for the better or worse. If you\u2019re going through one as well. Just appreciate the great memories you\u2019ve made and learn from it.

No trust, no one to cry on the shoulder, Sometimes I wish I didn&#39;t have family, because they really are useless to me deep in my heart. My parents did so much for me and I know that, but due to the distant relationship and fights I don&#39;t love them as much as I love being alone and with friends only. Sad I know, I sure hope that my children won&#39;t do that, but karma might do something to do it. Today. I cut myself. Due to the fact I was depressed and there&#39;s no support. Lonely. Yes, mom is here, yes dad is here, but I can&#39;t have their trust. So I dealt bleeding a bit with the pain. The emotional pain was a little worse. But when I had to wash the blood off then physical took over. I didn&#39;t know what I was thinking. It was horrible and I am unlikely to cut myself again. Its something to talk about with close friends. Strange, I care, love, and trust my friends, like family except they don&#39;t live with me and not my blood, but they&#39;re close. With family the complete opposite. I can&#39;t trust same blood. I can&#39;t love the discipline and the gifts of family. It makes me vomit kinda. Its like i&#39;m living with strangers that love me. I can&#39;t love them! Its too hard..! I can&#39;t take the fact of a alcoholic mother and a apathetic, busy father and me in my &quot;castle&quot; alone. I don&#39;t allow them in my cave.

It&#39;s ironic because he barely ever texted or called me while we were dating. I think he might have texted me like 3 or 4 times and that&#39;s it. I always initiated contact. In fact, I initiated everything. I asked him out, I suggested more than half our plans. Here&#39;s the real kicker. He&#39;s 38 and I&#39;m only the second girlfriend he&#39;s ever had. I&#39;m 25, so there was a bit of an age difference. To top it off, he&#39;s a virgin. None of those things mattered to me in the least. I loved him and I let him set the pace completely. He was so scared of commitment that he never once introduced me as his girlfriend in public. All he would say is &quot;This is Lauren.&quot; when he introduced me to his friends and others he knew. It would make me so angry, but I constantly bit my tongue and withheld my anger because I knew it wouldn&#39;t solve anything to explode at him over it. I saw the all red flags but I ignored them because I was so fucking smitten.
