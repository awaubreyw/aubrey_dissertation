For A Week!!! Weighing 216 pounds, I knew I would lose weight faster than others but I didn\u2019t expect these results. First of all, I started on a Sunday which is why I\u2019m saying this on a Saturday and crazy stuff happened. I\u2019m always searching this stuff but literally no one has tried this, I\u2019ve only seen stuff on fasting but studies only get technical and say people will give up in a matter of days so they don\u2019t elaborate on it anymore, which sucks because I wanted to know beyond the point of giving up. And others just fake their fasting. So let me tell you what I did. First of all I fasted by not eating a single thing. Only drinking water, and a cup of brisk every time I felt hungry. I bought a 3 liter bottle of brisk since that is all I would trick my body into \u201cconsuming\u201d but only allowed myself to drink a cup per day. On Sunday I started off great, didn\u2019t even care. I drank my cup of brisk at night went to sleep and it was easy. Monday came and i started contemplating what to eat. But I stopped myself. I drank my first cup and played video games for hours to distract myself until the day ended. I took naps also and just did whatever to have time pass by. Tuesday I woke up starving with a dry mouth. I felt weak but didn\u2019t care because I expected it. The whole day I spent slouching, being lazy, and not having the energy to do anything or put thought into anything. But I never slept. I couldn\u2019t do anything I enjoyed and was so emotional towards the end of the day. Night came and I was so tired from not sleeping or napping all day that I knocked out. Wednesday comes and something happened I never knew could ever happen. MY BODY SWEAT A TOTAL OF 9 POUNDS!!! I fell asleep and kept waking up for minutes only to fall asleep again for 14 hours straight from 12am - 2pm of Wednesday. I went to sleep 115 pounds and weighed 106 pounds when I woke up! I told everybody I knew but they didn\u2019t think much of it. I showed them my proof and everything yet no one seemed to care. They just kept telling me not to starve myself and eat. But I didn\u2019t want to, I hate not fitting in my clothes so I brushed it off my shoulders. I went to my room and drank my cup of brisk. I did research and you can too if you don\u2019t believe me, studies have proven that people have gone to sleep and have lost a total of 1-7 pounds of water weight. I know it\u2019s water weight and not much will think of it but that\u2019s a huge significance for me in my weight. So I go to sleep at the end of the day and then weirder stuff starts happening the next day. I wake up earlier than usual, I keep sweating but now my body can\u2019t rest. I woke up at 6am and couldn\u2019t sleep for the rest of the day. My body felt so unproductive but not having enough energy I didn\u2019t bother to look for food. I stayed in bed ALL DAY. I was just thinking constantly, looking at the mirror constantly just to see even the slightest of change or improvement. Even trying on outfits and seeing how I fit in them now compared to before. I went to sleep Thursday weighing 104 pounds devastated. I woke up early and sweating still. Now stuff started getting technical. I realized I never drank my cup of brisk and drank two. I weighed my self and saw I was 105! I hated myself. I realized now every ounce of water or brisk I drink I will be able to see on the scale no matter what. I hated myself. I thought I lost progress and thought of a solution. I kept taking naps, doing whatever I could to sleep no matter what. Constantly the thought of self hatred and sleep motivated me to. Hours and hours of naps, Only resolved to one thing I knew would happen. I\u2019m a heavy sweater and maybe it\u2019s due to my weight. So when I sleep I sweat a lot, I woke up very late and weighed my self. It\u2019s now Saturday Morning, 3:52 am and I weight 199.2 POUNDS!!!!! I can\u2019t believe it man. I went to the first video of fasting which is this one and told my story as the video went on. I\u2019m going to be fasting for a month, it feels like hell but I won\u2019t allow myself to go above 200 Pounds ever again. I\u2019ve weighed over 200 pounds for 4 years now! Never again. I\u2019m telling this to people who want to know the results but can\u2019t find them anywhere. I\u2019m going to copy and paste thing comment so I can post it on comments of other videos that might resemble this one for anyone interested. I\u2019m willing to answer to any comments whenever I\u2019m available.

Third day I started noticing feeling really fatigue. Alot of times I found my self almost falling from feeling dizzy whenever I&#39;m walking for a long time . 5th day was feeling OK I had pain in my sides but decided to ignore that . At the 7th day (the day I broke my fast) I literally and physically and mentally could not get out of my own bed and felt as though everything is in slow motion . Had to call my brother and told him to bring vegetable soup and some essential vitamins . My starting weight was 95 KG and my height is around 178 CM . My result was 75 KG after a week . But the thing is after a month from that experience I gained all of my weight even though I didn&#39;t eat any fast food or fried food only boiled and BBQ and weighed around 112 KG .

Very easy way to loose weight, and get rid of fat.(Do not exercise to the point you are gasping for air, but some good jogging will help burn fat faster)", "comment_date": "2019-12-19T03:36:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Ellis", "comment_text": "This is helpful.", "comment_date": "2019-12-18T01:18:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Assa Darlingtoni", "comment_text": "Good thing i eat 5,000 calories per day, lol", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T20:34:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "F\u00f8ggyleaf Exist", "comment_text": "Can all of you please stop talking about your eating disorders here?

I would be late to school which means I had no time to eat and no time to make lunch. After a few weeks I decided to fully starve myself and not eat any meals because I was going through a tough time. I had also starting working out within that same time. After about 2 weeks of not eating the feeling of hunger completely disappeared and I would never feel hungry. I only ever drank water. I realized some of my friends would notice my eating habits so once in a great while I would munch on something light like a power bar or toast and I survived this way for 3 months. I lost 10 pounds within those months which is quite a bit in my opinion for only 3 months (2 1/2 months maybe I cant quite remember but around 3). My mom had even complimented saying She could tell I was loosing weight. At that moment I only continued my routine until break came along and I lost track and binged ate and since then Ive gained weight. But I didnt gain more weight im at the same amount of pounds I was at before I lost weight. Anyways I don\u2019t recommend starving but I would be hypocritical since im still going through it. My point was hunger lasts for only about 2 weeks before your body suddenly stops reminding you that it wants food. But still once in a great while eat something whether it be one meal a month or maybe toast or something.

It also won&#39;t break down your bones but rather fasting mobilizes calcium in your body!

If life was all about live and die and there was no life after death, there wouldn&#39;t have been any need for Christ to leave His glorious throne and come down into this world of sin and iniquity to go through all He went through. 1 John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0diS49kvWWE&amp;t=2m15s\">2:15</a>-17 KJV\u00a0<br><br>But the devil through his agents in pastor&#39;s clothing has succeeded in making most believers to forget what Jesus died for and caused them to be pursuing the perishable things of this world that has no eternal value. Most believers have totally forgotten what they are made of; they forgot they are spirit in a body. The devil has blinded them to concentrate on the body that would die and forget the part that never dies. Hebrews <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0diS49kvWWE&amp;t=9m27s\">9:27</a> KJV\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0My beloved in Christ, don&#39;t let anyone deceive you into hellfire; you have a very short lifetime on earth.

Run from the ungodly and sinful pleasures of this world and fight for the safety of your soul. Give your life to Jesus Christ if you are not yet born again.

The body does begin to break down protein after 72 hours, but the vast majority of it comes from cannibalized old and/or under performing cells that the body seeks out in an effort to maximize energy stores. In particular cancerous cell tissue is targeted (as everyone\u2019s body produces some cancerous tissue daily that the immune system must deal with). The body can also metabolize fat into a simple sugar (along with some excess proteins) to form sugars which are then used as the make up fuel for the parts of the brain that cannot process ketones. Muscle tissue is the last to be targeted and it takes much longer than three days before any serious kind of muscle tissue degradation occurs. More like 5 to 7, and for some even more, days. Even then the amount is very small. Most heart arrhythmia problems are caused by lack of electrolytes (salt, potassium, magnesium which are vital for proper muscle function), which can be remedied by merely taking a supplement, as well as vitamin issues which can be remedied in the same manner. People all over are regularly doing 7, or 14, or 30, or even 40 day fasts. If unprepared you will have issues, but with some knowledge and preparation it can be done. I just finished a 41 hour fast, and a 44 hour fast just before that. And I normally only eat one meal a day.

Also, I felt a few small pains around my stomach a few times, and had gotten 3 random red/purple bruises out of nowhere. (Which is sometimes an effect caused by water fasting). <br>Day 4: In the middle of the day, I suddenly feel no hunger whatsoever! My stomach stops hurting and I feel a lot more energy. I still mentally wish I could eat and could have a few junk foods but if you were to place something like a pizza in front of me I would not eat it. I feel I have a lot more self control, and even eating something small like a small salad would feel like a lot of food to me. <br>Day 5-7: Still not feeling hungry whatsoever (only a little bit mentally), unfortunately my bruises haven&#39;t disappeared or lessened in color at all so I will need to go to the chemist and see if if I could get something to fix it.<br><br>Day 8: I quit my 1 week fasting and I am eating only vegetables for at least 4 days to break my fast. <br>*Warning*: Do not drink a cup of liquid that is something other than water on the very day that you break your fast (e.g. Thick Vegetable Soup) because 99% of the time, you will feel so much pain because your stomach has not recovered it&#39;s former natural amounts of Stomach Acid yet that it needs to digest regular/healthy food again. I had done this, and it felt my rib cage was tearing and I nearly puked and felt I was going to pass out! That&#39;s why I recommend that you break your fast slowly over a period of 4 days, with green vegetables like pickles and cucumbers. <br><br>So yes, I was very lucky that I didn&#39;t experience any severe symptoms from my Water Fasting experience. But I am sure that was because, prior to my first ever Weekly Fasting I had already been growing used to the Fasting experience for at least 2 weeks. For 2 weeks I had fasted for at least 3-4 days per week. It seems as though, most people commenting below had only suddenly started a 7+ day Fasting which will hit you a lot harder than gradually getting used to Fasting. <br><br>Furthermore, it was also a lot easier for me to achieve since I am an overweight person so people who are at their regular BMI will (on average) have more unpleasant symptoms occur during a water Fast. But now I will reduce the amount of days that I fast each week because, if you eat too little calories/fast too long... you may loose a lot of weight at first but then your Metabolism will decrease over time (especially after a 4-6 month period of severe diet restriction). And so, it&#39;ll be a lot harder to loose weight over the long term. I personally was only in a rush since, I have type 2 diabetes and if you become less than 220 Pounds (100 Kg&#39;s) and you are of a young age... there is a chance, that you can actually loose your type 2 diabetes. + Fasting can help decrease or even get rid of some conditions/illnesses (to an extent) and now I don&#39;t have (mild) eczema anymore!<br><br>From this 7 Day Fast I had lost 15 Pounds (7 Kg&#39;s), but half of that was actually just water weight. (This happens with every 7 Days+ Fast.) So once I start breaking my Fast and eating vegetables again, I will become 7.5 Pounds (3.5 Kg&#39;s) heavier which is fine to me because weight loss needs to be realistic in order for it to work. I will keep dieting and eating healthy until I reach my goal, and I wish the person reading my comment that they will also have a healthy and happy life also. :)", "comment_date": "2017-09-08T18:29:57Z", "likes_count": 521}, {"comment_by": "Kati", "comment_text": "@AsapSCIENCE what if I take bcaa sups???

Please read the Obesity Code by Dr Fung.  Before there was farming, before there was government and malls and food stores humans would go without eating for long periods of time.  Other mammals in the wild go without eating every day for weeks.  It is very healthy not to eat and do healthy spring high pH water fast for at least 3-5 days.  It regenerates stem, white blood cells, your immune system, cleanses your gut, liver, blood, pancreas, basically everything.  Protein if needed will be used from your skin which is made of protein.  It is stupid to think that as smart as the body is that it would canibilze itself.  Right after three days you have more energy, cognitive function improves dramatically because your body is smart enough to know that you need that to hunt for food.  If you are not ready for a full water fast you can do a 16/8 intermittent fasting in which you eat about noon and then at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0diS49kvWWE&amp;t=6m00s\">6:00</a>pm.  Only two meals.  We don&#39;t need 3 or more unless you do a lot if exercise.  The food industry makes billions of dollars the more you eat and they dont care if yiu become sick or obese.  Eat healthy fats like avocado, lots of fiber and vegetables with lots of minerals, antioxidants and vitamins for your 2 meals.

Beta-Oxidation is the name of the process that utilizes fatty acids in tissues for energy in the fasted state. Your body will also break down muscle tissue for amino acids (alanine, glutamine) to send to the liver and kidney for a process known as gluconeogenesis. From this process, the body will create more glucose from these amino acids, along with many other compounds that can contribute to this process. The goal of your body is to maintain a steady blood glucose level because the brain demands it and is unable to use all other nutrients (like fatty acids) except for ketone bodies (which, yes, are derived from fatty acids). Without this steady level of blood glucose your brain would not be able to function properly and you would faint. <br><br>Ketogenesis starts at around 3 days I believe, (forming ketone bodies from fatty acids) but your brain doesn&#39;t fully adjust to it as a major source of nutrition until weeks of fasting, in which your body enters a new state called the &quot;starved&quot; state. Here, your brain adjusts to ketone bodies and stops demanding a high glucose blood level. This is beneficial because gluconeogenesis uses muscle proteins, and to constantly maintain that blood glucose without any food entering the body means constantly breaking down muscle tissue. If this were to continue, you would undergo multisystem organ failure and die. So, your brain switching to ketone bodies after some time is a good thing, because the brain begins to utilize fat stores for energy, just like the rest of the body is.<br><br>Eventually, when your fat stores run out, gluconeogenesis must occur again to keep the brain alive. You eventually cause organ failure because you are eating away at your muscle for the sake of glucose.

The thing that saddens me is that when I had an eating disorder, I didn&#39;t want to be &quot;sexy&quot;. This probally was linked to my body disphoria. I have bigger breasts, I never liked that. I wanted to be like a skinny log. Videos and information like this is what got me back to eating. Although, while telling me what not eating was doing to my body helps for me, it will not help with everyone that suffers from eating disorders.<br><br>My eating habbits started on a Tuesday, yes, the sick reminder that I starved myself was September 27th. The day before I had planned to not eat. My mother had strepped throat, she didn&#39;t eat much for four days because of her illness. She lost nine pounds. I thought that of I didn&#39;t eat at all for an extended time then maybe I could lose even more than she did. The next day I woke up and didn&#39;t eat breakfast. That afternoon I ate one starburst, not a package with two, just one. When I got home from school I lost the record, I had a grilled cheese and nearly five servings of corn. Then for dinner I had nine ravioli&#39;s and one piece of garlic bread. I had about nine cups of water along with it. The next day I didn&#39;t eat breakfast or any lunch. After lunch I had a class at school and we cooked stir fry rice, I only ate a little, mainly because it was bland, this was surprising because normally we had delicious food. When I got home I had one cup of water and 82 pretzel sticks. Which was two servings. I then had stir fry rice for dinner. With two cups of water. The next day I ate one serving (41 pretzel sticks) when I got home from school and nine cups of water. The next day I ate gum. The following two days I only ate gum. I was sadly proud that I hadn&#39;t eaten for three days straight. I lost nearly ten pounds. Then I ate the next day. I had 41 pretzel sticks when I got home and then the vegtables my mother made for dinner with my own rice. She didn&#39;t question why because they were having chicken for dinner with corn, peas, and broccoli. I was a vegetarian, and still am. The next day I had a bowl of corn flakes with a little sugar for breakfast, then after school I had 41 pretzel sticks. Then the next three days I ate nothing at all. It went on, three days of 41 pretzel sticks the first with rice, 41 pretzel sticks with rice, 42 pretzel sticks with cereal and rice, no food, no food, no food, 41 pretzel sticks with rice, 41 pretzel sticks with rice, 41 pretzel sticks with rice and cereal, no food, no food, no food. <br><br>After two months of this I began to make more friends and I got more clothes and I felt happy. <br><br>After four months of this my grandma (step fathers side not that you need to know lololool sorry) did notice my absence of eating. She asked me questions and I began to eat more. For five months I ate breakfast which was always corn flakes with a little sugar with 41 pretzel sticks and some rice,  corn flakes with a little sugar with 41 pretzel sticks and some rice,  corn flakes with a little sugar with 41 pretzel sticks and some rice, no food, no food, no food. Of course I&#39;m not counting the days where I had cooking class and we ate, I mostly only ate a little and threw the rest out. After those five months I began my original cycle, you know it. I did this for almost a year dropping a few pounds every week, I was soon way under weight and many people helped. There were about 15 people who generally helped me start eating normally again. I am still under weight and I&#39;m trying to gain more to be healthy. Here&#39;s some advice: If you want to lose weight, do it the right way. It is more challenging but atleast if you do it the right way your body gets more healthy instead of making that go down.v", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T22:23:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grace", "comment_text": "Eugenia Cooney needs too watch this educational video.", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T21:53:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I STALK FICTIONAL CHARACTERS", "comment_text": "I have anorexia and I don&#39;t even remember  how it is to eat a normal amount of food anymore.

By week four, I had to move slowly and deep-breath to keep from passing-out; about this time, I felt my body shifting its fuel source from (primarily) fat to muscle: catabolysis. In the 36th day in the middle of the night, my body woke me and basically &quot;said&quot; STOP THIS NOW!! I did so only because I had made myself accountable to those who love me. What had started as a spiritual effort (for people I love) devolved into a spiritual struggle where I really didn&#39;t care if I survived. By the end of it, I had lost over 40lbs (not counting fluid) and I had re-triggered the anorexia I had in my early adulthood. My fat was depleted enough that my body lost its curves and it was painful to sit on hard surfaces. Then as I gradually regained weight, I was scared I would overshoot my &quot;dream weight,&quot; so I ended-up in several smaller fasts in the ensuing months. Now I am just a bit above my dream weight, gradually heading back down at a couple pounds a week. I still don&#39;t have a good relationship with food as a result of last year&#39;s fast, but I am obtaining some degree of balance. Spiritually, the outcomes I had hoped for did not occur, or rather not in with the speed and in the manner I would have liked; BUT I learned some very crucial things about &quot;control&quot; and &quot;outcomes&quot; that amount to a &quot;spiritual breakthrough&quot; which has enabled me to grow in some unexpected ways.", "comment_date": "2016-08-01T03:32:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HeyItsSea", "comment_text": "ok well I&#39;d die right away, I litterly weigh 83 pounds and I&#39;m about to turn 13 WtF man yay", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T06:53:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nymphic", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0diS49kvWWE&amp;t=1m31s\">1:31</a> is it just me or is that womans patella (search it) a freaking WORM", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T00:04:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emily Ramjohn", "comment_text": "I am 10 and didn&#39;t eat anything for 6 hours....my hands keep shaking", "comment_date": "2016-07-30T18:07:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KosKI Tv", "comment_text": "subscribe me \ud83d\ude03", "comment_date": "2016-07-30T09:58:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "3Pney", "comment_text": "people do water only fast for weeks and they say they feel better.<br>my longest water only fast was 6 days.", "comment_date": "2016-07-29T13:22:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Klara Debeljak", "comment_text": "im eating pizza while watching his video. in my head im like &quot;Never&quot; \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2016-07-29T09:34:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Puddin Master", "comment_text": "Dont worry I wont", "comment_date": "2016-07-28T15:15:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zubair Baraskar", "comment_text": "what if I starve an extremely obese person?", "comment_date": "2016-07-27T23:58:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Farah", "comment_text": "My best friend weighs 45kg/99pounds and decided to go on a two week apple and water diet.

Next, when your glycogen is burned out your body begins to convert adipose tissue(FAT) into ketones. One of those ketones is Acetone. Yes, nail polish remover and paint thinner. The other ketones get sent to various tissues throughout your body and brain. The Acetone is converted to glucose which is converted to glycogen for use in your muscles as well as your brain and the rest of your body as well.You do not officially start to starve until your body drops BELOW 4% body fat. So if you have more than 4% Body fat, you will just keep burning fat until you go BELOW that 4% marker(Generally accepted BF level before starvation begins.) You can Literally survive longer if you are a fatty. I myself am one. Though LESS of one than 5 months ago. I have been fasting for 5 months. I eat a single 1500 calorie meal a day and I am down 96 pounds so far. There was a professional study performed in the 70&#39;s in England. They took a group Morbidly obese people. One of them was well over 400 pounds.\u00a0He fasted for 379 days.He consumed NOTHING but water and vitamins. He ended up weighing 179 pounds as was in PERFECT health. They checked him again 2 years later after resuming meals and he only went up 10 pounds.

It got to the point where I couldn&#39;t take it anymore and just stopped eating. I knew nothing about fasting at the time and didn&#39;t eat until I couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. I hadn&#39;t eaten food for a month (just drank water mixed with honey, tea, and coffee). I started out eating tiny portions of raw fruits and veggies, then went back to cooked food, then I went back to processed foods. NO MORE GUT/BOWEL PROBLEMS. I talked to my doctor about it and he said I probably had a bad colony of bacteria/viruses in my digestive tract and not eating for a month must have starved them out enough for the good bacteria in my body to kill it. Why wasn&#39;t I tested for bad bacteria and viruses when I was spending over 6k in the first place?  I would have lost my job and subsequently everything, if I didn&#39;t make the choice to stop eating. I probably would have died at dehydration at some point since the diarrhea and vomiting kept getting worse each month.", "comment_date": "2016-04-15T17:43:32Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Glompy Glorper", "comment_text": "So we are glucose addicts?", "comment_date": "2016-04-15T13:35:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Traxtan", "comment_text": "us &quot;Arabs&quot; fast for a whole month that is called ramadan", "comment_date": "2016-04-15T07:15:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "xxhahaha", "comment_text": "I havent ate in 1 day im not hangry idk why", "comment_date": "2016-04-15T06:56:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I Need Sleep", "comment_text": "every day I get off my bus I check for food and I starve to death and I can&#39;t handle it  at all! help me plz.", "comment_date": "2016-04-14T18:55:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashley Mu\u00f1oz", "comment_text": "I&#39;m eating while watching this...is that wrong?", "comment_date": "2016-04-14T09:31:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TrapSoundBeatz", "comment_text": "Gonna stop eating to loose weight in my face and drank loads of water, lets see how it goes haha", "comment_date": "2016-04-14T06:37:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Treasure Hollis", "comment_text": "if you stop eating...you die point blank period folks", "comment_date": "2016-04-13T23:25:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Lee", "comment_text": "pigs in the comments saying they can&#39;t go an hour without eating.", "comment_date": "2016-04-13T19:27:26Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Forest The Gamer", "comment_text": "I found this when I was looking for a way to throw up to lose weight", "comment_date": "2016-04-13T13:50:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gizmo Cookies", "comment_text": "mum showed me this thinking it&#39;d cure my ana", "comment_date": "2016-04-12T20:19:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathanael Jones", "comment_text": "what happens in the cell life cycle exactly", "comment_date": "2016-04-12T20:12:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kim Manns", "comment_text": "I haven&#39;t ate in 6 days and I&#39;m not even hungry I feel full all I do is drink water", "comment_date": "2016-04-12T04:25:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kit T", "comment_text": "Am I the only person who feels so sick if I wake up and don&#39;t eat for a couple hours?.", "comment_date": "2016-04-11T07:41:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u03c7\u03c7\u043c\u03c3\u0455\u0442l\u0443_ r\u03c3\u0455\u0454\u0455\u03c7\u03c7", "comment_text": "am kinda just getting grossed out by food I mean ill eat but its not the same any more", "comment_date": "2016-04-11T07:28:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ror Sin Ann", "comment_text": "How does braces work?", "comment_date": "2016-04-10T20:12:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rozjan", "comment_text": "so I&#39;m 185cm 18 years old and rughly 110kg what would happen if I stopped eating for 1 week but I still got the minerals and vitamins in my system?", "comment_date": "2016-04-10T15:00:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kai serin", "comment_text": "I want to die of being skinny", "comment_date": "2016-04-09T16:44:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Javier Barrios", "comment_text": "Imagine if suddenly scientists discover that there&#39;s a way for good living without food.

Third day, more and more heart palpitations but the shaking turns into an excess amount of energy and I feel like I can lift a car. Fourth day and the heart palpitations die down and I start to forget hunger even exists. Fifth day and I&#39;m not bothered at all, though heart palpitations raise by around 5% - 20%.", "comment_date": "2016-01-13T05:00:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ziriah The Artist", "comment_text": "Omg I feel bad for savvy", "comment_date": "2016-01-13T03:27:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Teo", "comment_text": "he drew a white chick getting hangry, of course", "comment_date": "2016-01-12T15:50:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eva Kellner", "comment_text": "I hate food", "comment_date": "2016-01-11T08:35:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bostonzo B", "comment_text": "Eating is over rated.", "comment_date": "2016-01-10T22:21:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manuel Barajas", "comment_text": "Ima starve till I loose weight", "comment_date": "2016-01-09T04:05:21Z", "likes_count": 23}, {"comment_by": "Chloe Frazier", "comment_text": "Your so smart!!\ud83d\ude42", "comment_date": "2016-01-09T02:38:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nevvo", "comment_text": "Note to self: don&#39;t eat while watching this video.

When rice spiked in 2008 the prime minister of Haiti was outsed and riots included food market burnings.  In other words, we continually gave them the fish, and they cast their fishing poles to the sea.  Society needs to enable farmers, not disable food economies by bringing in free food for all.

Countries that suffer from starvation are always way overpopulated for the environment they are in. Think about Africa. The lifestyle of it&#39;s inhabitants was fine tuned by evolution to fit the environment. However, when people from other civilizations came to invade, they brought their culture with them. People left their lifestyle that is suitable for smaller tribes and adopted one that their environment did not allow.<br><br>\u00a0From a social standpoint we, human&#39;s, want to save our kind; other humans. It makes sense at first glance to ship food from a more fertile soil to another. And we already do this, but nobody can just keep giving their food away without a cost. Nobody would agree to feed a foreign country at the expense of people much closer to them. Thus we are torn apart between the thoughts of &quot;i must give my food to those who starve because i have more food than i already need anyway&quot; and &quot;i am working hard to bring food to the table, should i limit my own family for the sake of others?&quot;.<br><br>\u00a0You could be thinking; &quot;People leave food on the table all the time around where i live, we clearly have enough food to save others&quot;. We do. Probably. We could ship all excess food on a country to another, perhaps enough to solve all problems of starvation for the people currently starving. &quot;Currently&quot; is the key word. There are a lot of beggars in Istanbul, most of them are children. Countries underdeveloped enough to face starvation are in an even worse condition than Istanbul, if you save a couple from starvation, they will create at least 3 more for YOU to feed, not them, because they cannot afford to feed them themselves. Thus, from a more philosophical standpoint, i cannot agree with the idea. Before people realize that it is not ok to create a child before you cannot even feed yourself properly, i will not help them. This is, from a social standpoint, almost as evil as wanting to kill these people, which is why it is not a popular opinion. But it is the hard truth of life.<br><br>\u00a0If you truly wish to help countries that face starvation, instead of increasing the amount of people that will starve, you need to sacrifice a lot more than just a bit of food. The entire world needs to adopt a different system that is based on keeping everything homogeneous, from wealth to health...
