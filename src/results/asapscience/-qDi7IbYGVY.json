When you blush, you can quickly help fade the redness by relaxing your muscles, particularly in your shoulders and neck2) Don&#39;t focus on blushing. Many people focus on their blushing when it occurs, worsening their social anxiety.3) Consider calling attention to it. If a person&#39;s on a date and they do something incredibly awkward, one way that they&#39;ll save the situation is by calling attention to it: I\u2019m not usually like this.4) Try rehearsing thought exercises. In order to help you feel both cooler as in physically colder, but also street-wise and to distract you from the blushing itself, try several thought exercises.
