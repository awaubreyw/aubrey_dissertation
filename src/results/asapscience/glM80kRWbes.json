Really? 1. you are under-claiming the deaths, mortality effects, economic costs, and negative environmental impacts\r<br>of the various historical nuclear disasters. You argue for the safety of nuclear power, but this is not as simple as you say.\r<br>There are as of now 440 existing nuclear plants in the world and to date there are 100 serious safety incidents involving them.  Since nuclear is potentially much more serious than other energies, that&#39;s a failure rate  around 23%, assuming total failure was possible in each incident. Nuclear safety is debatable at BEST, it is not a done deal by any means. Negative impacts continue from all the disasters and will continue for decades. How can you say nuclear is safe when you must account for say, ten thousand years of future waste storage?  DEBATABLE at best.<br><br>The most positive thing you could possibly say about the various nuclear disasters of record, is they are debatable. That&#39;s not what you said here.   \r<br>2. waste can be stolen for 10,000 years to make dirty bombs by bad actors. For all practical purposes this risk never abates while monitoring can and likely will abate given the massive time scale involved. <br><br>3. waste that is not stolen for nefarious purposes has to be monitored for massive periods for leakage- which is practically impossible. No human society lasts more than a thousand years or so, what to speak of ten thousand and it is incredibly presumptuous to bequeath a lot of toxic crap to ten thousand years worth of your descendants who did not even get a chance to vote on the original issue.

They can then charge their customers( you, me and everybody else) for the cost of that project at a 10% mark up.

The unnuclear power plant requires 500 to 800 employees. If we converted every coal burning plant to nuclear power We would create lots of jobs in America we could potentially create a 100000 new jobs in this country. All kinds of jobs are nuclear plants have between just electricians plumbers to forklift operators to people with college degrees who majored and nuclear physics. is so by renovating every coal burning power plant in this country would fight global warming and increase jobs and our economy.", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T17:23:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bzo Ned", "comment_text": "Let me explain why i think nuclear is bad 1) its too expensive. cost per KWH needs to fall to levels by natural gas, solar and wind. 2) construction is too slow. If i want solar or wind in 4 months, i get it in 4 months. if i want nuclear in 4 years, it becomes 16 years. why must all nuclear power plants have delays?  3) Nuclear &quot;clearance zone&quot;. if i want solar i can put it on houses. wind in seas. but nuclear needs a huge area of clearance. if i fill this clearance zone with batteries and solar, i may generate tons of energy  4) Lack of innovation, and improvement in key parameters. This is super important. i see a lack of fall in cost per kwh, energy generation per unit of uranium, energy per plant, and reduction in waste per unit electricity.

So given that a nuclear power plant produces waste and costs many billions, I would like to say that these days it is an obsolete model.  In Italy in the last ten years, homeless people have tripled to reach the MONSTER figure of 500,000 brothers in Italy who live sleeping on makeshift beds, often in the cold and frost. Now, in this sense, a nuclear power plant in theory, providing so much energy, it should also provide a lot of resources for these people.  And what happens instead?  That the price of the kWh produced by nuclear power ends up in competition with the production of electricity from fossils, conditioned by wars.  Thus the bill remains high and the production chain that goes from the producer to the consumer becomes very expensive.  That is, we look at nuclear power from a technical point of view, a point of view for which, let&#39;s face it, we do not have all these skills to judge.  We should look at nuclear power by including the employment relationship or the relationship between social well-being in terms of jobs produced and wealth produced.  Unfortunately, this ratio for nuclear power is very low, in other words nuclear power is one of the real culprits for the soaring increase in homelessness.  Even the gas electricity production chain has a very low factor of social well-being in terms of work produced.  On the other hand, if we look at a renewable source such as photovoltaics, it is bulky and requires large surfaces but produces A LOT of WORK and therefore has a very high social well-being index.  Having a MAINTENANCE MANAGER for every 500 kwp of production could lead us to have 100,000 jobs, people who pay taxes keep FAMILIES.  Photovoltaics reduce homelessness and improve roofs.  And then let&#39;s face it, we from rooftops in Italy<br> we have many.  Just think of the 56,000 schools, the 9,000 municipalities, the 2200 railway stations, the barracks, the hospitals.<br> We don&#39;t know what to make a person do?  We place 500 kwp on the roof of a school, a hospital, a barracks and then we give him his office in charge of photovoltaic control.  Instead of financing ghost towns in the desert or phantasmagorical structures in warlike countries, let&#39;s enjoy power generation.  Producing energy is well-being, gives satisfaction, stimulates research, produces GDP, lowers the debt because we do not have to pay foreigners .... all things we need, and how if we need them!

This has been common knowledge among reasonably well educated people, for decades.  However, there are several things in your presentation that are poorly thought out, and border on fear mongering.  Fossil fuels are not fossil fuels.  They come from decayed plant matter.  We are not running out of them, and the emissions from plants using these types of fuel can be easily mitigated.  The same ignorance driven myths that fuel the fear of nuclear power also surround petroleum and coal fired plants.  It would be great if you were to investigate and report on technologies that can help reduce emissions from current plants, and why those technologies are not being used!  Hint;  it&#39;s money!!!  Next is the hype regarding climate change.  While climate change is real, we need to look at why global warming is beneficial to the biosphere.  Earth will lose far more species with the advance of glaciers than with controlled warming.  The history of Earth has already shown this.  Cold can spur diversity, but it also reduces numbers drastically.  The largest plants and land animals in the history of Earth existed in a much warmer climate with higher green house gas concentrations.  Lastly, renewable energy is highly over rated.  Solar and wind fields take away natural environments, and destroy plants, animals, and their natural way of life.  In California, we have many wind fields, and the owners of the fields instruct their workers to not speak about the endangered species that are killed by the blades of the wind machines.  California&#39;s State Flower is the Poppy.  There is a poppy reserve in the Antelope Valley, but the fields surrounding the poppy reserve have been converted to solar fields.  So, there are hundreds of solar panels covering ground that used to grow wild California Poppies, but the reserve is fenced off from public access part of the time.  Renewable energy destroys animals and their natural environment, and the media and government gloss over these issues constantly.  Money is the reason for this behavior also.

Although we only have 3 running reactors atm, and 6 are shut down due to an incompetent and environmentally extremist, as well as ignorant, government. In December we had a drastic increase in electricity prices. The prices go up and down, of course, but it usually never goes above 1SEK/kwh. Right now, as I&#39;m writing this it&#39;s at about 0.25SEK/kwh plus the 2.8SEK fixed price. That&#39;s completely fine. However, the prices went over 7SEK/kwh last month. 1USD is about 9SEK and the average villa (I live in a 180sqm villa with 8 rooms and a kitchen) uses about 55kwh per day. That&#39;s quite low, though, cuz we use about 80\u2013100kwh per day. We have been worried that prices would go up drastically due to the government shutting down perfectly healthy reactors that could easily go on for another 20 years. And instead of slowly phasing out nuclear energy, they just shut everything down and then have no plan whatsoever to properly compensate for it. In my opinion, if you&#39;re going to phase out a certain source of energy, you should start by building a new source of energy before you remove the first one.

A uranium mine is pretty awful, but so are coal mines and lithium mines, and it takes 30x as many coal mines to generate the same electricity as one uranium mine of the same size. Cost is the only rational reason to oppose nuclear at this point but more affordable nuclear is not an insurmountable problem (among others things nuclear costs more due to expensive requirements placed on it at the behest of the fossil fuel industry that would make fossil fuels cost-prohibitive if they faced similar safety and environmental restrictions), but in the face of climate disaster, even if it remained more expensive we should be going full steam investing in it.

Pebble bed  fuel at first glance appears to be a good solution, but when <br>looked at more closely it is terrible. The pebbles are very hard to make   and IMPOSSIBLE to break down and recycle with current technology. <br>There are a number of fundamental problems of any solid fueled nuclear reactor. Nuclear fuel ALWAYS swells due to the intense radiation, <br>reaction byproducts quickly contaminate the reaction and cannot be remove from the solid fuel, unless the fuel is recycled. Also it only <br>allows utilization of a very small portion of the energy in the nuclear fuel (about 1-3%), requiring fuel bundle replacement in about 18 months.<br> When the core is decommissioned you still need to store the highly radioactive waste for thousands of years. Spent fuel MUST be <br>continuously covered in highly purified water for at least centuries to keep the fuel bundles below melting temperature. The continuous heat <br>from the fuel, evaporates the water quickly (hundreds of gallons in a short period of time) ALL spent fuel is currently stored in pools, on <br>site at the nuclear plant and there are no plans to recycle it as it is expensive and hard to do conventionally. Uranium is somewhat water <br>soluble (Thorium is not), so there is a groundwater contamination concern.<br><br>I used to oppose nuclear energy, mainly due to high pressure steam/hydrogen explosions (3 times so far) and long term <br>storage of highly radioactive fuel for 10k+ years. I have changed my mind, but only  if we build  Thorium liquid fueled, Molten Salt reactors (such as <br>LFTR)  instead of the VERY expensive large, boiling water conventional reactors we have now. Currently Thorium is  a waste product of a number <br>of mining operations, is orders of magnitude more plentiful than uranium and is basically as safe as dirt (it needs conversion inside the reactor to become useful <br>fuel, conversion takes 30 days and is free). Molten salt solves ALL of the fundamental problems of boiling water reactors, as part of their nature. They also cheaply and easily burn current stocks of used fuel rods leaving only a small residue that is safe in about 300 years. They effectively use about 95+% of the nuclear energy in the fuel. No <br>expensive explosion proof containment structure needed, as it cannot explode (it operates at ambient air pressure). They are walk away safe <br>(Oak Ridge Tennessee ran a molten salt reactor safely for 6,000 hours and performed walk away safe tests on it at full power in the 1960&#39;s). <br>In fact they shut it down every weekend because no one wanted to stay. They are well suited to the SMR form factor and easily allow continuous <br>removal of very valuable medical isotopes on an ongoing basis. These medical isotopes are impossible to remove from boiling water reactors. <br>They also provide high temperature waste heat that can be used in many high temperature processes now, such as steel, fertilizer or concrete <br>making, just to name a few. Desalinization of sea water on a huge scale is easy and cheap.<br><br>The only remaining hurdles are some slight metals compatibility proving needed. Chemical separation is a far <br>superior and cheaper process. The inventor of the nuclear tea kettle reactor (Alvin Weinberg) said it was fine for military use but was a <br>very poor choice for commercial reactors, as we have seen 3 times. For many years he strongly promoted the Thorium, liquid fueled reactor as a <br>far superior choice. Thorium is useless for making bombs which is one of the main reasons they used uranium instead back in the 1950\u2019s.  See <br>Thorium Alliance you tube videos for a good overview.

From 1986 onward, the total death toll of the disaster has lacked consensus; as peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet and other sources have noted, it remains contested.[1] There is consensus that a total of approximately 30 people died from immediate blast trauma and acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in the seconds to months after the disaster, respectively, with 60 in total in the decades since, inclusive of later radiation induced cancer.[2][3][4] However, there is considerable debate concerning the accurate number of projected deaths due to the disaster&#39;s long-term health effects; long-term death estimates range from up to 4,000 (per the 2005 and 2006 conclusions of a joint consortium of the United Nations) for the most exposed people of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, to 16,000 in total for all those exposed on the entire continent of Europe, with figures as high as 60,000 when including the relatively minor effects around the globe. Such numbers are based on the heavily contested Linear no-threshold model.[5]", "comment_date": "2021-11-26T16:06:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Demon", "comment_text": "You guys are brain washed, NUCLEAR power plants are not safe, there is no place to safely store the waste and the waste is radioactive for way to long.

Unfortunately there is so much confusion in the public arena about Nuclear Power and it&#39;s role in fighting climate change that it is difficult to trust the mainstream media to help get a balanced and informed perspective, so thanks so much to you guys for making the issue fun and informative.<br><br>For me I&#39;ve always been a strong supporter of Nuclear power.  Two reasons for that :-<br>a. I served in the Royal Navy here in the UK and like many Navies around the world they have been safely using Nuclear Power for decades.<br>b. I&#39;ve always been interested in Astronomy and Cosmology since I was a kid so the concept of nuclear power being ubiquitous is something I have always embraced.<br><br>Taking this last point I think can help to explain to skeptics why Nuclear Power is not only to be embraced but represents a key technology for the future of humanity.  When talking with those who denigrate Nuclear Power but are strongly pro Solar and Wind I ask these questions:-<br><br>What powers a solar panel?   Answer the Sun.<br>What powers a wind turbine?  Answer wind which is the movement of different temperature air masses as heated by the Sun.<br><br>So far so good ..... both require the Sun.<br><br>So what is the Sun?   Answer a Star .... aka a large thermonuclear fusion reactor composed of super hot gasses and plasma.<br>Our sun is one of over 200 billion stars in our Milky Way Galaxy and our Galaxy is just one of hundreds of Billions of Galaxies in the Universe.  <br><br>Simply put there are more stars in the Universe than there are grains of sand on all the beaches and deserts on Earth.<br>There are more Stars than there are people who live, ever have lived and probably are ever likely to live...... Each a self contained Thermonuclear Fusion Reactor.<br><br>We are alive because of the Nuclear Power of our Star.  Nuclear Power gives life to everything on Earth.<br><br>It&#39;s as if the Universe is lighting the way for us literally and showing us the beauty and power of the most abundant power source there ever will be.<br>To turn our backs on that is something I cannot understand.  Almost like saying we know better.  Well sadly as every day when we endlessly argue and find more capacity for division than unity we prove clearly we don&#39;t know better.<br><br>As Human beings we have always sought to advance ourselves.  It&#39;s in our DNA to explore and to solve puzzles, the harder they are the better as they are more likely to lead to significant development.<br><br>We hear so much about doom and gloom, extinction and existential Climate crisis.  I chose to view it as one of the greatest opportunities to advance, explore and learn in our history.  To throw that away would seem to be a very great shame.<br><br>I think the simple answer is all technologies have a part to play; wind, solar and nuclear but to give in to the fear and ulterior commercial motives seems like a pretty silly thing to do.<br><br>Calling occupants of Planet Earth ........

Hell, we evolved as a species, also thanks to the &quot;domestication of fire&quot;! But radioactivity? It&#39;s beyond our senses&#39; grasp and therefore it&#39;s so weird that we cannot bring ourselves to &quot;trust&quot; it, so to speak. Sure, then came all the scientists that studied it and really understood it, and finally channeled its power, but what percentage of the population are they?

These same folks knew that the ultimate goal was renewables, but the technological development of renewables would not be far enough along to make a dent until about 2020.  The only path to avoid climate change was absolutely known to be through nuclear power. Renewables could not get there in time due to all of the technological hurdles and scientific advancements, but it could gradually grow alongside nuclear until it was ready to start replacing.

Did you know generation plants have a annual carbon limit by law? I worked on power plants , many clients had several plants, more than their demand required. When one plant hit its legal carbon output they shut it down and just started a different plant that was at zero on carbon emissions. At the end of a year they generated the megawatts they needed and never emitted more than their total carbon emissions. They just used six or seven plants instead of two, if they used two plants instead of six or seven the power output and emission would of been the same, but the law would not allow it. The power companies built and maintain many times the facilities needed , your power bill goes up, many times  more of our natural resources are used and many times the pollution and toxic waste is generated to build and maintain the extra facilities. Who wins, well companies like GE which build these facilities win. They spend huge amounts of money lobbying for laws that allow that insanity all under the guise of reducing emissions and saving the planet. This doesn\u2019t reduce emissions, but increases emissions to build unnecessary facilities, increases hazardous waste to build and maintain them and depletes natural resources in the making of these unnecessary facilities!

Wind and solar can\u2019t even pay for its operation, construction and maintenance, they keep afloat by government intervention in the form of taxpayers money and selling carbon emission rights to fossil fuel power plants which pass the cost to its customers.

I do however believe we need a balance of all types of energy generation and believe that nuclear is clearly the best option as its also the most efficient type of energy.

Green energy may reduce the carbon emissions, but does have a negative impact on the eco-systems they get installed in. Such that wind turbines kill many birds and requires more trees (our filters of CO to the air mixture we breath) to be cleared out to get better air flow to the blades. That in turn forces some of the wild life to move out of the area.<br><br>Solar panels are made of some very toxic material that (currently) has no way to properly recycle and could leak into the ground if damaged. Depending on the quality of panel, you could get anywhere between 5 to 25 years out a panel. Its sad that some of these facts are glossed over when it comes to selling the green energy idea. <br><br>Lets also put this in some perspective (rough)... a typical 1,000 megawatt nuclear facility requires roughly 1 square mile to operate. For a wind farm to produce that same amount of wattage it would require 360 times more land area (roughly 360 square miles with a quantity of 3,333 turbine units) of &quot;cleared land&quot;.

I agree nuclear fission power might be some lesser evil in our struggle with climate change.  However, I have a bit more of a sober view on this subject.  Further, no, I don&#39;t want to move to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone...  You seem to be strongly implying that something like Chernobyl is not likely to happen again because our new technology will make serious accidents nearly impossible to occur.  Somehow, I think we&#39;ve all heard this line before...  And Chernobyl was not just caused by human error.  A similar incident occurred before Chernobyl in another RBMK reactor because of a design flaw in reactors of the RBMK type.  What&#39;s more, the safety issue with RBMK reactors which led to the Chernobyl disaster could still have been avoided if not for the culture of secrecy in the Soviet Union allowing officials in the Soviet Union to cover up the past accident at the other RBMK reactor.   Much of the cause of the Chernobyl disaster can also more generally be traced to how the Soviet system worked and how people learned to survive in that system.  Human systems, not just individual human error and misjudgment, can also contribute to the cause of failures and accidents.   But even if no further meltdowns at fission reactors occur in the future, all the nuclear material at a nuclear plant makes a tempting target for a terrorist or two warring parties.  Nuclear waste is not much of an issue...  OK, we&#39;ll start building the US&#39;s high-level nuclear waste facility in your backyard?  Wait... I thought Yucca Mountain was going to be the answer to all of the US&#39;s nuclear waste problems?  Smaller reactors and reprocessing spent fuel to reduce nuclear waste...  A reactor in every neighborhood.  Sounds great... yes, that&#39;s sarcasm.  OK, let&#39;s start by putting the main transport route for all this nuclear material on the street in front of your house.  And, of course, there is no chance terrorists might hijack that nuclear material while in transport?  But why would they need to do that if there&#39;s a reactor in every neighborhood?  Honestly, I&#39;m not sure who you think doesn&#39;t know these &#39;lies&#39; you talk about concerning fission power are at best facts absent important key related facts, like the comparison to other power sources?  Or, just failure to mention key other facts in the overall energy field.  But, a lot of activities lead to the emission of greenhouse gases... like uranium mining.  Fusion power... great, still another 30 years off.  IMHO, you&#39;re doing the same thing you&#39;re claiming anti-nuclear power activists are doing.  You don&#39;t have viable real-world solutions to the real risks and dangers posed by the continued use of fission power.  Finland is the only country I know of that currently is on track to having a viable high-level nuclear waste repository any time soon.  Regardless of what you or I might consider to be reasonable safety concerns, you must know the immense political obstacles to trying to establish a high-level nuclear waste repository here in the US or changing the law here to allow reprocessing of nuclear material?  I agree fission power may be some lesser evil in our struggle against probable existential dangers posed by climate change, however, fission power comes with some serious risks and dangers itself.

I mean shure it was made to convince people of the safety of nuclear power plants, but it also isnt completly honest. For instance the death figure from Tschernobyl is disputed because a lot of deaths cant be traced back specifficly to the meltdown. Lots of health issues were ignored by the Soviet Union and late effects, such as cancer, arent counted towards the total. Some sources put the numbers up in the tens of thousends. And the waste cloud produced also hab lasting effects. Just as an example: you are still beeing discuraged from foraging for mushrooms or eat wild boar meat in southern parts of germany because they contain higher doses of radioactiv material then normal. Of course you wont die if you pick a few mushrooms, but prolongt consumption can increase your risk of cancer. So there are health risks from reaktors.<br>Another thing is that you presume, that reactors are managed propperly. They should be, but some arent. Some are older then they were build to become and are still running, like the reactor Tihange in Belgium. One of its reactor compartmens litterally has thousends of smal cracks and since 2005 they are loosing about two liters of radioactiv water and nobody knows why or where it goes. Its list of incidents is long and it is not the only power plant that has such a list. There are hundrets of incidents in plants all over the world. They are just so smal and normal that nobody cares. I dont think thats very good.<br>The next thing would be the waste. No matter how high you praise your depos for it. Nobody knows what will happen to them in the millions of years the garbage is still dangerous. It is a time bomb that is out of sight and out of mind for a short time only.<br>The last thing that should be mentiond is, that there is not much uranium left in the earth. We cant expect it to last much longer then fossil fuels would. It is disputed if thorium is a solution to that. But this opens up a whole different can.<br>Oh and i just remembert that with a funktioning infrastruktur to produce power you can also pruduce bombs (some slight modifications are needet) - and bombs arent good<br>So in the end i would conclude that nuclear power is a bad solution for a worse problem.

Well yes people will say that solar panels are green and whatnot but usually the earth beneath solar panel filled lands is not usable to make crops, effectively doing the same effect as having a nuclear power plant at that spot.

However, I have come to understand that ANY energy source that can&#39;t be traced to recent solar activity, adds to the Earth&#39;s heat load, and can only be bad for the environment, ultimately. Solar PV, solar thermal, wind, and hydro are all energy sources that trace back to the sun, and the Earth can cope with the amount of heat that comes from there, assuming no greenhouse effect. Tidal energy is also acceptable, since the energy in tides already ends up as heat. Energy from fossil fuels, of course, traces back to the sun too, but it is the sun of eons ago and does not belong on the Earth of today. Nuclear energy, whether fission or fusion, adds unnaturally to the Earth&#39;s heat load. Energy of any type will eventually degrade into heat, and the amount of heat must be limited to what the Earth is capable of handling if we are to continue having a life-sustaining planet. I urge you both to not trade one lie for another. Nuclear power is just as hazardous as fossil fuels are. Still a GREAT power source for off-Earth use, though.

I am not a Expert, nor do i claim to be. But as i am interested in all things technical and everything that has to do with disasters (sound wrong i know), i read a lot of books, watched lots of documentations and videos. visited an abandoned NPP in Austria (Zwentendorf), just to get to know this technology as far as someone that is not working in nuclear energy can. So some things are personal opinions and some things are what i found, when i read countless books about it.<br><br>I am not scared of nuclear energy, but i thing the problem is:<br><br>1. Many of the NPPs that are active today, are very old. And yes there is much upgrading going on, but its basically the same with an old car, you can modernize the headlights and the electronics, upgrade the brakes, put better tires on, but someday you are limited by something or it would be too expensive to do so. <br><br>Here in Germany all the NPPs we had are build in the in the early 60s to the late 70s. That is pretty old for something that basically can, in the event of a disaster, make huge parts of land uninhabitable for decades. Yes, you can say that the only really bad disaster that did that was Chernobyl. You can also say that that Chernobyl was operator error and that it also had to do with a mayor problem in the system (soviet union) itself, and that the chance of something like that happening to us in the &quot;west&quot; is pretty low or none existing. But the truth is, that something like that can happen. You just have to look to Fukushima for that.<br><br>In terms of Fukushima: Was it wise to build reactors so low to see level? No, not really. Was it wise to put Diesel generators and batteries under or almost under sea level? Not really. Was it as bad as Chernobyl? Probably not, because there was not a massive radioactive excursion like Chernobyl had (with much of the fuel &quot;flying&quot; to the outside), but non the less there are people that had to leave there homes and can probably not return for decades to come.<br><br>2. &quot;not many people die, because of NPPs and nuclear energy!&quot;:<br><br>Well if you only look at the statistics that is true. Especially because, if someone gets cancer you can not link that to NPPs or nuclear energy directly. But you can also not say that it has nothing to do with NPPs. e.g. Here in germany near the NPP Kruemmel (AKW Kr\u00fcmmel) and the Geesthacht research reactors, there was a spike in leukemia since the 90s, when there were some &quot;minor&quot; or medium accidents in that NPP and the research reactor. As i sad  you can not 100% link theses, but it can not be a total coincidence.<br><br> &quot;many people die because of fossil fuels and its Power plants!&quot;<br><br>Well yeah that can happen, if you live in densely packed environments, like very big cities. I dont think that many people living outside of big cities and small villages die because of pollution coursed by fossil fuels. Through that does not mean that its good to use them. <br><br>3. Then there is the issue with the NPPs fuel. <br><br>From what i found out. Most of the NPPs in service only use about about 5 - 10% of the total &quot;energy&quot; of a fuel road, before its removed from the reactor. I know that it has to do with balancing the fission and power output, through i am not claiming to be a expert. If someone can explain it, please do so.<br><br>Most of the countries that are using nuclear power have no way to recycle these used fuel road in e.g. in Sodium-cooled fast reactor or a molten salt Reactor (through those are coming with other problems as far as i know). Only thing that is being done more widespread is fuel reprocessing. <br><br><br>&quot;But were do we put used fuel elements&quot;:<br><br>Well sadly the truth is, that at most placed it is just &quot;parked&quot; outside or in buildings near the NPP. Because most countries dont really have a solid way of storing these Fuel assemblies permanent. Only Country i know that has a solid plan for that is Sweden. (google SKB forsmark). In Germany we tried using an old salt mine for that, now they are trying to get all the waste out of there because of water getting into the mine.<br><br>So to come to an end. Is nuclear energy safe? Well in my opinion yes and no at the same time. On one point we didnt had that many accidents that made huge kilometers or miles of land uninhabitable. Only Chernobyl and Fukushima really managed to do so (well there was Kyshtym too). And yes not many people died because of the accidents itself. But at least for me, its not about what happend, but what could happen. Where ever humans are involved, there will be a chance for a mishap or a accident. That we can not change (because computers make errors too). And just because the number of direct dead that can be linked to Chernobyl or Fukushima is low, does not mean that the long term problem is gone. Because some of the people will maybe get leukemia or a form of cancer, or at least have higher chances to do so. Most of the radioactive materials that were set free by both accidents have half lifes of YEARS not days or month and that is only half of the time it takes to be &quot;harmless&quot;. Do we need Nuclear at the moment? In my opinion, yes we do. Germany, the country i am from, decided to go without nuclear energy. Was is wrong. That depends on how much effort we are willing to make to get renewable were we need them. <br><br>I life in a small village (as of 2008 ~1600 people) and we are doing what we can do to do so. Since 2001 we&#39;ve build 5x 1500kW (72m diameter) , 1x 2000kW (90m diameter), 1x 1500kW (82m diameter), 3x 3300kw (110m diameter) Wind Power plants, a small solar power &quot;plant&quot; and a bio gas power plant 2x ~1,1MW elec. . Most of that was at least partially build or financed by local farmers and/or the local community. Yes I know that that is not even close to what a NPP can produce. but it is local and it is enough for this little community at least. <br><br>On a greater scale and in combination with water power this could at least help get fossils out. But you need something to do the rest, and there, at least for the time being, nuclear would be important. But i dont think we should use it as the only option we have.", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T20:10:16Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "0 0", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glM80kRWbes&amp;t=3m38s\">3:38</a><br><b>B R A Z I L   N U T S</b>", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T20:03:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rachel Maxwell", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve been seeing more and more ads and videos promoting nuclear energy and I\u2019m glad to see it.

A modern plant is going to be much safer, than the already reasonably safe plants of old. The real problem is, that solar panels and wind turbine costs have come down to a point, that Nuclear is among the most expensive sources of energy, surpassed only by off-shore wind. (according to the Energy Information Administration) While the cost of coal and natural gas continue to rise, the total levelized cost of Nuclear stays about the same, the cost of renewable energy continues to drop. The caveat, is that renewable energy is intermittent at best, requiring energy storage, to insure 24/7 power availability from the grid. Energy storage is expensive, putting Nuclear energy back on par with renewable+energy storage. With all the work being done on new types of energy storage, that too, is likely to come down on price as well, which will again, under-bid Nuclear energy. Just like in war, the &quot;nuclear option&quot; is an absolute last resort. Since nuclear is expensive, it can&#39;t be too great a percentage of total power production, or it will cause higher rates for the consumer.<br>     Both sources need recycling programs, to economically re-use waste.

At least for my country, Germany, there was and is an abundance of ideas on how to achieve 100% reneawble energy for electricity and heating, not by one single perfect solution but more including a vast mix of different ideas to master the engineering, economics and bureaucracy of a decentralized 100% reneawble electricity and heating grid. Since Germany turned its back on nuclear energy I really did not think about it that much since then, but given that the discussion about it is heating up again I recently started to inform myself, mainly from sources advocating for nuclear energy to look at the orher side. So I am very thankful for this video, your research and opinion while still having practical concerns and still advocating against it.

But, I was sceptical. Sceptical about the media that published these documentaries and articles. To this day it is still unknown what exactly was the second large explosion in the Chernobyl R-4. Which is unacceptable. <br><br>Some theorise it was an explosive reaction between the Zirconium cladding of the fuel-rods, or just plain too much steam pressure that blew it up. And while I do not fear nuclear power, whatsoever, I DO however fear the PEOPLE behind it.<br><br>What we need is an International apparatus, with enough power to hold safety controls, and (if necessary) shutdowns on Nuclear plants. A commission which must approve the reactor designs, participate in the building process to ensure EVERYTHING is built to spec, and finally hold safety controls. They also must conduct research, and update the industry about new technologies in environmental and nuclear safety, with the authority to require plants to upgrade their equipment once said technologies are ready for the market.<br><br>There also (Like Real Engineering mentions) must be Anti-Monopoly laws, for construction and operation of Nuclear plants. Or perhaps something that would require the state to own 51% of the market share of every Nuclear Power Plant?<br><br>I may not know everything about Nuclear, but i understand it damn well. And therefore I DO NOT fear it. And the media like HBO&#39;s Chernobyl (Which outright completely lies about a 3-4 Megaton &quot;Thermo-nuclear&quot; explosion, because molten uranium, concrete, iron, zirconium, steel etc. contacts with water? What? A nuke needs ~85% concentration of U-235 to actually become a nuke, once you try to blow up the U-235 core with conventional explosives, and Chernobyl somehow, being a Low-Enriched Uranium (~1,8% U-235) reactor, is supposed to blow up on contact with some sewer water? Oh lord...).<br><br>These lies need to stop. The real disasters are not &quot;NUCLEAR APOCALYPSES&quot;, but just stupid mistakes, by negligent people. Here are some of the actual mistakes made in some other disasters then Chernobyl (I have ranted enough xD) that I remember:<br><br>Design deviations and lack of investigations for nuclear incidents:<br>1. Politicians are not interested in funding f. ex. research into what was this secondary explosion at Chernobyl, because it will not get them re-elected. Also, at the same time, the punishments for breaching approved Nuclear Power Plant designs are not clear.<br>2. Fukushima:<br>2.1 - The company responsible, used two different types of concrete in the Reactor Containment Structure, resulting in the molten core breaching containment, which was supposed to be the last line of defence.<br>2.2 - Steam-turbine shaft seal (that is supposed to keep the radioactive steam INSIDE the turbine) was not designed to spec, and resulted in this radioactive steam venting into the structure, because of very high steam pressure (not enough cooling), preventing plant workers from accessing the air-tanks for the pressure relief valve (explained below, under &quot;safety negligence&quot;), because of high radiation levels in the reactor building.<br>2.3 - And the diesel generators??? Placed BELOW sea level??? In a tsunami/flooding zone??? What???<br><br><br>Safety negligence charges:<br>1. Like in case of Three-Mile Island, where controllers did not have enough education and knowledge about the control-systems of the cooling water loops.<br>2. Fukushima, where the air-tanks for the valve responsible for core-venting were EMPTY at the time of disaster! This system is supposed to prevent a steam explosion, in case of steam over-pressure in the reactor and containment vessel, by venting the radioactive steam into the atmosphere. (This could easily be improved by constructing emergency steam-containment tanks, instead of venting this crap into the atmosphere, f.ex.)<br>3. Don&#39;t even get me started on Chernobyl. The whole place was a design and safety negligence disaster. BUT, unfortunately there are more mis-informative articles, dramas and documentaries out there then what actually happened. And it all is blamed on &quot;It was the Soviet Union&#39;s fault, it would never have happened in the West!&quot;, instead of a calm, scientific approach, explaining what are the differences between the RBMK and PWR (Pressurised Water Reactors) mostly used in the West at the time.<br><br><br>Nuclear has been and still is, to some extent a game of &quot;Ping-Pong Nuclear Politics&quot;. Pointing fingers, and accusing but not actually calmly fixing the issues, and presenting evidence in a scientific manner. I am STILL to witness this change.<br><br>Nuclear is a technology, with the potential to save us all, but it will never help us, if it is treated like a game. Man up. Take the blame. Fix the issue. Share your results. Now THAT is what I wish nuclear industry to be. A collective industry, focused on improvement. There is so much potential for nuclear left behind in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, because of the nuclear fear. It is time humanity shuts it&#39;s mouth, and digs it&#39;s nose into the books.

How much more energy do we need? Why? Are we sure the world absolutely <b>needs</b> all that new energy? For example, no-one has addressed the fact that, under current economic systems, most poor households cannot even afford the terms and conditions in green subsidies to remodel their housing, so they end up paying more in energy bills, being drained of more money, getting further away from ever affording green housing. Even newly-built, environmentally-friendly housing is inaccessible to people who need it the most. No-one is addressing the fact that competing companies waste energy producing the same products that end up unsold and thrown away, no-one is addressing the fact that cryptocurrencies eat up an entire nation&#39;s worth of energy to mine coin no-one can use. No-one is addressing that, while the world population projection is expected to plateau, the energy consumption projection isn&#39;t following along. Someone or something is disproportionately demanding and wasting energy. <i>Do we need to spend that much energy as a species?</i> Do Las Vegas and LA need all those lights? If we&#39;re willing to take the risk and go nuclear, shouldn&#39;t that mean that big, consolidated energy spenders are also willing to take the risk and tone down their |energy consumption|? I don&#39;t have an answer, because no-one is addressing and quantifying those issues in a concise and consistent way, everyone says &quot;oh it&#39;s taken for granted that we need more energy, let&#39;s do X&quot;.<br><br>4) Yes, I am <b>very</b> afraid of the prospect of nuclear waste being deposited left and right because some genius in the near future may have the bright idea of privatizing nuclear burial grounds, while none of those previous concerns are addressed.

Granted the industry is very concerned with safety and rightly so, but there are other practical considerations beyond safety and I&#39;m not talking economics. The safety record so far has come at the cost of painstaking precautions, continuous improvements, deaths due to public evacuations, and good luck. Let&#39;s hope we don&#39;t need more of that. <br><br>But if solving climate change is the goal, can we really afford to lock up tons upon tons of materials and land in perpetuity for the sake of a relatively short time of productive heat production? Stop counting just the waste from nuclear fuel! Consider the Fe Mo Li Co and Cu that go into modular reactors, pipes, dry cask storage containers, molten salts and cooling equipment. Consider the concrete. Think of the land for underground facilities dedicated to &quot;cooling&quot; modules for decades until the shorterlived nucleotides have reached safer levels to allow further handling. All the infrastructure necessary to carry out the transition the industry envisions from factory construction to transport mechanisms (public highways adapted to accommodate heavy reactor module transfers) to nuclear-adapted industrial sites to recycling plants (if approved) to long term storage of whatever is deemed unrecyclable. There&#39;s already far more spent fuel than can be practically reprocessed into U enriched FLiBe salts any time soon, and meanwhile the resources needed to keep everything safe are tied up indefinitely. So we can&#39;t recycle for now, and that means more mining. None of that mining and construction and maintenance is carbon-free. That&#39;s why fossil fuel companies love nuclear. Not only do fossil fuel companies supply graphite for modulators in traditional reactors, but they are primed to implement modular reactors to get the heat they need to facilitate bitumen extraction.

In 2014 they started having cave ins and explosions and plutonium made it all the way to the surface half a mile above (I think its half a mile down) despite an extensive baffling system in the air circulation system.  The problem is that since the 1940&#39;s the &quot;safe&quot; place determined for waste disposal was a stable salt dome but salt is the most corrosive rock known so it corrodes metal containers.

As nuclear fuel and technologies become globally available, the risk of these falling into the wrong hands is increasingly present. To avoid weapons proliferation, it is important that countries with high levels of corruption and instability be discouraged from creating nuclear programs, and the US should be a leader in nonproliferation by not pushing for more nuclear power at home.<br>* National security.  Nuclear power plants are a potential target for terrorist operations. An attack could cause major explosions, putting population centers at risk, as well as ejecting dangerous radioactive material into the atmosphere and surrounding region. Nuclear research facilities, uranium enrichment plants, and uranium mines are also potentially at risk for attacks that could cause widespread contamination with radioactive material <br>* Accidents: In addition to the risks posed by terrorist attacks, human error and natural disasters can lead to dangerous and costly accidents. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine led to the deaths of 30 employees in the initial explosion and has had a variety of negative health effects on thousands across Russia and Eastern Europe. A massive tsunami bypassed the safety mechanisms of several power plants in 2011, causing three nuclear meltdowns at a power plant in Fukushima, Japan, resulting in the release of radioactive materials into the surrounding area. In both disasters, hundreds of thousands were relocated, millions of dollars spent, and the radiation-related deaths are being evaluated to this day. Cancer rates among populations living in proximity to Chernobyl and Fukushima, especially among children, rose significantly in the years after the accidents <br>* Cancer: In addition to the significant risk of cancer associated with fallout from nuclear disasters, studies also show an increased risk for those who reside near a nuclear power plant, especially for childhood cancers such as leukemia. Workers in the nuclear industry are also exposed to higher than normal levels of radiation, and as a result, are at a higher risk of death from cancer<br>* The 444 nuclear power plants currently in existence provide about 11% of the world\u2019s energy. Studies show that in order to meet current and future energy needs, the nuclear sector would have to scale up to around 14,500 plants. Uranium, the fuel for nuclear reactors, is energy-intensive to mine, and deposits discovered in the future are likely to be harder to get achieve. As a result, much of the net energy created would be offset by the energy input required to build and decommission plants and to mine and process uranium ore. The same is true for any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions brought about by switching from coal to nuclear <br>* Cost: Unlike renewables, which are now the cheapest energy sources, nuclear costs are on the rise, and many plants are being shut down or in danger of being shut down for economic reasons. Initial capital costs, fuel, and maintenance costs are much higher for nuclear plants than wind and solar, and nuclear projects tend to suffer cost overruns and construction delays. The price of renewable energy has fallen significantly over the past decade, and it projected to continue to fall<br>* Energy dependence of poorer nations (most of the world): Investment in nuclear plants, security, mining infrastructure, etc. draws funding away from investment in cleaner sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. Financing for renewable energy is already scarce, and increasing nuclear capacity will only add to the competition for funding.", "comment_date": "2021-04-26T07:30:22Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Human Seeks Justice", "comment_text": "A major environmental concern related to nuclear power is the creation of radioactive wastes such as uranium mill tailings, spent (used) reactor fuel, and other radioactive wastes.

They need to be mined from somewhere, and it just so happens that Australia is one of those countries, and our country&#39;s mining industry is as toxic as radioactive waste. One of our national parks (Kakadu National Park) is next to a uranium mine, which is famously badly managed and had a radioactive spill, which isn&#39;t an isolated incident. The water at the national park was contaminated  by the uranium mine, water which was consumed not only by plants and animals, but by indigenous locals. With over 200 documented spills in the past 40 years for just one mine, radioactive mine management is quite literally life threatening. A Radium mine called &quot;Radium Hill&quot; still contains hundreds of thousands of metric tonnes of radioactive waste, making the area uninhabitable. Mining for radioactive materials disproportionately affects the indigenous population of Australia who inhabit many of the areas which are eventually torn up by the mining industry. Now I am also aware that mining is commonplace for battery technology, but at least unlike radioactive materials, you can conduct further research into batteries until we come up with a more compact, less mineral reliant alternative. <br><br>The one thing I don&#39;t want Americans doing, because you&#39;re all really good at this, is ignore where all your nice things come from to justify the choices that improve your lives.

Much like the scrutiny electric cars get for the amount of emissions produced by mining for battery materials, the same is true for uranium and radium mines.

Everyone would benefit both from the power and health benefits.<br>BUT....<br>I don&#39;t want to be a killjoy here, but the issue of nuclear WASTE is the MAIN DANGER with these power plants.  Most of us have heard of Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, where all the nuclear waste was SUPPOSED to be stored for the long term.  The issue is, that it isn&#39;t being used for that due to the major push back from the residents of Nevada.  So the 56 nuclear plants plus the decommissioned ones are storing their spent fuel rods, on-site.   <br> - This poses some security issues, which was brought to light after 9/11 - what would happen if the terrorists targeted a nuclear power plant in the hopes of spreading around radiation?  They wouldn&#39;t need to buy radioactive material for a dirty bomb, they just crash a plane into a power plant.  A quick look at a map of where these power plants are should raise the hackles on your neck.   Anywhere downwind would be in big trouble.<br>So what needs to be addressed is a Federal decision to have a central location for the long-term storage (and security) of this material where it will be safe and protected.

Both, oftentimes, end up in traditionally underrepresented communities, most especially indigenous  communities (particularly the Navajo), who usually have the strongest opposition to this technology for this very reason.

If we can get the storage truly air-tight (both in the literal and metaphorical sense that nothing can escape), and we can find places sufficiently far enough away from population centers (including small ones, like the indigenous ones mentioned), this can be overcome.  Reprocessing could be an option too, but I&#39;m not sure it makes much economic sense.

In the case of Chernobyl&#39;s RBMK-1000 it is the following problems:<br>1. During the design period of the reactor-type in use at Chernobyl, there was a cold war race for the first large scale nuclear power plant. This led to the reactor-types RBMK-1000 (eg. Chernobyl) as the soviet contribution and the BWR-3 (eg. Fukushima Daiichi) as the american one. This political pressure led to a &quot;be first at any costs&quot;-mindset.<br>2. In the RBMK-1000 design this led to a system that has an anti-proportional correlation of coolant level and power output and a mitigation of this by an anti-proportional relation between fuel temperature and power output.<br>3. This design led to two things: A need to raise the power very slowly to keep the reactor stable and a minimum power output below which the reactor&#39;s power output behaves rather erratic.<br>4. During the well known test at the Chernobyl reactor, it did run into a conflict between both conditions to safe operation named in 3.. This problem occured in the third iteration of the experiment at the latvian Ignalina plant.<br>5. At Ignalina, the 3rd experiment uncovered a hidden design flaw: The control rods, who did consist of a neutron absorber and a moderator (incorrectly referred to as &quot;graphite tips&quot;) stacked in a way that meant removing the neutron absorber pulls in the moderator instead, were designed to have the functional parts shorter than the reactor core. This leads to the very dangerous fact, that the lowest part of the reactor has the neutron absorber water in it which gets replaced with the moderator of the control rod as the reactor is shut down, increasing the reactor core&#39;s bottom power output in the process of shutting it down. This was kept secret because of the race 1. and an improvement was designed, but not introduced to the reactors, as it would not be easily concealable.<br>6.  In case of Chernobyl-4 this led to an attempt to choose the violation of 3. that was percieved as being the safer one to choose out of both to keep the reactor stable. Surprisingly, that went terribly wrong.<br>7. To worsen the outcome, the soviets took several shortcuts to get a cheaper, more easily buildable reactor: For fuel channel failure tolerance was assumed that never could there be a rupture of more than one of the approx. 2000 channels at once and as this was a politically declared flawless marvel of soviet engineering, it was impossible that there could be an accident, so no countermeasures against one have to be comissioned.", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T23:15:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Pixlblade", "comment_text": "IT IS SAFE UNTIL IT IS NOT", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T21:00:55Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Zamokuhle Molefe", "comment_text": "I was super skeptical about nuclear energy but you two have persuaded me", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T20:56:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcus Roberto", "comment_text": "Thanks for using the correct &quot;football&quot; field for the graphics. \ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T20:32:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Eirsa van Flur", "comment_text": "Just learned about this in class and I\u2019m so confused on why we aren\u2019t making more nuclear plants", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T19:06:52Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "John Assheton", "comment_text": "Good video, but I&#39;m thinking your have not gone far enough to explain why ALL previous information about the dangers of nuclear are actually fears (not dangers!).

Hanford is divided into four National Priorities List (NPL) sites. These areas are part of a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) complex that includes buildings, disposal sites, the Hanford Reach National Monument, and vacant land. One of the NPL sites, the Hanford 1100 Area (190 square miles), has been deleted from the NPL.  A partial deletion was completed for the Hanford 100 Area NPL, removing an additional 140 square miles.\r<br>\r<br><br>Why this site is being featured\r<br>The Hanford Site is adjacent to the Columbia River which is the lifeblood of the Pacific Northwest. DOE\u2019s annual cleanup budget of more than $2 billion a year drives much of the economy of the Tri-Cities area of Washington State.

The most important aspect of TMI was probably the lack of any preparedness, and the poor training that the operators had received. The two major changes that came from this both significantly enhanced the emergency preparedness of sites and the local communities, as well as providing a standardised approach to training that was nationally monitored. INPO was set up in the USA and ensured a standard approach and regular assessments of training programmes. Following Chernobyl it became clear that what INPO was doing in the US needed to become worldwide, as any event had worldwide consequences. WANO was set up to mirror, across all nuclear sites, what INPO had originally started in the US. Every nuclear power station is now inspected every 5 years by an international team of experts, usually spending 3 weeks looking at a wide range of issues such as operations, maintenance, management oversight, health physics, training etc. A report is presented that covers all areas for improvement, and also any particular strengths, which are then shared with other sites to ensure they all match the best. Learning from others is a key factor in this process, driving out poor standards and ensuring high standards everywhere. I was fortunate to visit Chernobyl in 2006 on its 20th anniversary. I spent the day on site around the control room, turbine hall, external buildings, the old sarcophagus and several hours in Pripyat (the local town). My total radiation dose for the whole day was marginally less than what I got on the flight from London to Kiev. Yes radiation can be dangerous in large quantities, and its not easy to see - needing special instrumentation. But the industry understands it very well, and it is well managed. Radiation in the form of alpha particlaes and beta rays is very easily contained with very small amounts of shielding. Gamma rays may need thicker concrete of lead containers. People tend to forget that the ground from which uranium is dug is already radioactive. Yes, radioactive waste will generate radiation for many millions of years, but after about 100 years (I know its still a lot of years) it&#39;ll be back down to what it was when it was dug up. In the UK, our liquid discharge levels are such that we couldn&#39;t discharge mineral water as its too radioactive. The same applies to coffee grounds as they become low level radioactive waste. They&#39;re only managed on site as the canteen is outside the radiation controlled area. As another aside, Indian Point in New York wanted to build a coal fired station next to their two nuclear stations. They were stopped from doing so by the US nuclear regulator who stated that it wouldn&#39;t be allowed as the radation emitted from the coal fired power station chimneys would swamp the sensitive measuring equipment used to monitor the nuclear stations.", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T17:48:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vera Choi", "comment_text": "i&#39;m sending this to my mom", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T17:37:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luciano Duarte", "comment_text": "Would you mind if I send you the Spanish subtitles for this video in order for you to add them?

We get rid of fossil fuels no argument.   But new nuclear is not quite as perfect as you portray.  It&#39;s safe , but here in the UK our new reactors don&#39;t burythe waste underground in concrete, it&#39;s actually just stored above ground in casks until a final resting place is found, which we don&#39;t believe will be before 2150 at the earliest by which time the coast of this country may look rather different with these facilities being Islands by then.   The cost is prohibitive, it costs around twice as much as building wind farms for example and the cost of the power is much higher. Nuclear costs are going up rather than down which other renewables are. They take over a decade to build, and what the industry don&#39;t like to admit it&#39;s that during construction they are huge emitters of CO2 and the decommissioning of them is also very CO2 hungry in a way that no other renewable energy will be, 9 million tonnes is the latest estimate for what gets emitted during construction alone.  No country in Western Europe is building them other than the UK because they are totally uncommercial now and unless the taxpayer funds them, they don&#39;t get built,.  Renewables back here are totally privately funded and not burdening the taxpayer at these times.    I don&#39;t think Japan would have predicted that ten years later 160,000 people spotted still be displaced by their accident nor that the waters they had to use to cool the reactors which is showing radiation levels higher than they expected will  need to be poured into the sea.   Btw the cooling of the reactors kills half a million fish every day.    For me the benefits of this amount of energy which is going to run out of uranium to use in approx years and the fact that we are leaving the waste for our grandchildren to sort out means that I&#39;d prefer to see the future with increased renewables and storage improved to cope. The scale of nuclear is achievable with renewables, we are currently building the biggest wind farm in the world in the North sea, which by 2026 will produce 3.6gw of power, as much as one of the new reactors being built here. Of course tidal power has been vastly under researched.   The tides would provide base load always on power with no issues and no down time - nuclear is not flexible,it  is either on or off and can&#39;t be tweaked to balance the grid. Yet our ones need refueling every 18 months which takes weeks to do. Where does the power come from then?    One correction to your stats, France have announced that they are reducing their reliance on nuclear to 50% from 75% with a view to decreasing it much further.<br>This argument is so much more than safety.

Of course the reason for the hideous cost of reactors is largely the safety systems that must be implemented. The fact that countries like China are now building many of these reactors should be a significant concern, given their safety record elsewhere. Fusion is the great hope of the future (though even that isn&#39;t 100% waste free), but we still don&#39;t have viable commercial fusion reactors, despite many years of development work. In my view, renewables plus grid level storage (in all it&#39;s forms) is the best bet for the short to medium term with (hopefully) distributed fusion generation sharing some of the load one day. The UK, by the way, is perfectly able to import energy from Europe (undersea cables) and therefore, when it&#39;s not obsessed with being &#39;Little Britain&#39;, can and does make significant use of renewable energy. As an island,  there are also significant opportunities for offshore wind (and perhaps wave power someday). As an engineer, I do have to take issue with statements like (and I&#39;m paraphrasing) &#39; .. cannot fail..&#39;. There is not a single engineer worth the paper on which their degree is written that would guarantee a system cannot fail in some way. There are always unanticipated failure mechanisms.

In southern Ohio, the former site of the Fernald Feed Materials Production Site (a uranium processing plant) was converted into a massive nature reserve consisting of forests, wetlands, and prairies. The site was heavily contaminated (think &#39;polluting the water source and finding rotting barrels full of radioactive materials&#39; levels of contamination), which ensued a massive cleanup effort. There are only two of the original buildings still standing, and there is a massive mound on the horizon. That mound actually contains 3 million cubic yards of low-level waste from the cleanup site - if you go into the visitor center, you&#39;ll see that, via a photo diagram of the mound&#39;s cross-section, most of the mound is highly engineered to contain and monitor potential leaks. None of the wildlife has been affected to my knowledge (there&#39;s even been sightings of difficult to find birds like the Northern Harrier and Rough-legged Hawk), and my family and I have had no ill effects from visiting the site, so I&#39;d say as long as the materials are properly stored and monitored, they really pose no risk to anyone.

There were many errors in your presentation, from the number of people who have died from nuclear accidents and the normal operation of nuclear power plants - including the mining of uranium, its milling and manufacturing, its operation in a nuclear power plant, and its temporary storage on site in dry casks - something you may want to take into account if you are going to compare deaths due to the use of coal, for example.  <br><br>You assert that long-lived nuclear waste is being stored in casks underground.  Nowhere in the world is this true, though there are several projects to do what you describe and my hope is that deep geological repositories will some day work.  The problem is that these wastes are more deadly than anything that exists in the world.  If you stood next to &quot;spent&quot; nuclear fuel rods unshielded for even a few minutes dozens of years after it has been taken from the reactor core you would receive a lethal dose of radiation - that is why they have to be handled so carefully and stored away from people.  &quot;Recycling&quot; the waste leaves reprocessing by-products that are both radioactive and chemically toxic.  You can google the tank waste at the Hanford nuclear reservation to learn that taking the plutonium out of spent fuel and reusing it - in that case, for bombs - did not make the waste go away.  <br><br>Regarding the theoretically safe and economic small modular reactors, understand that these are on the drawing boards and not built in real life.  I suggest you google the father of nuclear power, Admiral Hyman Rickover&#39;s short paper, originally written in 1951 &quot;paper reactors v. real reactors.&quot;  You may also wish to read Dr. M.V. Ramana&#39;s short paper on the NuScale reactor from last September - <a href=\"https://www.oregonpsr.org/report-uamps-nuscale-smrs\">https://www.oregonpsr.org/report-uamps-nuscale-smrs</a> .

In fact Germany is shutting down the nuclear plants and opening of more coal power plants which is increasing air pollution and carbon emissions.<br>12.Therefore because of the abundance of thorium and immense amount of efficiency of thorium and how less carbon emissions and other greenhouse gas emissions it produces I believe that thorium will be the future for solving the problem of climate change as well as getting rid of fossil fuels and act as a viable sustainable and stable source of clean energy.", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T05:22:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Astronaut Biker", "comment_text": "Am I scared?

I think we need more plants to help phase out fossil fuels but the biggest struggle has always been the cost and then the taxpayers learn of it and don\u2019t understand so their support isn\u2019t there which hurts the production. The building of a plant eventually pays for itself though with how much power it can supply. The states shouldn\u2019t have to pay that\u2019s why the funding falls short because states do not have the extra money to build them. The federal government needs to help complete the plants that were already started and build some more ones. It makes sense people might think the federal government building these is an overreach but the government local to federal already monopolizes the power industry this is just another form of power and privatizing it might be possible but likely will make it even harder to build because of the cost and it would still have to live up to government guidelines. The fact that there are so many other alternate cost effective routes also need to be explored and expressed widely. Also I think it is also important to know about the operation of these plants as they undergo specific inspections and other routines to prevent human errors and meltdowns.

Now go back to work and get the facts about the cost[s] associated with commercial nuclear power and you will find the real reason that commercial nuclear power is practically finished in the United States.    After digging the cost stuff up;   perhaps you will realize that  a campaign based on a tissue of lies was never needed.   From coast to coast nuclear plants domestically  priced themselves out of the commercial power marketplace in an astoundingly short period of time.   This is due to many factor such as increases in thermal efficiency in other thermal power sources currently powered by natural gas and the relatively unexpected surge in alternate &amp; renewable power sources which are now contributing to over half the peaking energy in large systems.    When you are adding up the costs for your next presentation where you will  present more facts and perhaps less conspiracy mongering and salesmanship;  be sure to take into account nuclear contingent liability and consequential damages for reactor &amp; equipment suppliers who now share a belief that they are liable only up to the value of their contracts for the original equipment.   Original equipment which could easily be the cause of and consequence of property damage on a large scale.   This is one those bothersome details that equipment manufacturers are lithe to discuss which,  after sixty five years of commercial production has never been worked out.   We advise young students wanting to go into nuclear energy to 1)  Try a career path in the aerospace industry where nuclear engines have been proven or  2)  Move into a construction engineering field that involves large plant demolition since that is where most of the work will be in commercial nuclear power in the United States to 2050.   Nuclear power for commercial use had its day but frankly needed heroic sponsorship the likes of NASA in order to pull the whole thing together like they did over at Electricitie de France.    The self-promotional then Atomic Energy Commission stood center state for many years before they were broken up with the pieces going to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy Department of the United States;  but due to this and other reorganizations was never able to take a leadership role in standardization of design and segregation of mission[s] like the larger NASA did back in the late 1950&#39;s.

It just goes to show how damaging the media can be. Yes, nuclear power plants are expensive, but they also produce huge amounts of energy. Considering the effects of burning fossil fuels and the climate crisis, which are too many effects to name, I think this is the way forward. Of course, the best option would be to use renewables, but not all countries have the correct climate; here in the UK, the climate is, put in three words, wet, miserable, and grey. And of course, many countries can&#39;t even afford to produce enough energy from fossil fuels, so I think other, richer countries&#39; willingness to provide money and support is integral. Moreover, we need more great videos like these to debunk these damaging myths and lies so often portrayed by the media, and believed by too many. However, I undertand that there are other negatives, which I feel you could have maybe mentioned in the video - safe and responsible disposal of radioactive waste is expensive, and it can be damaging to marine life, and of course mining the uranium in the first place is environmentally detrimental.

You can just present the information and let people decide.  I say this because there are a lot cons that are left out of the infomercial.  There are many, presentation-style videos from Ph.D&#39;s in nuclear energy doing just that here in YouTube, and they spend a little over an hour talking about the topic.<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHPp458m1cs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHPp458m1cs</a><br><br>The future is not the present:  Yes, modular reactor would be cool, yes pebble reactors are cool, and nuclear plants that can reused spent fuel are also cool.  However,  I have not read any of these are production ready.  They are all being tested right now.  The nuclear reactors coming online around the world are the old fashion ones with the Uranium rods<br><br>The current reactors cost billions to create and the are UNINSURABLE.  That means insurance companies know they will lose money if they accept free payments for a few decades and then there is a meltdown.  Think of it this way,  a male teenager with a car accident is also uninsurable because the insurance companies worked out the math and figure the likelihood he will be in another crash is so great they cannot make a profit.  Likewise,  the likelihood of a meltdown times the cost ( the risk ) is so great that they cannot be insured.    So nuclear can only exist if you, the tax payer,  foot the bill.  When there is no meltdown, some onepercenter makes in millions in bonuses,  when there is a meltdown you have to pay (money and probably leave your town for good ) <br><br>History:  you downplayed the past disasters greatly.  First, Chernobyl is not something that happened in the 80&#39;s.  It is something that is happening right now.  You are not advised to go to that site, and the EU spends billions of dollars per decade just to contain the disaster for millennia.  The new dome was just finished which is probably why the mini-series came out, since the accident bubble up again to public consciousness.   <br><br>Likewise,  the Fukushima disaster will be ongoing for decades to come.  It is easy to find the Japan&#39;s energy companies road-map to recovery and  the plan goes on for decades ( <a href=\"https://www.tepco.co.jp/en/hd/decommission/project/roadmap/index-e.html\">https://www.tepco.co.jp/en/hd/decommission/project/roadmap/index-e.html</a> ).  That is engineer time wasted,  public officials time been diverted to the disaster for decades.  And also,  a lot of these mitigation plans need trucks and concrete, all of which add to the carbon footprint. So, not only Fukuyama does not reduced carbon,  it uses more carbon,  and produces no energy. <br><br>There is a nuclear waste storage facility in Germany.  They are in the process to relocate the nuclear waste because they discover there was a critical flaw in the plan so ground water could get to the nuclear waste, and over time it will poison the ground water.  This will also take decades to be resolved.  Similarly, decommissioning a nuclear plant is not trivial and it also takes decades to complete.  <br><br>Yucca Mountain:  billions were spent to store nuclear waste here.  But now the engineers are not sure the storage facility is a proper place to store the storage and the residents of the area don&#39;t want to get the wasted stored in there now either. <br><br>What then ? <br><br>I think we should do Renewable plus storage.  If you do the math, you can see that solar and wind are already on track to cover more than 100% of energy needs at their current rate of growth.  And they are already cheaper to manufacture and installed than any other form of electricity.  Storage is just starting to come online.  lithium will not be enough but we have liquid metal batteries that will provide scalable, industrial level storage.  And we also have green hydrogen coming on board.  It is very inefficient to produce hydrogen, but its storage efficiency is about the same as pumped hydro but it is easier to move those electrons to where they are needed. <br><br>Other items worth mentioning are better building codes, and right to repair laws. <br>Passive Housing can reduce the energy use to heat and cool a house by 90% ! <br>And right-to-repair can reduce waste created by plan obsolescence business models, which reduces needs for more steel and plastic, which reduces carbon output.  <br><br>How to do nuclear safely <br>All the research into new nuclear reactors is good.  thorium reactors, pebble reactors,  modular reactors are all good.  But, society should require that any of those ideas undergo a 10 to 20 year trial period.  Why so long ? Because, on paper, they always are designed to be impossible to melt down; but, when we get it wrong, we pay the consequences for millennia.  Therefore spending a few decades is reasonable given the scale of the consequences.   One recent idea I had is to use these prototype reactors to create hydrogen for the upcoming hydrogen economy.  This is ideal because the prototype reactors can be placed 100 miles away from the population.  Although that does not resolve the fact that the reactors need to be close to a fresh water supply  <br><br>Conclusion<br>I think safe nuclear is a few decades away.  It cannot be part of the solution for Climate Change because even when ready, it will take a few more decades to propagate.  It just won&#39;t be ready in time.  Instead, we focus on a carbon tax, renewable + storage, and hydrogen economy.  Nuclear is a distraction right now.  We should cut our loses on that technology and move these project back to the lab until they are truly ready.", "comment_date": "2021-03-27T16:03:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "\u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2", "comment_text": "I would like you to talk about also about the way we get uranium.

Therefore besides the increase of reprocessing techniques for nuclear waste will also increase. Now this increase has 2 sides, the first being that nuclear energy/waste becomes more sustainable, besides being environment friendly, which is obviously good. However the second result of increasing reprocessing techniques is that this allows for more waste to be reprocessed into nuclear weapons. Take for example the recent 40% increase of nuclear weapons in the UK where they have several reprocessing sites.

As others said, you failed to discuss how long the half-life is or where the waste is actually stored (if it gets moved out from storage from the energy producing cities) - and there seemed to be an implication of monitored concrete containers. I can&#39;t think of a single public entity with accountability that has been monitoring dangerous materials since the dawn of the Roman Empire, and it is naive to think that out less than 300 year old government that is already reaching authoritarian and economic crises will be around for the tens of thousands of years needed to monitor waste. (I seem to remember something about bioengineering cats that glow in the presence of harmful radiation and creating myths so that post-industrial societies will know to avoid the lands if we ever do designate nuclear waste dumps).<br><br>Not covered by the video? Nuclear energy is still dependent on fossil fuels to get it. The ores to create the feedstock are not going to mine themselves, and there are no nuclear mining excavators that I know of as of yet (and the amount of battery power needed for such things would be impractical - and if you look at battery production pollution you&#39;ll see there are plenty of areas in the US where harmful chemical have leeched into the ground water and made areas not fit for humans, so electric vehicles and their constant battery production will have some issues too).  Then there is the question of who gets to use nuclear energy - the US seems very uncomfortable for this solution used with Iran and other &quot;hostile&quot; powers. Finally, no one is discussing the finite nature of the fuel - if the whole world (yes, including Iran) suddenly uses nuclear power exclusively in 20 years, how much global fuel is available for the planet?  This isn&#39;t as limitless as a combination of wind, solar, and tidal energy production.<br><br>You may call my fears irrational, but they are not. How do you store the waste safely over the lifespan of its decay matters - this is a waste product that has a lifespan far longer than humans can rationally comprehend (and discussions about natural causes don&#39;t address human tampering with sites, which in 2000 years curious humans will do)? Who gets the solution? What is the cost of getting and transporting the fuel, and what fuels getting a fuel supply line? How long will that fuel supply last when everyone is clamoring for it?<br><br>I get it, fossil fuels are probably a worse solution.  We&#39;ve delayed and put leaders in power who have done nothing for the last 50 years, the critical time to avert a fossil fuel disaster on this planet.  Now the old rich are dying off and the younger rich are realizing they might not have as nice of a future to enjoy their wealth in, so they are going to start caring (unless your Elon Musk or the like, who look to other worlds as the solution - why fix when you can create a utopia somewhere else and dump on it). Nuclear might be a stop-gap for some in a limited area, but we need to really push for renewables and a global grid.... but humanity&#39;s tribalism will prevent that.<br><br>Oh, one last concern - targetability. Centralization is great for regulation and cost effectiveness, but it is also great for acts of terrorism and warfare. What happens when a hostile force intentionally causes a disaster? The more centralized, the juicier the target to our fiercely tribal society.  Imagine a USA where on 9/11 they flew planes into a few key reactors, causing a meltdown while taking out huge power supplies (and probably causing a large blackout on the grid) instead of striking some buildings? Can&#39;t do that with distributed renewable systems.<br><br>Nuclear might be a solution in some parts of the world for some time - but refusing to acknowledge the legitimate concerns of those opposed to it and saying we are &quot;fearmongers&quot; is the same tactic of climate change deniers... many of us have reasons why we say it isn&#39;t a solution. We&#39;ll accept it as part of the plan if it is well thought out - but our experience with fossil fuels means we&#39;ll be trading one non-renewable with environmental consequences for another... passing the buck to another future generation while going &quot;oh, nuclear power fixed everything for us.&quot; More than my concerns about nuclear power being addressed, I think the human factor of maliciousness and laziness (passing the buck to the future generation as long as you don&#39;t get hampered by the consequences) is even more of an issue with nuclear power.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;d say this is a good start to a discussion - but is it a discussion or just a lecture on why we are &quot;fearmongers&quot; because we disagree.

So for nuclear to really take off we need to figure out how to safetly produce nuclear energy at about 1/2 the price  that we are now. <br><br>Hopefully with fewer people afraid of nuclear we can encourage more research on cheap and safe nuclear energy.<br><br>Pulled these numbers out of an textbook, looks like the data is from 2016", "comment_date": "2021-03-26T03:55:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arijit Dey", "comment_text": "If you want a nuclear energy, and a fusion reactor just look up in the sky", "comment_date": "2021-03-26T03:52:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arijit Dey", "comment_text": "Totally disagree, your body can adapt but not a fetus, in world .

I really appreciate the positive video on nuclear power, however I wanted to mention a couple of discrepancies in your video. The main one being about nuclear waste storage. The original plan in the 90&#39;s was to build Yucca Mountain in the middle of no where Nevada to store the US waste as you mentioned. However, due to politics the site was never commissioned (despite being pretty much built and ready to go). So instead, most power plants across the US use dry cask storage on site (above ground) or maintain the fuel in spent fuel pools in the plant. This storage has been proven to be safe and no major problems or issues have occurred,  but this is far from ideal.  Politics really get in the way of nuclear power innovation in the United States, as reflected by advancements in France.<br><br>Also, Chernobyl was a terrible disaster that literally can never occur in the United States due to how our plants are built and our government regulations, however this video really downplayed the disaster in a way that is disrespectful. The fallout affected many people across much of Europe. Yes, there are only 51 confirmed documented deaths, but that was in the 80&#39;s in Soviet Russia and there are complications to that number. For instance, we know Russia tried to hide a lot of information. Some estimates are in the thousands.<br><br>It is better to discuss the Three Mile Island accident, as it is more similar to what could happen in the US today. As you mentioned, there were no deaths or major injuries. This is because the design of the plant allowed the meltdown to be contained and much better reflects our capabilities today. This is what people should focus on. <br><br>Hope this helps!<br><br>Edit: Typos.

It\u2019s clear to me that we can innovate the dangers out of the system. But it\u2019s also clear to me that nuclear can also be cost effective. It will create a shift in supply chains but that can\u2019t be avoided because any switch away from fossil fuels will do that. It\u2019s also clear to me that we\u2019re going to need A LOT of energy in the future. Nuclear does have the potential to last us a few thousand years if we powered humanity with it exclusively. And if we last that long, it should be plenty of time to figure out fusion energy or come up with a better way to get power that\u2019s sustainable and renewable. The problem with using only renewable energy is just the shear amount of land it requires. Off shore wind farms might hold the key for a while but at the end of the day, as technology progresses, we\u2019re gonna need more power and at some point, you run out of real estate. Renewables also require batteries or some kind of power storage which takes even more real estate. We also don\u2019t have a real way to recycle batteries that\u2019s adequate. Although to be fair, we\u2019ll find a way to innovate that problem away because of the demand for a solution. But it might become the next energy crisis if we ignore it as long as we\u2019ve ignored the current energy crisis. At the end of the day, nuclear has to be part of the solution. It uses way less land which we can use to grow food sustainably. It\u2019s okay to use renewables, but we need nuclear too and there\u2019s no reason to be upset about using it. We need to be carbon-free in 30 years max. We need all the help we can get. I\u2019m especially excited about modular nuclear reactors. I think that might take care of the safety and cost barrier. It at least makes nuclear accessible. Producing energy with nuclear reactors is profitable, we just need to reduce complexity and reduce upfront investment.

There is a very good comment debunking most of it from one of my fellow Frenchman in the comment section that I encourage you to read if it interests you.<br><br>Now, on the health effects, I&#39;d just add that the death toll you gave for the 3 main nuclear accidents, despite being right, can seem far from other estimates. So I&#39;ll explain why below in anticipation of comments addressing this. The main reason is that we have never been able to detect any statistical health effects for absorbed doses below 100 mSv. (That doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t, that means its is so small we can&#39;t show it using epidemiological studies. Remember the first rule of epidemiology : if you can&#39;t tell an effect from statistical noise, the effect is at most very tiny and negligible). The correlation being linear over that threshold (+5% cancer incidence/100mSv), people often extend that correlation to doses below 100 mSv, without any scientific basis. It is widely accepted that those LNT (Linear No Threshold) models greatly overestimate the adverse effects of low radiation doses, especially when it comes to doses below 30 mSv (so almost everyone). We still use those models to set regulation standards for obvious reasons.<br>Using those on the 700 000 most exposed persons at Tchernobyl, we get 5000 deaths, and 9000 if we add everyone in the world for 75 years after the accident. <br>This figure might be bigger than the 51 whose death could be attributed for sure or with very high confidence to the accident, but 1st, the link between those death and the exposure is really far fetched and questioned by most scientists, 2nd no epidemiological study will ever be able to show that (it&#39;s way way way below statistical significance, I mean, 9000 deaths over the whole world and over 75 years ?!) and 3rd, it still is only 3 times the number of people who die in car crashes every year in France only. So basically nothing.<br>That being said, nuclear accidents&#39; health consequences are more than just exposure to radiation, there are economic and social consequences such as people having to move out (200 000 people at Tchernobyl) that can lead to losing their jobs and income, depressions, segregation (people from contaminated area were feared by others and rejected), lower living standards, alcoholism... etc. But again, it also coincided with the collapse of the Soviet Union so it&#39;s hard to tell exactly what was Tchernobyl&#39;s impact. (Again, the rule is : if you can barely tell an effect from statistical noise, the effect is at most very tiny anyway).<br>In Fukushima, the official death toll due to radiation is 1, the scientific one is 0 (the state recognized the death of one worker as being due to radiations while it&#39;s hard to make the link, scientifically speaking), but the evacuation killed 2200 people (mostly old people that needed medical care that were not moved appropriately). People that wouldn&#39;t have been affected by the radiations anyway since cancers take time to develop. <br>So actually, the fear of nuclear energy leads to rash decisions which then leads to actual death. If fear kills more than the accident, I think there definitely is a problem.<br><br><br><br>Lastly if you read all of it, thanks, don&#39;t hesitate to correct me or ask questions, second, if you are looking for a full course on climate change and energy, I can only advise you to watch the J.M.

That death count is disputed and very likely a gross under-count. The Russian government covered up a lot of the health effects from the Chernobyl disaster. My wife has a politically active friend who lived very nearby in Minsk, who came to the US during high-school because his father was critical of the government (who are known for murdering journalists), and knew people in the area who talked about how the whole town was put into a media blackout for years afterward. And if that death count is even accurate, it&#39;s only as low as it is because they spent enormous amounts of money and other resources building &quot;the sarcophagus&quot;, a giant concrete dome they rolled into place over the plant on train tracks, so that workers wouldn&#39;t have to lay the concrete in the irradiated area (laying train tracks was faster). And that also cracked and had to be repaired. There is a struggling ecosystem in that area today, but notably microbial life sill doesn&#39;t really survive. So while there is vegetation, you wouldn&#39;t want to live in an area where your bodily microbes just died off.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glM80kRWbes&amp;t=3m12s\">3:12</a> This banana example is misleading. The presentation implies that the sources of a person&#39;s radiation dosages are both constant and the same across different types of radiation. a) they change over time and b) not all types of radiation are equally dangerous. <br><br>That&#39;s why we use lead blankets when we&#39;re getting x-rays at the hospital, because x-rays are significantly more dangerous than the background radiation we get from the earth and/or all the electronics we&#39;re always using. It&#39;s also why the Russian government covered up huge amounts of health problems after Chernobyl, and why US courts ruled in favor of the Radium Girls suing their company Radium Dial in 1938 because the mere act of painting watch-faces with a radioactive substance (because it glowed in the dark) was killing them. The Radium Girls case was a sisyphean nightmare getting through the courts despite easily demonstrable evidence their jobs were causing lethal harm. And that&#39;s just a fraction of what it takes to win cases where the harm is more ambiguously linked like the residents of Dish Texas poisoned by fracking companies, or the water poisoning crisis made famous by Erin Brockovich, or the similar water poisoning in Flint MI, or the 9-11 first responders in New York, many of whom died before they were given any medical care for the cancers caused by the WTC debris.<br><br>People get .005% of their radiation from nuclear plants today because there are very few nuclear plants and consequently very few meltdowns or other accidents. If we just start putting nuclear plants everywhere, our percentage of radiation from nuclear plants will increase (more plants, more radiation, more opportunities for accidents). <br><br>Japan had been on track to get all their power from nuclear plants and rapidly changed tracks after the Fukushima meltdown. They realized the accident happened while still following every best practice and safety standard they could, and it still was barely contained and a lot of that &quot;barely&quot; boiled down to being lucky, because there&#39;s no way to prevent the kind of natural disaster that caused the meltdown in the first place. If we start putting nuclear plants everywhere, we&#39;re going to start having more cases of unavoidable natural disasters like tornadoes and hurricanes causing meltdowns that we may or may not be able to contain. <br><br>And that&#39;s before considering the long history of private corporations deliberately doing dangerous bs with our power production, cutting corners to save a buck. Just ask the people who recently froze to death in Texas because ERCOT didn&#39;t require any of the local power companies to winterize any of their power plants. Meanwhile we&#39;ve got leaked documents from energy executives in Texas talking about how absolutely THRILLED they were that people died, because it meant they got to rake in a ton of cash.

Simple : nuclear is a fixed-costs system. As nuclear fuel is incredibly cheap, and yearly maintenance costs important (which you didn&#39;t talk about in your video but I will come back on it later), a nuclear reactor will cost you the same amount of money whether it produces at 25, 50 or 100% of maximum power. So a nuclear operator has all interest in keeping its plant at full capacity. And generally, that&#39;s what happens. In most parts of the world, including USA, nuclear is a small portion of electricity generation, so that consumption is always far higher than nuclear capacity, and so nuclear is running as baseload power. Whereas in France, because nuclear is a huge part of our electricity production, it is running in semi-baseload, which means it adapt itself to follow the average hourly consumption (decreasing power output at night and during week-ends and holidays). <br><br>Then, about the simplified explanation of the plants break-even. Well, it&#39;s not simplified, it&#39;s simplistic. It totally wipes away maintenance costs which are yet very important variables. About 2 &amp; 1/2 cubes for the nuclear costs, and 3/4 of a cube for the gas costs ? <br><br>Then, about the natural gas price. Well, I don&#39;t know where the figures come from, but they are false. From my calculations (yes because the video doesn&#39;t give a proper gas price in $/MWh th or $/MMBtu (a MMBtu is 0.293 MWh)), it assumes a gas price of 30 $/MWh th or 8.8 $/MMBtu, which is absolutely not what we observe today. Even in Europe, the average gas price over the last 5 years has been less than 6 $/MMBtu (currently 1.575 $/MMBtu). In US it&#39;s even worse, with the shale oil/gas boom, the average gas prices over the last 5 years has been less than 3 $/MMBtu (currently 1.83 $/MMBtu).<br>And that&#39;s what makes the difference. Natural gas prices are so low that it is nearly the same cost as nuclear fuel. Thus, gas and nuclear have similar marginal costs. But as natural gas power is far less expensive to maintain, it wins market share. That&#39;s what happens in the US : natural gas prices are so low that even an already paid back nuclear plant can hardly compete, let alone new ones. And that&#39;s why a lot of reactors have been closed in the USA. Gas is so insanely cheap in USA that even coal can&#39;t compete. The major shift from coal and decrease in carbon dioxide emissions in the US is mainly due to natural gas.<br><a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2018.01.22/main.png\">https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2018.01.22/main.png</a><br><a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2018.01.22/chart2.png\">https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2018.01.22/chart2.png</a> <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glM80kRWbes&amp;t=9m39s\">9:39</a> &quot;politicians an investors alike are hesitant to put their money on the line&quot;<br>Yes, especially when they have a bad track record concerning closing perfectly functional plants or even non finished ones...<br>There are many examples : Shoreham, Zwentendorf, Lemoniz, Fessenheim, Diablo Canyon, etc... <br><br>And when that&#39;s not natural gas which leads to the closure, it&#39;s political decisions.<br>You take the example of Diablo Canyon stating that it will be closed due to economic reasons. No, the real reason is political. California decided to phase out of nuclear by 2025, that&#39;s why PG&amp;E decided to withdraw their licence renewal to the NRC. <br>And, seriously, you bought the explanation of the closed cooling system ? For information, a closed cooling system is a cooling tower. There is never a cooling tower when a power plant is on the coast ! That&#39;s totally useless. <br><br>And, come on guy : is the problem the earthquake or the tsunami ?

It is maybe (I haven&#39;t done the calculation myself) true for peak-load and ultra peak-load, but it&#39;s not true for baseload and semi baseload, which will rely for a long time on natural gas. <br><br>And finally, the LCOE explanation should have been more detailed. Because LCOE is a very partial way of calculating the cost of a power plant for 3 main reasons :<br>-Load factor aren&#39;t always at maximum theoretical, especially in a complete system.<br>-It&#39;s totally unable to consider the intermittency of intermittent renewable &quot;the LCOE gives the cost of the electricity produced, but not the cost of that which isn&#39;t&quot;.<br>-It&#39;s not an objective calculation, because long lived, capital expensive electricity sources (nuclear, hydro, geothermal, biomass) are naturally disadvantaged.<br>2nd gen nuclear plants have been designed for 40 years at least, most will run 60 years, some will run 80 years.<br>3rd gen reactors are designed for 60 years at least, which means a lot will still be in use in 2100 !<br>4.3K", "comment_date": "2021-03-25T19:10:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian Bass", "comment_text": "I strongly believe that nuclear energy is the pathway to reducing our carbon emissions.

First of all, the choice is not between carbon fuels and nuclear energy: there are renewable energy sources which are by far the best solution. I\u2019ll agree that leaving the ones already functioning while we shift to renewable energy is ok, but building new ones shouldn\u2019t be: it\u2019s expensive and it takes a lot of time, during which we will still have to rely on carbon fuels and millions of people will die of it, while we could start using renewable energy now, which, btw, is getting cheaper and cheaper everyday. Solar panels for example even need much less maintenance, they have a long life span (not true that they only last a few years) and they do not completely destroy kilometers and kilometers squared around them if they have some malfunctioning. Even turning off a nuclear power plant is extremely complicated and sure, they are safer today, but not 100% safe (would you randomly pick a candy from a bag containing 10, knowing that just 1 of them is actually a bomb that\u2019s going to make your hand explode? I don\u2019t think so). Not to mention the waste, which could be decently stored, but isn\u2019t, especially in the us. Oh and there\u2019s been a lot more nuclear accidents with meltdowns or partial meltdowns than just Chernobyl and Fukushima, these two are just the famous ones.

I understand that there are pros and cons on both sides of the argument. I look at the energy production from the planet&#39;s point of view (as opposed to human perspective that usually is used in these types of discussions i.e. how environmental changes affect us as a species both on health perspective (i.e. cancer development for example) or mental perspective (i.e. we feel bad for extinction of other species due to our actions for example)). <br>I think that it is important to keep in mind that throughout Earth&#39;s lifetime over the past several million years (for which we have not been around by the way) there were literally thousands of species that evolved on this planet. They were born, they existed on the planet for a time and then they went extinct. It is a life cycle of a species (just as we have life cycle of individuals within a species being born, living and then dying so other generations can take their place). So let\u2019s look at these two choices from Earth\u2019s perspective. Fossil energy requires us to extract oil from the planet. That&#39;s like taking blood out of a body. I imagine that the planet needs that oil there for some reason (which we do not necessarily know right now) and us taking it out is just as bad as carelessly taking out someone\u2019s blood. Eventually it&#39;ll show an effect on Earth\u2019s health. Additionally, the by-product of using fossil fuels (as talked about constantly) is the carbon dioxide which is released into the atmosphere resulting in various consequences including warming of the planet etc. The much talked about carbon is something occurs naturally and can be found in and on the planet (admittedly not in the same quantity as what we produce however). <br>Now let&#39;s look at nuclear energy. It requires us using uranium (an element that occurs in very small amounts naturally in or on the planet). It also produces nuclear waste which does not occur in the natural way on or in the planet. Since we don\u2019t know what else to do with it we bury that nuclear waste (no matter how carefully) into the planets core. I know the nuclear proponents talk about the measures of careful storage of that waste but let\u2019s look at it not from human perspective (i.e. it won\u2019t harm us) to the planet\u2019s perspective. Imagine taking that nuclear waste, wrapping it in a \u201csafe\u201d package and implanting it into our own bodies. No matter how great the wrapping it is, eventually that wrapping will degrade (whether it is from the inside out (i.e. degradation occurs from the reaction with the nuclear waste) or from outside (the conditions from outside create for example a pressure that causes cracks in the wrapping). Eventually (admittedly this may take a few thousands of years but the point is that it will occur at some point) that nuclear waste will work its way into the body (or in the planet\u2019s case, into the planet\u2019s crust and maybe making its way into the planet\u2019s core). Not good for Earth\u2019s health. In fact, we have no idea what effect this would have on our planet\u2019s core. <br>While the amount of carbon dioxide is alarming, baring that we stop producing it in such alarming quantities, over time (in thousands of years to come) Earth will be able to \u201cdigest\u201d it (for example, store it in form of ice). However, since nuclear waste does not occur in nature, Earth will not know what to do with it or how to defend itself against it. So while we talk about how it\u2019ll be better for us to use nuclear energy, lets please keep in mind that nuclear waste (no matter how safely it is stored) is the much more deadly poison for our planet (and our environment) than the carbon dioxide (which is not healthy for the planet either, please don\u2019t misunderstand me; I\u2019m saying that they are both bad; just that nuclear waste is much worse for Earth\u2019s overall health long term (i.e. millions of years from now)). <br>Having said all that, I am actually a proponent for innovation. I would like us to start looking and finding energy producers that are not just good for us at present but also healthy for our precious planet long term (and by long term I mean millions of years from now not just a couple hundred to a few thousand years that we seem to always focus on when discussing energy sources).

After being born the year after Chernobyl, growing up being taught how dangerous it was and watching Fukushima happen I thought that it was just a matter of time before we would end up having to flee to safer places like in the last season of the last man on earth.  But, after researching for years and coming to my own conclusions about nuclear energy, I have come to realize that we have nothing to fear and that we absolutely need nuclear energy if we want to survive as a species. I also think you&#39;re right that the nuclear industry is creating more fear by stating just how safe it is to run, (especially new age) nuclear power plants.  The people who fear it only see that as the nuclear industry trying to make itself look good when it (in their minds) isn&#39;t.  A kind of &quot;scam&quot; in their eyes.  But how do we show them that it is indeed safe and necessary?  I honestly don&#39;t think that we can.  It&#39;s like the old saying of &quot;trying to teach an old dog new tricks&quot; (though that&#39;s not correct either).  You just can&#39;t do it as they are set in their ways and refuse to listen to evidence and be willing to change their minds.  You could literally kill someone with a piece of coal and then bring them back to life with nuclear energy and they would still praise fossil fuels and condemn nuclear energy.  We will never be rid of that mindset, at least in the near future.  The only way to truly dispell that kind of thinking is to keep going with nuclear energy and keep a great track record in terms of safety and, in time, those individuals will (sorry for being morbid with this \ud83d\ude2c) pass away and people who trust nuclear energy (because they&#39;ve not had to deal with it experience any of these accidents of the past or have this fear drilled into them by the fossil fuel industry) will be born and take their place.  That&#39;s literally the only way I see the numbers supporting it going up.  We just have too many who refuse to be taught the truth and who want to live in their world of willful ignorance because it&#39;s not easier than doing the work to make the switch.
