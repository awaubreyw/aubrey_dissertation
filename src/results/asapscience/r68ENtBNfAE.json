I\u2019m still fairly young, and my fianc\u00e9 is quite a bit older. So our children will have the best of both worlds.They will have my youthful energy, as well as his wisdom, security, and stability that comes with age.Some more gems of advice: don\u2019t put off having kids or never having children at all because you think you can\u2019t \u201cafford it \u201c. Keep in mind that our great grandparents raised large families with next to nothing, and no luxuries of any kind. Just provide the basics of life like food, and plenty of love. You don\u2019t need to provide braces, cars, and a college fund for every child. Give them siblings instead, and they will have built in best friends for life (hopefully).", "comment_date": "2018-04-20T12:57:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Daxa Patel", "comment_text": "Why do we have more men than women", "comment_date": "2018-04-14T17:31:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danaiah Bacon", "comment_text": "My mom had me and my sister in 17 and 19", "comment_date": "2018-04-14T02:02:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BunnyAndMars", "comment_text": "Pffft my mom has me when she was 40 years old..", "comment_date": "2018-04-13T20:48:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AmandaMae Castillo", "comment_text": "OMG!

One&#39;s personality, outlook, and perception of the world will be fundamentally different.  And the change is not just experiential, but chemical too, and for both sexes (it first happens to women during pregnancy, and usually starts hitting men 0-6 months after birth).<br><br>- Sometimes people don&#39;t realize until after they had kids that they don&#39;t like having kids.  And the flip-side is true too: I love being a father so much that I deeply regret not starting a family in my 20&#39;s (looking back, I see that I wasted a LOT of my pre-fatherhood years just being a self absorbed man-child).<br><br>- Women approaching 40 who are waiting for a man to have a child risk never having a child.   You won&#39;t hear people say this very often but it&#39;s true.  And it&#39;s not just a matter of biology; the older we get the harder it becomes to meet and adjust to new love interests.<br><br>- Maintaining a good relationship with your mate/partner is harder than raising the child.<br><br>- Counter-intuitively, waiting until you think you can afford a child isn&#39;t always the best idea.

This means between the ages of 21-30 she should be popping out babies preferably within a relationship entered into for this purpose, meaning she should be looking for a mate in his mid-late twenties to early thirties and in the early but stable part of his career path. She and he should decide how many children they want and make it so that there is no more than two years between siblings and best if it&#39;s done in subsequent years if possible. Once early childhood is over and all the kids have started school, then she can look to building a career, which if she has chosen to have optimally 3 children, that would be 8 years after finishing study. A woman who takes this path can better prepare for her career path by including part time additional studies so that when she hits 30, she will actually be better qualified to enter a career field at a higher level with a more promising promotional path than finding a job straight out of school and deferring family until her 30 something years, as by then finding a suitable mate will be much more difficult and limited.<br><br>Taking a hiatus from a career can be more detrimental than starting one later with the knowledge that the family is done and no interruptions will be needed. It would bode well for employers to hire a woman just starting their career at thirty with an established family as it bring more surety to the table for them to hire you knowing that they won&#39;t suddenly lose your expertise for long periods of time and both you and your husband can both become career focused and more equitably share the ongoing parental duties required by a family unit.<br><br>With the added credentials and no hiatus, it&#39;s very likely that you will have stronger promotional opportunities and by your mid 40&#39;s will be ahead of the game than where you would otherwise have been with an interrupted career and that extra study could well see you get ahead of your husband if the career paths are similar who would not have had the benefit of extra study during those early family focused years.<br><br>For anyone who complains that this is not fair for the woman, needs to remember that the person who is in charge of creating the family unit, is always the woman who has the power of veto on all decisions of if and when a child is born, the man gets no choice here, he can only agree if planned and no say if unplanned. He has to accept whatever outcome she prefers, she has all the power over family planning, he only gets a slight advantage to a career path, that isn&#39;t an advantage if the woman plans well.<br><br>Preparing for the incoming hate, let it rip or take the above as it is meant, which is simply advice based on statistical outcomes of just who ends up happier in the long term. Women who defer family for fun and profit early or women who get it sorted as first priority and reap the benefits and become empty nester&#39;s at a time when their career can hit the high end of commitment in their mid forties when they are mature enough to get into the upper echelons of their career path.", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T13:50:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "slanahesh", "comment_text": "I see someone else watched that episode of Adam ruins everything.", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T13:50:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alvin Lee", "comment_text": "Why should we have babies anyway?", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T13:49:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Actioncat7", "comment_text": "Simple answer, never", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T13:49:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "westie kid", "comment_text": "&quot;Research has shown that Higher family income is linked to higher S.A.T scores&quot; well obviously \ud83d\ude44 because rich kids can afford the best and most expensive tutors!", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T13:46:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TrickMaster", "comment_text": "DO A VIDEO ABOUT SALVIA", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T13:40:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "moonage_daydreamer", "comment_text": "adopt kids, world wont need your ugly baby.", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T13:38:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "moonage_daydreamer", "comment_text": "never", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T13:36:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FAT", "comment_text": "The answer is never ever.
