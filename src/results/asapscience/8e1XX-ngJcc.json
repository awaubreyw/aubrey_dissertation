In the late 1930s I witnessed the demise of Lake Ontario&#39;s whitefish. In the 1940s I witnessed the floating islands of sludge in Toronto&#39;s Ashbridge&#39;s Bay, the site of a primitive sewage treatment plant that held the floating sludge back from the lake by a boom strung across the mouth of the bay, but allowed semi-processed sludge to exit the bay under the boom.<br>This presenter is too young to remember the revolution in environmental protections that occurred after World War II. In effect, he does not know what he is talking about. Canada had a population of about 15 million in 1945 and now has a population of 35+ million. Still, the natural environment is in much better shape now than it was then. Water pollution is less. Air pollution is less, primarily due to the use of natural gas.<br>Going back to my grandfather&#39;s generation, urban pollution is less, mainly as a result of the internal combustion engine, which ensured that our cities did not become fouled with horse manure. And that our farms produced food for people instead of feed for horses.<br>I became an environmentalist before the age of 10 (by 1940) by simple observation and careful reflection upon what I saw. Today, I am appalled by the politicization of the environmentalism as a quasi-religion. By fear and loathing of human societies and their struggle to improve the health and welfare of the people.<br><br>We need to balance our concern for the environment with our concern for the people who live in this environment. Only by becoming rich can societies preserve the natural and human environments and that requires balance between managing our urban industrial activities and managing the human and natural environments.<br><br>Canadians also need to consider immigration policy. What level of population can Canada accommodate and how rapidly should the population increase by immigration without stressing the environment? Can Canada sustain its long-term level of legal immigration at 250,000 new landings per year? And how can the level of new arrivals be contained if illegal immigration is allowed?<br><br>To provide context for those who may object to this comment, I have a Master&#39;s in both economic geography and Earth science and have served in both academic and government institutions as a senior scientist.

There was no &#39;conflict&#39; before darwin, not even on evolution. That&#39;s right, Darwin didn&#39;t discover evolution, he was taught it in biology class. He was just the first to propose that this disproved the bible. The myth that religion has always tried to suppress science originated from one man who literally decided to turn science into a religion. He even advocated that atheists should perform rituals throughout their lives that directly mirrored those of catholics (such as the last rites). He even crafted the story of science and atheism having always existed and religion was created by governments to suppress reason, and the population. Obviously early cult members didn&#39;t take to most of his ideas of how their religion should be, but they did grab on to the myth that religion wants to destroy science and preach it to this day.<br><br>Yeah, Christians oppose evolution (though not as much as is commonly purported, for instance the catholic church openly supports the theory, and even Darwin himself defended the idea of theistic evolution, which was the view of science before the publication of his (in)famous book), but they don&#39;t deny anything else. And not all religions even have a problem with evolution. Most religions lack a creation story, so it fills in a gap in their own mythology. Oh, and Hindus have always claimed that their own scriptures support it. And physics is quite popular with Hindus, to the point that they&#39;re influencing scientific theory. An increasing number of scientists actually support the idea of pantheism for instance, that the universe is god. Carl Sagan was an early supporter of this belief. Though most today just accept it as a solution to the &#39;problem of consciousness&#39;. Essentially, consciousness is an innate part of matter, thus why living beings like us are conscious. But like I said, its mostly being accept just as a way to solve a problem they&#39;ve utterly failed to despite decades of research.<br><br>And most religious people do practice science. Virtually everyone who works in medicine is religious. So are most biologists (yes, most biologists reject evolution). Funny enough, the people most likely to believe in evolution, are the ones that know the least about biology. Kinda makes you wonder, now doesn&#39;t it? Oh, and scientists ignore the fact that the theory is unfalsible, yet they consistently reject other theories that make just as much sense, and are just as impossible to prove wrong. And what is it with the logic that &#39;if it can&#39;t be proven false, then it must be false&#39;? Yeah, if something can&#39;t be proven false doesn&#39;t make it true, but assuming the opposite is just as irrational!", "comment_date": "2017-08-11T09:01:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spearka", "comment_text": "if it&#39;s like the war on drugs or the war on terror then we&#39;ll be fine", "comment_date": "2017-08-10T15:41:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dark Lord Of The Universe", "comment_text": "Science not wer and love for all creches big and small \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc09\ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf08", "comment_date": "2017-08-10T01:46:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dmitri Shostakovich", "comment_text": "As a skeptic, agnostic atheist, non-religious and non-spiritual person, nihilist ( 1a and 1b definitions from here:  <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nihilism\">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nihilism</a>  ),a science supporter and a fan of philosophy, I still think that science ( and knowledge in general ) requires faith.", "comment_date": "2017-08-08T10:14:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Georgia Buchan", "comment_text": "this made me sad", "comment_date": "2017-08-08T08:44:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Morning Star", "comment_text": "Have fought religions all my life, still fighting, I&#39;m 44 now.

Is it really possible to wage war on science? I mean, science is a practice -- a methodology humans use to help them understand how they exist in relation to the world and universe around them. You can&#39;t really attack a practice, at least not from a critical and intellectual standpoint. <br><br>Now, <i>you can attack people</i> who perform a practice (or through a methodology you disagree with), but you can&#39;t actually attack the practice/methodology itself. At best, you can critically examine practices and compare them to others, to see if there are any weak points or blind spots in them, and then offer alternative methods or solutions in the event that there are critical errors in the methodology in question.<br><br>Now is it fair to say that <b>at an institutional level</b>, science might be under attack? Well, no... not really (even though that&#39;s what you&#39;re essentially saying in this video). <br><br>A better way to phrase it might be &quot;People are no longer blindly yielding to the dictates and determinations of <b>institutional science</b> -- that is, the body of individuals and the systems they&#39;ve achieved and perform through, which (presumably) seek to represent, perform maintenance on, and then speak on behalf of the practice of science.&quot; Humans have been using practices and methodologies for actualization (agricultural methods, tools, and the such) for millenniums now -- well before the scientific &quot;banner&quot; came along, and sought to collectivize these things under its heading.  <br><br>To claim science is under attack would be fundamentally no different than claiming religion is under attack -- which would be a false statement. No, no... the <b>authority of the institution</b> is being called into question, but not the practice itself. Much in the same way science exposes critical errors in religion, so too does critical thinking expose conceptual errors in science. Only, the practices of both religion and science remain unaffected by conceptual errors in their respective bodies. In other words, the practices themselves don&#39;t take offense to people calling their authority into question. It&#39;s the PEOPLE that perform through them who take offense to others calling into question the authority of the institution.<br><br>The institution of science is not being revered in the way it (or those who feel empowered through it) want(s) to be. The only thing I could think to liken it to would be a father complaining about his wife not appreciating him, and his children not listening to him. Would it be fair, no, <b>accurate</b>, for the father to claim he was being attacked simply because he felt undervalued, and felt his authority wasn&#39;t being recognized? I don&#39;t think so. To claim such a thing would <b>technically be unscientific</b>.<br><br>A real war science would look something more like people dressing in animal furs, and using sticks and rocks to effectively stamp out all traces of technology and social learning, which would extend to languages and then all aspects of modern humanity. Paradoxically, a real war on science would require more science than is presently available to humanity, because truly regressing us to a point where science was not (in some people&#39;s opinion) &#39;the bane of existence&#39; would require a sorting process that is exponentially more advanced than science presently is.", "comment_date": "2015-10-31T19:28:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xxlillypadxx bvb", "comment_text": "that&#39;s so sad \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "comment_date": "2015-10-31T17:26:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Creator Link", "comment_text": "Note to self: Don&#39;t Go To The Comments", "comment_date": "2015-10-31T16:58:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alejandro Vallencci", "comment_text": "Religion and illogical people will be the downfalls of society yet again", "comment_date": "2015-10-31T13:07:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eamonn cooper", "comment_text": "Serious complaint you colored in the Republic of Ireland in the English flag.

If it&#39;s unbiased great, but it does seem like you must have and awful lot of bias as is in the video. For instance I don&#39;t know much about Canadian politics but I do feel like just singling out one person and saying their government, it&#39;s all their fault, is not much better then everyone blaming every single US president for all the troubles of the nation. If your about Science then one you must specify what polocys they made that are bad, tell us their reasoning behind it and then showing how this is incompatible with truth and progress. Just saying they are bad and wrong while drawing sad animals killed by said evil person is not really true to the scientific method. Truth be told you could be right you could be wrong, but it&#39;s Canada, I don&#39;t much care. What I do care about is even if your right your not giving us a real fair unbiased view I don&#39;t even know who he is and just from what you said it screams bias and that your not telling the whole story, which if I might add is not what science is about. It&#39;s about giving us the facts and letting us decided. So your argument holds no sway to me if you can do nothing better then simply appeal to emotions of your followers, rather then giving us all a summery of the situation and letting us decide. So frankly I like your show and what you try to do, but it&#39;s descusting that you steer up peoples emotions for a thing we all love in one form or another which is the search for truth. And then provide to ignore the very fondation of that concept to simply use your sway on people to think a specific way, your way. And it&#39;s repulsive that you do this all while claiming to be a good scientist only concerned with the fact&#39;s when in actuality your not any different from the vast majority of the people you claim to be against.

Bill Maher is anti-vax becaus he is a peta member, and believes vaccinations should be optional.

Simply using past (centuries old) examples of such persecution does not negate their expressed need to promote further persecutions of modern scientist viewpoints of today and yes this remains ONGOING TODAY -- simply because they oppose the established orthodoxy opinion (who control public knowledge and passing it onto subsequent generations).  Controlling the spread of knowledge, whether true or false, only promotes the dumbing-down of the populace.  For if the science is really true science, opposition to various theories or even factual content (such as laws) would, in time, verify such truths as true.  And all science needs such balancing to maintain an unbiased and truth-seeking quest for knowledge. <br><br>We all must remember &quot;true&quot; knowledge gained in science may only come from observable, testable and verifiable research.  If not, then no matter its name, it becomes just another religious belief and one that squelches all opposition or nay-sayers (like those in our past).  Yet, there is no place for any governing authority to say one science is good or bad.  Neither is there room for ANY national government to dictate or even fund such sciences.  That only leads to the promotion of personal motives or agendas in guise of science.  And therein lies the modern scientific problem of our society, a problem which this video promotes using an expressed emotional plea with disregard or in conflict to the actual topic (all in the name of successful integration).

Here&#39;s why:<br><br>Claiming that there is any kind of war on science because skepticism exists in the general public is foolish.  Scientific skepticism has led to the abolishment of MANY bad ideas.  <br><br>For example:  Scientists did a LOT of damage to the world with scientific racism in the 1800s.  Scientific racism was the justification behind the Scramble for Africa that completely eliminated all African identity, the slave labor conditions of India during the British Empire, the near eradication of the Aboriginals in Australia, the mistreatment of Native Americans in the United States, and most damning was the rise of the Nazi party formulated on the idea that the Caucasians were the highest evolved human beings, and all other human beings such as the Jews simply held us down.<br><br>Another example can be found in the Climategate scandal.  During this scandal, we received evidence of lots of scientific bias in the climatology community, talking about boycotting certain journals for publishing papers that went against their narrative, outright avoiding FOIA requests, and outright blasting anyone who publishes a paper that goes against their views.  These things are clearly wrong and the wrongdoing was done by some of the top what we called climate scientists.<br><br>This does not mean to blindly reject scientists.  What that means is that we should not accept what any person, be they a scientist or politician, based on dogma.  The general public has every right, and definitely deserves that right, to demand evidence fit for their own personal standards.  We simply live in a time today where the demand for evidence is stronger than it ever was.  This is absolutely fine.  We need the general public to challenge scientists to do a better job of proving their claims to be true.<br><br><b>The Romans were simply content with Greek discoveries?</b><br><br>This is another reason I disliked the video, false statements.  The Romans brought us many advances, such as how to structure cities and societal roles.  We had the first social programs, highways, architectural and agricultural improvements.  People didn&#39;t stop thinking with the Romans.  Roman culture was more practical and less philosophical, which brought us applied knowledge.  It is applied science where the Greeks lacked it (after all, neither Socrates or Plato, as smart as they were, could come up with ways to reduce disease or prevent their own people from devolving into Chaos).<br><br><b>Government funding of science?</b><br><br>There is nothing wrong with the government providing small amounts of funding toward specific areas of research, but when our governments waste money on useless points of research such as hundreds of thousands of dollars just to watch shrimp on a treadmill for example, that shows that we are way over the line.<br><br>While NASA has produced a few key discoveries that have been useful to us, the reality is that we will never get our money back.  If you correct for inflation, we have spent more on NASA than its discoveries can ever hope to repay, especially considering that many of these discoveries would have been made by private individuals anyway.<br><br>Government funded research should be based on current productivity, NOT based on simple satisfaction of curiosity.  We need to feed, cloth, and make sure that our people are taken care of, and this is where the government research can go.  A private entity can choose to do longer-term research if they feel there is commercial value to it in the future.  But, that&#39;s not for governments to decide, because they simply don&#39;t do a good job, no government does.", "comment_date": "2015-10-12T08:49:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bristol Camellia", "comment_text": "i just wanna cry. is very sad that some people doesn&#39;t really support some science research instead mostly the governments only allow research which help the economy.

The Conservatives seemed focused on fishing, lobsters, building roads in places that don&#39;t need roads, and creating those tourist attractions that you see and think &quot;Yep.. that&#39;s definitely a thing.&quot;  The Liberals seemed focused on making big changes to things, with most of their budgetary promises being 1-3 digits longer than most of those made by the Conservatives.  (as in, 1.5 billion, instead of 15 million.  Not for the same things, of course.)  The areas of interest did seem to be more focused on sciences, technology, and not buying things we don&#39;t need.<br>For example, on September 20, the Liberals promised to cancel Canada&#39;s purchase of 65 F-35 jet fighters, in favor of planes that A: work, B: exist, and C: don&#39;t cost almost a billion dollars each.  And to use the savings to build Navy ships.<br>On the same day, the Conservatives promised to build a &quot;Manufacturing Technology Demonstration Center&quot;, so that we can look at the robots that would build the things that we don&#39;t build in our country any more, while those robots don&#39;t build things.<br><br>There&#39;s a flip-side too.  I don&#39;t like that the Liberals promise to end the combat mission against ISIS.  If anything, we should be putting more effort into fixing that problem where it sits, instead of pretending that taking in 0.25% of the refugees who are currently dying, and doing so at some point in the next few years, so we can have time to pick and choose the ones we like, is in any way helping in the face of the crisis.", "comment_date": "2015-10-12T06:41:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Azriel A", "comment_text": "True, very true.

Heck civilization (a videogame about playing a civilization and building from the ground up) accomplishes this by showing that technology is always necessary to compete against others, but do you need religion? No, because it provided nice buffs but at massive costs that almost didn&#39;t feel worth it. Now not to say you couldn&#39;t but it was a very awkward playstyle no one really tried themselves, but I digress. The real meaning is that it is better to have proof and logic over faith, but faith is a very weird thing. It is like a way to explain things  we can&#39;t understand but are almost too ridiculous that they are believable and when everyone believes faith over science, things start to become dangerous. An example is like the Crusades or even the covenant crom the videogame Halo, they both show how groups that believe in faith over science, duke out war with others because of reasons like &quot;my faith says to destroy all who oppose, and if you oppose my faith then I will destroy you.&quot; Now not to say thats everyone who has a faith but rather this is something that happened in history and what truly happened wasn&#39;t a bunch of priests or monks trying to just spread the love, it was the death many innocent lives. This happens in history and history is there to make sure we don&#39;t repeat the same things our ancestors did, but when people forget to remember histories important we are destined to repeat it. Or maybe it is our destiny to do this, so that our future great grandchildren will have to live through our mistakes and when they have children, those children will learn from our mistakes so that they will not repeat them too. We are all here on this world to either make the mistake so that others will learn from it, or we are the ones learning from them. That is what scares me the most, which one are we going to be? Well I sorta branched out but to me history and science matter most, science will help us advance in intelligence and strength so that we wont have to depend on history to remind us what happened when they did this and people started to die.

Oh the persecution that &quot;science&quot; endured for saying the earth was round. Get over it. It&#39;s time to be honest about science. It fails quite a bit too. The video is emotional, and extremely well made. I enjoyed it. But it&#39;s dishonest. Science gets things wrong sometimes. Let&#39;s not blur the truth and deify science. How unscientific. Science messes some things up too. Nuclear Weapons, DDT, Agent Orange, are just a few things cooked up in a lab that are devastating for humanity. It counts! They&#39;re products of science whether we like it or not. Science gave us penicillin, and I for one am thankful. But what about the thousands of other prescription drugs that are killing people? Science! This idea that science produces all the things that make humanity great, but everything else cooked up by the same people working in the same labs, well, that&#39;s not really science? What? Again, I liked the video as far as videos are concerned, and to me, that&#39;s important to mention because you don&#39;t have to agree with something to appreciate its quality. But there is a darker side to science that has been extremely harmful for humanity, and to deny it by simply focusing on some great accomplishments presents partial data.  It&#39;s bad science not to admit that its fallible, and capable of disaster, and horrendous consequences. It doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s war just because it&#39;s questioned. It&#39;s getting so incredibly old for scientists, and the scientific community to consider themselves above questioning when that&#39;s what science was supposed to be all about. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t believe we should fund science. I do! But this video begins politically charged, and it wasn&#39;t necessary. So people don&#39;t believe in vaccinations? So people don&#39;t believe in global warming? There&#39;s even people on YouTube swearing that the earth is flat, and many of them attended public schools with quite a bit of public funding. I want to fund science, not an agenda.  Let&#39;s fund science because it forces upon us the need to ask why something works the way it works.

It is a field of knowledge, not an actual being who asks questions and wonders. No people wonder and ask questions, then the answers we receive are considered science. Science is not an entity in and of itself, but a matter of our objective agreed upon perception of the world. and posing science like an entity comes dangerously close to theology. <br><br>Next, this videos view on history is incredibly flawed.The enlightenment era and the scientific revolution are two different things, and the enlightenment was an era that championed the PHILOSOPHY of reason/logic to explain everything in our world, whereas the scientific revolution was the era of scientific innovation that came BEFORE the enlightenment. I could go more into many of the things wrong about enlightenment reasoning, but I do not want to wright a ten page essay. Moreover, hardly any contemporary historian refers to the time after the fall of the western roman empire as the dark ages anymore (because we know a hell of a lot about it now). Also, there were many technological innovations achieved by the romans, but they were more practical than the greeks, and the greeks where around for quite some time during the roman empire.... they didn&#39;t go anywhere lol. Again! no one considered the earth flat since Eratosthenes discovered this back in 300 bc.  Furthermore, rome fell into the &quot;dark ages&quot; (lol) because of many many many many factors none of which are &quot;they lacked sufficient scientific knowledge&quot;. well I guess no empire ever would fall if they had sufficient &quot;science&quot; (more like technology) to solve all of their problems lol.<br><br>Now time to go into the politics of all of this. <br>First, no one in the scientific community debates climate change, however they do debate on the primary factors leading to climate change, which is some of the sources of mistrust among-st society, but they are right! this does not give any excuses to dismiss climate change entirely like so many people do.<br>Secondly, the UK can have many reasons for decreasing their public spending on scientific research, like the lack of progress in the fields that they are funding, and a more efficient private sector that provides most of our technological innovation (such as the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation). The reason we have cut NASA is that it we are not seeing the returns on our spending from NASA. It is impractical to spend this much money on a space program that has been coming out with less innovations year after year, and especially when we see few or little returns on our investments. These reasons are about economics not a war on science. Moreover, most of our major spending on studying climate goes straight to the UN instead of NASA because it is a world issue not an american issue. Continuing about NASA and the banks, the bank bailout was to ensure we didn&#39;t have an economic collapse, the economy that supports the entire US government including NASA. Also, fun fact most of the banks have paid back the bailout in full with interest. The military budget has always been vastly superior to NASA&#39;s budget, even when we sent people to the moon. America has the largest economy in the world, and we have the largest military in the world too. Why is this a surprise?.... i have no opinions on Canada because I do not know the situation. Next, Einstein received very little initial funding for his research, and his funding came from collegiate institutes not the government (this is the model we follow today, trusting that universities, and private institutions will make the most progress which has been the case). <br><br>Last but not least. Science is &quot;the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.&quot; the scientific method is a way of proceeding and thinking about this science. By putting a philosophical attachment to any of this you inherently bias everything. Moreover, applying certain scientific concepts in areas they were not designed for have led to things like the bloody french revolution, the communist governments of the world and their atrocities, social Darwinism helping cause multiple racial atrocities including the holocaust, and the nuclear arms race. So when applying &quot;science&quot; to your voting and life, remember that this has been done before, and has lead to some of the worst atrocities in history. (along with religion/philosophy, they do not get a free pass either).<br><br>All in all, this video should not be considered an in depth source of information on the complex political and economic reasons behind why our governments have cut our research programs. This is evidenced by its very flawed very quick overview of thousands of years of history. Also, it is evidenced by the lack of a full view into both sides on why certain spending has been cut, essentially building up a straw man argument for the opposing side, but they are right, we do need more government funding on scientific research into PRACTICAL solutions to problems. not things like a space trip to mars, but more into energy solutions and medical advances.", "comment_date": "2015-10-12T01:21:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bianca r", "comment_text": "What a shame.

There is distrust on science because it has allowed itself to become politicized. Examples used in this video are examples of this politicization. Take the Carl Segan example. He was a great scientist, but he was very politically active. The examples he used on his Cosmos series on the plight of science as a war between religion and the Vatican were designed more as a political message against Reagan at the time. The reality is that the earth being flat and at the center of the universe were not religious dogma. These were the scientific facts of the time put forth the greatest Greek philosophers, scientists and mathematicians Aristotle and Ptolemy. The Vatican embraced these scientific facts as their own because they fit neatly with their views and they tried to defend it against Galileo. Ultimately, the theory was wrong and the Vatican were made to look like fools. The mistake made here was the Vatican by putting all their trust on a scientific theory. Today I see the same thing. Politicians are using &quot;scientific facts&quot; to push their political agendas. There used to be a time when politicians used religion to force people into their way of thinking. If you didn&#39;t follow their political ideals, you were offending God. Today with an increasing population that is indifferent to religion, politicians are replacing religion with science to force people into their way of thinking. Today politicians quote scientists and if you don&#39;t vote for them you are a scientific illiterate. The problem here is that just like the Vatican found out, this can backfire. Take Al Gore as an example, he used science to scare people for his political benefit. He used global warming as his political platform. He warned that by 2012, the polar ice caps would melt and that he was the candidate to do something about it, therefore you should vote for him. Al Gore was very astute, though. He said, \u201cscientists\u201d were telling him this. So if the predictions did not pan out, he could blame it on poor science. Today, the ice caps are still there. Al Gore is still a rich politician. However, science took a major hit in its credibility. So scientists have no one else to blame but themselves for hurting science when they decided to allow themselves to be used as political puns.", "comment_date": "2015-10-11T19:35:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate Parry", "comment_text": "Canada conservatism is much different from American conservatism ", "comment_date": "2015-10-11T19:34:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sharron Wall", "comment_text": "You guys rock!", "comment_date": "2015-10-11T19:32:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jake", "comment_text": "Check this out..

A hypothesis is an unproven idea. A scientific theory is proven. They may change, or the way they are interpreted may change, but the facts don&#39;t.

AsapSCIENCE, I love you guys, but I hate bad history more. The collapse of the Roman Empire had nothing to do with values shifting away from science - it couldn&#39;t have.  The damn Eastern half was culturally Greek, and the elites of the Western half borderline idolized Greek civilization. Regardless, it&#39;s not as though the Rome simply stopped making scientific advancements. Just a small list here: Roman Pentaspastos (&quot;Five-pulley-crane&quot;),  double glazed concrete, glass-blowing, Roman abacus, the Screw press, advanced large-scale architecture, the codex, brass-making, hydraulic mining,  the hydrometer, and a number of surgical instruments which we still use today were all invented in Rome. This is just a fraction of what the created. I&#39;m going to blatantly steal from a historian here, and post what he said about whether the Romans stagnated technologically:<br><br>&quot;No. Absolutely not. Even in parts of the academic community there is a continued perception that the Roman empire stagnated technologically, mainly because their social values forbade wealth from other means than agriculture. This is, of course, complete bunk. The idea only comes from a few passages from literature, which was written by the imperial elites, for the imperial elites (the size of the Senate was 600 people during the Empire, the population of the empire as a whole was 50-70 million). It was also a presentation of an ideal, rather than a reality, because the elites often collected money through rent. So don&#39;t listen to that argument.<br>So, where did the Romans technologically innovate? Everywhere. The problem is that the Romans never identified the uses of coal, so their technology was still essentially water powered. For example, a sawmill for cutting stone seen on second century tomb in Hierapolis is mechanically almost identical to James&#39; Watt&#39;s steam engine, only it is powered by water rather than steam. We have tentatively identified the remains of a few of these in several parts of the Empire. In some farm houses we have been able to identify several very impressive gear based water mills, and the more we look for them the more we find.<br>Mining is another area where the Romans innovated greatly. The primary technical problem with mining is the water table, because you can&#39;t mine under water. Before Roman times, mining operations were essentially stuck only mining down to there, but the Romans were able to go far further down. In fact, old Roman mines were only reopened in the later 19th century because they didn&#39;t have the technology to go deeper than the Romans until then. Look up the Roman water wheels in the Rio Tinto mines--they were incredibly sophisticated. There was also some pretty impressive works to divert river courses to help in mining.<br>Roman shipbuilding was largely based on Hellenistic innovations, but took those farther than ever before. Roman anchors are basically identical to those from the nineteenth century. Modern style bilge pumps, lanteen rigging, and extremely strong hauls were also present.<br>Construction was another area the Romans excelled in. I can&#39;t find the best picture for it, but they made innovated use of pulleys to create their stunning constructions. Their innovations with cement and the arch are also well known.<br>I&#39;m sure there are other areas I can&#39;t think of now, but basically speaking the Roman empire was a period of heavy technology use.&quot;<br><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/swr2e/was_the_roman_empire_a_period_of_technological/c4hndg9\">https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/swr2e/was_the_roman_empire_a_period_of_technological/c4hndg9</a><br><br><br>Though I&#39;m obviously not going to go over why the Roman Empire fell in this single post, but pretty much every historian you&#39;ll ever meet will tell you that the idea of the Roman Empire falling due to technological stagnation is completely absurd.

Professors are threatened with losing their jobs if they don&#39;t fall in line. Does that sound like unwavering confidence? Does it even sound like science?", "comment_date": "2015-10-10T15:57:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cesar Cesar", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Illuminati\">#Illuminati</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NewWorldOrder\">#NewWorldOrder</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ThisIsTheFirstStep\">#ThisIsTheFirstStep</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ImJustJokingButMayBeTrue\">#ImJustJokingButMayBeTrue</a>", "comment_date": "2015-10-10T15:57:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Strange Tree", "comment_text": "I&#39;m pretty well educated on science...

Science and technology is an enabler of surveillance, imprisonment, war, and less overt means of social control.\u00a0Capitalism is full of contradictions, and capitalists&#39; own fears of an informed, engaged working class and their obsession with short-terms costs and gains, has led directly to the gutting of science and technology education and training.

I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you\u2019re being had.<br>Let\u2019s be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus. There is no such thing as consensus science. If it\u2019s consensus, it isn\u2019t science. If it\u2019s science, it isn\u2019t consensus.

People are so brainwashed into this way of thinking that &quot;if the government doesn&#39;t fund it then it will not get funded&quot;. Why is that? If it is true that most people want to FUND science and all that jazz then if you cut and lower taxes and give more money to people they will fund it. I do not know exactly what the Canadian politicians are doing at the moment, but I will guess that they are reducing the size and power of the state (less government programs) which usually results in lowering taxes. Even if that is not what&#39;s happening it doesn&#39;t matter. <br><br>The reality is that the government is an inefficient bureaucratic institution that will charge you a fee for redistributing the money from your pocket to the source, which will result in LESS money for science.( In the U.S the government takes 70% of money they take for welfare programs, and only 30% gets to the poor) If you really want to help science why not cut the middle man charging you a fee and just give your money directly to the source by lowering taxes? Of course this is assuming that you guys actually want to help fund science and don&#39;t just want to vote in politicians that will use laws to take money from people to fund things that you think should be funded. If that is that case my friend you are not for funding science, you want other people to fund science.<br><br> I am all for funding science, but I don&#39;t understand why being &quot;pro science&quot; is synonymous with being for the left wing/ more government power and size. Plus private funding for science is much more efficient than public funded science because the researchers have pressure to make some progress otherwise they will often lose funding. This is not true for the government as they will give money easier due to the fact that it is impossible to keep track of every lab.

Hipsters love science. <br>2. While I generally agree with the point you are trying to make, I think the video itself is very poorly done. I understand there is are limits on how much you can say in a little amount of time but ironically none of your claims are really substantiated. And obviously (and ironically given your point about ideology) you clearly have a political bias you are injecting into the mix. Just a few quibbles and points:<br><br>a.  at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e1XX-ngJcc&amp;t=0m54s\">0:54</a> you talk about &quot;advances&quot; in agriculture saving lives. Interesting that study after study after study have concluded GMO&#39;s (responsible for much of this claim you are asserting) are no less safe than non-GMO foods yet LIBERALS attack them at every opportunity and even people like Bill Nye still have an anti-GMO bias. He has only recently starting to retract his claims, kicking and screaming all the way. <br><br>b.  Saying that funding cuts into research constitutes a &quot;war on science&quot; is incredibly simplistic and certainly unsubstantiated by the information you present. Perhaps it is purely a budget issue; sometimes you have to make tough calls. Nobody likes it but sometimes it&#39;s a reality. Maybe it was a compromise and it was a LIBERAL interest (i.e., spending on some program) that they didn&#39;t want to cut so they went with research funding instead. The politics and economic realities of this clearly prevent you from making this straightforward connection. Furthermore, much research, at least in the states has shown to be wasteful, particularly studies and other projects involving the &quot;soft sciences.&quot; Liberal ideologues also forgot that public funding is also subject to conflicts of interests between the academics who have an agenda. We have scientists in America trying to make outlandish claims about the imminent radioactive menace that will consume the West Coast because of Fukushima. That&#39;s right, half way across the world separated by the largest ocean in the solar system. The reality is that 30,000 people died of a tsunami (which was the catastrophic cause of the meltdown) yet not a single death was the result of radiation. Further, radiation levels in the Pacific Ocean, including waters surrounding Japan, are no higher than background radiation. But just try and promote the idea of nuclear power as part of the puzzle to reduce climate change. Not very scientific.<br><br>c.  You you say those cuts &quot;happen to include climate science&quot; you suggest, without proof, that the real motivation for these cuts is some sort of anti-climate change agenda. Were there other areas that were cut? Is it possible it was just one of many? You need to be very specific here because you are asserting quite clearly this is to serve an agenda. <br><br>d.  Your point about the bailout is laughable and irrelevant. The two are not necessarily connected. Do you think you really have a nuanced enough financial and economic understanding of the importance of such a bailout? Where do you think the tax dollars for research are going to come from if the economy sinks into a depression? Is it possible you are oversimplifying things?<br><br>e.  I agree with you regarding the military budget, though again you don&#39;t add useful qualifications, such as the fact like the unintended benefits of Einstein&#39;s research you mention later, military spending also has clear ancillary scientific benefits (laser tech, satellite tech, etc.). In fact, a significant amount of the military dollars are spent directly on scientific research. Just because such research is principally aimed at defense does not necessarily mean it doesn&#39;t have other useful purposes. <br><br>f.  You haven&#39;t described why the current stock of science libraries is critical to the current progress of science. Maybe nobody goes to them anymore. Maybe all the information can be obtained online or in other formats. Again there&#39;s no meat on the bones for the points you are making. <br><br>g.  Losing endangered species and fish stocks protections does not constitute a &quot;war on science.&quot; They are regrettable and it&#39;s a trend that should be reversed but you haven&#39;t quite made a clear causal connection between that action and how it harms scientific progress. <br><br>h.  Your point about Canadian scientists not speaking freely or being forced to change their view doesn&#39;t explain which views they were being asked to change or which governments (or parts of government) and/or when they were asked to do so. You clearly suggest a monolithic &quot;conservative&quot; government versus a monolithic presumably &quot;liberal&quot; group of scientists but I seriously doubt that&#39;s the case. At least in America scientists who publish things antithetical to liberal political narratives are often complaining about censorship or even outright attack. <br><br>i. You are &quot;told&quot; that science has to be for a clear &quot;commercial&quot; output. Where has that proclamation been made and was it made that definitively? Just Canada or everywhere in the Western World? See my point about the economic realities of budgets above. <br><br>j.  Finally, &quot;science is supported by the government&quot;? You&#39;re joking right? Do you really think that the whole of current scientific advancement is all &quot;supported by the government&quot;? If that&#39;s the case, maybe the government should give (or give more) money to many of the private business and innovators making real and serious advancements every day. <br><br>But I know &quot;Big Pharma&quot;, Monsanto, Cargill, Elon Musk and all the other fat cat conspirators are hindering real progress.

The point of Science is to fact check. So be thorough about it.   Science isnt complete or perfect.

Not just stating things to be taken at face value. Those who are a threat to Science and its true purpose, those who corrupt its process is anyone who falsely represents it. It&#39;s fine to have questions and beliefs, without them the process would never get off the ground. The problem is when people claim a conclusion to be an undeniable fact when it has yet to be fully demonstrated or observed.  When speculation is treated as actual observation.

Why was it necessary to mention that his government was &quot;conservative&quot; if you were simply trying to defend &quot;science&quot;? And what exactly is your point in attempting to claim science should be merged with society? Isn&#39;t that philosophy? Ethical obligations, critical thinking, logic, political ideology, these are all philosophical concepts. Yet you place it under the banner of science. Why not invest in philosophy if we want a better world? The philosophy of &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;science&quot; was already tried in the el 20th century, and was revived in mid 20th century under the name pragmatism.

Should we simply give money to every scientist who claims to be working on an extremely important discovery. How many research projects, inventions, scientific ideas, turned out to be complete failures? Is it wrong of us to ask the scientist to present EVIDENCE to support the CLAIM that his invention or discovery will help improve society when we are using SOCIETY&#39;S money to pay for it (tax dollars).

So the budget to NASA is less, but the amount and quality of scientific study is increased, because costs are lower. Increasing a budget does not equate to &quot;more good science&quot; and to believe that, is the same as having faith in religion.

Anyway, the youtube comment section isn&#39;t the place to be to share that you are supreme simply because others don&#39;t share your belief. This is the Internet. Of course your going to find people who don&#39;t share your belief but that doesn&#39;t mean you have to bash them for it. If you don&#39;t agree on someone&#39;s point of view, don&#39;t argue about it; you jus look stupid and if you&#39;re gonna have to, do it somewhere private.

For example science cannot tell us why fire burns. Surely it is an exothermic reaction of a combustible material with oxygen but this only tells us how fire works and not why something like fire exists in the first place. So although no one here has claimed this, many people see science as a substitute for scripture (religion) but this is really dangerous as science cannot adress certain woes and needs humanity has.<br>There is a reason something like religion exists and these desperate reactions like burning someone who shows earth not to be the centre of the universe can be explained not only by a war on science for the pure hate of science. Christianity has a creator who cares about humans and lives. Showing earth not to be the centre, doubts this principle and rather suggests like many &quot;controversial&quot; discoveries e.g. Evolution, the creation of mankind and the earth to have happened kind of randomly with no meaning to it all. Although latter is nowadays widely accepted, life being totally meaningless sets us under high psychological stress, which is why one can cling on to religion or has to find another substitue for meaning. Science however, although giving us the comfort in our lives and lessening our fears of our surroundings by understanding and insight, cannot be our source of meaning.<br>What is your opinion about this?", "comment_date": "2015-10-08T21:47:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "KiesKo Enterprises", "comment_text": "Maybe we could fund science as much as we fund the military....<br>But that just wouldn&#39;t be Murican.", "comment_date": "2015-10-08T21:46:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max", "comment_text": "Yes!

It&#39;s way too easy to say that science has not<br>enough money, because government spends more on war and banks without<br>understanding the economic, political and social reasons behind it. People who say<br>that the right abolishes science are usually those, who think that gender<br>studies and sociology are as important as STEM related science. Science was on<br>its decline when lefty universities in the US &amp; UK began to do things like<br>cancel out quantum physics from their curriculum because it can offend muslim,<br>because Allah obviously built the universe. They demanded engineering students<br>that they have to visit an additional gender studies course, because how else<br>they would learn not to rape women. They put a narrative forward, which says<br>that things like gender and race don&#39;t exist and that they are made by society,<br>while they lack basic evidence and take away the importance of subjects like<br>biology. They always claim that there are not enough women in STEM fields and<br>pretend that this would cause a problem and that it is the fault of men, little<br>they know that women just don&#39;t want to study these things and exclude at the<br>same time men from STEM fields. Companies like Intel use their profits for<br>hiring diversity officers, rather than invest in research and research<br>companies want to hire more women even though there are men out there who are<br>far better. The left media has contributed as well to the fall of serious<br>science. Serious science is ridiculed by TV shows for kids and mainstream media<br>formats, which teach shit but show science as a funny thing. The liberal media and government praises little kids<br>who know nothing about electronics, but know how disassemble clocks and show factory<br>made circuit boards on TV and gives them scholarship for the MIT. The problem<br>which causes the fall of science is that it&#39;s not taken serious anymore, people<br>in charge put a social agenda forward rather than taking objective approach and<br>most important the privatisation of science, which means that science responds<br>only to the market.
