Every stat had the best and worst tolerance in the entire spectrum of energy drinks AND SIZES but then only black coffee. In an 8oz cup-  and one cup not 8. I&#39;m all for shaming something if it&#39;s bad but this doesn&#39;t feel like an even remotely scientific comparison between them. Looking at a red bull in my fridge right here. 8.4oz. 110 calories. 80mg of caffeine. And 100% of your day of Vitamin B6, B12 and Niacin, which is uncommonly known as Vitamin B3. It also has 27g of sugar and trace amounts of salt and protein. If you&#39;re going to use an iconic looking can, use one that&#39;s actually bad or be specific to the size and brand. You Have to at least do that cause this compared to an Ubermonster or some junk off labels on Amazon, that&#39;s going to range drastically. In closing, drinking 100% venti lattees with whole milk sure seems like it&#39;d be worse than drinking a small 8.4 oz red bull for each meal. <br><br>Tldr, don&#39;t skew statistics to try and prove a point entertainingly.
