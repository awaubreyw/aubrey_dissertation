Friend, Jesus loves you. I have a habit to beat myself up (not literally) when I look at images that I shouldn\u2019t. The reason why I say that is cause the feeling is very sad and it makes me very upset. I don\u2019t want you guys to be upset or mad at yourself for sinning. We were all born into sin. If you sin, its normal to feel a bit of sadness cause sin is not good. We certainly shouldn\u2019t feel proud of ourselves. I too get discouraged and upset when I sin, but I pray and ask God to pick me up from the ashes and dust, Brush my shoulders off with all that gunk, and try again and again and again. When you do sin, don\u2019t think \u201cIM A FAILURE! WHY DO I KEEP DOING THIS?! IM NEVER GONNA BE FREE OF THIS SIN!!\u201d My brothers, my sisters, that is a big fat lie from the enemy. Jesus can and WILL save you from your deepest and darkest struggles! We are all in this together and we all struggle with sexual sin. Know that the Lord Jesus Christ DIED for your sins. His blood was shed for us sinners when it should have been us on that cross. He took all our shame, all our sins, ALL OUR TRANSGRESSION onto himself. Jesus will free you. Matthew 26:41 \u201cThe spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\u201d I care for whoever reads this. I love you, and so does God.

You will become more confident in knowing your strength in overcoming this HUGE obstacle in your life and it will give you more confidence in yourself all the time. You will be better at seeing problems as challenges to overcome. If you can confidently and honestly tell a woman you don&#39;t watch porn because you felt it was affecting you negatively she will LOVE that. QUIT PORN. YOU CAN DO IT. Sure... there&#39;re days when it&#39;s really hard... it does get easier but it won&#39;t be easy. Work through it, get stronger mentally and just from this task alone you will be tougher than most guys out there.", "comment_date": "2022-07-20T22:53:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Benjam\u00edn Enrique", "comment_text": "just try to think about the effects of mixing porn, social media, gaming, junk food, alcohol, drugs, all together.<br><br>The XXI society is unintentionally killing brains", "comment_date": "2022-07-20T15:50:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan S\u00e1nchez", "comment_text": "Does watching porn videos affects the same way to the brain as watching images?", "comment_date": "2022-07-20T04:26:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eris", "comment_text": "I just look at it when I want to sometimes    <br>Going 1or 2 moths without it", "comment_date": "2022-07-19T23:16:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel", "comment_text": "I did quit porn but idk how my discord friends literally byypass and send literally 40 minutes of porn", "comment_date": "2022-07-18T10:53:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cannon fodder", "comment_text": "Porn is a weapon. Each time porn is viewed, brain damage is incurred by a flood of synthetically generated dopamine.

Porn also disconnects the viewer from reality and degrades the relationship between men and women, making it easier to control the population.

I myself have recently quit porn I wasn&#39;t overly obsessed and I don&#39;t think I qualify for PPU. But porn use is definitely an issue it&#39;s a constant in our mainstream culture and especially considering every day we become more and more disassociated with other people, because of the technology we have in our pockets 24/7 we&#39;re becoming more and more socially isolated creating unrealistic expectations to fill up the free time. Honestly if you want to make noticeable and identifiable change for whatever reason maybe you&#39;re an alcoholic or have PTSD or sexual trauma quitting porn can seriously help I&#39;ve definitely noticed good mental changes I further encourage people to measure their heart rate and seek blood pressure medication to relax their heart as best they can not sure if this is scientific but accelerated heart rate can make you more impulsive further increasing your porn use and decreasing it can actually benefit you in many ways mentally and physically alongside quitting porn. I&#39;ve quit porn and been taking heart rate medication and so far I&#39;ve gone for a few days now and I must say I&#39;m a much happier person I get better grades in school and I&#39;m more attentive and caring to other people rather than being cold and distant. I definitely think some of it is a placebo but even if it is it genuinely helps me feel like a better person and I think that&#39;s good no matter what. (Note: I haven&#39;t quit masturbation and I don&#39;t expect anyone to do so anytime soon considering the numerous studies proving it is a healthy and non-intrusive sexual pass time as long as it&#39;s not obsessive blocking your daily life much like porn use.) <br><br>Needless to say I believe quitting porn is a difficult challenge but helpful in the long run you look at people you would&#39;ve never thought were attractive and suddenly become interested. I definitely encourage people to try quitting porn and if you relapse it&#39;s okay, just start over and work on it. Change is challenging and often painful process but in the long run you&#39;ll be a much happier person. (2nd note: I&#39;m not doing this for any religious or vendetta against porn use I&#39;ve used it for many years and just decided to quit one day and I in no means an expert.

He didn&#39;t want Heaven without you so he gave up his life on the cross and rose again. When he did that, he justified us with God, and he paid the full price of our sins, we just need to accept the gift he has given us. To accept this gift, you need to confess that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that he rose again and you will be saved. Romans 10:9-11 says, &quot;9 If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. 11 As the Scriptures tell us, \u201cAnyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.\u201d&quot; . Jesus is coming back, not to be happy with everyone, but rather he is coming to get his bride, the people of Christ. Jesus will not be coming back in the desert or in secret chambers, HE will be coming back on the CLOUDS! Be ready people, turn to him and repent of your sins.

Until, initiative; a materialization of the gravitational manifest of &quot;office&quot;, (oneselves psychological apex), and it&#39;s now untenable duty unto reality.

It&#39;s contrast therein unlived. Rectified both are, through our mutations of selfless activity. Not us remaining, within the usurped plateau of a striation of stature, for it&#39;s lethargy as an unfolding of mental incongruities intensifys our emotional fatigue through any unguided opioidal &quot;faucet and wheel&quot; complexity, as our unfettered and mystifying saturation stands us in a multidimensional dereliction of capacity. This, our deteriorating caustic state, presently a reworking of noble conduit (fanciful undeath by nostalgia) as the identity complex of ourselves (those immersed), quests for a &quot;divinity&quot;, already imagined and ordained through the subversive vulgarities within peaked scripture or lilt. For this, instead, we must reside as victors, and become such mobility as to relate its crucible, without implacable intermediaries. Of this query, a positive known if seamless, enters time, thus we gain truth, the factual glean in a contrasting of all quandaries. Through this, your admittedly pored discipline, (the atlas of agony), starts a now kinetic (responsively so) ethereal symbiosis of maturity. Your masculinity, forgiving prior defeats presently, in the spirit of a multi-faceted endeavor; a worthy future of battling a perfect crisis. Undergoing thy own scrutiny and palpable inversions of natural binary: A portrait, mentally manifest in masterful notation of an exponential activity, and it&#39;s sentient measure, our own.

An option made, retaken. Thus, our re-configuration of the duality in hemispheres past and present, function in a cycle marked as: truth (dignity) versus immemory and it&#39;s renewal (indignation).

In other words it gets harder and harder to find particular kinds of porn to scratch the itch. And at that point I seek out other things that are not so boring and do that for few hrs a day every day for a week or two. Till porn becomes exciting again. Then I switch back to that. Basically my brain doesn&#39;t care so long as it&#39;s something that is extremely enjoyable. Like binge watching my favorite tv shows. Or binge reading erotica stories for a week or two. Or sometimes becoming fascinated with learning about every detail about something new almost to a obsessive degree. Some times I&#39;ll just get bored with myself mentally. Like I will just go online and become friends with someone and learn everything about them how they think, how they rationalize, what makes them tick. Till I get bored with them and then go seek something else that I haven&#39;t focused on in a wile. I don&#39;t think any of this is bad or not healthy. I am not self absorbed, I&#39;m not rude to others, i work, i pay my bills I socialize when I want to. And I&#39;m not depressed or anything like that.

So I went back to the megachurch because I sent an email \ud83d\udce7 to a Pastor of the megachurch I attended at that time and he said he wouldn\u2019t be in his office for another week. I approached that same Pastor and told him I did a DTS with YWAM and he said \u201cHeck ya you did!\u201d Then I asked if he wanted to talk about it, he rudely said \u201cNo I\u2019m tired of hearing about DTS\u2019\u201d THAT shocked me, I left that church \u26ea\ufe0f ASAP, the moment I left, the porn addiction left. But years later like a retard I attended that church again, the addiction came back and I attended a small group where I got bullied and discriminated against by a guy who I thought was a friend, I left the Church \u26ea IMMEDIATELY after the new young adults pastor did NOTHING. I still To this day don\u2019t go back to that Church \u26ea, I refuse to talk to anyone from that Church \u26ea\ufe0f unless if it\u2019s someone I knew for years since childhood. The porn addiction has gone away, do I occasionally watch it? Sure but I\u2019m still conquering the occasional part. I like smaller churches \u26ea better and hopefully I\u2019ll be leaving the State I\u2019m in next year since being traumatize.

For us who wants to give this up for good, we must treat every day like NNN!<br><br>What\u2019s going on so far:<br>1. I no longer feel embarrassed and insecure because I am doing something society would consider taboo.<br>2. As the days go by, I get more and more motivated not to relapse as I see myself travel further in time away from when I last performed these acts. I\u2019m guessing this is a personal thing as I find that I can motivate myself.<br>3. My mind is noticeably clearer and more focused now. I no longer stumble over my thoughts and actions and can process instructions more quickly. This helps a lot, especially as I am studying right now. I feel more energetic too. I also no longer have sexual dreams.<br>4. To be honest, I get anxious and scared that I will relapse whenever the occasional female sexual stimuli pop up on social media and the internet and when I see females in the community with revealing clothing. Hopefully, it gets better as time goes by.<br><br>What I have been doing to prevent relapse:<br>1. In my country, internet porn is blocked, so I used a VPN to access them. So I deleted the VPN. <br>2. Whenever sexual stimuli like ads or posts appear on social media, I click \u201cNot interested\u201d so that little to none of this content will appear. Whenever I see females with revealing clothing, I immediately look away so as not to get tempted.<br>3. I developed mechanisms to remove the thoughts of watching porn and masturbating. I started working out more frequently, embarked on a weight loss journey, and led a healthier lifestyle. Diversions are significant.<br><br>One important thing I\u2019ve learnt so far is that when we want to quit something, we must find something that can divert our thoughts away from it. It\u2019s effective, trust me.<br><br>And the ULTIMATE, PARAMOUNT, IMPORTANT THING IS WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE QUITTING, THINK ABOUT WHY YOU STARTED<br><br>What I just shared is what happened to me and what works for me. We\u2019re all different, but I hope my story can help all of us in this journey.<br><br>We can do this, everyone! We can stop once and for all!

It can be difficult at first, but I think keeping the possibility of bettering your mental health and life in general in mind can be a great motivator for those trying to quit.

However on carnivore diet, withdrawals symptoms are more tolerable, not as intense as I&#39;ve read other non-carnivore folks describe them. That&#39;s not to say it was a cakewalk, it certainly wasn&#39;t. You have to be committed, make lifestyle changes, exercise,  replace old habits with meaningful activities to avoid relapsing. The worst symptom for me was the fatigue (besides the really bad anxiety and depression which i already had prior to quitting). At least 1 year of varying degrees of fatigue. <br><br>I also quit cannabis a few years later (also on carnivore diet) and the symptoms definitely were less pronounced. I was a heavy cannabis user for years. I did not even experience insomnia which is almost universal in heavy users that quit cold turkey. <br><br>I can&#39;t recommend the carnivore diet enough.

Keep yourself occupied and busy so that you don&#39;t do it. Unfortunately, many people watch porn before sleeping, which is a huge problem when you feel the urge when you&#39;re ready to go to bed. What do you do? I haven&#39;t tried it, but I think taking melatonin might help for the first few days so that you just go night night instead of laying there with your loins burning. Other than that, those who feel the urge throughout the day, replace it with something else. PLAN to do something else when those urges arise, or plan to do something that keeps you occupied throughout the day. However, whatever it is you end up doing, try to do something that would not make it easy to access it anyways. For example, hanging out on or near your phone or computer is not a good idea. Furthermore, being alone is probably not the best idea either. You&#39;re less likely to go on pornhub if your mom is in the room and if your phone is nowhere near you.

Why? Especially when your average looking and shy. You will ask yourself what that has to do with quitting porn right? Well, as an average guy you will experience more rejections than the handsome guy. You will have a harder time dating girls, while seeing how easy it is for the handsome and attractive guys. They seem to have no problem dating girls. It fucks your self esteem up and it makes you depressed. Especially when you work on yourself and  build up the courage to approach  cute girls and get rejected and found later that they have a crush on other handsome guys. I get that looks matter. Its a fact. I have nothing against that. Its a sad reality for a lot of men nowadays.  Thats where the PORN comes in. Porn is like a perfect escape from reality, a best friend who never says no and welcomes you whenever you feel sad and lonely. Little that we know is that its TOXIC! Whenever we come across a cute girl, the voices in our head are saying &quot; Dont bother, you will  get rejected&quot;, &quot; She will never like you back&quot;, &quot; You are not attractive enough&quot;, &quot;Why bother when you already know whats going to happen&quot;. &quot; You cant get her, she is out of your league!&quot;...  eventually we go back to watch porn and feel like shit afterwards. This is a cycle that many of us  men struggle with. What makes it worse is that we cant talk about it. We feel ashamed. Other guys will laugh at us, women will look down on us. This leads to a deeper level of depression. <br><br>That being said, I still work hard on breaking that cycle. I lost count on how many times i tried to quit. Sometimes I managed to reach 2 weeks, 3 weeks. Sometimes not even a week, haha. My longest was 41 days. But i will never give up!<br><br>Brothers, we need to keep supporting each other.

I&#39;m still not out of the woodworks, but here&#39;s some advice:<br>-You absolutely need an accountability partner. No buts. This is an absolute necessity. This needs to be someone that you can trust, and that will be available for you. i.e., they should live in the same area as you and be able to see you if you need help.<br>-Get your phone/laptop out of your bedroom. Buy a physical alarm clock. Never use your phone/laptop in your bedroom.<br>-Your brain will crave dopamine from porn. If you want to stop, you have to get that dopamine elsewhere. So when you feel tempted, do something that&#39;ll make you feel good. Personally, I&#39;ll pray and then take a walk for 15 minutes or so. Going outside really helps, since you&#39;re literally just removing yourself from the tempting situation. What&#39;s important is that you do this AS SOON AS you feel tempted. <br><del>Don&#39;t just quit porn</del> also quit lusting after other people in the street. Don&#39;t stare at their boobs or muscles or butts or anything. Get those thoughts out of your head if you can avoid it. This is also just good in that you&#39;re not objectifying anybody.<br>-Come up with a system that will remind you to pray every morning and every night (if you&#39;re not religious, then meditate or something, idk). <br>-Be social. Hang out w/ friends. If you feel like you might fail, invite someone over and just have a good time.<br>-Exercise. This has tons of benefits, obviously, but it&#39;ll especially help you to feel relaxed, energetic, and satisfied. Most people relapse when they feel lonely, depressed, stressed, or tired. Exercise helps mitigate all of those feelings. Basically you want to replace porn with something good. (this goes for the hanging out w/ friends thing too)<br>-Get something that blocks access to porn sites in some way. (I use Covenant Eyes, you have to pay for it but it&#39;s super worth it)<br>And if you fail, get back up and try again. No worries.

Then add another day so now Tuesday becomes Wednesday as if you failed. The idea is to try and stop so even if you didn&#39;t fap on your day,  you treat passing as failing.

Instead focusing on other parts of my day, especially getting to the gym in the morning, then heading to work, then finally do some cardio after work (like walking), then coming home and making food. By that time my mind is tired and thinking about watching some Netflix or playing video games to zone out. Or even reading books (best one). Then sleep. At times my brain tries to trick me to think about porn again, but I&#39;m become good at zoning it out of my mind again. The longer you stay away, the easier it becomes. Especially when you are proud of how long you&#39;ve stayed away it. Best of luck. And again, the key is to stop giving importance to it.

This addiction is not like with hunger where you eat food so that hunger is satiated and then it&#39;s back to a normal cycle. It&#39;s rather about reproduction and in evolutionary terms you can&#39;t micro dose that because genes are at stake.<br>Simulation (to imagine to self) using the neo-cortex (all the higher cognitive faculties) is not what the brain had evolved to do.
