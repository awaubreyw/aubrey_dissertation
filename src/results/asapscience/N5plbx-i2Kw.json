The theory is as follows:<br>The hairs on the side and back of the head are subjected to high pressures during the night when we sleep for about 8 hrs during and entire life. The pressure is caused when you lean your head on the pillow, this pressure sends the hairs deeper inside the follicles and roots them more firmly in place. You often roll on the pillow left and right during the whole night creating pressure around the head, however, on the top and front of the head you NEVER put pressure; for that reason I hypnotize that the lack of pressure on top of the head is the cause of hair loss.

You only release insulin when your body needs to break down sugars and when you release insulin your liver also release IGF-1.
