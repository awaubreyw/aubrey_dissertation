I even offered to drive him and go in with him and that insulted him. He has called me up and never does unless he wants something from me or wants to let me have it. Boy, he called me up on several occasions and blasted me while I was in a store shopping and told me off in a rage and then tells that all he ever gets from me is nothing good that if he looks at his FB messenger he thinks oh no. He  said all of those times he fussed at me that I was the reason that his blood pressure is up. Asked me silly questions blaming me. Well, he can go somewhere ever single day of the week so why can&#39;t he just simply do this one thing? He said, oh well probating is the easy part, executing it is other. What in the world am I going to do? He a terrible HOARDER as well. Just piles up things so you have to climb over everything. Refuses to throw out most things. You should see him room and the rest of the house is getting that way, it is disgusting. I love my brother but I can&#39;t take this behaviour. I have to send everything via Messenger because he stays in his room most of the time and will not sit down and speak to you in person. He would do the same thing to our Dad when he was alive. My Dad would say, I wish he would just come in here and talk to me, he comes to the end of the hall for a few seconds and then goes back to his room. My Dad needed his son to talk to and my brother never liked talking for very long to my Dad, my Dad loved to talk for hours on end and my Brother is the opposite.

So, choose a habit to change (e.g. getting up by at least 9am every morning) and stick to it religiously. After about 3 weeks, it&#39;s become habit, and you can move on to the next habit to kick.<br><br>The key is to not choose 10 habits to kick at the same time. You&#39;ll get overwhelmed and discouraged when you miss one, and then kick the entire concept.<br><br>My personal tip in addition to the above: When I&#39;m on a study break and am starting in on a YouTube marathon despite saying ONLY TWO VIDEOS, get up and walk down the stairs.
