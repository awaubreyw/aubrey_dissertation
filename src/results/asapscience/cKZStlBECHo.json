Also, R.E.M. sleep which helps us not act out our dreams. Dreaming, I don&#39;t know why we do it, but there has to be a reason. If we&#39;ll ever find out, who knows. Hopefully we can and I can&#39;t wait until we do. They&#39;re fascinating. Just millions of other little things like that. Also, I find it weird that when I look at my hand, and I just control it without even thinking, that just really gets to me for some reason. Try it. Which is why I believe in God.

Also what happens if you wake up a sleep walker? ~Thanks.", "comment_date": "2013-01-09T04:15:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate Johnson", "comment_text": "So are kangaroos like the biggest sluts ever?", "comment_date": "2013-01-09T04:08:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JayBeproductions", "comment_text": "Mind raped me.", "comment_date": "2013-01-09T04:07:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesus Rodriguez", "comment_text": "What the science behind batman???", "comment_date": "2013-01-09T04:02:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amy Joy", "comment_text": "How much oxygen do you breathe in a life time?", "comment_date": "2013-01-09T03:55:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dizzle502", "comment_text": "The octopus is smart he rather not have to deal with the extra bull", "comment_date": "2013-01-09T03:55:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Jara", "comment_text": "Wait what were u talking about the peanut butter", "comment_date": "2013-01-09T03:50:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrLuisbonilla202", "comment_text": "What is &quot;up&quot;?
