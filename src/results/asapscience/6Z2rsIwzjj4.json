Since the meeting is at noon (12), and saying that it has been \u201cmoved forward 2 hours\u201d, most people would think 10 because its earlier in the day, the only reason anyone would think it\u2019s been moved to 2 is if they perceived the question more along the lines of \u201cthe meeting has been moved BACK 2 hours\u201d causing them to realize that the word back more nearly means to postpone the meeting 2 hours, when forwards means to bring closer. Two people could read the same question and get 2 different answers. It\u2019s like the whole \u201cglass half empty\u201d question.

It goes from top to bottom, 12am-12pm in the middle which is noon. And then noon to the bottom which is 12 am again. <br> This is standard, top to bottom. With the mowing being above the evening. So if you move something \u201cup\u201d in that schedule, it is happening earlier than planned. <br><br><br>Just like 1 o\u2019clock is experienced or perceived chronologically as before, earlier or first, compared to 2 o clock. <br>Forward and back must have a connotation that defines them chronologically. When you are thinking only of yourself in time, reference being your memory of things chronologically, \u201cback\u201d is behind you. Like \u201cremember back then. But it can only define any number of infinite moments before \u201cnow\u201d. And \u201cmoving forward\u201d cannot define a specific moment on its own either, only any and all moments following this one. Unless specified. <br><br>But if you think of an abstract meeting as yourself and move it based on if you were in it, you would again think \u201cback\u201d means before it\u2019s destined moment. And forward means after. <br><br>But a meeting is not a living thing, and cannot perceive time as past or present in relation to itself because it only exists for a moment. <br><br>Until it is happening it is always in the future, once it passes it is forever in the past. Unlike humans, who exist now, as well as having a history. And as far as we know, we exist in the foreseeable future as well unless we suddenly die.<br><br>Therefore you can\u2019t ascribe a perspective  to an abstract like a meeting, because the meeting itself does not think for itself. You must think for it in your own perspective as must the other invitees, in order to conceptualize when to attend it. Which is what we use clocks and schedules for. A clock has no end. It simply moves \u201cforward with time\u201d or clockwise as we perceive it. But if you had to go \u201cback in time\u201d the clock would have to go counter clockwise as you perceive it. So you have gone back in time. <br><br>But the meeting cannot perceive time. It is where ever we want it to be and is not bound to continuity until it has happened. It moves in relation to those who perceive it being us. As the meeting gets closer, it moves \u201cup\u201d in priority, it moves \u201cforward\u201d from the perspective of those who perceive it as near or far chronologically. That is us. <br><br>To move something back in relation to yourself is like shuffling cards and putting one in the back of the deck, meaning that chronologically, you will pull that card last because you placed the others in front of it. If you move \u201cup\u201d in a line or queue, you have gotten closer to the action point. If you go to the \u201cback of the line, you are at the end and will be served last. <br><br>In English, \u201cback\u201d is a negative and forward is a positive. In relation to what is important: perspective, back is further away, and so as we approach something in time, if it moves \u201cback\u201d, it\u2019s imperative is to get \u201cfurther\u201d away from a point where it is perceived. Only organisms can perceive, so the point is imperatively our present. <br><br>The reason why we are moving toward it and it is not getting closer to us is because I\u2019m physics, movement is defined by perspective on a line or plane. <br><br>If something that is defined and doesn\u2019t usually move like an event, is what is moving then it implies that we are stationary or moving towards it to meet it. We perceive time as linear and exist for a Stretch of time.<br><br> An event is but a point from our perspective. Such that in all of time which certainly exists, we are but a point in its infinite stretch. A point does not grow or stretch once it has ended, so from our perspective as a line, the point must approach us, pass through us as it is perceived, and then leave us for the past, no longer perceptible to the present except in memory.<br><br>Just like if we were moving through the 1rst dimension. An object gets bigger as it gets closer, then shrinks into nothingness after it passes out of perspective which is also our event horizon. It came forward because it was approaching. It went back as we watched it leave us. <br><br>The language neccesitates this meaning. There would be no point of \u201cforward\u201d or back if you and I were equal to time it\u2019self and a 20 minute meeting. That suggests you, me, the meeting, and time itself are all privileged chess pieces on a board. <br><br>But in reality, the way we understand time, physics and perspective, means that events are squares, clear and defined, you and I are pawns moving forwards and never back wards according to the rules of the game (laws of the universe) and the board is time itself.

And after years of missing things and special days, I&#39;ve learned to (mostly) remember scheduling events and setting reminders days out, especially if I need to do something like buy a present. I have to schedule work tasks and time them to fit them together in a productivity type of plan, for project management but also because it gives me a counter I can reference.<br><br>I&#39;ve tried this exercise a few times and the results have been the same.
