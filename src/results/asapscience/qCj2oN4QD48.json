Roughly half an hour ago, I was crying endlessly, after having a panic attack, and loosing a lot of my energy to the point where I collapsed. It was horrid- due to a mental health problem. As soon as I was stable enough to walk, my mind went to this, and I played it as quickly as I could. It was so soothing. Sure, the compound formulas are basic, but familiar, which is very nice and calming to see after being so overwhelmed. The sound, the colours, it was all so calming that soon the panic diminished, and my breathing rate returned to normal. This is a really soothing video to me, and I assure you, though it may not be your favourite video, it is useful to others, so instead of bickering on about how boring this was to you, and that it&#39;s useless, then this video just wasn\u2019t created with you as an audience. Just as it isn\u2019t your type of video, don&#39;t go complaining about it, for it certainly is others.

I thought for a moment that too much pause was given from the time that you introduce the information: fuel source, oxidizing agent,heat. However, because I know that learning requires repetition and processing... what we call in\u00a0the education &quot;metacognitive processing&quot;, I found myself repeating the list until I felt I remembered it. Luckily, each time that I thought I might forget, the visual aide that helped me to say like a mantra &quot;fuel source, oxidizing agent, heat&quot; was still on the screen. Then as it changed to additional information about how a wood fire (which I know from extensive past experience) you added that wood only requires heat and a fuel source, I internalized that, of course, the oxidizing factor would come from the air. Quick diversion, I will spend time in graduate school writing out transcripts like this but I know otherwise it may seem out of place. To the producers of this video I want to say, I think you have hit a nice balance between informing your audience and allowing them to reflect. I hope that other educators, probably better middle and upper grades, realize you are an interesting provider of educational resources.
