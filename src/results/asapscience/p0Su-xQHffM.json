I ricorrenti avevano considerato illegittimo il fatto che  l\u2019Agenzia del Farmaco e la Regione, pur ammettendo l\u2019utilizzo di tali farmaci per detta patologia, ne subordinassero tuttavia  l\u2019impiego all\u2019attestazione della patologia stessa attraverso un tampone positivo e reiterato, compromettendo in questo modo la tempestivit\u00e0 e l\u2019efficacia delle cure. Nella sentenza si legge peraltro che la Regione, nella propria memoria, ha dichiarato: \u201cil rilievo \u00e8 comunque superato con la nota 382588 del 28-04-2020 che consente la suddetta prescrizione sotto la diretta responsabilit\u00e0 del clinico prescrittore seppur in assenza di tampone positivo, proprio in virt\u00f9 di uno spazio innegabile di discrezionalit\u00e0 scientifica nell&#39;erogare la prestazione in scienza e coscienza e per l&#39;innegabile diretta conoscenza del paziente&quot;. Se le parole hanno un senso, questa dichiarazione della Regione Lazio significa che i medici prescrittori, anche non specialisti, possono utilizzare i farmaci sopra indicati senza sottoporre il paziente al tampone. Non solo, la stessa AIFA, in una sua memoria, ha ammesso di non aver mai inteso  limitare la libert\u00e0 del singolo medico di prescrivere off label il farmaco, riaffermando quindi implicitamente il principio dell\u2019autonomia e della responsabilit\u00e0 del medico nel prescrivere una cura che egli ritenga appropriata per i suoi pazienti. <br><br>Per quanto sopra, non appare quindi immotivata la decisione del TAR, il quale ha dichiarato inammissibile il ricorso cautelare per \u201ccarenza di interesse\u201d. La decisione \u00e8 stata comunque impugnata dinanzi al Consiglio di Stato, che ha rimesso la causa e il definitivo giudizio di merito allo stesso TAR. <br><br>Ritengo in ogni caso che il TAR  non potr\u00e0 sovvertire nel merito quanto ha  gi\u00e0 accertato nel giudizio cautelare sulla base delle memorie di AIFA e Regione Lazio, vale a dire che i medici di base potranno prescrivere ai propri pazienti, sia la idrossiclorochina che gli altri farmaci in esame, rivelatisi efficaci anche per la cura iniziale del Covid-19.", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T09:00:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deas vearest", "comment_text": "Gracias al Dr. osaze que me cur\u00f3 a m\u00ed y a toda mi familia del virus corona con su medicamento a base de hierbas en siete d\u00edas, covid casi elimin\u00f3 a mi familia, tambi\u00e9n puede comunicarse con el Dr. osaze en su correo electr\u00f3nico: drosazeherbal@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a> o WhatsApp en +2347089275769", "comment_date": "2020-12-25T07:06:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emily Marshall", "comment_text": "Hi I&#39;m Emily I am a 10year old kid and my parents have colvid 19 and I Don&#39;t my Dad has Been Drinking and spoking so has my mom if your wordering how they got it they didn&#39;t where there mask like I Did and spent time with friends and Dad got it Bc he Didn&#39;t where is mask at work now I&#39;m isolating with my parents take colvid", "comment_date": "2020-12-22T00:48:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Suede S", "comment_text": "now its been 9 months and they have created a vaccine and testing it in humans", "comment_date": "2020-12-16T15:56:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "murry alex", "comment_text": "I was diagnosed with Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) 3 years ago.

Due to this coronavirus disease, we have lost loved ones, families, friends, and it has created broken hearts. My husband&#39;s symptoms began a month ago after he fell ill and decided to get tested for COVID-19 after he returned from a trip to London. The test came back positive and he was taken to a specialized facility to receive medical care, his case was among the serious and critical type, we think he will be gone soon but with Homeocure Worldwide herbal medicine, he has finally recovered. He remained at an isolation ward until last weeks\u00a0when he was discharged following his permanent recovery. I&#39;m really grateful that my soulmate is still alive, there is a wealth of knowledge that is openly accessible in nature. For those that have the symptoms, my humble and honest advice for you will be to contact Dr. Markus Maur (drmakusm@gmail.com) for more information and consultation. At times, asking for help can also lead to the path of healing. Constantly protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.

Many doctors had great success on a large scale administering it to hundreds of patients and seeing rapid drop off in virus. <br><br>Shortages will be addressed with production ramps that are already ongoing, it is being administered in hospitals for more serious cases. <br>The only takeaway there is that it should not be used for mild cases at least for now to ensure supply.<br><br>As to side effects - these involve build up of the drug over time. What is glaringly Not mentioned is that its use as a preventative over months does Not apply in treatments done over 2 weeks or so and the side effects are unlikely in the extreme to manifest so quickly unless patients are overdosed. All (well known) side effects can be easily avoided in any case by monitoring dosage.<br><br>Its current recommended use - severe cases while supplies are low - not an issue as suggested here. <br>Its side effects - not an issue when used as a treatment rather than a preventative - not an issue as suggested here. <br>Using drugs off-label is far less risky than pre-mature use of new drugs as the mechanism and side effects (if any) are well established - in this case over the course of 50+ years. <br><br>The short version: Thousands of people are currently dying who could be saved at very, very minimal risk with Chloriquine + Zinc + antibiotics  for secondary effects. <br><br>Telling people something that is clearly working, requires strenuous testing when there is no risk (50 years of experience) and people are dying, is not helpful.

There are a great many doctors now reporting substantial success, I have heard of none indicating otherwise save a few early studies where it was used with out antibiotics or zinc.

The instability is the worse setting to work and make progress on science. Most of scientist here waste a lot of their time wondering if the next month they&#39;ll have the scholarship coming, if they&#39;ll have the money to eat or pay the bills. And they waste their time frustrated with the discredit and disdain the president and the general public treat their work here, I can see we&#39;re not alone. Seeing all that happening makes me realize that&#39;s something we&#39;re missing about the scientific communication. Me and a social scientist I just met, but we already have the same intent to make science great again (pun intended) joined forces in-between papers and social distancing to brainstorm a way for that happening. We really want to change the way the scientific community takes place in our society and we really want to reach the general public, and it doesn&#39;t depend on the scientific area.

The Chinese didn&#39;t give out samples or much reliable information and still haven&#39;t (surprise?) but they did release a transcript of the RNA. Rumour has it that it ends in 33 A&#39;s. Is this a genuine viral joke? Our researchers in Melbourne, Vic, Aus took that transcript and engineered a sample of the new upgraded strain from a Corona virus they just happened to have in the lab and had worked on. They did it in a few desperate days. Yes, it wasn&#39;t accidental. There are biolabs doing work all over the world. Most low key. Most inadequately funded. Not all doing military research. This engineered sample was circulated. Our Brisbane lab in Qld. Aus. took it up and after relentless heroic efforts over several days and nights came up with a vaccine candidate which is now being trialled on an expedited basis. The Canadian team are congratulating themselves that they came up with a vaccine candidate in some 9 or 10 days. Dream on little Canada. The world must be a disappointing place for you. The British aren&#39;t saying. The Americans definitely not. Probably for security reasons, of cource...or so I&#39;d like to start the rumour. Try to work it out for yourself. All vaccine candidates are going into fast track testing. Help is on the way. We will do better in the future. Fast mass deployable blood testing has already been pioneered in several places including here in Aus and are being rushed into widespread use. We will be able to screen and test millions for any new disease at short enough notice to make a difference. Our national health and response strategies have had to be revolutionised. Our disaster preparedness likewise. In the wake of this many countries will have to drag their health establishments and/or Health Administrations kicking and screaming into the 21st century. We&#39;ll have the tools and the systems to quickly counter future outbreaks as a result of this nuisance of a corona virus. This goes for the future possible outbreaks be they relatively minor like this one or of the mass disaster levels of the Justinian plague, the Black Death or the 1919 so called &#39;Spanish&#39; flu. Incidentally about this last we now know the deadly pandemic flu was probably brought to a US army camp with a recruit from rural Iowa or Arkansas or some such place and exported to the war and the world with the US Army as they rushed to join the mass slaughter. Charge bravely into deadly immune reaction storms anyone? Similar with this novel corona virus I&#39;m told only with the old with mature immune systems rather than the young, vigorous and healthy for a change. On such accidents turns history. Ask about how native peoples around the world fared with the coming of measles, mumps, small pox, colds, flu and christian missionaries to name a few disastrous pathogens if you&#39;ve got the stomach for it. Anyway the world will survive. Our job is to hang on as long as we can. We adapt desperately lest we perish. We are passengers not overlords. A touch of humility wouldn&#39;t go astray. Consider that just a few years ago we would not have had the communications, the lab techniques, the tools, the expertise, the analytics and the methods and the knowledge to do this well. Hopefully Governments won&#39;t cut funding for research in the wake of this outbreak when things settle down again as they have time after time in the past. Hopefully large corporations might take an interest in investing in new treatments for disease or be induced to. Hope for hope.

It would be sensible take his results seriously...and the effective use of chloroquin and hydroxychloroquin against corona viruses was well known and published in the wake of SARS and MERS... this hasn&#39;t been worked on much since... and the US Govt pulled money out of the medical research into viruses and the pioneering of possible treatments for same well before the 2016 election... otherwise we might not have been in quite as bigger mess as we currently are...you may want to check on the French results again and perhaps revise your reporting just a little bit. Both these are old established drugs and off patent. If they do work as well as the latest trial that the French are reporting there would be not much profit for the  multinational pharmaceutical corporations but at least their production could be freely ramped up to industrial wartime levels and it would be comparatively cheap to do so. The Italians not to be outdone are claiming that the pairing of a more modern and still proprietary anti-inflammatory which is used against gout is up to 4 times more effective than hydroxychloroquin which others claim is 4 times more effective than chloroquin. The studies will make things clearer. At this time people are being treated and getting better. Lives are being saved. As far as the antivirals I&#39;m told that remdesivir wasn&#39;t that effective against ebola but was successfully paired with hydroxychloroquin and seemed to work very well on the first very sick people to arrive in Brisbane, Qld, Aus after the year of the rat celebrations... thanks CCP....people did get better... clinical trials are underway. With modern running statistical analysis we will know soon. According to literature any of the quinine derivatives are supposed to mainly work as ionosphores, giving zinc ions a passage into cells... zinc being not a RNA virus&#39; favourite ingredient. A small German lab team had a nucleotide based treatment similar to remdesivir ready to go to try on ebola but were pushed aside when the US Army Medical Corps arrived with their monoclonal antibodies. Since then in an effort to attract the interest of pharmaceutical investors they have worked on to produce treatment options for a wider range of RNA viruses. These new antivirals are aimed to work to stop the virus making the two big proteins which split into some sixteen different parts which make up the molecular machinery which the virus replicates itself with, not just dumping a dummy nucleotide base into the viral RNA copy to lock it as antivirals such as Remdesivir are purported to do. In other words this team out of Germany think they think they have a broad spectrum treatment against all RNA viruses known, Ebola, Cold, Corona, Hand Foot and Mouth, whatever. They may have a cure for the common cold but so far the pharmaceutical corporations don&#39;t seem to be interested. Something about not being good for the stock/share price some would say. The story goes that the lead researcher of the German team was invited to fly into China with samples of his precious molecules. He served his two weeks of quarantine but then the Chinese blew up in fury over some idiot&#39;s misreport on the internet that he had taken &#39;new drugs&#39; into China to try on sick patients. He was flown out without having seen a patient. Who knows? There are lots of good stories being told about the goings on and off around this latest corona outbreak. There are a lot of tales told, misinformation, misstatements, legends and fictions galore being circulated for a variety of reasons and purposes. Conspiracies abound. Real and imagined. For instance the Chinese are well known for their spying and intellectual property theft. They would have insisted on samples to test. They could be working diligently on cures even at this moment. There&#39;s a delicious rumour circulating in spook circles (often misleadingly called &#39;Intelligence Agencies&#39;) that this time the low despicable detestable sneaking immoral conscienceless Chinese may have stolen a booby trap and got the lethal strain (nCOVID-19l?) of novel corona virus vintage 2019. The precise beauty of this &#39;fiction&#39; as such a psyops rumour is talked about in such circles is that the Chinese have to take it seriously true or not. The Chinese spy and steal all the time. Two Harvard professors were arrested for their espionage activities for fun and profit with the Chinese. So was at least one other professor from the west coast arrested. The Canadians aren&#39;t saying much. They could be similarly embarrassed. The brilliant Chinese grad student did turn out to be a member of the PLA. Was she a stunningly gorgeous lady? That would at least fit the narrative. So far the proposed lethal strain being followed by the weaker strain to hit the target area and then protect the broader area and your own troops as you invade is straight bioweapon theory. The Chinese have two biolabs in Wuhan. One closer to the infamous wet market where live wild animals are chopped up for meat. It&#39;s cultural. The plot sickens. One Level 4 lab is further away. A Chinese study says bats are not sold or eaten in that market. Nothing on Pangolins yet. Chinese lab workers are renown for their meticulous hygiene and strict adherence to the best biohazard protection protocols. The lower paid are also often also addicted to cigarettes. Anyway mistakes happen. I make no judgement. Feel free to speculate. We have plenty of time while obediently cowering in cover. The imagination runs wild. The probability is that this new virus is a natural cross over from the lesser horseshoe bat to the pangolin to humans. Possibly recently. Chinese poor public health and hygiene habits guarantees that some new viruses will be spawned, take hold and spread. This new latest and greatest corona virus is just the next to emerge. It&#39;s just a sheer coincidence that this new corona spreads well hands to face and is so particularly dangerous for the Han in its original form. Don&#39;t believe the Chinese numbers. There are lots of stories surrounding this present mess. Good and bad. The pharmaceutical corporations are keen to push new and more expensive proprietary solutions bringing big profits for them. They would be all too keen to downplay talk of cheaper old established drug options. And have. Our testing was hopeless. The WHO worse than useless. Insurance companies run the US Hospital system. They shut down 12 Hospitals in the New York area alone over the past few years. Hospitals around the world have been paired down to the minimum for good times in an era of good public health standards. In our era blessed with peace and prosperity supply chains have been put on just in time ordering from everything from the ingredients for medicines to toilet paper...enough said. National Health Authorities are in the grip or at least heavily under the influence of the same proprietary interests all over. As is the chain of registering for new treatments. We&#39;re just not prepared for disaster. Corporate geniuses have outsourced vital industries to China. Yes, the Chinese CCP rulers did it. They&#39;re culpable. They&#39;re guilty of a lot but we did it to ourselves too. The inept efforts of Health Authorities at the start of this outbreak have been a debacle. The US Administration have been forced to cut red tape and bureaucratic inertia both and put  the country on a wartime footing. A lot will change. People have lived in times so easy that they have been able to indulge in the luxury of idle speculation about the existence of invisible imaginary gods including the problematic god of imaginary man made global warming and whether cow flatulence would destroy the world. Or that bacon might be bad. Or that vegans are sensible etc, etc...In these tougher times that are upon us they can worry about realer things.

Is This Artificial Life? <br>In a milestone for synthetic biology, colonies of E. coli thrive with DNA constructed from scratch by humans, not nature.\u201d<br><br>\u201cFor about 100 years, the scientifi c community has repeatedly changed its collective mind over what viruses are. First seen as poisons, then as life-forms, then biological chemicals, viruses today are thought of as being in a gray area between living and nonliving: they cannot replicate on their own but can do so in truly living cells and can also affect the behavior of their hosts profoundly. The categorization of viruses as nonliving during much of the modern era of biological science has had an unintended consequence: it has led most researchers to ignore viruses in the study of evolution.\u201d<br>BACTERIAS are transmittable through coughing and sneezing .........<br><br>\u201cQ. What are bacteria and viruses?<br><br>Dr. Mandal: Bacteria are one-celled organisms that multiply and are linked to ear, throat, and sinus infections, as well as bronchitis, pneumonia, and whooping cough. Viruses are little parasites that reproduce rapidly and cause the common cold, the flu, and certain pneumonias. Most respiratory illnesses are not serious\u2014the culprit is usually a virus not bacterium.  <br><br>Q. Bacterial and viral infections feel similar to me. How can you tell the difference?<br><br>Dr. Mandal: People should rely on their general practitioner to distinguish between the two. We suspect that a respiratory illness is caused by a bacterium if you develop a secondary fever after the first few days of being sick. Make an appointment if you have:<br><br>Symptoms that last more than 10 days<br>Recurring fevers<br>Shortness of breath<br>Excessive yellow or green mucus<br>People with an increased risk for bacterial infections, such as the elderly, individuals with compromised immune systems, or a history of asthma, should see a physician within the first few days.\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-04-03T04:44:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hely Dominguez", "comment_text": "I love y\u2019alls character in your vids.

Is it even possible for the virus to disappear? Do we only have to wait until the summer? If heat slows it down or kills it, how is covid spreading in hot regions like Florida? How did SARS disappear and why does the flu keep coming back every year?

When he hit the right ratio, he began saving over 80%.  Today, some who have cancer or other serious diseases, go to clinics that remove a pint of blood from the patient, infuse food grade peroxide that&#39;s been highly diluted and put the blood back in.  <br>     <br>     Many are unaware that the body&#39;s front line of defense, our white blood cells, manufacture hydrogen peroxide and use it to fight invader cells.  I began using Hydrogen Peroxide in the nineties, by putting 5-7 drops of 35% Food Grade Peroxide in an empty nebulizer cup and filling it the rest of the way with distilled water.  I also purchased the cheap 2oz. brown glass bottle dropper bottles on amazon and the equally inexpensive 2.7oz Fine Mist spray bottles as well; for use as convenient, travel versions for when one does not have a nebulizer handy.  I filled the dropper bottle with 35% Food Grade Peroxide then put 12-15 drops of it into an empty 2.7oz fine mist spray bottle, then filled it the rest of the way with distilled water.<br>     <br>     This mix, which contains highly diluted and pure food grade peroxide (not the 3% brown bottle stuff you get at the drug store) and has proven HIGHLY BENEFICIAL to me and my family.  On one occasion, my wife was sent home from work with bronchitis, as her boss had lung cancer and couldn&#39;t be exposed.  My wife was back to work in 4 days.  Her boss sent her in for a lung scan because, as a former nurse, she said it takes a month or so for bronchitis to run it&#39;s course.  Lung scan was clear.  Her boss tried it and her tumors stopped growing almost immediately.  Since then, we have used it for all manner of flus and colds.  It is important to tackle any sickness as first symptoms arise.  This helps your body get the upper hand quickly.  The longer invader cells are allowed to multiply, the longer and harder the battle.<br><br>     As with any &quot;antibiotic&quot; it is beneficial to also take a probiotic, I have used a broad spectrum one called nexabiotic, to keep my beneficial gut bacteria intact.<br><br>(Obligatory disclaimer:  I submit the aformentioned information as a personal account, and give no medical advice to anyone, explicit or implied.)", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T20:44:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Hodson", "comment_text": "Put trust in healthcare professionals and scientists by staying at home?

Ante<br><br>5G at 60Ghz resonates with the oxygen molecule and gives oxygen a reverse polarity that makes it much less usable to the human body. At high concentrations of 5G usage you get suffocation of humans at street level. And at lower doses you get flu like symptoms which are the exact same symptoms as the flu with this lowered oxygen uptake by the body. But the way 5G kills is much more interesting.<br><br>Our bodies have trillions of parasitic organisms inside which feed on us and some say help us live by doing many useful functions. But when these bacteria, fungi, and parasites are subjected to any WIFI microwave radiations they are harmed and begin reproducing toxins in self defense. These organisms begin reproducing rapidly to ensure their survival. And so we get flu like symptoms from these internal parasite organisms under attack from WIFI microwave radiations reproducing rapidly and excreting toxins. This is the real illness people are getting not a bio-weapon coronavirus.<br><br>2G has ten microwave frequencies assigned to it, 3G has ten also, 4G has five frequencies with some overlaps, but 5G has 3000 microwave frequencies assigned to it by the FCC. Why so many? So 5G should really be called 297G not 5G. So with this 5G rollout in China, Korea, Italy, Iran, and cruise ships we have the greatest concentrations of 5G usage and the greatest concentrations of illness and death in the world. Our internal parasites are like canaries in a mine and are being killed off rapidly from this 5G usage. When this happens too quickly the body can not get rid of the increased toxins and the host (you) die from toxemia. Our human cells are all tied together and form a much stronger union but our many parasitic hosts inside us are much more isolated within us and much more vulnerable to this WIFI microwave radiations. They try to survive by multiplying rapidly and making toxins to protect them from harm but it is no use and they die with 5G. And with their rapid death our bodies (at least of older and less healthy human) are overwhelmed by toxins very quickly and die from the combined effects of lowered oxygen uptake from 5G, and also from the massive overpopulation, and then die off of our internal biomass of germs and parasites, which creates overwhelming toxemia.<br><br>When the Chinese locked down the people in Wuhan they turned to their new 5G phones and internet connections and so the city was flooded with much more 5G WIFI radiations and made many more people fall sick and die.

The Hong Kong people are staying home because most of us do not trust the government, and staying at home is the best way that we could save ourselves from the coronavirus.<br><br>From the start of January to mid-March, the government had been holding back the policy to close ALL of our borders that connect Hong Kong with mainland China, and this has stemmed discontent against the government. Hoping that people coming into Hong Kong would fill in the health forms honestly, the government even stated that if people filled in the health registration forms honestly, if they contract the coronavirus, the treatment that they receive in Hong Kong would be free of charge, and even more mainlanders stormed into Hong Kong through the few borders that remained open. Many politicians in the legislative council pleaded to the government in hopes that the government would close all borders, and it was 2 weeks ago that the government finally decided to close down the border at Hong Kong International Airport, but they still kept the borders between Hong Kong and mainland China open as usual. Documents from the government even mentioned that businessmen coming in from China are exempted from quarantine, and this has fuelled more anger against the government.<br><br>After almost 9 months of anti-extradition bill protests in Hong Kong, most Hongkongers have strong distrust against the government. Amidst the current situation, we are staying at home. We are just simply trying our best to protect ourselves when the government is not able to protect its citizens. I am sure that our ability to stay at home and quarantine effectively is not correlated with our trust in our government, but our distrust against our incapable and unresponsive government.", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T06:56:23Z", "likes_count": 29}, {"comment_by": "planes124", "comment_text": "RIP those who got corona.

Plus my elderly neighbor is immunocompromised.<br><br>  Point is, I&#39;m doing what&#39;s best for everyone and staying home. Whether I have Covid-19 or not, I don&#39;t wanna get anyone sick. Plus, I need to make sure my breathing is kept stable since I can&#39;t really take prednisone like I usually would for my breathing issues. (I go to the E.R. at least twice a year due to lung infections, pneumonia, bronchitis etc) Prednisone weakens your immune system, and I can&#39;t afford to have my immune system weakened because if so I&#39;m at higher risk of getting Covid-19. <br><br>Let&#39;s do our best to flatten that curve. :) I hope you all stay safe and healthy.<br><br>Edit: Just got the results back from the hospital.
