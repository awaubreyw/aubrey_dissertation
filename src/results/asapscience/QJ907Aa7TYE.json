Good looking people can get their desires satisfied easily and have no use for people they perceive as not useful. Everyone is so replaceable in their lives. I hate the truth, but there is not hardly anyone out there who is nice just for the sake of being nice. On top of that, the few people who are nice and hot often get thrown into an uncomfortable situation because they were being nice and friendly. It takes conviction to treat every person they meet as a clean slate because of what could be or what has happened in similar situations. So eventually all nice people become just as jaded as the people who presume that good looking people are jerks. They decide it isn&#39;t worth the risk of being nice. The decision to be a nice person assumes all risk with low probability for reward. Pragmatically, good looking people almost have to be jerks.

Everyone is different, so everyone goes by their own checklist of what they want in someone, or, on the contrary, what they don&#39;t want. You also really need to consider whether or not how you present yourself has an impact on the impression you give off to other people. For me personally, I&#39;m about 20 years old and I can swear on my own life that I&#39;ve never actually had someone come up to me and try to be my friend, much less have I ever actually had a girl willingly /talk/ to me, and that&#39;s how it&#39;s always been. Why is that? No, it&#39;s not just because &#39;hurr durr im ugly and literally everybody out of the 7,000,000,000+ people on earth are too conceited to give me a chance&#39;. It actually took until I really started to mature to realize: The way I present myself out in public practically screams &quot;STAY AWAY FROM ME&quot;. All throughout grade school, I&#39;d go to my desk, sit down, and cover my head with my arms on the desk. How was I to expect anyone to just waltz up to me wanting to strike up a conversation when my own body language essentially suggested &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk to anybody&quot;? It&#39;s little things like that which really give people insight--or a chance to assume, at least--in regards to how you feel about social interaction, or your desire to take part in it at that current moment. And speaking of social interaction, that&#39;s another thing. Don&#39;t expect all the guys/girls to come flock to you if you yourself make it apparent that you&#39;re <i>actually</i> not into interacting with people to begin with. Things like low self-confidence, a monotone voice, short responses to statements &amp; questions, and the like really speak verses about how you might feel about even getting to know somebody. And no, it&#39;s not selfish of other people to be reluctant to talk to you if literally everything you&#39;re doing is giving off the &quot;I&#39;d really rather not&quot; vibe. I know from personal experience that a lot of people who do that, really more than anything, just want someone to notice them and be the friend nobody ever could. But that&#39;s not how it works. Why? Well, ask yourself: When you see someone at your school/workplace sitting alone on their phone, with their head down, or with just a general dull expression on their face, (and I bet it wouldn&#39;t exclude very many of you to add if you saw someone sitting alone at ALL), what do you do? Do you go up to them, sit down, and distract them from whatever they&#39;re doing to force their attention onto you? No? Why? Isn&#39;t that what you want them to do when YOU act like that? Exactly--the same rules apply. People are just as nervous to distract you from whatever you&#39;re making yourself look pre-occupied with as you are to do so with someone else. So is it really anyone&#39;s fault in the end? No, it&#39;s human nature, and a deduction of logic and instinct. And personally, I&#39;ll admit, sometimes there are moments when I&#39;m just like, &quot;I&#39;m literally doing nothing wrong--in fact, I&#39;m actually MAKING myself seem approachable and giving off a &quot;Hit me up with a conversation&quot; impression--why don&#39;t they care?&quot; Like during school presentations, I&#39;d often get really passionate about whatever it was that I was talking about, (albeit involuntarily nervous and would choke on my own words many times), and would really open myself up for people to talk with. Why didn&#39;t it work? Well, news flash: Not everyone is compatible. Common interests are a big deal too when it comes to finding people to talk to. Take for instance my YouTube icon: It comes from a Disney kid&#39;s game called Toontown Online, which I guarantee at least 99 out of every 100 readers here don&#39;t play today. So tell me, if the only things I really got fired up talking about are things like that--things that almost nobody else can relate to or have no interest/experience in discussing, would you want to try to get to know me on the basis that I try to engage you in a conversation about Toontown, or any other topic you wouldn&#39;t know/care to hear me ramble on about? Probably not. People like to talk to other people about things that actually matter to them, that they&#39;re involved in, or that they have knowledge about. Unfortunately for people in my boat, an overwhelming majority of youth today would rather be on their Snapchat/Instagram/Vine/the-list-goes-on accounts or talk about things or people that, to people like me, don&#39;t matter at all. So is all hope lost? No. All too often someone can be faced with that exact situation and lead themselves into the assumption that &quot;Everyone I&#39;m surrounded by in real life are all the same and don&#39;t fit the kind of person I wanna talk to, so that justifies why I have no friends and why nobody talks to me--because what they&#39;re into isn&#39;t as IMPORTANT or MATURE as what <i>I&#39;m</i> into&quot;. And wouldn&#39;t it be nice if that generalization were completely accurate and we could all live in our own little naive worlds? But no, that&#39;s not how it works, either. That&#39;s a lazy way to rationalize why you don&#39;t take initiative or change your behavioral patterns to open yourself up to people. Just because the way someone looks doesn&#39;t stand out to you in public doesn&#39;t mean you have the right to assume they&#39;re only into things that you have no interest in talking about--even if you&#39;re the most obscure, outlandish kinda guy like myself. &quot;So are you saying I have to change who I am to appeal to others?&quot; No, you can still be you. Just don&#39;t act depressing, stop throwing pity parties, and stop distancing yourself from society entirely every chance you get just to play the &quot;more mature&quot; card. If you&#39;re generally good looking, then great, it&#39;ll be that much easier for you. If you&#39;re generally ugly, stop emphasizing it. How is anyone supposed to love and care about you when you can&#39;t even do the same for yourself? What are they to expect you to feel for them if even on yourself you&#39;re just always going on about &quot;I don&#39;t like myself, but I don&#39;t like anyone else either because they don&#39;t like me too&quot;? Honestly. And if you typically are the kind of person who just acts like that all the time, why <i>wouldn&#39;t</i> you want to change that about yourself? Does it take too much effort? Do you lack incentive? Are you already so deep in the hole that you don&#39;t see what trying to get out could do for you? Then do what I did when I was in that stage: Listen to Crywank&#39;s &quot;I Am Shit&quot;, &quot;Leech Boy&quot;,  and some of starry cat&#39;s songs for a few hours, maybe even some dandelion hands or something, contemplate your choices, and then start small. Buy some dumbbells online and lift them regularly to relieve stress while improving your own appearance and health, fix your sleeping schedule, stop being absolutely careless about your diet, do something with yourself every once-in-a-while. You get out of life what you put into it. It&#39;s up to you to be a good person, nobody else is going to do it for you. I could keep going but I&#39;m going to end the rant here because at this point I can&#39;t tell if this is all directed at you guys or if I&#39;m speaking to myself.
