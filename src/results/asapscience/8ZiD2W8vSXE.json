I stayed away of these types of things since they are always seperated from the &quot;normal&quot; foods and tend to be more expensive.<br>Here is my question that wasn&#39;t answered in the video: Why is dairy milk so much cheaper than the plant based milks? I mean having tested a couple of different ones I can say that I actually prefer the taste of most of these plant based milks. I think almond milk tastes the best btw. For dairy you also need to take care of cows so I don&#39;t get why that&#39;s cheaper. If the plant based milks have so many benefits then why are they the ones gated from normal people the most? I can only think of 2 reasons but both are stupid reasons in my opinion seeing how benefitial plant based milks are: 1. dairy companies still want to make it seem like milk from animals is the better product, 2. since more people drink dairy milk they can sell it for less and since less people drunk plant based milk they have to sell it for more.<br>But one reason more people drink dairy milk is because of the lower price. Not everybody will look for the differences of these milks and they see the prices and buy the cheaper ones. That&#39;s how I thought for the 30 years I&#39;ve been alive... <br>I don&#39;t know what the difference is in the US and other big countries but in my country plant based milks are 3-4 times more expensive than dairy milk. I think that&#39;s where the problem starts or is there any other reason why dairy milk (the worse opton for a multitude of reasons) is so much cheaper than the other (better) options?", "comment_date": "2021-12-28T15:56:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wuffy Wufferson", "comment_text": "I&#39;ll try oat milk instead of almost then", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T18:18:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "orphee", "comment_text": "nice!", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T05:26:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gregory Keane", "comment_text": "Love your channel!

You see, instead of collecting profits for the sole purpose of making money and growing their business, Ecosia instead uses the money that they generate to <b>plant trees*!

To get to the point, I would love if you could use your platform to promote Ecosia to your audience (after you yourself have researched and fallen in love with it, of course!). I don&#39;t make any money from the promotion of Ecosia by the way. And in case you&#39;re wondering, Ecosia is not a scam and it won&#39;t give you a virus.

Also, let\u2019s not forget that this is primarily a white people problem bc most other countries don\u2019t have dairy milk or milk in general as a large part of their diet bc most of the world\u2019s population is lactose intolerant. The USA should not be dependent on or buy large quantities of a product from other countries, especially when there\u2019s no need for it.  We don\u2019t have to import soy or rice milk, we can literally just make our own environmentally friendly milk if we want.  And the land we currently use for the conventional dairy industry could just be land for goats and sheep, as those animals are smaller and generally need less land, not to mention sheep also provide material like wool.  Ultimately, having a mixture of milk sources is the most sustainable decision, because then you\u2019re not putting all the pressure on one industry to supply the world with a single form of food. Also, let\u2019s not forget that it is fundamentally not the consumer that is responsible for global warming, it is corporations and governments not cracking down on those increasing anthropogenic climate change that are responsible, so while sure its important to do your due diligence with regards to making household choices based on the idea of a sustainable and zero waste future, its important not to start blaming an individual for making what you might consider the wrong choice, i.e. conventional dairy milk. As it stands, for a lot of poor people in America, conventional dairy milk is something extremely affordable, incredibly nutritious, and available nearly everywhere.  The reason the US even has milk and dairy as a staple in the American diet is bc of the Great Depression and the three reasons listed above.  Ergo, from a purely utilitarian perspective, it\u2019s better to drink dairy milk, and a lot of the milk alternatives simply don\u2019t even come close to dairy in those three regards.  Finally, let\u2019s talk about the fact that a lot of conventionally grown produce uses a lot of pollutants like pesticides, insecticides, fertilizers, and GMO\u2019s which create their own problems due to their pay to use patents consequently causing a decrease in competition amongst farms.  Organically grown produce, while not perfect, does not contribute to nearly the same extent of overall anthropogenic climate change as their conventional alternatives, so you really do have to differentiate between conventionally grown and organically grown produce and their corresponding \u201cmilks\u201d because their impacts on the environment will be drastically different.  I think this video is a good starting point for people wanting to learn to make changes to their behavior to become eco friendly, but it is not nearly enough. I would suggest making a follow-up video with all of my information and more. Perhaps even touch on the fact that the brand of milk alternative you buy (like is buying a brand of soy milk that is basically owned by Monsanto really better than buying conventional dairy milk) and the store you buy it from matters too.  If, as a consumer, you want to have a meaningful positive impact on the environment these are things you really have to do as conscientiously as possible.  There\u2019s literally no point in half assing it because these choices are elective, so if you want to become sustainable, that is something you do for yourself and the environment and for no one else, and you should never shame anyone for not doing what you\u2019re doing. You can educate, but never shame unless it\u2019s something really pathetic like littering. People don\u2019t respond well to shaming, educating people on these issues is better.  Sorry that was so long, this is just something I\u2019m really passionate about. <br><br>Also, for those wondering I am not dissing GMO\u2019s because I think they are physically bad for you, I am dissing them bc of the human impact they have and the monoculture they bring in agriculture.<br><br>Edit: typos", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T07:09:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JuliaTheBrain", "comment_text": "Is there a reason why hazelnut milk is not in the graphic? \ud83e\udd7a", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T07:02:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ember Filled Sky", "comment_text": "Still be careful with soy milk if you have health conditions that get affected by hormone changes.

Unfortunately, only production has been taken into consideration here, which isn\u2019t the full picture at all. There is no way that importing alternative milks from the other side of the world is any better than drinking local dairy milks (say, goat milk instead of cow milk) because of the emissions from transporting those milks thousands of kilometres across the world to your supermarket shelves. Coconut milk from Indonesia might have less environmental impact in the place of its production, but that impact is increased with the distance it travels to get to the consumer.<br><br>Potential slave and child labour was also touched upon here but that\u2019s only the tip of the exploitation iceberg that exists in corporate trade. A good thing to always keep in mind is that there is no ethical consumption in capitalism. Just because something is labelled as \u201cfree trade\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that there are no underpaid workers with bosses above them who rake in the profits, whether it\u2019s in the fields, in factories, in a corporate setting or in stores.<br><br>The best thing you can do to lessen your negative environmental and economic impact isn\u2019t just to buy whatever you see on your grocery store shelves that\u2019s lowest on the scale shown here. Instead, buy as locally as you can and buy from smaller producers rather than big corporations. And if your local, small business options include alternatives, great!

Drink less milk, or don&#39;t use any at all. Because the main problem with alternative milks is that they need to be grown and therefore might cause deforestation. The obvious solution to that is the use of local circuits, if possible. <br>To me it&#39;s the perfect example of the modern trend : finding more or less satisfying ways to keep up the current pace of consumption. But we can&#39;t really do that. If we were all to consume alternative milks, how many acres would have to be converted to satisfy the demand? I don&#39;t think they are a real solution. The real solution if you want to be eco-friendly is to grow your own plants, and live without electricity. <br><br>PS : that&#39;s just my opinion though, so feel free to respond and argue with me if you have facts that contradict my beliefs (with respect and politely of course ^^)", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T17:22:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kero 7", "comment_text": "Does this also concern actual calcium our bodies needs and can accept", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T17:21:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jansa", "comment_text": "if you\u2019ve not tried it, try OATLY brand oat milk that comes in grayish box, not the low fat one or chocolate flavor.
