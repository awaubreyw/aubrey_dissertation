In other words, meditation is reducing discursive thinking by being in the moment or \u2018mindful\u2019.  The avoidance of discursive thinking or \u2018mind wandering\u2019 prevents the development of future perseverative conflicts and results in the covert musculature becoming inactive, or a pleasurable state of rest.  Relaxation is achieved by avoiding discursive judgment rather than all judgment, while anticipated and subsequent non-discursive or meaningful behavior sustains and enhances the positive affect due to relaxation both during and after meditation sessions. (This is exemplified in cognitive strategies such as savoring, loving-kindness meditation, and flow experiences that couple positive ideation with relaxed states, and its neurobiology is discussed in the link below) Thus meditation, to be effective or most \u2018affective\u2019, must represent a dual cognitive strategy that couples the inhibition of discursive thinking with subsequent non-discursive or meaningful judgment or thought.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>A more formal explanation from a neurologically based learning theory is provided on pp. 47-52 in a little open-source book on the psychology of rest linked below.

She done a 3 minute breathing meditation with me in-session to show me what to do, which went okay, apart from feeling silly and a bit bored. I was then asked to meditate for 3-5 minutes daily at home for the following week. This is when my problems started. <br>\r<br>First day doing it alone triggered my anxiety to a near panic attack. I tried to continue for the rest of the week, thinking it would get better over time. By the end of the week I wasn&#39;t just experiencing anxiety, but remembering disturbing memories from a time I was really struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. Everything came rushing back - all the feelings and emotions from that time, and I started to have suicidal thoughts again, which hadn&#39;t bothered me for years.\r<br>\r<br>While I respect meditation can help people, it doesn&#39;t help everyone.

To clear it up: The DMN activates itself when the mind is in a negative-task state, whereas meditation has everything to do with a positive-task state; in other words, actively using the mind&#39;s attention and focus.

Yes, that means that you are not your mind, the mind is just a tool but we don&#39;t get to learn that in school. So, meditation helps you to stay &quot;Conscious&quot;, and also help you use your mind when you do need it and shut the excessive thoughts if you do not need them, because otherwise, that&#39;s how you start getting negative thoughts and therefore negative emotions, energy, etc. On a spiritual level, and also the reason why by meditating we are trying to shut down the mind is to feel your &quot;True&quot; you, to understand that there is a higher intelligence than the mind and that this last one is just a tool for practical daily use, like solving math problems, but the mind is not good for other things like Love, and Relationships with any living being. So yes, it does improve your life not just physically and emotionally but also and most importantly in every aspect of your life. Sounds amazing right? and it only takes 20 minutes every day &lt;3! In case you want a good book that combines science, spirituality, meditation and life, go read the Power Of Now, a lot of CEOs and entrepeneurs put that book as a must read, me too, its amazing :D!!<br>2) After knowing the basics I just told you, you can easily know that if you just sit down in front of a wall and try not to think, you will be practicing &quot;Meditation&quot;. But wait, that is a hard way of doing it, especially for beginners. Thus, there are easier ways and I will give you some examples:<br>3) First and easiest Example: most common around the world, is to sit down, cross your legs like in the movies, and concentrate on your breathing; thus you will make your mind to be occupied so it can not keep its process of excessive thinking. It&#39;s simple, but it won&#39;t shut down your thoughts that easy, so you must practice it for at least 5 up to 10 minutes the first times. Then you should try 15 up to 20 minutes and 20 is perfect for a daily practice, if you do more, better, but i guess most people here are living an urban life so sometimes not everyone has the time to sit down 1 or 2 hours to meditate.<br>4) Second and more in-depth Example: Sit down, cross your legs, put your hands down together (you can see how in a video or in google :D) and concentrate on your breathing while also using a &quot;Mantra&quot; and / or a imaginary guide scene (this is more difficult because your mind will try to change this imaginary story to don&#39;t let you shut it down). A Mantra is fun to have and I personally prefer it. you can look up on the internet how to create a mantra of your own, which is pretty easy, but there are also mantras you can use. For example, there is one Mantra I found last month that goes like this: when you inhale you think &quot;So...&quot; and when you exhale &quot;Ham...&quot;. So a Mantra is basically thoughts of pronunciation you can focus on to get your mind out of its usual work of bringing other random thoughts to you, as I said before, is like getting your mind to be occupied.<br>5) The third example is the most simple one, but is hard as stated before, and is just to sit down, look at a point somewhere in the room, and just try not to think of anything. This one, in particular, is a must do at least for 20 minutes, not less because is harder to meditate without a Focus Practice like the other methods. The good thing about this method is that in your daily life you will always encounter many situations, objects and living beings for your mind to judge and create Thoughts so this method will make you be more like a &quot;rock&quot; against any situation and your mind will stay shut down for longer. It&#39;s the most simple of those 3 I&#39;ve done but by far is the most rewarding.", "comment_date": "2018-06-13T05:06:01Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Parul Aggarwal", "comment_text": "That&#39;s why a majority of successful people practise meditation.", "comment_date": "2018-06-12T13:54:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jitu ramani", "comment_text": "thanks to India? everyone?", "comment_date": "2018-06-09T16:50:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bilal Shahid", "comment_text": "Can we increase our height after 20 by meditation process?", "comment_date": "2018-06-08T22:29:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Socrates", "comment_text": "Excellent Video!

The truth is that we are all sleeping in the awaken life but once truly awaken you are no longer consider &quot;the dead&quot; but &quot;the living&quot;. The living is the ones who has connected back to the One inside that gives breath of life. That is why breathing and meditation are connected together because breath is from the spirit of life and the mind is for the eyes to to awaken from old dying eyes to new living eyes to see life in the light. We are living in a reality where people fall back to sleep which is &quot;death&quot; and to be resurrected to Eternal Life we need to surrender to the Spirit that is living inside us that is sustaining our breath and being.

Even though most things in religion may not be real, this is one of the first traditions in religion to be proven fact. I enjoy knowledge, but I also enjoy peace. So when I started meditating on a regular basis, I definitely started to feel some kind of feeling in my body that I can&#39;t really describe. All I know is I felt really calm and my body felt as though it had some weight lifted off of me. And I really did feel a sense of peace. I honestly wish that religions like mine, which use to be Christianity, actually adopted meditation because I believe it really has an effect. Today, my\u00a0 beliefs are complicated. I&#39;m pretty much in the middle between religion and science, but mostly believe science. But studies like these really make me believe that we still don&#39;t know everything yet, but we can still research to the point when we might discover that our body may have a soul or not. It&#39;s like the more knowledge I gain, the more religion looks messed up and doesn&#39;t make sense.

Maybe our\u00a0information we find in religion\u00a0just isn&#39;t 100% accurate.\u00a0At this point, I don&#39;t really know what to believe anymore.

I just express myself to\u00a0those who have understanding and respect for what I believe.

We get the powder that you put in regular water and it changes the color and flavor. So this is my question. Is water with flavoring as healthy as regular water? That is my question because after watching your video something called &quot;Can you really have too much water?&quot; That is my best guess of the title. After finding out you can die after three days without water, I went to get a glass of water and when I got back to my room, I drank the water and hated the taste. I would really love to know the answer. I love my education, and I love to learn. Science is my favorite subject. Right now we are learning about the water cycle, and also food chains.

Of course the cell wich gives gametes (meiosis), or cancerous cell (but it&#39;s pathologic then) express the telomerase enzyme which increase the length of the telomere.

Basically, instead of watching porn and/or masturbating and releasing (or wasting) your sexual energy, through meditation you can harness your sexual energy and give your brain a major boost, especially eliminating things like ADD/ADHD, anxiety, depression, hypersexuality, etc. and increasing creativity, drive, passion, etc.. This is also an ancient practice but is well-documented, I think most popularly in the western world by Napolean Hill who in his book, Think &amp; Grow Rich, dedicated an entire chapter to it. He researched many of the great driven people in the past and how many of them would use sexual transmutation to keep their focus and drive at it&#39;s utmost. The Chinese called this energy, Jing. A lot of the &quot;nofap&quot; movement online uses it too, and there are TONS of testimonials to it&#39;s effectiveness.<br><br>I really think they should start teaching meditation in elementary schools.", "comment_date": "2015-01-18T17:20:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "eChuckNorris", "comment_text": "You forgot alzheimer&#39;s... oh wait...", "comment_date": "2015-01-18T17:19:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Billy Fox", "comment_text": "Can I buy your book in stores or just exclusively off your website I&#39;m really interested in reading it ", "comment_date": "2015-01-18T17:18:53Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tara L.
