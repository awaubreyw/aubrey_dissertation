I am so happy I can buy fresh crispy bread now without that disgusting plastic packaging used during covid times. However there are areas you cannot avoid plastic. Imagine a wooden computer or a mobile, wires without insulation as they used to be initially, medical tools like 100 years ago. Then, using plastic saves trees. Imagine all modern plastic packaging boxes replaced by wooden boxes, etc. Working at a polyethylene manufacturing facility I can confirm that if done properly modern industry is maybe 99.9% clean. A plant size a half of football field saves forests of trees. Years ago when people still did not invent plastic the industry was much more polluting than now. Then, let us recollect the tragedy in Seveso, Italy. The whole city deadly polluted by dioxine chemical, not by plastic. The most nature polluting plants are steel mills and paper factories. Textile industry is a terribly polluting branch. Then, agriculture. Breeding cows and pigs drastically increases CO levels. Next, crops. Using pesticides and fertilizers causes damage to water life, and we consume this stuff through water and food. This is to add only a few. Then, transport. Solar battaries frying birds alive. Wind mills in the middle of widelife, changing routes of fish migration in the sea and scaring animals. Study the question of windmill environmental harm, you will be terrified. And I am keeping silence about military sector. Do you think they are good for environment?))))) The only way we can mitigate the unavoidable harm we are doing to nature just by our plain existence is producing less unnecessary material stuff, concentrating in research fields which are necessary in life improvement, like medicine, science, etc. Making less what goes to trash and carefully sorting out and recycling trash by eco friendly means. For instance, burning with CO capture which can be aftewards used as a feedstock for chemical industry. And this is the riddle for civilization. Taking rubbish from developed countries and dumping it in Africa or South America is a crime.

This fabricated climate crisis is a catalyst that\u2019s being used to bring that about. Through Gaia worship, the veneration of earth and its creatures, and the universal acceptance of Sunday sacredness, all the world is being brought to worship at the feet of Satan.\r<br>.\r<br>In addition, there is a general and widespread expectation of the arrival of a \u201cWorld Teacher\u201d to guide the world into an age of peace.

The much higher pressures needed with R134A cause undue wear and tear on compressor components, and since the compressor is fighting to produce much more pressure, consumes much more power than would be needed to compress R12 refrigerant. [1]<br><br>For those who want to learn, read on!<br><br>The most common type of Freon is dichlorodifluoromethane, commonly referred to as R12.

Basically a good idea.<br>Buuuuut: the known lithium deposits worth mining on this planet will be depleted at CURRENT rates by around 2035, at the latest. Without localising huge additional deposits somewhere on the planet, the amount available, both currently mined, as well as future mining, will allow for a total of around 120 million vehicles on the planet. No other usage of lithium in ANY other product, except for lithium-ion-batteries. That is less than half the current US vehicles registered. Or less than a tenth of all vehicles around the planet.<br><br>So unless we research a cheap, same energy density battery based on more available materials, such as iron, we will see an INSANE price jump for electric vehicles in the next ten years as lithium will become more and more expensive as stored and minable deposits dwindle. When they suddenly, almost instantly, will be stopped totally as no more lithium will be available.<br><br>Even though the recycling of lithium is technically possible NONE of the current vehicle companies are currently actually doing any lithium recycling. <br>Including the much vaunted Tesla 50% recycling rate of batteries by weight.<br><br>So how does Tesla achieve a 50% recycling rate of their batteries BY WEIGHT? <br>Simple, they calculate all the housing, wiring, hardware and heat exchangers to control temperature, etc as part of the battery. Which makes up roughly 60% of the total weight. <br>So without even recycling one gram of ltihium from batteries Tesla (like so many other Musk products) is simply green-washing so many of their claims by outright lying to the consumer.<br><br>I&#39;ll make a bet that in 50 years or so Tesla will be taunted as one of the greatest waste producers on the planet, unless they come up with some truely revolutionizing development in batteries. Which they have failed to do since their inception and there is no real indication that they are working on it.<br><br>So why not invest in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles? <br>Because people are often still soooo scared of the hydrogen combustion demonstration in chemistry class in school and they misunderstand the concept of hydrogen fuel cells.<br>That&#39;s it, basically. <br>The current rate at which hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis is still very inefficient, agreed.

If my plastic cannot be recycled it makes no sense to build recycle centers to recycle a product that does not exist. Nestle being a food producer and not in the business or processing plastic waste will not build the recycle centers themselves obviously. But by making their plastics recyclable they allow others to build these recycling centers and make money while improving the environment.<br>The argument that 50% still goes to waste is cute but this is a glass half full discussion, 50% recycled is about 50% more of the plastic getting recycled than in the &#39;70 which is an improvement regardless of how you look at it.<br><br>So you would argue that no marketing can be done unless the government approved the statement or an scientific study has been conducted to back up the claim? For your first suggestion I would suggest voting for parties in favor of censorship. For the second one I would suggest having a look at how many scientific papers are published only to be proven to be totally false because the author had a (financial) motive to get a certain outcome. The antivax claims that have led to so many children being not vaccinated against deceases that had almost been eradicated in large parts of the world, but are now making many more victims than just 25 years ago.<br><br>CFC free, not putting this on your product will cause a decline is sales. Because people are stupid, or at least very lazy or simply not interested enough. Anyone that lived trough the &#39;80 will tell you that CFC&#39;s are bad and that any spray can that has that stuff in there is bad. So finding a spray can that does not explicitly state that CFC&#39;s are not included is much better. The fact that they are banned and that no one in their right mind would put this in any product as the PR disaster that could come from that is just not worth it is something that a lot of people are not aware of nor do they need to be, as the packaging helpfully states CFC free on there.<br>Regulation of alternatives is nice but much like you said in your previous bit about scientific research being required to make a claim (total nonsense though it might be) it does actually apply here. Because a government cannot ban a product without some kind of grounds to show that it is in some way harmful or otherwise not desirable. Thus here rather than trying to force companies to inform people that products they are selling could potentially contain substances that might eventually be proven to be harmful or none desirable maybe you should focus on pushing lawmakers to collect more evidence on the harmfulness of certain compounds if you are convinced that they might be harmful.<br><br>So you argue that companies should be punished for telling consumers about their much improved efficiency and reduced impact on the environment. Taking away a driver for these companies to spend time and effort making their products greener... When my competitor makes a product that is much greener than mine and I lose customers because they want to be as green as they can be than I will be forced to best or at the very least equal my competitions products green qualities. At which point my competition will want to get that upper hand again and push for an even greener product.<br>Suggesting that simply not using a car is a great idea but in the real world people need to use a car for work for instance if they have to get a car and they are not supposed to be aware of the green credentials of the different cars out there they are likely to pick a less green car than they would have if they had known that this other one they where doubting about was way more efficient and as a result much less polluting. Again your sensational arguments are rather silly and badly thought thru.<br><br>Emissions cheating software, sure we forget to mention that cars are running with minimal fuel (lighter thus less load thus less power required thus greener, tires are filled with helium and very much over filled and as narrow as they can be in order to produce minimal friction and reduce the power required. And so on and on... this is not lying this is simply incompetent regulators that allow for this to happen. The software was known about for many many years and it was never seen as a problem till finally after all those years of this public secret being out there one of the regulators seems to have not gotten the right Christmas gift from an anonymous benefactor or was not invited to that golf tournament in that tropical resort with his whole family. It is therefore not a company lying the company followed the test requirements and bend the rules just far enough for no one to care, till someone finally did. Rather than punishing the companies we should punish the failing regulators and insist on much better testing procedures, that are out in the open that others can look into verify and suggest improvements to. That way regulators are not alone when trying to fight the armies and armies of highly skilled engineers that the companies employ to make sure they pass the tests with flying colors.<br><br>The labels idea, this again is regulation this is not a company thing, they are just looking for an organization that is willing to let them slap their label on the packaging as this is what we the consumer expects to see on the packaging these days. Companies cannot and should not police these organizations this is not their business nor would it be a healthy situation as it leads to a serious conflict of interest. The government that supposedly is there to represent the people and act in their best interest is where this responsibility lies no other group has either the incentive the resources or enough of a distance to the outcome of any such investigation for it to make sense for them to take on the task.<br><br>Cotton bags have a higher Co2 cost for sure, then again if it is 5x higher and you use the bag 6 times you have a net savings in Co2, unless the rules of math are different in the US of course, what with the imperial metrics and all who knows what other weird things you have made up over there.<br><br>All in all from everything that I have heard the vast majority is short sighted, nonsense that seems to be mostly based on to little knowledge of the subject not understanding that the world is not populated by people that only strive for the betterment of human kind and probably willful misrepresentation if information in order to make a point.", "comment_date": "2022-07-15T14:28:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony C.", "comment_text": "It seems as though we, 30 years ago and before, used to re-use and recycle a crap ton more than we do now.

IOW oil needs to be transported in conflict or war zones for thousands of miles via far less environmental controls than would be seen in Europe or the US. This also means as we have seen countries willing to spend billions on bombs and other munitions to combat military forces in the middle east and Ukraine but unable to stop importing its oil as it would cause a famine. The simple threat the additional oil pipeline poses to the oil monopoly is why Putin felt safe enough to Invade During Obama and Biden but not during Trump.  We must not just ask if something will negatively impact the environment but what are the current environmental impact without it and the future alternative environmental impact. How many, wars, trans-Atlantic shipping, and food shortages does it take to offset the pipeline? And has it not already created a worst-case scenario by just looking at the current human and environmental impact.

Increase cost with no real protection. As an example, is OSHA, people like to claim how they protect workers but if you look into workplace ascendants before OSHA and it was dropping at the same rate as after OSHA. My own personal experience in a bottling plant, the government agent was more concern about where our vending machine was at then the dead tree frog on the bottling line, the broken bay doo, and a huge slit in the brick wall that you can see daylight through.  That is not including how some government regulation requires you to look with no testing to tell if there is harmful microbus on food products. <br><br>In the case of cars, many innovations stopped when government started regulating requiring minimal requirements. Many who lived back in 70s have talked about the brief period of some senators wanting to make it standard for cars to get 70 mpg based on a car at that time. Then it quietly went away. Or how when people had order cars from Europe, that because they are not the US standard, often more environmentally friendly parts are removed and replace with the less environmentally US standard. <br><br>It is seen that when the government puts in regulations it often means a minimal requirement and companies pull back on innovation because it is the government they must please, not the consumer. Often, in industry where government does little regulation, there is more innovation because companies are meeting the demands of people. If you notice in the car market, often the innovation is not with the engine as much as it is with extras like wireless charging of your phone, heated seats, and GPS installed.<br><br>As for the pipeline, it is not as dangerous as shipping the fuel by truck. Nor is it as environmentally damaging as shipping it by truck and ship, two things that Lith Battery EVs cannot replace. And we thank you for killing people because without the pipeline, we now have to get the fuel from even worse ways. How is stopping the pipeline really protecting the environment? By having us buy Russian and OPEC oil who care even less? Solar and wind have proven they cannot meet our needs, nor are they as green as people think? How are you going to make the metal parts if you close the coal mines down? Burn trees to get the carbon needed? <br><br>The truth is, there is nothing you can do that does not have an effect.

You make it sound impossible to find out what is and isn\u2019t right, but we all have smartphones that allow us to look anything up. Just google an award, it\u2019s not a Herculean task. That way we choose which companies get our money and therefore which companies succeed.<br>2) The only example I didn\u2019t agree with was the Pipeline. Pipelines are by far the cleanest and safest way to transport petroleum. I understand petroleum isn\u2019t our goal, but as of rn, it\u2019s a critical part of our infrastructure, if not at the very least for plastics etc. canceling it doesn\u2019t help the environment. The demand for fuel is still there. So now instead of the pipeline supplying shale oil (one of the cleanest/most efficient  forms of petroleum) those same consumers now need to receive it either by truck or ship (which is much more polluting) and more so, probably from outside suppliers who have little to no environmental regulations compared to the US and Canada.", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T12:00:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Doctor Bosconovitch", "comment_text": "For years New Zealand was using the &quot;Made in New Zealand&quot; line.

While you can argue that the oil itself can be burned to power cars, thereby causing damage to the environment, that oil will still make it to the refineries to be used in cars...so the pipeline is not the issue.

Instead we got in most of the break rooms water spending machines which will give you cold and room tempered water, sparkling room tempered water, hot water and very hot water. In said machines is an added filter system containing several filters so the water will be drinkable even if it is cold. Also these machines give you information about how much water they gave away and how many bottles were saved by using one of those. And boy they save lots and lots of water. During the first ten days of using just one of them already saved over 1500 bottles (to be fair, the machine won&#39;t tell you what size the saved bottles are so it can be everything between 0.33 - 1.5 litres). The cantina also give away bottles for those machines, so you can get water everywhere if you&#39;re thirsty and you don&#39;t pay a cent for the first bottle (said bottles are made of plastics but they are easy to clean and if you wish you may use a dishwasher to clean it, we have them in many rooms. Also, it is not forbidden to bring your own bottle to work). When it comes to the remaining vending machines, they will only give you cold drinks in glass bottles. Ice tea, lemonade, juices... all in glass bottles. If you want coffee or tea from a vending machine, you have to bring your own mug. And I think this is one of many steps towards an environmentally friendly lifestyle.<br><br>edit: Water has to be free at work in Germany. So if you are thirsty at work, your boss has to give you access to drinkable water. If they give you access to machines like my boss did or if they go and buy bottled water is up to your boss but water has to be free (this does not include if the water is sparkling or not, so in many companies you will only get non sparkling water for free). A machine like the ones we got at work may be a good solution for bigger companies, if you only have like... two employees you rather still may buy bottled water for them.

They can sell reusable ones for people who forgot to bring their own. Some places already sell reusable cups, but then there is a giant wall of plastic bottles of soda and energy drinks. The cups and bottles are the most expensive part anyhow and it would stop tons of plastic bottles and coated paper cups from ending up in landfills and the ocean. Everyone wants to argue over paper vs. plastic straws, but most people don&#39;t need a straw at all and if you do need/want a straw, metal and reusable silicone ones are pretty easy to obtain. I even have some silicone ones that can be &quot;unzipped&quot; making it easier to wash them, but I mostly use the stainless steel ones that came with my reusable mug.", "comment_date": "2022-05-18T15:12:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "kefpull", "comment_text": "Technically, crude oil is natural (and the dinosaurs were non-GMO)", "comment_date": "2022-05-18T14:02:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik Hellekson", "comment_text": "Agreed.And the #1 battery producer is #1 world polluter ,and also seems to be locking up shop at the moment,possibly ripping up passports/work visas .How much does the shop close and how long we shall see.", "comment_date": "2022-05-18T13:29:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Snackordeal", "comment_text": "The environmentalists movement is a scam.

So it makes it insanely hard to try and research what you need.<br><br>For example Rustoleum has a brown rust primer, they have a rust converter, and they have other primers, paints, etc. I had to do so much looking around to find what the hell these products even do, or when to use which one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Rustoleum barely has any information on their products so you don&#39;t know which to use! This is the same with waxes, polyurethanes, oil vs water based paints.<br><br>Hell most &quot;chalk&quot; paints are really just latex paint with &quot;chalk&quot; on the can........... Real chalk paints have different attributes which make them desirable for furniture because latex paints are rubbery and peel. <br><br>So companies can just say whatever they want and they aren&#39;t obligated to even tell you what&#39;s in their product! This is INFURIATING when trying to find what you need, you basically have to rely on hearsay and other peoples anecdotes. <br><br>Lets not even get into electronics, appliances, tools, etc. You basically just have to GUESS what you are buying and hope you are making a good decision.

I would like to correct a bit of (presumably unintentional) electric vehicle misinformation. Even if an electric vehicle is powered by coal, it is still cleaner than a petrol or diesel car. A coal fired plant is close to 50% efficient in converting fossil fuels to energy, whereas gas engines are in the 25-35% range. When combined with all the waste of extraction, refining, and transportation of fuel, even the worst coal plant is better than continuing to burn gas in cars. Add to this that the EV doesn&#39;t leave poison in its wake as it drives past schools and homes, and at least with the coal power plant the particulate pollution is centralized away from most people&#39;s lungs. Furthermore, given the trend of most power grids to renewable energy, an EV will just get cleaner, whereas a gas car will only get dirtier as it gets old and worn out. And if you&#39;re concerned with the extraction of things from the ground to make batteries, I have two points to make there. First, there are batteries in phones and laptops and all kinds of things, and nobody was upset about it until they started showing up in cars. Second, oil is a thing that has to be extracted from the ground, and then it&#39;s burned and never used again. An EV battery will last at least 10 years, and after that another 20 or so for balancing the grid (gotta store renewables somewhere) and then the vast majority of the materials that went into the production of the battery will be able to be used again, instead of extracting further things from the ground.

I suspect the average citizen may struggle to identify how more governmental power has led to better outcomes; one may even ponder about how much government we really need in our lives. In my opinion, the people ought to reduce the size of the government to the point where all it can do is protect the rights of the people who elected these public <del>servants</del> rulers.", "comment_date": "2022-03-26T00:10:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Channing Choi", "comment_text": "the hand gestures for me &lt;3", "comment_date": "2022-03-26T00:06:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AndreasNV", "comment_text": "So the trash pun at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3roITeXVWuE&amp;t=3m21s\">3:21</a> was intended, but the litteraly pun at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3roITeXVWuE&amp;t=2m11s\">2:11</a> was not?", "comment_date": "2022-03-26T00:00:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NoOne 2Notice", "comment_text": "Looking through some of these comments bring me hope.

In moderation it might be fine but I don&#39;t think more vulnerable populations such as infants and young children should have endocrine disruptors used regularly if at ALL. YET where is lavender commonly seen in products? <br><br> Many plastic bottles have phthalates yet they state &quot;bpa free&quot; and so people assume it&#39;s cool because they don&#39;t realize BPA is only one of hundreds of harmful chemicals potentially in one of these plastics. Also how many types of plastic there are and growing... I&#39;m surprised how many times I ask college- &quot;educated&quot; adults &quot;What is this made of?&quot; and they say &quot;plastic...&quot; <b>crickets</b> WHAT KIIIND OF PLASTIC? LOL It&#39;s not their fault necessarily but it&#39;s upsetting. This is important information to understand. After laws were made only a few years ago to outlaw PVC in child&#39;s toys in the USA; many largely successful toy companies had recalls due to many children getting sick from the PVC and similar in their products. I loved Barbie but no longer support Mattel. When you visit many of these companies&#39; websites they give excuses of &quot;It costs a lot of money to transition away from these [harmful] products&quot; AKA Don&#39;t you consumers want cheap toxic garbage vs buying less quality products that are safe for your kids???<br><br>On Amazon sellers are allowed to lie and play with words. &quot;Cotton-like material&quot; Or straight up &quot;100% cotton&quot; then you get an unlabeled item or an item with &quot;50% cotton 50% polyester&quot;. Not held accountable. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that this is common in countries that are known to traditionally dislike the USA and to have issues with them. Not that they take their own country&#39;s health into consideration either. <br><br>People are TOLD polyester, acrylic, rayon, Tencel....are great safe green products. BUT the truth is most of these are supremely toxic when produced and even more so when non-organic. They are supporting cancerous deaths and neurological attacks on the people whom make these products and the people that rely on the water that is polluted by waste products. <br><br>Not even all natural products are safe. This SHOULD be common sense as not all plants are safe to digest, even wood dust is toxic for many species of wood. (Though if protecting self from dust I thin k this is a much better alternate to plastics). <br><br> Also proven by SCIENCE is that most people cannot sustain a healthy diet on plant life alone. Supplements are not a good alternative either. It&#39;s about balance and not being greedy.  People hate on leather yet is most countries there are high ethical standards for how they raise and slaughter the animals. Leather goods are less toxic to manufacture most times and also less toxic as they wear down vs fake leathers like PU and PVC. Those produce more toxins during and after production. They tend to wear down more quickly (if you of course maintain the leather). <br><br>Since I started to cut out polyester, rayon, etc in my home and especially in my clothing and bedding...I have noticed a much better quality of life. I started to heal from issues that doctors could not place a finger on. Consistent migraines, nausea, weakness, brain fog......I was told to &quot;do yoga&quot;, &quot;cut out gluten&quot; etc. I did try those things. Definitely need to exercise more and eat better...(organic, fresh foods). BUT it was switching to better safer products that&#39;s been a life changer so far. Now I feel I am actually capable of exercising without being worn out for days, eating healthy because I&#39;m not so depressed and deflated when that didn&#39;t work before. I sleep better. I suddenly have minimal asthma symptoms when before I was having asthma attacks several times a day. <br><br>It&#39;s not easy to research with the green washing pulling everyone down and confusing them. There are many biased (financially buffed) articles out there of misinformation about these materials being &quot;better&quot; and &quot;safe&quot; , even &quot;non-toxic&quot; by the FDA when proven to actually increase your odds of cancer by ten fold and other health issues greatly proven in numerous case studies. The FDA is a fun one as well....they helped support using refined sugars as bread filler and etc. Even after the initial findings were that dogs and mice would die faster from a diet of refined sugar than a diet of natural sugars or starvation. The mice and dogs also commonly grew tumors a majority of the time vs rarely in the control groups.  When I was looking into becoming a pharmacy tech (pharmacist family friend suggested it) I learned about the history of medicine in the USA and the UK. As well as the modern methods of releasing new medicine to the public. More often than not the public is the first large-scale way to perform human trials. Many medications today have to have a minimal amount of identical ingredients to another &quot;passed&quot; medication and maybe 50-100 people tested it. Then out to the public! YAY! This doesn&#39;t mean 50-100 people were ok mind you. It means they reported the potential side effects and outcomes and a medical panel determined whether or not THEY deem it safe; if they acknowledge that the medication caused problems or if it was a coincidence etc. <br><br>If you can take the time do your own research. Keep an open mind, consider the sources. Maybe look into a non-biased biology or chemistry course (or just investigate it yourself online). There are so many ways to learn for free now it&#39;s crazy.

So he took the money he made by his made up Global Warming research and has homes built on the SAME locations that should have been under water?

In contrast the alternative to move oil are by tanker truck, railways and ship. Tanker trucks take diesel fuel, the trains take diesel to move and ship use diesel to move accidents and humans cause fuel spills all the time. So these transport methods have two strikes against them from the get go, both use resources and pollute the environment. Using fuel to move and oil spills. The pipeline on the other hand once build moves oil by mostly gravity (notice how I said most gravity). The better question to ask is who benefits for the shutdown of the pipeline.

On a global scale it&#39;s even worse since the usual culprits are less regulated (more polluting and damaging to their local environment) and the resource has to be transported over a much bigger distance to your country, so it defeats the main purpose of these enviromental arguments - unless you think your backyard matters more than theirs.<br>2) Stopping the most efficient means of transportation (like a pipeline) doesn&#39;t prevent, and often expedites, less efficient and thus more expensive and polluting means of transportation.

All that counts is that the engine in the vehicle can burn whatever fuel the engine uses cleanly below thresholds. So for example: a big SUV getting 5mpg is considered clean because the engine in it can burn 1 gallon of fuel below the legally allowable emissions. Nobody in the US cares that the vehicle burns hundreds of gallons of fuel to go places that another vehicle could do with a fraction of the pollution.  So a BMW 4 series Diesel - which gets up to 47mpg without complicated hybrid technology is illegal in the US - because it burns one gallon of diesel above the allowable emissions. Again, nobody cares that the SUV or Pickup next door uses 15 to 20 gallons to go 100 miles when the BMW uses less than 3 for the same distance.

I would prefer if we had paper bags or something to use, or if people used baskets or something instead, but as a Coles worker I think I sell almost or even more than 100 &#39;single use&#39; bags an hour.

Most things aren&#39;t outright lies, but truth that has been so twisted as to basically be lies. So, monitor yourself, try to live honestly, research ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING, and be open-minded but skeptical.<br><br>This video is a great reminder that everything is a lie! Nothing you see on the internet can really be trusted! It&#39;s always been filtered through some agenda or worldview, especially if it&#39;s supposed to be something super emotional. Not that emotional appeals are inherently bad. They are simply a tool, to be used for good or evil, but a powerful tool, and you need to be able to recognize when it&#39;s being used on you. Of course, logic and reason can be manipulated, too. The existence of &quot;logical fallacies&quot; just speaks to how serious this problem is. Politicians lie! Corporations lie! Even volunteers, no, especially volunteers, they lie too! I&#39;m a volunteer, so I would know. I know the necessity of lying, of playing this dumb social game, but at the same time, I hate it. I hate the fact that the world we live in is one of lies and half-truths. From protecting others&#39; feelings to justifying genocide, almost nothing can be trusted! I guess the only thing we can do is to monitor ourselves, try to be as honest as possible, so we can avoid falling into this trap. The trap of lying is insidious and extremely easy to slip into, and once you do, it&#39;s hard to extricate yourself. We can do extensive research (although the internet screws with that, too) and practice open-minded skepticism. Aka, being open to all the possibilities, but not taking any as absolute truth. Most articles, essays, propaganda, everything, when you strip it down to the bare facts, you&#39;ll find that there&#39;s really nothing of substance at all. And of those small, precious grains of truth that you can glean, you can&#39;t even really tell if those are true, either. You can only hope that they have only twisted the truth, and aren&#39;t lying completely. After all, it is often to their benefit to work with the truth, and do lots of mental gymnastics to make it fit their narrative, rather than lying outright. But I guess you can never be completely sure that anything is true. (Except for the shape of the earth. We can all know with certainty that it is round. Flat earthers take this &quot;everything is a lie&quot; thing too far. But then, quantum physics has to screw with that too.

It\u2019s just a marketing scam. I just really think we desperately need better options. One option is to make a bunch of regulations which will hurt our economy and it will drive off some of the companies based in America. There\u2019s no preventing that because there\u2019s just no way developing countries will ever create a bunch of strict regulations and even if they did, their governments can\u2019t enforce them effectively enough to make a difference. Overly strict regulation only works if everyone is on board, or at least mostly everyone. So regulation is part of the solution, and it\u2019s FAR better than blaming individuals for climate change, but it\u2019s not enough and it can\u2019t be the thing that solves everything because it just won\u2019t. Real environmental change will only come when climate-friendly options are cheaper and more effective than conventional options. It\u2019s going to take a lot of time and investment to get that off the ground. We don\u2019t have any time and nobody is willing to pay the investment. And America and China can\u2019t fix this issue by themselves. So this is just really, really complicated and while we should never give up, there\u2019s just no way we\u2019re stopping significant climate change from happening. The only question now is how badly we\u2019re going to bleed before we can get a handle on it and start reversing it. Again, there\u2019s a massive difference between bleeding out and minimizing the bleeding, so it\u2019s no excuse to give up. At the same time, thinking we can prevent climate change is just really, really naive. I haven\u2019t seen a single technology that is ready to make a change. Even the most promising ones like nuclear power are shot down by the public because it\u2019s a pain. People just aren\u2019t evolved enough to sacrifice short term convenience for long term prevention of catastrophe. It\u2019s a lesson we seldom learn and quickly forget.
