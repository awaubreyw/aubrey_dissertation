We like to compare ourselves to guys like Hitler and say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m a pretty good guy compared to him.&quot; But when we compare ourselves to God&#39;s standard, we  realize that the Bible speaks truth when it says that we all sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God!!! When we see this ( our sin in its TRUE light), we see how much trouble we are in and we say, &quot;Well then there&#39;s nothing I can do. I&#39;m going to hell for sure then.&quot; It&#39;s true that there is nothing that WE can do, but there is something that has already been done for you! God sent His One and Only Son to die on a cross as a sacrifice for our sins! So to recieve that eternal sweet sweet forgiveness, all we must do is repent of our sins (meaning to continually turn from them and confess them) and trust alone in Christ as you trust a parachute. If I was to push you out of an airplane, you&#39;d want the parachute for sure! Don&#39;t try to flap your arms and save yourself, trust in the parachute!! His finished work on the Cross IS ENOUGH!!! He is the only way to Heaven, He said it Himself!! These other religions teach that we must he good and do good things and then maybe if we&#39;ve been good enough, we will enter Heaven. But if that is true then we are all doomed to eternal hell because none of us are good. That&#39;s why this makes sense. Look at the Ten Commandments, they are written on your heart right now!!!!! I promise that you have violated them. And you might still be doing that today. Therefore God is just to poor out His wrath on us because we deserve it!!!! But Christ died for us so that we can spend eternity in Heaven with Him!!!!.!!

But When you hear your own voice, you hear it through bone conduction, so your vocal cords and bones vibrate (including skull). and because bones tend to transfer lower frequencies, people usually hear their own voice slightly lower than other people hear it.

This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I&#39;m a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xk8ldFZhFM&amp;t=7m13s\">7:13</a>-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It&#39;s not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God&#39;s presence forever where you&#39;re never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can&#39;t continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn&#39;t rise from the dead.

Eventually I just quit because again I didn&#39;t like the sound of my voice and because of that I just couldn&#39;t tell if I was doing any good. It all just sounded bad to me. Like my teacher said I was good especially in a very low register and others told me it was good and getting better over the years but I never believed them. I just assumed, as most do they were just trying to be nice and I would say &quot;Seriously be honest. if its bad I need to know so I can improve so just be honest even if its brutal&quot; but they still would say I was good and still I assumed they were just trying not to hurt my feelings. I needed to know the truth and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what they were giving me. The sound of my voice just ruined it all for me. Every year my teacher would ask me to perform in their Christmas concert which I guess all the students did but I always declined.

Even in my thirties, people think I\u2019m a kid when I answer the phone, but to me my voice sounds like everyone else\u2019s around my age.  There are a couple of positives of sounding like a kid, which is the majority people are nicer to me over the phone , even if I\u2019m calling with a problem. ( I think it\u2019s because most people in general are nicer to children then adults, so with me sounding young they subconsciously are nicer) But being extremely shy means the bad part is my husband always hands me the phone to talk to people if the call isn\u2019t going great, and then jokes about how they\u2019ve all of a sudden turned nice. And my sister and husband both swear that if a cop ever pulls them over and I\u2019m with them to do some of the talking, they never get a ticket, but I think that is more about my attitude towards them then my voice honestly.

Growing up in central Florida only added to my problems with a very Southern accent.<br>How I went from something I disliked to such a wide range:<br>First, I practiced cupping a hand behind one ear and sang the scales using various sounds like:<br>La. La la<br>Fi-ga-ro<br>A a a<br>Me me me<br>And when I was younger I tried, &quot;Super cala fraja listic expi ala docious. From Mary Poppins.<br>Another technique is placing the back of one hand below the lower jaw and forcing it down with the muscle under the jaw.<br>Opening the jaw like going to a dentist appointment.<br>Grinning like the Joker on Batman which pulls the muscles on either side of the neck.<br>If your hands get tired, I&#39;ve instructed people in my Church Choir to make  partial clam shells, out of heavy craft paper, that can hook over each ear and will redirect the sound to the ears.<br>I&#39;m almost 60 now. Haven&#39;t practiced as much lately and now my range has deepened to a deep baritone to alto. <br>If you practice, you can correct your voice.", "comment_date": "2022-03-30T11:00:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jouko", "comment_text": "<b>Voice dysmorphia intensifies</b>", "comment_date": "2022-03-30T10:59:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cat Astrophic", "comment_text": "So recorded voice is my real voice?", "comment_date": "2022-03-30T10:57:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ultraneko", "comment_text": "I thought it was just because I hate myself", "comment_date": "2022-03-30T10:56:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Good Just Good", "comment_text": "I hate my voice even my friends ask me why i sound like this but not my loyal friends it hard to make friends lol", "comment_date": "2022-03-30T10:55:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nao Sei", "comment_text": "People always said i had a low voice and i always agreed i have a rather low voice for my gender....until i heard it recorded and i was like &quot;you guys are kidding me.
