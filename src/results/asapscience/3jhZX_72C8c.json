If an animal with it dies in nature nearby plants can absorb it. It&#39;s safe to say that most wild mammal species in the US have prion infected members. Cows, squirrels, deer... And petri dish studies have shown that they can infect human tissue. Its called variant CJD when a person gets it (CJD is a death sentence). There is no cure and no reason it wont keep spreading. Cooked food is still infectous, bleached surfaces are still infectious, mammals (humans) can spread it via transfusions, saliva, and waste. One variant causes fatal insomnia in humans and is inherited genetically. You dont have to be a cannibal to be scared of this stuff. It&#39;s like the flood in Halo, just the curruption of life itself. Imagine if viruses mutated to produce these things! Infected cows have been shown to have contagious milk.
