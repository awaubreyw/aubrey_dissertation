I really used to think so too so I always downplayed it, like when I get angry, irritated or emotional, I just hide from everyone and distance myself because it makes me cry even more when someone sees me and mentions that I&#39;m being a crybaby for attention. I really felt like I go through depression and sudden wave of sadness and emptiness just hits me.

Many aspects of medicine vary from person to person, from pain management (a famous one) to mental health. Second, menstrual health and PMS is understudied compared to other conditions. Women themselves are understudied - 80% of pain studies are conducted on male men or male mice, leading to poorer pain management in non-men. Third, there is some well-documented bias in the clinic - including menstrual issues and women&#39;s pain care. We are not far beyond the days of treating PMS as &quot;hysteria.&quot; Honestly, the notion that womens biology is inherently more nebulous and mysterious is such a lazy viewpoint, and its &quot;lost cause&quot; implication perpetuates the same sexist attitudes that lead to these issues continuing to be understudied.

There was a huge media sensation because a woman wrote an older kids novel in which a young woman gets her period at some point in the story. It was shocking and controversial and very progressive.( Are you there God ? Its me Margaret.) I guess my parents thought it taught me everything I needed to know and they were off the hook. It didn&#39;t though.   I woke up in sixth grade and I had bled and I thought, &quot; Well that&#39;s over&quot;. I was too embarrassed to say  anything so  I put a few washcloths in my pants just in case some left over blood came out and went to school. At noon I went home for lunch because I was starting to feel awful and no one was home. My abdomen started hurting like crazy and not only wasn&#39;t the bleeding over it was getting much worse. I was convinced something had gone terribly wrong like something had ruptured and I was dying. I laid on my bed convinced I would probably be dead by the time anyone came home and didn&#39;t go back to school but curled up to await death. There was no 911 and I didn&#39;t know the number for help and I preferred death by hemorrhage to death by embarrassment.  My mom came home and my fear of death overcame my embarrassment and I confessed the tragic news. My mom hooked me up and explained it all and gave me a hot water bottle and aspirin. In 1974 there was  no Tylenol or ibuprofen the miracle drug so it didn&#39;t help much. ( Forgotten US history..Tylenol came out soon after 1974 and just as it was getting popular someone put poison in a large batch of bottles distributed in the US, people died and the tamper proof foil sealed bottle in a sealed  box became the norm. That is why today people in severe pain or having an allergic reaction are not able to access the medicine they need before passing into an apoplectic fit from trying to open the bottle without the assistance of a child.)", "comment_date": "2018-07-05T06:08:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DJKoollord", "comment_text": "I will respect women even more after watching this.", "comment_date": "2018-07-05T00:15:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AnimeAustin1", "comment_text": "I would have liked this video without the unfunny girl.", "comment_date": "2018-07-04T21:21:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dead girls dont say no", "comment_text": "I remember when u got my first period, I got ripped the throat out of everything that moved and I got angry at everyone for no reason", "comment_date": "2018-07-04T03:05:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "2muchofme 2", "comment_text": "I started crying 3 days ago for no reason lol", "comment_date": "2018-07-03T18:05:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nagella Jean-Baptiste", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t get moody thank God, just my stomach feels blubbering when It about to come.

The sperm fertilizes in the fallopian tube, which is the wide opening next to the ovary, in 1 day after it was released.8 It dies after 1 day, and takes about 4 days to move to the uterus. Thus, sperm cannot fertilize an egg in the uterus, only in the fallopian tube. So if there&#39;s a baby, it will have reached a further stage of cell spliting, so that it&#39;s good to dig itself in the uterine lining that&#39;s been building up for those 4 days mentioned earlier. If that happends, hormones are sent to the body so that the lining doesn&#39;t break off. That&#39;s pregnancy. If not, the yellow body thats the bag the ripe egg was in in the ovary, will die and the hormones will not be sent to the body, thus brealing off the uterine lining, causing a period.

Then  a few days after period (like around 2 weeks) an ovule is liberated from the ovaries but it only goes in the fallopian tube. It doesn\u2019t go to the uterus before it is fertilized by the spermatozoid. So when spermatozoid come inside of the woman they have to go all the way from the vagina to the fallopian tube and a lot of things are in their way to make it harder.

Cramps are primarily caused by our shitty modern diets, low in magnesium and potassium.  That&#39;s literally all you need to do for that part.  Estrogen and serotonin, that&#39;s a little different but there are various regional plants (every region has at least a few that were regularly consumed by humans) that actually contain compounds that modulate hormones and neurotransmitters (for both sexes).  But we don&#39;t really eat those very much anymore, unless you&#39;re a hippie (I guess lol, or someone who buys extracts from health nut stores like me), or living in a third world country where food sources have less variety.   Telling everyone it&#39;s okay for a woman to act like a B, or to actually celebrate such behavior, actually makes her likelier to be that way and be less capable or willing of self-monitoring (same as telling girls they are bad at math, or telling boys they are good at math, same as telling boys it&#39;s alright for them to show aggression).  PMS is not entirely natural, this is why every woman has wildly different so-called PMS symptoms, and why some have none at all and have no idea a period is coming other than the date on the calendar (which is the way it should be).  It&#39;s a huge evolutionary disadvantage for a female of any species to be regularly crippled enough that their ability to hunt or flee predators in compromised (because they&#39;re in pain or feel sick/tired) or problem-solve or appropriately respond to environmental stimuli in her usual rational manner (which would be a threat not only to the female directly, but any offspring she might have at the time).

Also as a side note, both my friend and I had noticed that our endurance with regards to pain increased exponentially the more often it happened, so although I can&#39;t state unanimously that this is the case for periods, one would think that eventually you&#39;d become less prone to it, especially if it is as bad as they say.

Aren&#39;t people generally pretty cranky when they&#39;re in pain? &quot;Moody&quot; is a vague term, so explaining that PMS happens separately from the period doesn&#39;t really tell us anything about whether a woman&#39;s mood could be impacted by the physical experience of the period itself.<br><br>I didn&#39;t really like the implication that women are totally at the mercy of their biology and need understanding because they are almost certainly going to behave in an erratic, emotional manner during that time of month.

I know far too many women who manage to perform consistently despite hormonal fluctuations, and who do not simply lose control every month.<br><br>In any case, I don&#39;t think people should tolerate bad behavior or unreasonable demands from women based on this, and certainly not physical violence.

Its not like we can go around yelling at our colleagues and bosses in the workplace without facing consequences for it. So while some people could use it as an excuse we cannot deny that these natural mood changes are genuinely something that women go through every month.\u00a0<br><br>And regarding feminism. Its such a hot debate here and lets make clear that the definition for feminism is &quot;the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes&quot;. Those women who are man-haters and want female world domination are not feminists. Feminism is an act that benefits both men and women. Have we achieved this ideal world? No. Politically- 88 of 435 members of the house of representatives are women (20%), economically- 23 of 500 fortune 500 companies have female CEO&#39;s (4.6%), socially- while I think the most progress has been made socially for women its hard to measure this with numbers (since there are many types of categories) and so I cannot spoon feed to you how equality is still not achieved within this category. While the population is pretty 50/50 among men and women why aren&#39;t the above numbers also roughly 50/50? Is it because women are not as smart as men?

Sometimes it&#39;s this weird clumpy, sticky shit that sticks to your coochie and makes it way to your thigh if you don&#39;t change your pad/tampon fast enough.

I had the stabbing feeling once before and I had to go to the nurses office to get a hotpad. I cried for a few minutes because it really hurts to the point of immobilization. Sometimes, it&#39;s not even just cramps. Sometimes, it&#39;s something weird, like back pain or soreness.\u00a0<br>4. The hormones just spike up everywhere. Guys have hormones too, but I&#39;m not sure if their levels spike up to the same degree that girls do during their periods. My friend has is pretty bad where the spike in hormones causes her to break out in pimples. FYI, no it&#39;s not puberty.

I DARE you to say what you have posted on here to your mothers, sisters, grandmothers, and girlfriends/wives. A kick to the balls is NOTHING compared to what women go through in childbirth and periods. And don&#39;t give me that &quot;well why do they want a child if it hurts every time and why don&#39;t they just get their tubes tied&quot; bullshit because there is a difference between having a child and getting kicked in the nuts. A child is a HUMAN LIFE. Giving birth and having pms and periods should NEVER EVER BE COMPARED TO BEING KICKED IN THE BALLS. Having periods and giving birth are a part of nature, which last time I checked, we still haven&#39;t been able to control without the human race completely dying out from every woman wanting to get her tubes tied so she doesn&#39;t have to have pms and periods. Women have DIED from this shit. DIED SO THAT THEIR CHILD COULD LIVE. SO THAT HUMANS COULD STILL WALK THIS EARTH FULL OF SHITHEADS LIKE YOU. Think before you spill your horrible and ignorant arguments all over my face. Go hug the women in your life and be fucking grateful for the life you have today. Also, thank you to all the guys and girls who support women on their periods and when their in labor and giving birth. Trust me, you make our lives 100 times easier just by knowing someone cares, even if we&#39;re not the best at showing it.

Atresia begins at birth and continues throughout the course of the woman&#39;s reproductive life. When a woman reaches puberty and starts to menstruate, only about 400,000 follicles remain. With each menstrual cycle, a thousand follicles are lost and only one lucky little follicle will actually mature into an ovum (egg), which is released into the fallopian tube, kicking off ovulation. That means that of the one to two million follicles, only about 400 will ever mature. So technically, we have only cca 400 eggs.

So guys, if you&#39;ve ever had a kidney stone, Congrats! You are feeling a tiny bit more pain than childbirth. So there, there&#39;s your facts.

We can&#39;t control all the hormones racing through our body up to our head, causing us to be emotional. Think about it. Girls are generally already more emotional than boys. Times that by about 7. So guys need to stop complaining about a girls emotions. If you complain to her, it will only make it worse. Understand she&#39;s in a lot of pain, and there isn&#39;t a lot she can do about it. So don&#39;t be an asshole. Go buy her some chocolates,a teddy bear, and cuddle with her. She will be grateful and happier, therefore less emotional.

It&#39;s the same thing with women, unless you are a woman, you dont really have the right to say whether or not something is difficult or if a woman is cursed because you most likely have never expierenced it. I really blame schools for not teaching males about periods, and the whole process, because it does tend to result in them being close minded and almost scared that blood comes out of a female organ. It&#39;s sad that something so natural is viewed as taboo in society or dirty, when in reality its fascinating.

And before we hear any one saying &quot;we deserve something for dealing with women,&quot; or &quot;men are just as important as women.&quot; There are other ways. The first coming to mind is that female bone marrow can have the essential genetic information to have a baby. To put it in perspective, female sperm.<br><br>2) all women&#39;s periods are different. As ASAP said, no two menstrual cycles are alike. Some women get mood swings some do not. Some get cramps, some can have three day periods, some can have seven. Assuming that all women have five day periods with intense pain and super bleeding is extreme. And this isn&#39;t directed towards just men. A lot of women in the comments are going insane on men saying &quot;how&#39;d you like it if it felt like you were getting stabbed in the abdomen&quot; not all women face that same pain.<br><br>3) all we ask is that we have sympathy. No sympathy is not going to get you laid, or earn you respect, or get you noticed. But what happened to being a decent human being? Simply saying &quot;I get it, it&#39;s not a fun time. I have some new found knowledge&quot; would be great. You expect all girls to appreciate you ganging up on someone who just wants to be nice? Please just think before you speak and be nice in the comments. Because you look like shitty people if you decided to start hating on anybody, women and men.<br><br>Men will never know what it&#39;s like to have a period. And I accept that.

I don&#39;t think its fair and rather sexist. Its especially sexist to say women can&#39;t have any sort of power because SOME WOMEN experience certain emotional responses to hormonal changes the majority of women go through. Not all women experience emotional or physical changes when pmsing. I for example just get physical symptoms. Headaches, bloating, back pain, fatigue, for usually 10 days before my period. Although I have this physical discomfort I have no emotional changes. I get emotional sometimes, but it doesn&#39;t always happen on my period. For those who are emotional on their period it may be hormones but for some it may just be a correlation. And correlation is not causation. Just because a trait of masculinity is expressing less emotion does not mean all men have less emotions then female. They just express emotion differently or not at all.

Some girls I know have it so bad, they can&#39;t stand up and continuously throw up because of their periods and the pain. And then comes time if you get pregnant.
