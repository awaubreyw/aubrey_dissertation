Schools are not helping us become better or perform better. Instead, they literally destroy us mentally and physically by giving us hundreds of tasks with no free time for ourselves so that we cannot spend it living our lives or with our family. They physically destroy our bodies by forcing us to wake up early and making our already tired body do a lot of work to the point were standing on both of your legs is impossible. Schools are the reason for me having mental illnesses (Depression, Anxiety, Social Anxiety, and stress) and the reason of why I&#39;m always so tired and can&#39;t work on any of my projects or spend time with my family. I was once studying 4 years ago when I got a phone call, saying that my grandmother had recently passed away. I had an exam the next day, but my Grandmother&#39;s funeral was also the next day, so I called the school to be excused so that I can attend my Grandmother&#39;s funeral and what they said literally shocked me. They said, &quot;You can attend the funeral but, you&#39;ll fail the exam in the process and will have to take it in the summer vacation.&quot; I ended up missing my grandmother&#39;s funeral because of a subject that I would never use in my real life. That broke me. At the end of the day, school does nothing but torture kids and steal their childhood from them.", "comment_date": "2022-08-31T16:02:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vicioussnake", "comment_text": "8 year-olds sending this video to their parents an as excuse to not go to school:", "comment_date": "2022-08-30T16:23:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mr robotto", "comment_text": "This exactly why i lose haft of my braincells and started to become dumb on things iam good at!

Half of the time, they dont even know what they\u2019re teaching, but the children do. But does it matter? No. Other teachers I\u2019ve encountered love to be sexist. They just LOVE to blatantly degrade boys and get away with it because they\u2019re teachers. We always have to hide our thoughts from most of our teachers because when we say something against degrading humans, they say its stupid and lecture us about why we\u2019re wrong. I had another teacher who blamed us for failing even though she never actually teaches us anything. Her subject is Math. Its hard. But what does she do? She walks in the classroom, writes some equations on the chalk board, then the subject just becomes nonexistent cos she starts talking about her life, then the bell rings, class is over, and we learned NOTHING about Math. Im not even exaggerating this. Then the exams come, we fail, and its our fault for not having any guidance on what the hell to do. She starts yelling at us, calling us stupid, slamming her hands on the desk, throwing the chalkboard eraser - and its all her fault anyway. She never told us what to do.

Science has too much pressure, and I don&#39;t find the subjects enjoyable. I have bad memory, so I&#39;m always struggling too much with tests.

Nowadays, I can barely read because I have to do schoolwork, I can barely write because my creativity is dwindling, I can&#39;t play soccer because I&#39;m so afraid of doing something wrong, I can&#39;t remain curious about science because I need to focus exactly on the subject we&#39;re on and remember everything. I&#39;m struggling to remain creative. I&#39;ve always been told that my imagination is &quot;too much,&quot; and that I needed to tone it down. But now, I can barely think of anything other than school. I miss the adventures I used to come up with in my head, as if I was dreaming. It felt so light, and filled with fantasy. I wanted to become an author, and put all my crazy ideas into words. For awhile, I was doing good! But school interrupted.

Sometimes I&#39;d turn on my GameBoy or something and then get caught in be in trouble, even though it was only because I literally couldn&#39;t sleep that early and parents rarely listen to their kids about things like that. But, because I didn&#39;t know any better, I thought it was just me.<br>But people keep thinking that all of this somehow happened without anyones knowledge and that no one realized it was going to be like this. But that&#39;s bullshit. That&#39;d be like saying that the companies who make cigarettes had no knowledge of the literal poison in the product that they choose to sell to people back when they pretended it was just a nice stress reliever and not deadly at all, giving it to soldiers for free so they&#39;d become addicted....<br>So we don&#39;t just need to fix things, we all need to realize that is was made this way intentionally.

Don&#39;t forget the horrible education itself, I swear when I was in primary school, wanna know what I learnt from grades 3 to 6? How to read an analogue clock, and how decimals work. That&#39;s it, and its not because I wasn&#39;t learning what they taught me, it was because that&#39;s ALL THEY TAUGHT ME! OVER THREE YEARS! I would say fractions too but they taught me that in grades 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. In grade seven they taught me long division, how to add positive integers, how to add negative integers, and how to multiply positive integers. All of which I had been taught many times in previous grades and long division I was taught by my older brother because or coding to school I was to stupid to be able to learn it. I also at that point (from my brother again) knew the basics of algebra, and could solve things involving algebra and sequences, but all school would do was teach me to convert units of measurement and find the area of a square. AGAIN. They could have taught me useful things like a basic concept of what things are worth and how to manage money and finances, but no. Now I need to ask my parents about every aspect of selling my art because I don&#39;t know how much it&#39;s worth, and couldn&#39;t even imagine getting a house because it&#39;s to expensive. They could have taught me basic first aid, or how to spot a scam, I know you might be thinking &quot;You were to young to learn that&quot; but is it a better idea to not tell a young child that? Especially with the increasing access to the internet? What about how to cook? That would be very useful. How to judge risk? How to do LITERALY ANYTHING OTHER THEN WHAT YOU ARE TEACHING US. It&#39;s not just math I had this problem with, wanna know how many times I learnt what a ballad is? How many times that they told me THE BASICS OF A SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT. You&#39;d think you don&#39;t need 4 years to tell you that you can only change one in an experiment or it won&#39;t be fair? Well clearly my 12 year old brain is FAR TO STUPID TO ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT. Couldn&#39;t you have taught me biology? I&#39;m sure many people would want to know the specifics of a human eye, that&#39;s interesting! Isn&#39;t school supposed to be a way to experiment with different things to find your passion? Instead of one day of touching an led to a battery, could we have had a course on electronics? Were not stupid, we wont hurt ourselves, and if you worried, we can all just wear rubber gloves! Could you teach me how to manage my time so assignments aren&#39;t impossible? They didn&#39;t teach me how to write an essay, yet get annoyed at me when I don&#39;t know how. This is why I&#39;m homeschooled, and why I plan to teach my kids from home to. Literally the only thing I got from school was social interaction and there are many ways to get that. Imagine if school was a place where you hang out with a bunch of other kids your age and chose from a huge range of options, none of which are mandatory and all of which don&#39;t have restrictions. Imagine if instead of a bunch of people chucked in the same area and forced to &quot;Get along&quot; and &quot;Be friends with everyone&quot; it was a community, who work together to build things, and plan stuff out. Like, imagine if instead of sitting in a room being talked at for hours on end to end up drawing a single picture for this &quot;Community event&quot; You and a group of others interested in finance worked together to invest in something. Imagine if instead of needing an adult to hot glue something for you, you got to do it yourself, with gloves and an adult supervising for the first couple of times to stop you from injuring yourself. Imagine working together with a group of friends to plan out a chicken housing and care, with the finance group helping figure out the costs, and the building group helping to design the coop, then you go to the principle and present all your work to see if it will get accepted, even if it doesn&#39;t have they not now learnt the effort that goes into caring for pets? and if it does get accepted, then they build the coop on their own (With supervision of course, insurance is still a thing and so is getting sued) and they pick out the chickens, they raise the chickens themselves and name each one. Or maybe there a group who learn 3d modeling, and work with the electronics group to make a cool device to like, open cans or something. Seriously. It may be hard to get going and obviously would need lots of changes to make it doable but at least it&#39;s not the broken system we have now.<br><br>WOW THAT WAS LONG!

However, school is forcing children to all think the same. Like many other people, I am getting decreasingly creative and I&#39;d go as far to say intelligent. I am so used to not using creativity or solving problems that I literally cannot think logically. School is not preparing kids for life. My brother is now a functioning member of society. He works full time, lives on his own, etc. When he graduated, it was my dad who had to teach him how to do taxes, how to drive, how to do all the things that adults have to do.

We should literally close ALL schools on this planet right now, except for elementary schools, but these need to be completely redefined. Learning is nothing but indoctrination with something idiotic, what some other idiots have learned from older idiots, or \u201eThe Elder Idiots\u201c how I call them. Basically you\u2018re still an idiot, even if you pass ALL exams in Elementary School, in Highschool, in College and yes, even in University. That\u2018s simply because all you waste your time for is LEARNING. Learning is worth-, use- and senseless once you grow past these elementary skills to be learned. Other than that, never learn a single thing in your life. Don\u2018t even bother. Instead try to understand. So what I would do is completely revolutionize the educational system like this:<br>You would be in Preschool and Elementary School until the age of 12, in which basic skills are the focus and yes, you\u2018ll have to learn here and there but it\u2018s mostly playful learning and it\u2018s nothing too complicated. But it also builds up the base knowledge on which YOU AND your teachers decide what paths, what possible careers and what skills fit you the most and then you get to decide which of the fitting paths would be the right one for you.<br>From there on you\u2018d be in some Secondary Personal Development School, which completely replaces Highschool, College AND University. You won\u2018t ever have to learn anything there. You\u2018ll UNDERSTAND. This School is completely based on the process of understanding, rather than learning and forgetting. And of course your interest might change therefore you can switch to different classes later on because the process of understanding doesn\u2018t build up slowly like learning does, if you already understand math but you decide physics is more of your interest, then you\u2018ll understand that as well, just like you\u2018ll also understand history. And understanding always beats knowing. Because knowledge is just your memory, remembering what someone else said, may it be written in a book, told in a documentary oder classroom or shown somewhere, someone learned it somehow from someone else who themselves just learned it from somewhere else and so on and no one actually knows whether it is the truth or not. You\u2018re completely dependent on hoping that your teacher knows what he\u2018s talking about and I\u2018m not on boat with that\u2026 because most of them don\u2018t. Not by bad intention, just because they never learned to understand themselves, they also just understood how to learn.<br>Also your brain makes your memories go swoosh all the time and they definitely aren\u2018t the most reliable source of information at all. But if you understand something it goes way deeper than just your memory. It fulfills you. That doesn\u2018t mean all of you out there don\u2018t understand ANYTHING but you rely too much on learning and knowing.<br>You don\u2018t need to know anything, since you can\u2018t know everything, no matter how much you learn.<br>But if you truly understand anything, you\u2018re capable of understanding everything. Because it\u2018s a process that starts with that one realization\u2026 \u201eI don\u2018t understand anything.\u201c that is the first thing you\u2018ll have to understand and from there on you can start your journey through the world as enlightened person that understands things rather than just learns something about them.<br>There is ALWAYS a why behind everything in this universe. Nothing exists or happens completely without a cause and it happens like it happens and is how it is for reasons that lie in the past and maybe in the future. But at the same time there is no past and future, there always just is and will be right here and right now. And if you understand anything right here and now and thats all that exists basically, then you\u2018re capable of understanding everything without having to learn about it.

Imagine how much better people would do in school if math, english, science, history, geography, etc.... incorporated things that you were interested in.<br><br>Okay, what about limited school resources? Not all teachers are adept at certain things, there is a limited number of teachers, and schools have limited funding.<br><br>Surely with the budget that the military has and the salaries that our politicians get, there is more money that can be spent on educating people better. Hire more teachers, better ventilate the schools so that the students and staff don&#39;t end up with health problems (asbestos for example), incorporate better mental health, hire some mental health experts, instruct teachers on how to better identify this stuff, so that students don&#39;t end up overworked and depressed, and most importantly, incorporate something interesting into these dry bland subjects. <br><br>Yeah schools offer courses like music, computer science, psychology, etc... but the offering of these courses is inconsistent, and it still doesn&#39;t help people with the bland subjects. There is plenty of math, science, history, and English to learn for auto mechanics, there is plenty of math, science, history, and English to learn for computer science, there is plenty of math, science, history, and English to learn for culinary, even if a specific interest lacks an emphasis on these cor subjects, some incorporation is better than none.<br><br>This is objectively better since students, like me, that cannot focus on anything, have a better chance at not being left behind. This is good for people that already excel too since they will have an advantage heading into post secondary, and learning about the work that surrounds their interests will help them learn if they want to turn their passion into a living or not. Some people want to keep their hobby as a hobby, and lots of people have no clue what they want to heading into post secondary.

Even on weekends my parents don&#39;t let me sleep in as much as I need to to be able to catch up on sleep so no matter what time of week or day, you could give me 10 minutes of free time in a room with a couch and I would for sure be asleep on it by the time you&#39;re back.<br>I&#39;m also constantly depressed. During any part of the school year, even on breaks (although less so) because I have a looming sense of dread and overwhelming fear and anxiety about going back to school that it keeps me up at night and gives me panic attacks. Even during the summer I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m depressed, but something&#39;s definitely wrong with me because I&#39;m so used to constantly having something to do that I don&#39;t know what to do with myself.<br>Also, I&#39;m currently sick and have been for weeks because I had COVID (can&#39;t recover without sleep, but I can&#39;t sleep hardly at all because I&#39;m so far behind in classes, also increasing my anxiety) and obviously had to stay home for that, but other than that my parents don&#39;t let me stay home when I&#39;m sick (like have a fever or throw up or have a sore throat). Case in point, I have a doctors&#39; appt literally tomorrow and it&#39;s scheduled for like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4u6oOQ77mg&amp;t=7m15s\">7:15</a> or something so I won&#39;t miss too much school (which starts at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4u6oOQ77mg&amp;t=7m45s\">7:45</a>).<br><b>Trigger warning for this next paragraph</b><br>I know this is extremely unhealthy and a horrible thing to do to yourself, but once I got so anxious and stressed about school that I forced myself to throw up the night before... three separate times in one week. It didn&#39;t even work, and I was still sent to school the next day, feeling awful.<br><b>End of trigger warning</b><br>Even though I logically know it does nothing to help, I have started avoiding my schoolwork when I get home, leaving me to do it in a rush before school starts or during other classes. This is partially because I&#39;m so exhausted I just want to pass out on my bed, which I often do on accident, or when I&#39;m trying to do my homework I sometimes just fall asleep and then wake up disoriented. But a lot of the time I just end up lying around rewatching my favorite TV shows or sometimes movies. I tell myself &quot;I&#39;ll work after this episode&quot; but I never do. I think I do this because I want to feel happy, and being comforted by known and loved characters and plotlines makes me feel safe and forget about my problems for a while. I can even envision myself in that world... which has now become a whole other problem as I think my lack of sleep and being stuck in my room doing homework for long periods of time has contributed to me going slightly crazy and talking to myself as if I&#39;m talking to my favorite fictional characters sometimes. I know they&#39;re not real. I&#39;m not stupid. Just bored and lonely. Please don&#39;t judge me. Anyway, I lose track of time, my parents yell at me for a solid chunk of time for not getting any work done, and I &quot;go to sleep,&quot; telling myself &quot;I&#39;ll do my homework after I get ready for bed.&quot; It never happens.<br>Speaking of, what little &quot;self care&quot; I had previously is slipping. I have no motivation to even get up and shower or brush my teeth anymore. I disgust myself when this happens, but I can&#39;t seem to muster the energy to just get up and do simple tasks like these. My room is often a mess for this same reason.<br>And this is just the mental (and somewhat physical) effects school itself has had on me, not even the environment I&#39;m in when I&#39;m there, feeling unrecognized and ignored and like I don&#39;t belong constantly.", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T04:42:47Z", "likes_count": 25}, {"comment_by": "Someone2124", "comment_text": "bro im just boutta drop out, school boring &amp; useless asf", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T04:41:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kim Luker", "comment_text": "EE", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T04:01:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ayu", "comment_text": "I love when someone roasts school", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T03:56:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Vargas", "comment_text": "Me, a 14 yeat old, watching this at 11:00 p.m:<br><br>Huh, interesting...", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T03:25:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xx Radi\u00f8MUTO xX", "comment_text": "To put it quite frankly, the school system in general hasn\u2019t been changed in years (in most if not all places.) and its still stuck in the Factory era of the past.

That will frustrate many of us knowing that we still need to be aware of the next class. The second thing is how stresfull it is. School is one of the most stresfull in our life. It ruins many lifes and im gonna tell why in a bit. We need to take about 5 hours of our time at home, just to finish studying and doing homework. Its too much to say so im just gonna say the most important things. The reason why many kids/teens are depressed its because parents (im also affected by this, not depressed but not too far from being!). Parents make our life 10 times harder for all of us at school. They force us to study and do homework because of one thing. Grades. As you see most parents wont remember something you will ask them. Why? Because they finished school years ago and they forgot. In conclusion, they dont really care how smart you are. They care about the grades. Grades are not like some rating to your knowledge. For parents thats basically everything. Its very sad how many kids in out generation cant live a happy childhood because 3 quarters of theyre time is based only on school and sleep. Sadly, some parents will get abusive in the place where you have bad grades (my mom abused me for getting low grades without my dad knowing, but after he found out she stopped. she was doing it in the worst ways, she would slap me, force me to get my clothes down and go stand in the front of our door so people can see me so she could emberass me. she forced me to to dangerous things like getting my body out of the window, and i could get seriously injuried from the height that window was. i know the last 2 are weird and way too harash but its sadly real. nowdays sometimes is still get beaten up but not abused).<br>I have a lot of things i can say about school and more world wide problems, but it would be too muxh for me to put in 1 comment. Maybe ill update this update from day to day in order to complete day.

I\u2019ve always had a gripe with how early school starts. I\u2019ve always been a high output person given that I have high input, with output being level of brain function, and input being energy requirements. Essentially, I need much more sleep than my peers in order to function, but when I get it, I can sit at the top of my classes easily. However; this isn\u2019t always the case, as I have a dual enrollment program with a local university. I usually go into school at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4u6oOQ77mg&amp;t=10m25s\">10:25</a> due to a privilege program (I\u2019m in grade 12, people who aren\u2019t in the program go in at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4u6oOQ77mg&amp;t=8m05s\">8:05</a>). But twice weekly, I go to the university early and need to get up at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4u6oOQ77mg&amp;t=7m30s\">7:30</a> if I want to be comfortably ready and there early. And, since I sleep late, I am often dragging myself out of bed at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4u6oOQ77mg&amp;t=7m45s\">7:45</a>. It\u2019s only 2 days, but it still contributes on to considerable burnout on my part, so considerable in fact that this Wednesday I forgot how to read temporarily. I was able to see the words, but I couldn\u2019t connect them together to form a meaning. Definitely one of the weirdest moments of my life caused in part by a terrible schedule.

The level of stress and anxiety I got from school was so great that I would stay up later and later into the night every school night trying to avoid the inevitable turn of the next morning. I retreated further and further into a rapidly unstable mind just to cope with it, and by the end of high school I would commonly fall into delusional fantasies when I got home to escape and have panic attacks daily when at school. The pandemic was a blessing to me because it enabled me to finally escape the hellhole and stay home. But by that point it was my senior year, and I think the damage has already been done. I can&#39;t drive a car due to rapid onset anxiety from being in the driver&#39;s seat and all that driving entails and how my poor memory could cause problems, and I can&#39;t get close to an educational building without shutting down. At this point I don&#39;t think I can handle college, partly because I refuse to fall into the pit that is college debt, partly because I can&#39;t handle being in educational buildings and working a job feels like climbing Mount Everest.

It&#39;s not just how early school starts, it&#39;s how much work students are pressured into taking on. Especially in high school, the perception shared to students is to constantly be working and doing difficult classes in order to get into a good college and be successful, which only increases how many hours we need in a day. Plus, the way grades are set up in America, a student&#39;s performance in a class is measured less on personal self-growth and more about constantly regurgitating information and never messing up. A student who starts a class not knowing anything, but learns the most about the topic, most likely would have a grade around the C to B range, since they would have to make lots of mistakes to actually learn. On the other hand, a hypothetical student who knows everything and never messes up would get a perfect 100 percent at the end of the year. Both of these factors combine to create an environment in which students are put into a never-ending rat race, and are forced to stay up late, as they feel like they never have the time to finish their work otherwise. I can speak from personal experience, as I am currently in high school, that it feels like there is never enough time. No one gets enough sleep. Everyone is so tired and overworked. I talked to one of my peers, and they told me that school feels so suffocating, like you can&#39;t breathe. They told me that it feels like you&#39;re never able to take a break or go to sleep because, in order to be successful, you have to do everything at once. School needs to change because it is such a major reason why mental and physical health is such a problem in people my age.

I\u2019m teaching myself math so I can pass. The best teachers in our lives are our parents (if they aren\u2019t toxic or abusive) and those who have higher knowledge and wisdom that they share with us. Now I\u2019m bot saying that they are the best way to learn, but is a good way to learn. My mother doesn\u2019t even know any of this math we are being taught in American schools. To teach myself is something that I find effective. I know my wants and desires. Everything is how it is. If you have a book in a subject you despise or fail at.

What&#39;s needed is more informed adult representation on behalf of the students.

However, this requires parents and other adults to take a considerable interest in developmental psychology which is not always at the forefront of their minds especially when they recall how hardcore school was for them when they were students.

wake around 10:00am in the morning to get dress and get to school around 12:00am in the morning<br><br>we work from 12:30am to 5:30pm <br><br>ya&#39;ll have about 9 hours or straight work<br><br>and I

teach you because they more simplified versions depending on the class<br><br>now I&#39;m not saying secondary school is better cause you have to work harder depending on how many credits you&#39;ve

For so long infact that I didn&#39;t even know I was legitimately depressed. I would have mental breakdowns on a daily basis, beating myself up in fits of anger at home and bursting into tears at the counselors office. It was horrible, I am so glad to never have to see the 4 walls of the tiny classroom I was holed up in every day for 2 years ever again. It brought me to the worst mental state that I&#39;d ever been in. The &quot;help&quot; they provided only made it worse, sending people to my home every few weeks at random to check up on me, the day I got my birthday present I was screaming and shouting at the top of my lungs in happiness because my Girlfriend got me a new graphics card. They were waiting outside knocking and they thought I had a mental episode. They didn&#39;t believe that I was genuinely just happy and so I was sent into a youth therapy program where I was forced to talk to people I didn&#39;t know about every little detail of my life. And while I still wasn&#39;t well in the head I had to lie and pretend that I was slowly recovering and getting better when in fact, being forced to go to therapy was just another unnecessary stress that lead me into some emotional episodes and fits of self harm. It is disgusting that the current state of schooling is at all considered acceptable and I hope my story sheds some light on the fact that change is necessary for the sake of all the other kids in the same situation I was in. It&#39;ll be okay, I want everyone in my situation to know that it will be okay in the end. As hard as it can be to see in those times of stress and anxiety, better days are to come and you shouldn&#39;t let school be too big a burden on your childhood. I attempted suicide multiple times as a kid and I&#39;m an idiot for doing so. There&#39;s a lot more to life and it&#39;s truly, deeply disgusting that for many, the first 18 years are nothing but torture on a daily basis.

I have ADHD and a few months after I began at my uni, I began to get chronically exhausted and stressed and have developed a tic disorder that really impacts my functionality even more. My school runs on a quarterly system, with 10 weeks equaling a quarter, and our materials are so intensive that every single student is stressed, exhausted, depressed, anxious, etc. I am not the only person w ADHD that has developed the same things from being at this Uni, which I find really disgusting that regardless of the major health impact these classes have had on us, the University only cares about money. The worst part is that once you start at this university, you can&#39;t leave because credits do not transfer, and what makes that even worse, is that the school does not make that a public notice before beginning there. It&#39;s a complete shock when you get there how incredibly rigorous and exhausting it is and then after about a year of studies, you finally find out that you cannot leave unless you want to start over again. So sad and we all tried to justify the actions, however, once COVID hit, the school would not lower tuition even though we were not using the utilities we were paying for, and with that, I believe everyone saw how much of a scam our University is. The worst part is that we are the most successful and famous art school in the world, as we have campuses in Europe and one that recently closed down in China. Parents send their kids to study here and so many high schoolers say that it&#39;s their dream school. The part that makes me the most frustrated is how some of our professors will literally shorten our deadlines a few days before a presentation because &quot;sleep is important,&quot; so instead they want us to stay up all night for days straight to then turn in a project 6 hrs earlier because they believe it&#39;ll help when in reality, I know all students will agree that, NO IT DOES NOT. Then when we try to speak up, they love to say, &quot;Welcome to reality,&quot; as if that&#39;s a real reality. It is not and that has been PROVEN by every alumni who have said that our school could care less about us and that the workplace post-graduation is so much better and bosses are so much more understanding and helpful. Just to give yall a reference, our projects are full-on interior architectural projects that would be completed by an entire team within 1yr, however, we only get 10 weeks and we do it individually.

I was busy studying for a test cause I felt so stressed with the amount of work I had, when I&#39;ve finished 1 exam, there&#39;s always more exams to study and memorize in the next couple days for and that loop just continues on and on all the time, I even had a stronger anxiety attack due to this exact reason while trying to study for that test and I&#39;ve been feeling anxious and stressed these days, the stress of how little time I have and how many tests there are and much work there is to be done, even today I have a presentation and another short test due tomorrow so I&#39;m kind of restless and I studied that late also because last friday, 4 days ago, when I came home and decided to take a small nap, I woke up at midnight, it seems that I slept for 8 hours. Holy shit. Well, after being 5 hours of being awake, i fell asleep again for 6 hours, and then the next night I was oversleeping 9 hours after that and I felt sleepy even when I tried to study even after those many hours of sleep I&#39;ve had so i kind of took my time with it. On top of that, there are countless of days where I sleep only 3-4 hours at schooldays and when it&#39;s holiday, no matter when i go to sleep, I always wake up at 10-12 am, probably cause I&#39;ve been worked up with school. I usually have woken up at 6 and went to sleep somewhere near midnight, but never do i normally wake up at the middle of the day or sleep that much..it&#39;s frustrating.", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T15:12:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UncomfortableSunsets", "comment_text": "IT ISSSSS", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T15:11:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Broken X", "comment_text": "how tf do i stop it then", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T15:02:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TimeWarpEatsCrayons", "comment_text": "when i was 6 i was very creative with lego i would build things and they were very cool, im 14 now and i dont even have the motivation or creativity anymore because school killed it", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T14:42:14Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Cinnamon-Skateboarding", "comment_text": "The U.S really needs to learn from some of the European learning institutions.", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T14:40:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OSU_SPEEDPLAYZ", "comment_text": "this video was usefull but i get what your saying in this video we need more sleep my school starts at  800am :(", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T14:40:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "m91 trooper films", "comment_text": "Checkmate Education system, Checkmate", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T14:36:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Banished knight Oleg", "comment_text": "talking about schools we are that time of the year where we should be studying to enter in universitys.<br><br><br>but my school has other ideas with 3000 works they want us to do<br><br><br><br>i wont lie i already gave up, im not doing any homework because i dont need to do hopefully and I&#39;ll focus on what i need to do that is studying for the incoming tests, school got me so full of shit that I cut my sleep schedule just to have a little vanity moment for myself.", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T14:25:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RockinFootball", "comment_text": "wait you telling me that you americans basically start school before 8:15am? and half of you start before 7:20am???

I was filled with excitement and thrill of learning new things, test my knowledge, get good grades, etc. I felt so good about it when I was younger and didn&#39;t care much about getting early. It feels sorrowful in a way whenever I have to look back at these memories...<br><br><br><br>Now I am demotivated, unhappy, sucked of all energy and interest, my creativity and way of expression totally crushed under the boulder of  school educating system, which is even more apparent during online school. While I liked it for the fact that it inspired me to follow my art passions of drawing, animating, writing, game and web developing; I didn&#39;t like it for the fact that it gives me practically no time to practice these things. You honestly won&#39;t believe how much pain it is to wake up in the morning, telling to yourself &quot;Alright today I am going to practice drawing and other stuff&quot; only to realize you&#39;ve been wasting your entire time studying and having no time to do all those things because of how fast time flies by. Heck it&#39;s not even guaranteed that the things you learn in online school will be remembered. And that&#39;s what made me demotivated...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Honestly I have been ranting about online school being detrimental to my psyche and cognitive functions like a little baby but it&#39;s true. Online learning makes you feel like a zombie more than anything. You just sit here starring blankly in the screen, listening to a disembodied voice of a teacher explaining yet another lesson in the most boring way imaginable while throwing a barrage of homework at you. I had a conversation with my mother where she was concerned about my well-being when it came to learning, always asking where is the motivation I had and how I was sinking down (my grades aren&#39;t really bad, but she was concerned because I didn&#39;t  participate enough in class.). I tried explaining to her the reason but she denied it claiming that last year I did online school yet I was actively participating in class so I didn&#39;t have any excuse to act the way I am now in this year&#39;s online school. That honestly felt like a big punch in the heart because she was the only one who would support me and understood my feelings better than any other. And now she turned her back on me....OK maybe I am overexaggerating about that but still, it felt so wrong that the only person I could trust was dismissing my feelings.<br><br><br><br>I still don&#39;t plan to give up on school entirely but if thus continues like this, I might have no choice but to drop out just because of how stressful it has become. Sorry for making this really long. I probably wasted your valuable time with you having to read through my useless ranting. But if you managed to get this far, thank you for your patience.

But think about it....does anything in life come easy?If our bodies got accustomed to sleeping late cant it get accustom to sleeping earlier too? A little tip: go to bed around 7pm get up around 9pm, to do work or study go back to bed around 11pm, 12am for the latest and wake up 6am according to the time you have to wake up for school. thats actually 10 hours of sleep there and if you think 7 is to early go to bed 8pm for the latest. Thats what i do, ( most days) You need to work! You need to make sacrifices! You watch those motivational videos all the time about hard work and pushing on but yet you learn nothing from it. Let me tell you, NOTHING COMES EASY IN LIFE. Some teachers actually over-do it with homework <b>Cough</b> especially spanish teachers <b>cough,cough</b> but still, its there for practice and to make sure you understand. Tests are there to see how much you learned even though they love shaming people for bad grades but if you pay attention in class trying to LEARN what the teacher is explaining, thats less study time. Dont even think about saying ,&#39;oh well my parents could have taught me to read or to write or about the earth or about cooking or about managing families or about etc.&#39; Dont even think about saying&#39; oh well i could learn it from youtube or from google or etc.&#39; Because if you dont know what photesynthesis is, how do you know to search for it to learn it how do you know do search for Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

The answer for why kids stay up late and deprive themselves of sleep is actually extremely simple, it&#39;s because when you go to sleep the next day begins. And when the next day begins, you have to go to school again. Staying up an extra 2 hours instead of sleeping is 2 more hours you have to yourself to do what YOU want. <br><br>As an aside, you can also make the conclusion that smarter and more academically proficient students are managing their time, able to finish their work, and giving school the attention it&#39;s asking for. While on the other hand, students who aren&#39;t as proficient tend to let work pile up, disregard assignments, or develop a habit of apathy towards academics.

I studied a bit about this in college at the age of 24, (pssst, I&#39;m now in my 40&#39;s) already had 2 kids by that point.  Our lecturer told us not to touch drugs, not to experiment with things that literally could damage our growing brains - erm too late for me I thought.

I like learning yes, I even educate myself, but school is supposed to feel like a second home, not a mental prison. My parents and grandparents are even complaining about excess school work becuz they want me to go biking on weekends, but I never do becuz of homework.

Note 11 p.m. is what is considered medically approved even in the hospitals, because that&#39;s the time period that usually put the patients to bed most secure hospitals, and you may say well this is because of control reasons or part of those control reasons also includes having the patience to stay on a healthy circadian rhythm that works with their medications.", "comment_date": "2021-11-01T22:13:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Enzo Batista", "comment_text": "Jokes on you I&#39;ve been waking up at 4-5 everyday of my life \ud83d\ude43.

I have ADHD, schizophrenia, and ocd. My schizophrenia and ocd formed when I moved to a new town and over the course of my junior high and high school years, with my mental deterioration forming during this time. I am in the 11th grade now and I wish I could have gotten more of this sleep so I could have been smarter. But since this change will most likely happen when I am an adult, if ever. This is due to how I am a junior and if this change happened now, I would already be far too gone in terms of non rem sleep. But that is humanity, we are all humans in this world. Even with the greedy people above us who won&#39;t aid this cause, I know that even adults from anywhere on this planet could have done better by raising support from this cause. But I can&#39;t change what others have done, since myself, as well as others around my age and younger can&#39;t just tell this to them. For one, kids aren&#39;t too far ahead in their mental development to understand this issue and how it could hurt their education and minds. Since I am a junior, I also can&#39;t just go up to a person high in power, like a world leader, or senator, even my own parents and ask for this change since there are things above this to worry about. Why I say I couldn&#39;t say this to my parents is about how my parents could get in legal trouble for letting me get some shuteye, and I also can&#39;t just start appearing to my school at 9;00 in the morning if they start at around 7;40 to 7;50. But even with this, there are almost 8 billion people in this world, do we really want the future generations to suffer through this too, or are we gonna worry about other things that are more important than this? These mental deformities could very well be the cause for some people to go insane due to the PROVEN formation of ADHD and schizophrenia forming due to non rem sleep and do wrongful things. But maybe we can&#39;t do anything, since we have already been in this rabbit hole since school even started for kids before the 21st century. So I guess in the end, there could be something we could do, but a random YouTube video isn&#39;t going to convince the higher ups to fix this sadly, that is just reality and the world we live in.", "comment_date": "2021-11-01T00:05:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Siji Doherty", "comment_text": "Watching this at 2 AM on a Sunday \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "comment_date": "2021-11-01T00:03:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Masked Gamer", "comment_text": "I was a happy child.

Then, when the school fee got too expensive to be worth it, I was switched to another school (cheaper, closer to home), with the start time of 7:30 AM. Needless to say, my sister and I were not pleased we had to wake up earlier than usual. (Also, it didn&#39;t help that I didn&#39;t like this school, but I digress). Then, halfway through high school, there was a student exchange program that sent me to the UK (basically a get-out-of-jail-free card in my eyes.. I wanted out of my school so bad I&#39;m willing to take any chance I could get) and that school starts at 9 AM. Boy howdy, I enjoyed myself so much I was so brokenhearted when COVID forced me to go home after only 3 months (it was supposed to be 6, but I did get to follow along back home and night lessons were actually a nice change of pace.. Chemistry at 9 to 11 PM was surprisingly fun). All this time I thought it was ME (since I could go to sleep relatively early until COVID eras) but turns out my circadian rhythm was off all along. I thought my sheer hatred for the school basically meant I REFUSED to wake up to go there (though it was probably a contributing factor).

English, Urdu, Islamiat, History, Geography, Math, and Science. If I counted wrong, I apologise in advance. Now I constantly make the argument, \u201cHow are we supposed to go to school for 8-10 hours a day, go home, finish homework which takes around another 3-4 hours (all of our teachers usually assign some form of homework; even before tests), study for exams/tests which takes another 2-4 hours depending on how much content we have, and make time for family, hobbies, friends and other things, like hygiene and sleep?\u201d Just 2 weeks ago, I was essentially starving myself to make time for all this because for the past 9 years (I started school at the age of 2), I have been the \u201cstar\u201d student.<br><br>Okay, now on to next thing, I\u2019ve been struggling with severe sadness (I don\u2019t want to use the word depression because despite my desperate attempts to get a therapist, I\u2019ve never been diagnosed or given mental help) for the past 3 years. After hitting puberty at the age of 9/10, I discovered that I don\u2019t believe in the same religion of my parents or family. This makes it difficult to concentrate in class, since my teachers always mention something about Faith and the afterlife. We literally have a class to learn about the history of Islam for crying out loud, how am I supposed to pay attention to something I am not interested in, in a language I don\u2019t know how to speak very well? (For context, Urdu is the national language of Pakistan and I don\u2019t know how to speak or read it very well, we study islamiat in it and google translate is the only shit keeping me sane)<br><br>You might immediately say, \u201cYou\u2019re too young to be thinking things like this!\u201d or, \u201cIt\u2019s just a phase!\u201d but honestly I literally have dreams/nightmares about studying and exams. Even my subconscious is stressed, and I don\u2019t work well under stress. Neither the environment of school, I work really well at home where I can wear things that aren\u2019t tight shalvars and where I can mute my classmates if they\u2019re getting too loud. Where I can drink water without having to expose my face and where I can sit in a half-comfortable chair and work on a desk with actual space.<br><br>The point of all this is that school does not appeal to me personally, and it doesn\u2019t help me focus or learn.

And it didn\u2019t help that, especially in middle school and high school, most of us had so many assignments and so much homework to do that we would go to bed by midnight or even later. I guess it goes without saying that all of us hated it, but since it was a private school and most of our parents insisted on still having us go there because of its \u201cprestige\u201d, there were more than a couple suicides on campus, and many more outside of campus. Everything in that environment was hell. From the ungodly hours class started, religious enforcement which stated that we deserve our pain, being told by teachers that our misery was our own fault, counselors that challenged students to kill themselves because \u201cthey were saying they were depressed to get attention\u201d, and much more. It was a perfect recipe for poor mental health among basically everyone. But a lot of the adults around us didn\u2019t believe mental illnesses were even a real thing. They thought we were just being lazy or trying to get \u201cthe easy way out\u201d.

Basically, I&#39;ve had some very noticeable symptoms of some sort of cognitive decline over the course of high school)\r<br>\r<br>When I went into Highschool, I was super smart (according to lots of other people, not myself). Not bragging, just stating it how it was, and the other students in my freshman class quickly started identifying me as one of the really smart kids once it started showing. I was quick-minded, mentally very awake, full of energy, I was a fast learner and good at following directions easily and quickly, I was knowledgeable and could explain most of the stuff in class (as well as plenty of other things we weren&#39;t studying) in detail before we had even learned much of it, especially with history, I became known for practically helping teach the class because I could always give in-depth answers from the start and already knew so much, I was a complete math nerd, a level ahead of my grade, and could do fairly advanced math completely in my head and fast, had a very good sense of math and numbers and was even somewhat knowledgeable on quantum mechanics and could mostly understand books talking about it, my memory was really good and was something I became known for especially concerning memorization, my sense of musical rhythm was really good and I often became the orchestra&#39;s counter of sorts, I was a good writer, and...well you get the point. Names people gave to me included words like &quot;prodigy, genius, Renaissance Man, intellectual, etc.&quot; My oh my, how poorly those titles have aged: \r<br>\r<br>NOW, I graduated high school, and I&#39;m kind of a bit of an idiot. I literally feel like I&#39;ve experienced some degree of cognitive decline. Senior-year and present-day me has literally nothing on middle school to early high school me aside from maybe knowing some additional facts younger me hadn&#39;t been told yet. Back then there were many calling me a kind of genius/prodigy of sorts (an exaggeration in my opinion but okay cool) but now I&#39;m like the farthest thing from that, I feel more below-average now than anything. I need to hear things or read things MULTIPLE times over before I even begin to comprehend it, meaning I also learn slow and need to hear directions more than once oftentimes before I can reliably follow them, I&#39;ve forgotten at least half of the vast knowledge I used to have 4 years ago (I can only give you super general statements about historical events, whereas before I could like narrate the entire story of Atilla the Hun or the fall of the Byzantine empire or Otto Von Bismarck or whatever in great detail on the spot with ease), my mind is so much slower at nearly everything, my memory isn&#39;t nearly as good, and while I&#39;m still I guess slightly above average at memorization it takes more effort now, my sense of rhythm is no longer basically an internal metronome and it&#39;s really nothing above average anymore, and my math ability has perhaps had some of the worst hits: For most of my life up into high school I was known as THE math kid, I loved math, was ahead in math, could do it quickly with ease, but now I can&#39;t do nearly as much math mentally as easily, it takes way longer to do so now, doing math in GENERAL takes me much much longer, I don&#39;t even have freaking times tables or even ADDITION tables down anymore and have to keep double and triple checking to myself what 6 x 4 or 8 + 3 is or whatever, and it&#39;s gotten so bad that I now need time and a half on math-related tests when before I was the type who would finish early and would have done most of the test in my head (and still getting correct answers) if I wasn&#39;t required to &quot;show my work.&quot; \r<br>\r<br>Not only that, but it&#39;s impacted my interactions with people. I ended high school with a lot of genuine friends but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s thanks to the fact that I made most of those friendships and became well known in the first couple years of high school, when I had rather strong cognitive abilities and whatnot, and so I still have those friends and can talk with them now despite the apparent decline, not because I&#39;m still good at interactions and making friends but because I had already made them. Because NOW in college I still haven&#39;t really made ANY new friends or anything, I can&#39;t keep a conversation up for the life of me, but I also don&#39;t want to talk to people anymore. Not only that, but I&#39;ve noticed a startling decline in any ROMANTIC interest or anything. In middle school and high school it was pretty typical for someone that age, I felt a very strong attraction to girls (I&#39;m straight) and had pretty healthy typical romantic desire. But in the past year I&#39;ve noticed that increasingly drop off a cliff; people say college is a good time to start dating but I now have practically ZERO romantic desire whatsoever, I&#39;ve turned almost asexual for no apparent reason, I feel no attraction to or interest in ANYONE at all. \r<br>\r<br>I&#39;m pretty certain this decline in my abilities is largely due to the problems with school and that it&#39;s slowly been killing my brain. I started to notice this apparent decline in sophomore year of high school, but even then it was nowhere near as bad as now, I was still pretty good at the stuff I used to be good at and I still had normal romantic interests for a teenager. But I had to pull a whopping 5 all-nighters in 10th grade, and like 2 in 11th, and then a lot late nights in both years plus senior year, and school started before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4u6oOQ77mg&amp;t=8m15s\">8:15</a> in the morning, and I have no doubt those were massive hits to my brain and cognitive ability.\r<br>\r<br>I was one of the smart kids going into high school, but now I feel below-average (then again if most kids are getting hit by the effects of this, I guess the average has lowered too but still). The only things I&#39;ve really retained are memorization ability, most of my musical skill, my hand-eye coordination to an extent, my physical drawing skill, but I&#39;ve lost almost all my motivation to actually do any art projects so I rarely use it, my writing quality (though it takes forever for me to actually write something that&#39;s not a stupidly long YouTube comment no one&#39;s going to read lol), my vocabulary, and apparently my SAT score (I somehow managed to get a 1560, but that was with an extra time accommodation so even that was still harmed), and maybe a couple other things. But my retention is pretty bad, and all the other things I mentioned before. I&#39;ve definitely experienced some degree of cognitive decline over the course of high school, to the point where I&#39;m way less cognitively able than I was 4 years ago, and yet I&#39;m still young, what SHOULD be still too young to be worrying about cognitive decline or anything.\r<br>\r<br>It seems to match what you were talking about in the video, so I have little doubt that it&#39;s related to that, and if this is happening to kids in school on a large scale, that&#39;s almost CRIMINAL. That means so many kids that used to be or could be really smart are literally getting ROBBED of their cognitive abilities by the very thing that&#39;s supposed to FOSTER those abilities, and there&#39;s very little they can do to avoid it because, well, they are required to go to school. Sometimes I wonder if that&#39;s intentional, like some secret attempt in recent times to intentionally decrease the general cognitive ability of the youth and keep them asleep on a massive scale, but that&#39;s probably getting into borderline conspiracy theory territory and I don&#39;t know enough to really make any sound claims relating to that so I won&#39;t go any farther into that at least for now.\r<br>\r<br>Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.", "comment_date": "2021-10-29T19:04:21Z", "likes_count": 49}, {"comment_by": "RQB", "comment_text": "S teir vid", "comment_date": "2021-10-29T19:01:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zyansheep", "comment_text": "Totally agree, but you are terrible at researching and presenting data.

I started going to bed late much earlier than my peers. I&#39;m one of the students that struggles the most with waking up early and during my final years of high school I used to sleep for the better part of all my classes until around 10AM. Considering that, in my country, primary and secondary education only lasts for half a period, that meant I slept through roughly half my classes. Honestly, I don&#39;t know how I kept my grades up (and how I was never suspended for it). I guess I was just lucky, and tried to compensate studying on my own when I got home. I was one of the most notorious in-class sleepers, but far from the only one. Incidentally (or not), I&#39;m bipolar too, and my symptoms worsened right after leaving HS (though diagnosis was still a good 5 years away). If my school days started at 9, I&#39;d still struggle for first period, but that alone would still be a reduction of over 60% on the time I spent sleeping in class and, knowing that I&#39;m a pretty extreme case, that&#39;d probably solve the entire issue for most of other in-class sleeping peers. Plus, that&#39;d probably give me the ability to have a decent breakfast and benefit from some much needed glucose in my brain at schooltime and maybe be able to stay up for that first class - it&#39;s kinda hard to eat when you&#39;re still groggy from sleep and your stomach still seems to be in dreamland.<br>Though it&#39;s always good to have research backing this up, this isn&#39;t something that&#39;s news for anyone who is or has been a teenager not long ago.

A million years ago our night owl ancestors would&#39;ve been on guard at night against a number of different threats. Predatory animals like large cats, birds of prey, and many other large carnivores. Our ancestors that far back in time were definitely not at the top of the food chain yet. Therefore someone always stayed awake to be on the lookout. That&#39;s why some of us operate more efficiently at night, and get better sleep during the day.

My school started at 7:45am and it was hell since I lived about 45 mins away. They would also give lunch detention, after school detention, or 2-day suspensions for being late, however that makes sense. You missed 5 minutes of the beginning of your class? Miss 2 entire days of learning instead! In my junior and senior year I stopped doing homework most of the time just to catch a break and go enjoy my youth.", "comment_date": "2021-10-22T00:51:29Z", "likes_count": 297}, {"comment_by": "Soft_Gummy", "comment_text": "Everyone: School is bad cause it\u2019s boring y&#39;all<br><br>This guy: Talking about health<br><br>Me: Finally someone who knows how it feels like to wake up so early", "comment_date": "2021-10-22T00:47:28Z", "likes_count": 71}, {"comment_by": "Erin Underwood", "comment_text": "Online school is so much better!
