But often I do not think this. What dancing is about, is having the ignorance and courage to go all out in the open on the floor. It means to hear the beat of the song. When you hear the beat you are provided with a template of what to do. Like I always raise me knees in alternate fashion, and stamp them down to the beat. In other words, beat is in your legs. <br>The rest of the song, such as the melody and main tune dictates the style. So if it&#39;s rap music then I&#39;ll swing my arms about like a rapper. If it&#39;s a band singing I&#39;ll be really jumpy etc. if it&#39;s rock, I&#39;ll play air guitar and add a little head banging. <br>In truth, I&#39;ve been dancing for years and I would say it&#39;s second nature for me now, to be able to get up on the floor. But what as surprised me about my supposed talent is I&#39;ve never got laid. Now I can rule out bad moves as the reason for this, but it&#39;s mainly because girls will not approach you. They just don&#39;t. I&#39;ve had a couple of instances where a girl has approached me. But it didn&#39;t turn into much.<br>So don&#39;t worry guys if you can&#39;t dance. It really isn&#39;t a big deal. It&#39;s more about how you can physically interact with a girl on the floor, not dance independently.<br>Oh and btw, none of this works unless you are stone cold sober and are free from drugs.
