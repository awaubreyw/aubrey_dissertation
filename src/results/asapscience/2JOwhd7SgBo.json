When my mom offered to buy it for me, I immediately thought &quot;do I really need this sticking around my room? I&#39;m causing a burden for my mom&quot; and I look at the price tag of $13 and said NOPE. My mom tried to convince me but I couldn&#39;t let her buy it for me. This is often with deserts at restaurants and when for example my mom&#39;s friend has a lot bigger spending habit and wanted to buy me a fortune for a whole dollar from the fortune machine.... like I can&#39;t even repay them because I&#39;m still too young for a job. This was since I was really little when my mom wanted to get me ice cream when I felt really sad, and denied anything that my parents offered to &quot;bribe and help me feel better&quot;...

I think about him more often..... another reason why I hate Christmas is because it is just  time when people are stressed and they try to find a good gifts for their family and people are just crazy... they think they have to buy gifts because it is Christmas .... they think that they have to eat because of Christmas dinner etc... that is good for marketing and shit like that and they use it for themselfs..... everything cost more money ( idk how it is in other countrys but in mine it is like this) ... Christmas isn&#39;t what it was some time ago.. it was about family and friends now it is about money... then... I feel lonely... I usualy walk around the city with my headphones and cry... noone cares... even if they see me...
