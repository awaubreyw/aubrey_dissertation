In reality, this can be linked to pretty much anything.  If you go to sleep CONSISTENTLY really late where let&#39;s say you only get 1 hour of sleep when it&#39;s dark and for the rest of the time the sun is already up, this wouldn&#39;t change your melatonin levels.  The reason it&#39;s so often a problem in so many tests is because they switch people over to sleeping on a night shift, people who take night shift jobs have other things to manage in their life and the general patterns of the people around them like family don&#39;t allow them to sleep normally, and in general there tends to be a conflict with the active times of most other people based in society.
