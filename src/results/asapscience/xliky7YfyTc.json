But I can understand using the term &quot;hallucination&quot; as a sort of umbrella term for any spurious sensory perception for the sake of convenience.<br><br> The definition given on Wiki is: &quot;a perception in the absence of external stimulus that has qualities of real perceptions.&quot; Which include visions of people, objects, places etc which are indistinguishable from reality. For example, a person suffering from delirium may see a friend of theirs&#39; walk into the room and have a conversation with them for several minutes, only then to have the person dissolve into nothingness and suddenly realize that the whole thing was just a hallucination. Or a common one among smokers is smoking cigarettes which aren&#39;t even there.<br><br>Anticholinergic drugs or plants like atropine, scopolamine, over the counter medications for nausea and motion sickness and benedryl, which contain the drug diphenhydramine, although motion sickness medications list the active ingredient as &quot;dimenhydrinate&quot; this is just a combination of diphenhydramine and another drug called 8-chlorotheophylline which has a slight stimulant effect to mitigate the drowsiness it causes, but I digress. Other things that could cause delirium include plants like atropa belladonna, datura, and green potatoes.<br><br> These will cause a state of anticholinergic toxicity when taken in abundance, which will lead to exactly these sorts of hallucinations. But don&#39;t let any would-be psychonauts be tantalized by the notion of tripping or getting high on these plant/drugs. As I said, the &quot;high&quot; is really a form of toxicity and reports indicate it feels more like a fever dream than anything enjoyable. The can also cause side effects like cardiac arrhythmias, strokes, heart attacks, seizures, inability to urinate while also producing an excessive amount of urine. Whichwould be my idea of a living nightmare and severe short term memory loss. To the point where people on it will forget what they&#39;re Between the realism of the hallucinations and the severe short term memory loss it causes, often the user won&#39;t even realize they&#39;ve taken anything.

Lambert, Ph.D.", "comment_text": "<b>As a Harvard Neuroscientist, any psychoactive drug - whether it be alcohol, marijuana, caffeine, opiates, hallucinogens, or prescriptions - can only exert its actions by hijacking an endogenous system already in place in your brain.</b> For example, your brain and body have an extensive endogenous cannabinoid system which - in the absence of THC from marijuana - serves natural roles in modulating seemingly every function of your nervous system. This is because the overwhelming majority of neurons in your brain produce and use natural cannabinoid ligands to influence the electrical communication between neurons at synapses. Technically speaking, endogenous cannabinoids provide neural activity-dependent, retrograde, metabotropic inhibition to presynaptic inputs of a given neuron. Without all the jargon, this means that when one neuron excites another neuron with a barrage of electrical impulses, the recipient neuron tells the talkative neuron to quiet down a bit - and not overstimulate it - via the use of endogenous cannabinoid signaling as a feedback. When you smoke, inhale, or ingest THC from marijuana, the THC provides a potent external source for binding to endogenous cannabinoid receptors and overrides/hijacks whatever the natural cannabinoid ligands in your brain were doing previously. This results in many THC-induced changes, which can be therapeutic or harmful depending on the concentration and frequency of usage. This example of THC acting on your endogenous cannabinoid system is analogous to what any other psychoactive drug is doing to its targeted natural system in your brain. Nicotine hijacks your brain&#39;s natural acetylcholine receptors, while opiates do the same for opiate receptors. Caffeine &amp; alcohol are more complicated simply because they are &quot;dirty&quot; drugs in terms of having a broad binding affinity across many receptor targets, but caffeine has a particularly prominent binding &amp; influence on adenosine receptors to affect wakefulness, for example. While some of these psychoactive drugs can be beneficial if used judiciously, consider that hijacking of your natural systems with regular use may have long-term deleterious effects on your brain &amp; body.

What&#39;s the difference you ask? Well, optics only show what is already there but in a different way, hallucinations cause you to see things that aren&#39;t there. For example, when you see something like a shadow that looks like a face, when you hallucinate you may also see a body (which isn&#39;t there) and optics make you see the face a bit more clear or with more depth. <br>Of course, that&#39;s just the optical part of LSD, the mental part is a different story and it&#39;s not made for everyone. However some people can easily take multiple times the dose than what would be too much for most and wouldn&#39;t even be close to a bad trip. <br>It&#39;s the  basic mindset which makes the difference. For example, if you are drunk you may or may not be able to realize your level of being drunk and control your actions. It&#39;s basically the same principle.
