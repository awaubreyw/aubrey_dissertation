Water evaporating in the atmosphere will happen over and over again until the atmosphere is below the vaporization temperature of water, which depends on atmospheric pressure.

I remember being terrified looking at a map to see if I was going to drown and if they were right I would have  (in the mind of a 7year old) so not long after that my dad was looking at buying a 2nd car and I caused the biggest fuss cause I thought that I was definitely going to be burned alive by the sun or drown. I got in alot of trouble cause I kicked my dad cause of what the teachers were telling me... year 2000 goes by and by 2010 most households have 2+cars and definitely no real green energy to be seen, now starting to wonder when climate change was going to kick in.. 2020 comes around and we had the coldest summer I can remember and I can go to the same part of the beach that I did in the 90s.. no rising water, no 50\u00b0C summers... but life&#39;s sure getting expensive cause of this climate change and we get a few hot days and people cry climate change well do people think the earth is on rails staying the same distance from the sun for eternity?

CO2 is required for all plant life to photosynthesize the plants take in the Co2 remove the carbon atom and release oxygen. 4.ALL aerobic life forms take in oxygen and exhale CO2 humans lungs alone produce 3 billion tonnes of CO2 annually. Factor in the rest of animal life and uh oh life is pollution. 5.when CO2 is more readily available plants begin to grow larger and grow quicker. This will actually cause global cooling once plant life hits it stride, the carbon cycle provides carbon sinks as well as a means to offset excessive carbon. 6. Most living creatures feed on plants with the exploding food source animal population rises. It is the circle of life. A horse running full gallop produces more CO2 than a car.

This information is in their report, Chapter 6.

There was a time, before humans, when the world was 13 degrees warmer than it is today and atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 2000 ppm. Currently CO2 concentration is around 380 ppm. Sure, the planet looked a little different then, but life was thriving and coral reefs existed in places that are now too cold. This is science fact, not speculation, which logically tells me that a two degree warming is very manageable in global and environmental terms. How humans will cope, however, is another issue. Judging by the mental meltdowns they are having over the speculation of what might be, doesn\u2019t bode well for our species. <br><br>I am if the opinion that the current take on climate change is akin to the believe in the end days. People wish it to be true because they convince themselves that everything is broken and the only way to fix it is to go through some cathartic change and where they imagine themselves as coming out empowered and on top. <br><br>BTW, I am not a \u2018denier\u2019 of climate change. The climate has and continues to change and maybe humans do in some small way influence that change. I am all for studying and understanding this issue better. However, I do not subscribe to the militant ideologues and the opportunistic politics that are the elephant in the room of global warming.", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T13:34:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "unionwithchristjesus", "comment_text": "The real issue is Climax of Two Males", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T01:00:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Olga Jeffay", "comment_text": "Yes!

Is common sense no longer common? <br>Is there really something like a true global climate? For example, at the equator there is a rainforest climate, around the Mediterranean they enjoy a Mediterranean climate and up north they have a Nordic climate. Around the world we find many different climates, warmer or colder, dry or wet with windy days. A &quot;global climate&quot; from only a temperature perspective makes absolutely no common sense! Why worry about a simple global mathematical average from temperatures sampled from many places over time? Obviously, the global climate from this single measurement does not exist anywhere on the planet because it is just a static figure down to a 1/10 of one Celsius degree. It seems silly that the worlds temperature represents climate in the same way as people&#39;s \u201caverage age\u201d with half of the world\u2019s population above and the younger 50% below middle to represents the calculated &quot;human age&quot;. What would such global \u201chuman age\u201d tell us about any specific individual? Nothing of course! So what does the \u201cworld temperature\u201d tell us? Nothing, because such a \u201cglobal temperature\u201d is NOT something that can be experienced at any specific location. <br><br>If we choose an arbitrary place, like a village in southern Scandinavia, the temperature at that village varies every single day by about 10 degrees between 25 degrees on a summer afternoon and 15 degrees late at night. During all four seasons of a year, the temperature in the same village can vary a lot more, maybe as much as 50 Celsius degrees, from icy -20 during a clear winter night to +30 degrees on balmy summer days. If the temperature at that village changes on average one degree here or there, it does not really matter at all for the villager\u2019s life. Yet, we are bombarded by shrill preachers claiming that species will become extinct, and diversity will decline due to a one degree change in global mathematical average temperature. We are told about imminent &quot;mass extinction events&quot; and that human living conditions are guaranteed to be destroyed for sure. Really? What does your common sense say?  Could +26 degrees during the day and +16 at night eradicate fauna, flora, and microorganisms? The south part of Scandinavian has very different fauna, flora, and microorganisms than the central landscapes, or the wild northern regions. Spring comes to the south a month earlier than what they expect up north, etc. Common sense tells us that what is likely to happen, namely that some of the southern life forms will seen further north and bloom a little earlier during spring. Well, such healthy natural variation is precisely what scientists have observed from recorded treelines over thousands of years during a variety of historical climate conditions.<br><br>Should we trust what we are told or dare to trust our God given common sense?  Many are too easily frightened by all sorts of dire predictions and intimidating threats. Frightened people desperate for a cure for their anxiety will readily accept anything on offer. In a panicked climate context, it can be anything from stopping the use of cars, forsake air travel and cancelling holiday trips. Even rationing meat, reducing home heating or cooling, and discourage young children from dreaming of an interesting, bright, and active future lifestyle. <br><br>It is noteworthy what the Nobel Laureate Manne Siegbahn once reminisced. When he began to study physics at the beginning of the last century, many academics like himself honestly believed that only a few more pieces of Mother Natures puzzle remained to be discovered and then science would have a complete holistic knowledge of the physical reality around us. However, it did not take long for extraordinary thinkers like Einstein, Planck and Bohr to name but a few, to open up large knowledge gaps in the picture and even to change the boundaries of already laid puzzle pieces. Today we are told with 100% certainty that the &quot;science is settled&quot; despite that history teaches us that the only thing we know for sure, is that we never know everything, especially about something as complicated and chaotic as Mother Natures climate system. This is not to say that we should ignore our precautionary principles, but we must also trust our common sense in the face of the many reckless political decisions that are rushed through only because the \u201cMasters of Power\u201d are 100% certain that we need to be saved from a imaginary world-wide &quot;climate crisis&quot;. <br><br>In their too common ignorance, our leading politicians seem to hope for a day when we will all be able to see with the naked eye that a climate crisis is raging outside the window, like an approaching comet. This is a futile hope because a changing climate is as invisible to the human eye as the molecules and atoms in our own body. Despite this, the old mass-media is desperate to link every hot day, every recent forest fire, a glacier caught melting, another drought, earthquakes, changing land and sea levels and flooding rains as if they were occurring for the first time in Earth&#39;s history and must therefore must be valid evidence proving &quot;climate change&quot;. Globally we are just over one degree warmer today than during the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; when the Thames froze over and millions of Europeans starved with numerous deaths. Scientists, journalists, or anyone should be sharing that during the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; it was much colder globally, and since then the climate thankfully has improved until this day! <br><br>But instead of being delighted about this climate normalisation they tell us that any increase in temperature is about &quot;greenhouse heating&quot; and it is our generations fault due to our irresponsibly luxurious way of life! Never are any other possible causes discussed than our modern way of living where energy from fossil fuel is the most important factor that has pulled us out of poverty. We are told that unless we funnel our economic powers into stopping the temperature from rising by another degree before the end of the century, we will waste &quot;Planet One&#39;, and we will wipe out our civilization as we know it. We are told that the climate must and can be tamed and controlled by our generation of people by following the directives that politicians give us. The directives are made to influence every part of our daily lives. Previous climate history is ignored like the recent climate emergency that struck Europe in the 1860s. During that \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d summers went missing or were too short for farmers to grow and harvest crop. Few people have the stomach to reflect over the fact that such &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; could return at any time during coming decades. What social and logistic preparedness will be needed for our densely overpopulated world are questions that has become irrelevant because of the &quot;Climate Crisis&quot; in our overheating Bland New World.<br><br>Propaganda has historically been used for evil purposes - often influencing children and the young alike. It is favoured by dictators who are stuck in their own dogma regarding the politically acceptable. As a rule, the &quot;Masters of Power&quot; speak with well-chosen words, often in combination with adjectives such as emergency, crisis, and threats, so obedient people can be herded along a predetermined compass direction. Common sense means to look critically at the flow of messages and using our own intuitive examination of what can be regarded as moral, sensible, wise, and above all realistic. This is clearly not just a battle over \u201cclimate truth\u201d and this fight will most likely never end. Today and during past millenniums, people has never known what the future may hold. With a reasonable outlook, humanity will be able to go where the future trends are heading and like every generation before us, we can trust our future descendants to live in ways that they find wise and justified, just like it always has been.", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T15:03:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Rodriguez", "comment_text": "climate has been going on for like forever? what\u2019s the big deal. carry on.", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T15:00:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ALEKSI Dravitski", "comment_text": "Dude....your videos are sooo flawed and quite frankly....overly politicized because of your sexuality....take a hard look at straightpeople...notice they don&#39;t change their voice to make everything about them...... thank God I left the extreme left echo chamber.

Look up HAARP and you will see that they openly share and are proud of manipulating the weather and ask yourself, should I believe and trust those Governments and controlled scientists who claim we are facing climate change, when they have weather modifying weather technology? Should I really be parroting those who aim to change the weather and who aim impose weird carbon taxation? If they can steal your tax dollars and make technologies that can change the weather and you ignore that fact and still ignorantly talk about the world causing climate change, you might not be living up to your potential. Time to give your head a shake and start walking towards truth and not be a pawn in a game you don&#39;t know you are participating in. China is even playing with the weather and if you are naive and trust your own Government, you can at least see the dangers of allowing China to manipulate our weather. The extreme weather and these floods that we face are not natural. The meteorologists are even making up new terms like ARCTIC VORTEX, HEAT DOME, THE RIVER OF BLA BLA BLA. These new sayings are designed to freak out the people and make those who live in perpetual fear, cry out, &quot;see it&#39;s climate change&quot; and delare &quot;THE SKY IS FALLING. If you refuse to see weather manipulation technologies exist and then refuse to understand that if they have that tech they will use it and that their is money and controlled to be gained by using it and that absolute power corrupts absolutely, you might best sit down and reassess your ability to combat the fear that leaves your logic center unavailable to you to access. You that say that people are climate deniers are in fact weather technology deniers and are a liability upon everyone around you.

We came out of the ice age period about 13,000 years ago or so, we are over due for the ice age cooling period. Why are we overdue? Because humans began warming the planet with the advent of large scale farming, forest clearing, flooding rice fields, animal husbandry on a large scale etc. (civilization activities)10,000 years ago. Earth actually began cooling again as per Milankovic cycle years ago but Humans staved off the returning ice age that long ago but we are over doing it now.

The absolute ignorance and blatant arrogance one must contain to contemplate attempting to rid the world of such A fictitious notion of belief as global warming. Combined with the powerlessness a human would have in the factor of temperature on an earthly scale is just ridiculous and A laughable juncture.

These fools are grossly underestimating human intelligence to a degree that rather intrigues me. I cant help but wonder how could like minds converge to the depths of such ignorance.

Its all based on lies and they think that we are so unintelligent that we will fall for the trap. Well This guy aint falling , giving up or hiding for that matter.

The volcanic ash emitted into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere in just four days - yes,  FOUR DAYS  - by that volcano in Iceland which has totally erased every single effort you have made to reduce the evil beast, carbon.

Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991,  it spewed out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the entire human race had emitted in all its years on earth. Yes, folks, Mt.

Why have none of the alarmist\u2019s predictions come true?   All of the so called evidence, like more powerful storms, heat waves, floods, etc., are within the range of naturally occurring events.  So they can claim their proclamations of doom are accurate.    Doubt that the events claimed to fulfill their nonsense predictions are actually normal? Try explaining how 1936, 1934, 1921, and 1901 were very hot.  All of them before the CO2 levels were high.  Forest fires were much bigger back then too.  Many tropical cyclones were bigger back then also.   <br>The alarmists are doing their best to scare weak minded people into destroying Western Civilization.  <br>One need not be a climate scientist to see that the claims of the alarmists are lies.   One only needs to actually watch what they do.   Here are three \u201ctells.\u201d   Before listing the tells, let us review the claims made by the alarmists.   They say CO2 is so dangerous that we only have x number of years to stop it.  Of course x number of years depends on who the alarmist is.  Beginning in 1989 it was 10 years until Arctic Ice was gone.  Then it was moved to 2013, 2014, and now out to 2035.   They say global warming will cause crop failure.  People will starve by the thousands.  Storms will be worse.  Hot places will get hotter, cold places will get colder.  Basically the world, as we know it, will cease to exist.  Such doom and gloom.  <br>So if CO2 will cause all this, why do they oppose known ways to reduce CO2, and still have plentiful, reliable, and inexpensive energy?<br>The first tell.  They oppose building new hydroelectric plants, and even have shut some down.  Hydroelectric does not emit CO2, but it does generate electricity.   <br>The second tell.  They oppose the enhanced recovery technique that makes it possible to generate electricity using natural gas rather than coal.  This switch lowered the CO2 emissions of the US by a large amount.   This enhanced recovery technique allows copious amounts of gas to be extracted from shale.   It is called Fracking.  A contraction of hydraulic fracturing.   <br>Some say fracking is unsafe.   Really?  Compared to their doom and gloom?  How can a rare Fracking problem possibly compare to their doomsday scenario?  They oppose it with gusto!  Why would anyone do that IF CO2 is SO dangerous?<br>Third tell.   Most of the alarmists and their legions of useful idiots are also violently opposed to nuclear.   Nuclear has the capacity to produce all the electricity we need and with the exception of CO2 produced in making the reactors etc., generates zip, zero, nada CO2.   <br>But nuclear is too dangerous the alarmists cry.   Really?  Which one of the three nuclear accidents have caused droughts?   Which one caused more severe storms?  Which one has caused major forest fires, or crops to fail?   None of them have!<br>But what about the waste.  Modern nuclear reactors are more efficient that early ones.  The fuel can even be recycled.   The waste from a modern reactor can power a medium sized city for a year and produce enough waste to fill a shoe box.   There is ample area to store this for the foreseeable future.  <br>To me it is obvious the goal of the alarmists is not \u201csaving the planet!\u201d   Many of you need to wise up before it is too late!", "comment_date": "2021-10-08T02:33:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim K", "comment_text": "I appreciate the video, but the assertion climate change was established by oil industry scientists in the 1970s is wildly inaccurate.

The IPCC is a joint project of that entity and the World Meteorological Organization.<br><br>(Strong was subsequently implicated in corruption surrounding the UN\u2019s Oil-for-Food-Program and has resigned from his UN positions. <br>According to John Izzard writing for the Australian publication Quadrant Online,  \u201cFollowing his exposure for bribery and corruption in the UN\u2019s Oil-for-Food scandal Maurice Strong was stripped of many of his 53 international awards and honours he had collected during his lifetime working in dual role of arch conservationist and ruthless businessman.<br><br><a href=\"https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2015/12/discovering-maurice-strong/\">https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2015/12/discovering-maurice-strong/</a><br><br>A superb political operator, in 1972 he set up a UN \u201cEnvironment Conference\u201d in Stockholm, to declare that the Earth\u2019s resources were the common inheritance of all mankind. They should no longer be exploited for the benefit of only a few countries, at the expense of poorer countries across the globe.<br><br>To pursue this, he became founding director of a new agency, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and in the Eighties he took up the cause of a tiny group of international meteorologists who had come to believe that the world faced catastrophic warming. In 1988, UNEP sponsored this little group into setting up the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).<br><br>In 1992,\u00a0now allied with the IPCC, Strong pulled off his greatest coup when he set up another new body, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to stage that colossal \u201cEarth Summit\u201d over which he presided in Rio, arranging for it to be attended not only by 108 world leaders and 100,000 others but also by 20,000 UN-funded \u201cgreen activists\u201d.<br><br>It is the UNFCCC which in effect has dictated the global climate change agenda ever since. Almost yearly it has staged huge conferences, notably those at Kyoto (1997), Copenhagen (2009) and the present one in Paris. And all along it has been Strong\u2019s ideology, enshrined at Rio in \u201cAgenda 21\u201d, which has continued to shape the entire process, centred on the principle that the richer developed countries must pay for a problem they created, to the financial benefit of all those \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d that have been its main victims.<br><br>In 2005, Strong was caught having been illicitly paid $1 million from the UN\u2019s Oil for Food programme, supposedly set up to allow Saddam Hussein to pay in oil to feed starving Iraqis. He retired to a flat in Beijing, where he had been close to China\u2019s Communist leaders back to Mao. It was from there that he returned home to Canada to die,on November 27.<br><br>&quot;Strong\u2019s dream is more than ever falling apart&quot;<br><br>To this day, global climate policy is still shaped by Strong\u2019s Agenda 21, as was highlighted last February when Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican Marxist now head of the UNFCCC and organiser of the Paris conference, urged that the West should give \u201c$1 trillion a year\u201d to the \u201cdeveloping\u201d world.<br><br>But the wonderful irony is that the reason why Paris will fail, like Copenhagen before it, is that those \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d, led by China and India \u2013 now the world\u2019s first and third largest \u201cCO2 emitters\u201d \u2013 have not the slightest intention of curbing their emissions. It is for the West to do that, for creating \u201cthe problem\u201d. Thus, just as he died, Strong\u2019s dream is more than ever falling apart \u2013 thanks to those very countries his socialist vision was intended to help. <br><br><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/paris-climate-change-conference/12035401/Farewell-to-the-man-who-invented-climate-change.html\">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/paris-climate-change-conference/12035401/Farewell-to-the-man-who-invented-climate-change.html</a><br><br>The United Nations IPCC, have been playing God, and changing the weather?

So how does a car work differently ? it doesn&#39;t , it&#39;s only reasonable to a human mind that you put petrol and after a combustion the result is no longer petrol , it&#39;s kinetic energy (moving the car) and the excess or better said the energy that was not transformed in movement . If the transfer were 100% (only on paper is actually do-able) then you would put petrol , it would burn and move the car , and you would have no exhaust . But ICE&#39;s have a maximum of around 20% efficiency . That means that if you put 100 L of fuel , only ~20L get transformed into kinetic en. .  How many of the 7-8 bil humans think about this ?

Relative to Earth\u2019s entire record, carbon-dioxide levels are at historically low levels; they only appear high when compared to the dangerously low levels of carbon dioxide that occurred in Earth\u2019s very recent history. The geologic record reveals carbon dioxide has almost always been in Earths\u2019 atmosphere in much greater concentrations than it is today. For example, 600 million years ago, when history\u2019s greatest birth of new animal species occurred, atmospheric carbon-dioxide concentrations exceeded 6,500 parts per million (ppm) \u2014 an amount that\u2019s 17 times greater than it is today.\r<br>\r<br>Atmospheric carbon dioxide is currently only 410 parts per million. That means only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere is carbon dioxide (compared to 0.03 percent one century ago). Only one molecule in 2,500 is carbon dioxide. Such levels certainly do not pose a health risk, as carbon-dioxide levels in our naval submarines, which stay submerged for months at a time, contain an average carbon-dioxide concentration of 5,000 ppm.\r<br>\r<br>The geologic record is important because it reveals relationships between carbon-dioxide levels, climate, and life on Earth. Over billions of years, the geologic record shows there is no long-term correlation between atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels and Earth\u2019s climate. There are periods in Earth\u2019s history when carbon dioxide concentrations were many times higher than they are today, yet temperatures were identical to, or even colder than, modern times. The claim that fossil-fuel emissions control atmospheric carbon-dioxide concentrations is also invalid, as atmospheric concentrations have gone up and down in the geological record, even without human influence.\r<br>\r<br>The absurdity of climate alarmism claims gets even stranger when you consider there are 7.5 billion people on our planet who, together, exhale 2.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year, which is almost 10 percent of total fossil-fuel emissions every year. However, we are but a single species. Combined, people and all domesticated animals contribute 10 billion tons.\r<br>\r<br>Further, 9 percent of carbon-dioxide emissions from all living things arise not from animals, but from anaerobic bacteria and fungi. These organisms metabolize dead plant and animal matter in soil via decay processes that recycle carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. The grand total produced by all living things is estimated to be 440 billion tons per year, or 13 times the amount of carbon dioxide currently being produced by fossil-fuel emissions. Fossil-fuel emissions are less than 10 percent of biological emissions.

I learnt about the greenhouse effect at school in the 1970&#39;s.

Also, the motor industry started to produce more fuel efficient cars as though this was somehow an attempt to reduce the use of fossil fuels - but, again, it just kicked renewables further down the road.<br>The 2008 crash meant putting the whole eco thing to one side.<br>And the rapid growth of China and of India was fuelled by coal. So we just watched on the side lines, dutifully taking the metro to work instead ot the car, in the hope that would make some difference.<br>Then only recently I began to learnt about solar activity and its affect. I also began to come across the idea that the areas of land covered with ice were not always covered with ice. Then, that there was more C02 in the atmosphere in the past and the there is an effect called global greening which is a result of having a better level of atmospheric C02 which may be useful for feeding a growing population.<br>And while sea levels rise, vast area of land area are also made available because they are no longer covered with ice.<br><br>Nevertheless, I do find the behaviour of EXXON shocking.

The overall climate is demonstratively cyclic, as in that it oscillates. We do not yet have sufficient data to build a worthwhile climate modelling computer program for realistic calculation of climatic changes and much is to do with clouds, water vapour and other greenhouse gasses. Australia was early to build the Hornsdale green mega battery to help with going green with solar and wind power and despite our backward thinking Prime Minister. I believe we should now also be the leading nation in installing fusion nuclear. The fusion nuclear SAFIRE GENERATOR by Aureon Energy Ltd. of Canada is the actually cheapest, cleanest and least expensive solution for clean electricity. Wind energy, solar, hydro and other green technologies are now just superseded. Hydrogen will not either become a future conventional fuel but a nuclear fusion one! Electric power is the future for autonomous small aircraft and with ever more battery energy storage density perhaps some larger ones. However, FUSION NUCLEAR IS THE FUTURE of ever-larger commercial and military aircraft. Now we have a 24 hr. reliable fusion power product. We now in 2021 have super cheap nuclear fusion energy already proven and almost commercialised as in being in advanced production, that of the &quot;SAFIRE GENERATOR&quot;. So sadly, storage technologies and the power from ITER-type fusion power generators as well as conventional fission nuclear are going to be eclipsed. Current magnetic plasma confinement strategies and all current green energy technologies are totally out of date and relatively redundant. All our effort must now go into EVER HIGHER ENERGY DENSITY BATTERIES because green energy is now solved. With intermittent green energies we need an enlarged electric grid, so we see wind generators, solar farms and a multitude of variable green technologies with expensive backup batteries and they are all ugly and use up much land, while also being significantly capital intensive and all while having some safety issues.

People are already aware that it will take months if not years to end the COVID-19 conflict, which became painfully obvious that the conflicts during world war I and II would go on and on for months and years. Both these wars were also misnomers. The World War I ended with roughly 20 million people dying, which is comparison with COVID-19 deaths [136]. The coronavirus pandemic has confirmed the disturbing potential of viruses as a weapon of mass destruction, reduction of social rapport building, distancing in religious activities, which have transformed the concentration, dimension and trajectory of an undeclared third world war and, in its aftermath, could conceivably transmit about a revolution in the global order [137]. The world is in turmoil from racial injustice to rising inequalities due to pandemic COVID-19 [138]. These World Wars were named with retrospective effect to all generations.

We are at 400 parts for me and now roughly, and during glacial times we are naturally at 200 parts per million. The Earth&#39;s natural carbon cycle bring CO2 levels as high as 600 parts per million and greater. At 600 parts per million plants thrive, and biodiversity regenerates on the planet. Now these climate-science Psychopaths want to bring you down to 200 parts per million, and according to their pseudoscience this means they are forcing the earth into a glacial state., and they want to sustain a glacial state; if the scientist were correct about how CO2 controls the climate. The one thing the climate scientists forget to tell you is that as glaciers melt because of the Sun and solar Cycles CO2 is released from the ice at the poles oh, it is also released from the waters during these solar Cycles because of underwater volcanic activity is activated by solar Cycles much like what happened in the 70s oh, those who are educated remember the glacial growth that happened at that time. Another thing that climate scientists do not understand is why did the CO2 collect at the poles and Glaciers that start with. The reason for this is because of the properties of carbon period carbon is an amazing element oh, and it is so useful, not just as food for the food that feeds the plants LOL. Carbon by itself is a superconductor up electricity, it is also diamagnetic. When combined with oxygen oh, that happens to be paramagnetic, this sets up the perfect electromagnetic properties that draws this amazing CO2 compound to the polar regions of the Earth.

part of the current natural  warming is of human origin, but it CERTAINLY is only a part.<br>Humans do not   cause CLIMATE CHANGE  it has been constantly ongoing for billions of years humans did not start it and we cant stop it, the same is true for global warming and global cooling, though human emissions are probably adding some warmth to the natural warming in in line with our TINY Co2 emissions (less than 4% of the annual total of Co2 outgassed into the atmosphere) remember there are processes which recycle Co2 out of the atmosphere and back into the planet.<br>This guy knows NOTHING about the science , NOTHING, he just keeps trotting out the same unsupportable BS that you get in the media.<br>How dare they portray a highly UNCERTAIN science as UNCERTAIN, indeed he sounds

through the Club of Rome via the U.N<br>then in order to prevent a human induced global climate catastrophe they wanted us to melt polar ice by sprinkling carbon black on the poles, and to build as many coal powered power stations as possible to pump as much Co2 into the atmosphere as possible thats right exactly the opposite of what they demand now.<br><br>Why, well there are a range of climate cycles over various time frames and intensity&#39;s both cooling and warmings, the short term cycles such as the bearded wonder is responding to are irregular in the time they run for (and we really dont understand the causes well)  but warming follows cooling which follows warming.<br><br>One hundred and eighty years ago we broke out of a several hundred year period of cooling (the little ice age) this had followed a period of warming at least as warm as today and quite possible warmer (the medieval warm period is one of many which seem to occur roughly every thousand years and have been much warmer in the past than now), since then we have had numerous short term cooling and warming cycles but overall it has warmed (otherwise we would still be in the Little Ice Age) the peak of the last short term warming was in the late  1930&#39;s (in fact that time period still holds the records for the most broken records for high temperatures) from 1940 (with human Co2 emissions peaking) we moved into the next part of the short term cycle COOLING it cooled from 1940 through to the 1970&#39;s, so in the 1970&#39;s they were pushing human caused climate catastrophe  GLOBAL COOLING, when we moved into the next short term cycle WARMING, then within a couple of years it was a human caused climate catastrophe GLOBAL WARMING.<br><br>So far NONE of the predicted climate disasters HAS EVER OCCURED from the 1970&#39;s till now, this issue is 90% politics and 10% science, science is being used to justify the imposition of a geopolitical agenda our governments signed us up to at the 1992 Rio Earth Conference (without our permission).<br><br>The irony is that the bearded one (who does not seem to know much climate science) attacks the oil industry but ignores that the Rockefellers (Massive Oil  producers and ruthless and powerful capitalists) set up the Club of Rome to advance their financial and geopolitical interests by using the environmental movement (the Club of Rome set up the U.N environmental department and the IPCC), in this they have been stupendously successful the AGW panic is enormously profitable for them.<br>So your climatically challenged narrator is doing his best to pour even bigger profits into their pockets and transfer political power from the nation state (you dont mind living in a corporate controlled socialist dictatorship do you ?) to the U.N as Global Governance (which the U.N has been pushing for years, after all that is the real reason they were set up by the Rockefellers and the international banking elite with the support of the Fabian and other socialist groups and their compliant governments).<br><br>Now i dont remember he who has glasses (he is certainly shortsighted when it comes to this issue ) ever pointing out that a Climate segment is THIRTY YEARS thats right thirty years, climate is many things but here we are using the word CLIMATE when we are really talking about Global Warming.<br>We will not know whether the current thirty year segment we are in has warmed/cooled or is in overall stasis for another EIGHT OR NINE YEARS, thats right its WAY too early to know what climate has done right now and wont  for years.<br><br>Going back to a recent convenient point we know it warmed from late in the 19th century (Australias hottest recorded  day was in 1909 51.7 Deg C),  till around 1940 then cooled till the 1970s, then warmed till 1998, thats what we know ALL THAT FUSS RIGHT NOW and so far nothing out of the ordinary at all, in fact a European ice core series paper published last year covering the last eight hundred years shows clearly that our current climate movements are slow  and mild compared to what has happened in only the last eight hundred years.<br><br>Perhaps EXXON were in existence then ?and were responsible for the medieval warm period, the even warmer roman warm period, the warmer still bronze age warm period etc, do you think the Trojans bought EXXON shares ? or maybe the Myceneans,<br>perhaps Julius Caesar had to invade Gaul to recoup the losses he made trying  on a short sell on EXXON shares ?<br><br> There is no significance at all to the EXXON scientific reports they were hypothesis only that needed replication via empirical testing, neither necessarily wrong or right just hypothesis and on their own PROOF OF NOTHING.<br><br>Clearly Brittany Spears with the beard does not understand the concept of HYPOTHESIS, i see he has other videos UH OH HE DID IT AGAIN, i would advise potential listeners to go out and get some books from AGW proponents and AGW sceptics and form their own opinions, this guys video was a waste of space.", "comment_date": "2021-02-27T18:03:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Waylon Shults", "comment_text": "Global warming

Then how did the Cambrian start at 6000PPm and how did life sequester so much hydrocarbon bio mass in low surface, sub surface and sub ocean deposits, how did sea life fossils end up on what are now in land meadows? <br><br>According to the current modelling, the earth has already ended 4 times since the climate scare was started back in the 60s. Oil has also run out twice since the start of the climate scare, so. Either. This is all a lie because it creates expedient political control, or, we are actually all already dead, or, climate change is just a complete tax scam.<br><br>Co2 can&#39;t contribute as much temperature as is proposed as it has a saturation point where it&#39;s re radiative effect falls off, we are already at that point. Oil is likely to never run out either as in 200 years we have used just a fraction of the original sequestered co2 combination of hydrocarbon. The time it would take us to use it all up, new deposits accessible by technology like fracking, would already be forming, especially if we increase the earth&#39;s capacity for green growth through the introduction of more Co2.<br><br>If you look at the fear induced by &quot; climate change &quot; you&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s primarily aimed at western countries, countries like china do not have to participate in the paris accord but get all the green tech patents to sell back to the countries that invented them. You&#39;ll also notice that the main focus is Co2 which is the almost universal by-product of energy consumption and production. One intergovernmental organisation sets the policies that these western countries must abide by, In conclusion this means,  one organisation governs more than half of the world.<br><br>Scoff if you will but it&#39;s true, whether Co2 is heating the planet (which means the planet would have been a fireball during the Cambrian period ) or whether Co2 is a net benefit to the greening of the planet (which it is) neither outcome matters because the UN-IPCC governs almost all western countries now by throttling or allowing their production and consumption of energy and it governs those people by controlling their autonomy over personal transportation and soon, food as well.<br><br>Scoff some more if you like but I predict that over the next few decades, we&#39;re going to see a sharp drop in temperature due to the solar cycles and our orbital cycles combining to produce some harsh winters and mild summers.

Instead of using the ad hominem fallacy over and over, how about trying to neutrally report your position with evidence to support. <br><br>Example from the video: &quot;the debate on climate change has been long, complex and intense. This is of course not true because according to their own science...&quot; (I don&#39;t really feel like typing the whole thing out so from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbW_1MtC2So&amp;t=4m18s\">4:18</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbW_1MtC2So&amp;t=4m33s\">4:33</a>)<br><br>That statement is factually accurate because climate scientists have been trying to figure out all of the effects of climate change for several years now (and we are still trying to figure out the effects). It&#39;s a fricking world climate with so many countries, companies, variables, etc. Climate scientists are still not 100% certain of what will happen. That&#39;s why, if you read the IPCC&#39;s most recent report (the staying under 1.5 C), you can see that there is a TON of things they have to talk about, and within each one, they list off the things they are &#39;confident&#39; in and how much evidence supports it. According to their charts, they have varying levels of confidence (from low confidence to high confidence). Medium confidence is about 50% certainty an outcome will occur which doing a simple Ctrl-F will reveal dozens of times &quot;medium confidence&quot; appears in their report. Meaning that there is uncertainty about certain outcomes. Which means that it&#39;s debated.<br><br>SO. TLDR; Climate change is an ongoing debate, and it has been long, it has been complex, and one could classify as intense if they wanted to.

This climatic trend will reverse like a pendulum and the world will again grow massive icecaps that drains much of the seven seas all over again!

Carbon is the building block of life not the destroyer of life, which is exactly why they have demonised it. They also push the lies that we need more oxygen/plants when in fact more oxygen = less plants and more fires. Plants breath Carbon in any most gaseous forms, thus More CO2 = more plants. Everything these lunatics have been telling us is a reversed script. Now all you have to do is go to Wikipedia and research things as essential to the environment as peat and you&#39;ll find it vilified as if it&#39;s a detriment to the environment simply for producing access carbon (the building block of life). Plants thrive on the &quot;shit&quot; in the air just as much as they thrive on the shit on the ground. The global warming theory literally claims that the life cycle is bad and is destroying life on earth. If you reduce carbon you reduce life. It is argued that dinosaurs couldn&#39;t exist today because there are not enough plants due to depleted carbon in the atmosphere and an access of oxygen. And besides all that, green energy creates far more toxic pollutants for the environment during production. Many of these pollutants are dumped in the oceans and are far more difficult for nature to break down. The atmosphere is easier for the environment to clean, because trees are the worlds greatest purifiers but we are removing their ability to do anything by reverting our pollutants to chemicals and plastics in the name of green energy.

This is why we have had ice ages. In fact it is the strength of the solar output that is the most important factor in determining global temperature. We had far higher CO2 levels in the distant past which still led to ice ages. The ice core records prove that CO2 levels lag behind temperature changes by hundreds of years. We are coming out of a mini ice age so it&#39;s normal for temperature records to have been broken. Temperature changes have been static since the late 90s and it is probable that it will be a lot colder as the solar minima takes hold. If not then it is estimated that the CO2 levels must double for each extra 1C of temperature increase. So we are a long way from the panic point instilled into our children at schools and colleges. It will be ironic if we actually need to release more CO2 in order to save us from an ice age in the next few years. If it was a real problem then the government would use molten salts instead of pressurised water to cool nuclear power plants. This won&#39;t enable them to work at far higher temperatures which could both make electricity 20% more efficiently and allow it to crack atmospheric CO2 and recombine it is with water to form synthetic automobile fuel. This would effectively make burning fuel carbon neutral. These power plants could also act as desalination plants as well.

Kudos. There&#39;s something the Exxon scientists missed in the early 80&#39;s. A modified theory of gravity and orbital inclination.<br>The term &#39;global warming&#39; will become an icon of the past. There is a new way of thinking about climate change. I propose that Professor Andrea Ghez (UCLA) will soon prove that Einstein&#39;s theory of gravity is wrong.<br><br>There is an alternative imagery based on the idea of dark/different matter existing at the centre of the Moon which pulls on the Earth&#39;s core to create the ocean tides. The pull would be especially strong when on the same plane as the Earth to create the Spring Tides and King Tides.\ud83c\udf0a<br><br>Evidence for a stronger gravitational pull on the orbital plane due to dark/different matter in planetary cores comes from this scientific paper: <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/94/16/8329\">https://www.pnas.org/content/94/16/8329</a>. It appears more technical than it needs to be. They are saying that the change in distant from the Sun (eccentricity) is only between 1% and 5% and so is way too small to generate the glaciers of ice ages. The orbit of the Earth also goes up and down in a more direct 100,000-year cycle (inclination) and so is a better fit to the data. They lack a credible mechanism but didn&#39;t think of an increase in tidal gravity as Earth&#39;s orbit traverses the orbital plane of Jupiter. This increase in tidal strength would bring extra precipitation to the polar regions. The increase in snowfall accumulates at a greater rate than summer melting, leading to glacial buildup and advance. The ice ages have little to do with the Sun, much more with the failed star Jupiter.<br><br>Further evidence comes from the 405,000-year climate cycle which is attributed to Jupiter and Venus: <a href=\"https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/05/07/milankovitch-cycles-deep-time/\">https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/05/07/milankovitch-cycles-deep-time/</a>.<br>Note that the gravitational effect of Jupiter is 1/10,000 that of the Moon and therefore requires a modification to gravity to &#39;make it work&#39;. Similarly with Venus.<br><br>Note that the official explanation is that  they &quot;perturb the Earth&#39;s orbit&quot; to create the largest glacial cycle of them all. <a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/139198/jupiter-and-venus-change-earths-orbit-every-405000-years/\">https://www.universetoday.com/139198/jupiter-and-venus-change-earths-orbit-every-405000-years/</a>.<br><br>But this still only makes the Earth at most 5% further away from the Sun. The dark/different matter theory is a better fit to the data. Jupiter causes extra tidal strength on the 100,000-year cycle and Venus brings even more every 4th cycle. <br><br>Evidence for periodic increased tidal strength in past climate is given in the following paper which states &quot;..extreme Arctic penetration of warm North Atlantic waters.&quot; This is attributable to the addition of the 1,470-year lunar climate cycle. The next cycle I estimate  to commence in around 750 years, so plenty of time for humanity to prepare itself for the biggest changes to come.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033589499921233\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033589499921233</a><br><br>It will all be confusing to start with but is understandable to a layperson given enough thought.<br>...<br>A quick google search will find that precipitation has been increasing in both Antarctica, Greenland and Norway:<br><br>&quot;Scientists have compiled a record of snowfall in\u00a0Antarctica\u00a0going back 200 years. The study shows there&#39;s been a significant\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0precipitation\u00a0over the period, up 10%. The effect of the extra snow locked up in\u00a0Antarctica\u00a0is to slightly slow a general trend in global sea-level rise.&quot;<br><br>Similarly in Norway, with a very high rate of maritime precipitation, both precipitation and snowfall are increasing.<br><br>I predict that this will increase exponentially eventually halting the trend in global sea-level rise.<br><br>Unfortunately it appears that increasing precipitation in Greenland is currently falling as rain which will lead to increased melting, which will offset the Antarctic/Nordic accumulation in the short term.<br><br>Sea-level change is just a part of climate change. Heat is redistributed from the equatorial regions towards the polar regions via increasing tides. The warming is much greater in the Northern hemisphere due to the unidirection of Earth&#39;s orbit as it traverses the orbital plane of Jupiter in this current cycle.<br><br>A test for this hypothesis is to actively measure tidal height changes in the mid latitudes. I predict a small but exponential increase in tidal strength over time. Another consequence of dark/different matter core interaction will be increased mantle convection bringing extra heat to the Earth&#39;s inner crust. Bore holes from 1km to 5km can test for any increase in rock temperature. I predict a small but exponential increase in rock temperature over time.<br><br>I am not &quot;anti-Greta&quot; as she is right that governments and industry need to take climate change much more seriously. Naomi is right in that the science needs to be settled first and that CO2 emissions shouldn&#39;t be targeted in an attempt to &#39;control the climate&#39;. There is a new middle ground way of thinking and both Naomi and Greta have much more positive work ahead of them.<br>.....<br>\u2668\ufe0fThere is also the potential for a new green energy source based on dark/different matter which theoretically would have been brought to Earth by past comet impact events.<br><br>A &#39;theory of everything&#39; is expected to bring a new world economic revolution of unimaginable prosperity. \u2665\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T10:20:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "francis c", "comment_text": "You&#39;re lying in the same way as exxon was.", "comment_date": "2020-07-21T00:01:06Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Steven Last", "comment_text": "Climate Change Reconsidered: Science the U.N.

Let me explain this. This hoax was first proposed by a cusp organization called the Club of Rome and they adopted computer simulation models to predict the course of Global warming and how it is going to affect our planet. The thing about computer simulation models is that the input affects the output, meaning if you put in the required inputs, you will obtain your desired output that is manipulated by you in the first place by supplying rigged inputs to meet your sinister intentions of agenda 21. If their computer simulation models were accurate wrt the current global conditions, then people in New York and other coastal cities would now be swimming to go from one place to another. But is that the case? Did you ever consider this fact : sun is behind global warming and not carbon dioxide? Yes carbon dioxide traps the heat, but without that,ie, the greenhouse effect, we could be headed for the next mega ice where temperatures could plummet to sub zero. And moreover, we all breathe out carbon dioxide and plants inhale them to prepare food that we in-turn consume. This natural food cycle wouldn\u2019t be possible without carbon dioxide. Pollution is harmful for the lungs, yes but it isn\u2019t the cause of global warming and hence climate change. Global warming occurs when greenhouse gases trap the heat of the sun within the atmosphere, without which life wouldn\u2019t be possible on this planet. They have brainwashed us from the start that we humans are dangerous and that our very existence is a bad omen to this planet. But without us, plants would die, and hence this planet will become a rotten, dying barren land. Infact, it was much hotter during the 1500\u2019s than it is now. That period is called the mediaeval warm period and you do know that there was no pollution whatsoever back then.

I live in Australia in one f the Hottests states &quot;Queensland&quot; and this years summer wasn&#39;t as hot as 7 years ago&#39;s summer it is cooler this year and the winter is getting colder.t We just had a small event of cooling over most the states &quot;NSW, ACT, VIC, QLD, SA&quot; that dropped the temps in late summer from the normal at nights that are around 20 degree&#39;s C down to 1-10 degree&#39;s C some even lower for 4 days and in the days it was 10-20 degree&#39;s C lower then what they normally are.

However, the term \u201csignificant\u201d was never defined. Furthermore, according to the Heartland Institute, most skeptic scientists would agree with the statistic if the term was defined.<br>The video explains that when formulating the 97 percent statistic, researchers used only the responses from \u201cclimate scientists.\u201d However, only 5 percent of the respondents \u2013 79 people \u2013 were climate scientists.<br><br>So, out of 10,257 academics that the professor and graduate student identified as worthy survey participants, only 79 were in agreement with their final finding.

Various predictions were made that never occurred.<br><br>Until the 1970s when it was postulated that actually the world was warming and not cooling (at least not in the next 1000 years or so)...

It is this incredibly high level of scepticism that gives science its trustworthy and repeatable nature and allows us to use science to correctly predict extrapolations of existing facts into new and untested territories with a high degree of success.<br><br>So the next time someone tells you the science on something is settled and calls you a denier or a sceptic you can thank them for confirming your adherence to the core principles of science and not on faith - needed due to the fact it\u2019s based on emotion and a total lack of facts.<br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/GpVBH-HY5Ow\">https://youtu.be/GpVBH-HY5Ow</a><br><br>We are currently in our 5th ICE age (google Quaternary glaciation if you don\u2019t know this) and during these ice ages 70-95 percent of the earth is often covered with ice... that\u2019s global cooling. We are in a warmer part of this period so not so bad atm. During our planets \u201cnormal\u201d period the oceans were 152 feet above where they are now and temps around 50 deg C were common.<br><br>During previous ice ages people traveled along ocean floors to other continents - oceans got that low... <br><br>The fossil fuels that everyone is now so worried about came from fossilised remains of living plants and animals that were living on the surface of our world during its longest and most vibrantly lush and diverse period. The carbon released burning fuels is the same carbon that was above ground for millions of years during the dinosaurs reign. <br><br>We live on a world that is essentially a closed system. The water we drink today has been recycling through the guts of dinosaurs and plants for those same millions of years. The balance of chemicals in this planetary system are fixed with the exception of tiny amounts that get fired off into space or brought here by meteorites, or locked temporarily away by being sealed in the soil/rock by tremors or tar pits etc. but essential the carbon we have is the same carbon that existed when the earth came into existence. Only how much is in the atmosphere changes from time to time... the absolute amount that is within our system does not change much at all.<br><br>Anthropogenic Climate Change is the hypothesis that man, through his actions, is able to influence climate upon our planet. This is also the first stage of a process called terraforming. Which is the \u201chypothetical process of deliberately modifying a planet\u2019s atmosphere, temperature, surface topography or ecology to be similar to the environment of Earth\u201d so as to make it liveable for Earth creatures. The idea is to be able to manipulate the climate to be the way we want it to be and not the way nature wants it to be.<br><br>So what is the right climate? Depends on who you talk to, right? <br>I love cold days in front of the fireplace in the misty mountains but my wife loves steamy hot tropical nights near the ocean. Who are we to determine what is optimal for the entire planet and all its various life forms? Only human arrogance would dare believe our wants matter more than all other creatures because we currently rule. <br><br>Dinosaurs ruled the planet for millions of years, we have barely been here for around 45,000 years and they have been pretty shaky years at that, with us almost wiping ourselves out multiple times already.<br><br>Here\u2019s some of the Climate Consensus based news reports that supposed \u201cscientists\u201d and science reporters have predicted many citing government scientists or using working papers and IPCC reports since the formation of the UNs IPCC and its first report in 1990.<br><br>1966: Oil Gone in Ten Years<br>1967: Dire Famine Forecast By 1975<br>1968: Overpopulation Will Spread Worldwide<br>1969: Everyone Will Disappear In a Cloud Of Blue Steam By 1989.<br>1970: Urban Citizens Will Require Gas Masks by 1985<br>1970: Nitrogen buildup Will Make All Land Unusable<br>1970: Decaying Pollution Will Kill all the Fish<br>1970s: Killer Bees!<br>1970: World Will Use Up All its Natural Resources<br>1970: Ice Age By 2000<br>1970: America Subject to Water Rationing By 1974 and Food Rationing By 1980<br>1971: New Ice Age Coming By 2020 or 2030<br>1972: New Ice Age By 2070<br>1972: Oil Depleted in 20 Years<br>1974: Space Satellites Show New Ice Age Coming Fast<br>1974: Another Ice Age?<br>1974: Ozone Depletion a \u2018Great Peril to Life<br>1976: Scientific Consensus Planet Cooling, Famines imminent<br>1977: Department of Energy Says Oil will Peak in 90s<br>1978: No End in Sight to 30-Year Cooling Trend<br>1979: West Antarctic ice sheet could melt before the year 2000 and inundate American coastlines with up to 25 feet of sea level rise.<br>1980: Peak Oil In 2000<br>1980: Acid Rain Kills Life In Lakes<br>1988: Global Warming predicted to cause a thermal expansion of the oceans and to melt glaciers and polar ice, thus causing sea levels to rise by one to four feet by the middle of the next century.<br>1988: Regional Droughts (that never happened) in 1990s<br>1988: Temperatures in DC Will Hit Record Highs<br>1988: Maldive Islands will Be Underwater by 2018 (they\u2019re not)<br>1989: Rising Sea Levels will Obliterate Nations if Nothing Done by 2000<br>1989: New York City\u2019s West Side Highway Underwater by 2019 (it\u2019s not)<br>1989: UN predicts disaster if global warming not checked {by 2000 } Senior U.N.

Our species went through multiple ice ages and global warmings. The current global warming started approximately 12,000 years ago. That&#39;s how the last ice age ended and the current geological period, the Holocene, began. This warm and cozy climate won&#39;t last forever. Interglacial periods last between 20,000 and 60,000 years. So, we have between 8,000 and 48,000 years until the next ice age.<br><br>2. The rate at which the sea level is rising now is much lower compared to how it rose between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago \u2013 a period in which the sea level rose by 197 ft (60 m). Look up the <b>Early Holocene Sea Level Rise</b> if you want to learn more.<br><br>3. The climate is always changing. There is no such thing as a stable climate. If you want to learn more about the &quot;stability&quot; of the climate, you might want to look up:<br>\u2013 <b>The 8.2 Kiloyear Event</b><br>\u2013 <b>The Little Ice Age</b><br>\u2013 <b>The Year Without a Summer (1816)</b><br><br>4. <b>Chaos Theory</b> tells us why the behavior of some systems is unpredictable (chaotic). Even simple systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, like the double pendulum, for example \u2013 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/U39RMUzCjiU\">https://youtu.be/U39RMUzCjiU</a>. No one can predict the climate.<br><br>5. Computer simulations of chaotic systems have no predictive value because the initial conditions can never be measured with sufficient accuracy. Such simulations only generate pretty pictures on a screen. Again, no one can predict the behavior of chaotic systems. Because \u2013 <b>Chaos Theory!</b><br><br>6. Compared to water, CO\u2082 plays an insignificant role in the global greenhouse effect. Because \u2013 and I&#39;m not making this up \u2013 <b>95% of all greenhouse gases is water vapor.</b> <br><br>7. CO\u2082 is <i>not</i> a pollutant. CO\u2082 is plant food. Almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is a byproduct of photosynthesis \u2013 a process by which plants use light energy to produce glucose from CO\u2082 and water. Without CO\u2082 plants die. Without plants, we die. CO\u2082 is used in the food industry, for example, in the production of carbonated beverages like: beer, soda, sparkling water etc. CO\u2082 is also used in hospitals, for example, in laparoscopic surgery. There are real pollutants out there we should be worried about and CO\u2082 is not one of them.<br><br>8. Compared to astronomical factors like solar activity or the <i>Milankovitch Cycles</i> or terrestrial factors like volcanic activity, human activity has an insignificant effect in the long term evolution of the climate. We cannot start, end, or prevent ice ages or global warmings. We&#39;re not that significant.<br><br>9. This may came as a shock to you, but we&#39;re actually in the middle of a 2.58-million-year-old glaciation \u2013 the <b>Quaternary Glaciation</b> \u2013 look it up!<br><br>10.  There are many scientists who disagree with various aspects of anthropogenic climate change. One of them is Ivar Giaever, Nobel laureate in physics, who essentially said Global Warming is pseudoscience \u2013 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TCy_UOjEir0\">https://youtu.be/TCy_UOjEir0</a>. Freeman Dyson said that &quot;Climate Change predictions are absurd&quot; \u2013 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fmy0tXcNTPs\">https://youtu.be/fmy0tXcNTPs</a> Wikipedia has a <i>List of scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus on global warming,</i> but it only contains the names of those scientists &quot;who have their own Wikipedia article.&quot; Keep in mind that science doesn&#39;t work by consensus. Science isn&#39;t a democracy. As Carl Sagan put it:<br><br>\u201cScience is more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking; a way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then, we are up for grabs for the next charlatan (political or religious) who comes rambling along.\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-02-06T08:27:26Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Eric", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbW_1MtC2So&amp;t=1m41s\">1:41</a> Welcome back to the 80s!", "comment_date": "2020-02-06T03:06:32Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Komal Gill", "comment_text": "But can we talk about how animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of global warming and nobody wants to talk about it cause hypocrisy?", "comment_date": "2020-02-06T02:58:35Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Jim Phelps", "comment_text": "You think Exon lied...... what about Al Gore and his predictions in his first movie.... what a joke that movie was since nothing it predicted actually occured.... and to showcase his total lack of knowledge, his book cover/posters used a nasa photo that he altered to show less clouds and polar ice, but he added a hurricane rotating in the wrong direction and a hurricane on the equator..... which everybody knows can&#39;t physically occur", "comment_date": "2020-02-06T00:54:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cosmopolitan Bay", "comment_text": "Cool story bro!

This is because you are poisoning the land (top soil erosion).<br>- Energy poverty is quite a big problem (even in the western world) and will become an even bigger problem because of environmental taxes and more expensive energy sources.<br>- Paris climate agreement is just a joke (some countries do take it serious though) as a lot of countries are promising stuff they where already going to do or they promise even less than what they where planning. The only reason they sign is because they will get money out of it.<br>- CO2 is the food of life for plants.<br>- There is actually less CO2 in the atmosphere than before.<br>- CO2 cannot be connected to climate change if you look in history.<br>- Computer models are not precise and cannot be used to accurately predict the future.<br><br>So instead of these problems we should actually be looking at real problems that we can solve.

That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth&#39;s overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to &quot;fight&quot; climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:<br><br>Historical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core<br><br>Investigators<br>J.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius<br>Laboratoire de Glaciologie et de G\u00e9ophysique de l&#39;Environnement,<br>CNRS, BP96,<br>38402 Saint Martin d&#39;Heres Cedex, France<br><br>N.I. Barkov<br>Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute,<br>Beringa Street 38, 199397,<br>St. Petersburg, Russia<br><br>Period of Record<br>417,160 - 2,342 years BP<br><br>Methods<br>In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15\u00b0C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the &quot;Grenoble analytical setup,&quot; which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).<br><br>Trends<br>There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.<br><br>References<br>Barnola, J.-M., D.

There\u2019s one world, one climate, one environment: there was absolutely no control group to rule out other causes of the findings. Second problem: the climate has changed continually for as long as we have been alive, and with what scientific tools are available to us, it appears to have been going on like that for a long time. In addition to this fact being an uncontrollable variable, it asked the question \u201cshould we be messing with the weather?.\u201c And that is completely aside from the fact that our ability to control the weather is a whole other variable. Who is to say that the weather modification activities that have been going on for years have not skewed results? Add to that the fact that leaders like George Bush and Kissinger etc. have been quoted as saying, or have written, That in pursuit of a one world government they need a problem big enough to draw everyone together and that climate is a great tool for that. Now you need to separate \u201cscience\u201d with flat out human manipulation, greed etc. Then we can move a little further into the fact that there is a large body of scientists who do not agree, and who explain very clearly how the \u201cconsensus statistics\u201d were manipulated, and how they do not dare to speak out until after retirement because they actually need to feed their families.  If the world is heating up, regardless of the cause, it seems as though we simply post the public service announcement and suggest that people crops that can tolerate more extreme weather changes, and consider selling your property if you are at a low elevation. And let people take responsibility for their decisions. That is a little glib, but I hope you get my point. Instead of promoting solutions being generated by people at the top, just let people know that it\u2019s open season on solutions to the changes that are possibly coming. Oh, yes. There is that niggling little issue\u2026 We can\u2019t even accurately predict the weather next week, much less next month, next year, in 12 years. But wait, there\u2019s more: It would be nice if the people who are doing the weather manipulation would cease and desist so we can see what the weather is actually supposed to be. So far, the only thing being offered to us is shaming for questioning, and higher taxes to pay for\u2026 What, exactly?  And it\u2019s not like using LED bulbs and Tesla cars are actually good for your health in the short one or the long run. But there are plenty of people who would like to lobby for legislation that gives them incentives to create \u201cgreen\u201c options that may, but probably will not, \u201cfix\u201d the perceived problem.

Yet, another benefit for more habitat !!<br><br>3) CO2 is made out to be such an enemy of nature and the climate at large... but CO2 is the life source for All plants and trees.  After photosynthesis, plants and trees would naturally expel increased levels of Oxygen.... that\u2019s Another benefit to every mammal on Earth, since we breathe and survive with Oxygen !  \ud83d\ude01<br><br>4) Every celebrity and politician that travels around doing speeches on the \u2018Severe Crisis\u2019of climate change.... also uses vehicles like automobiles, airplanes, etc , that burn fossil fuels and only contribute more to the problem they SAY they\u2019re fighting against !??<br>  Also - I\u2019ve yet to see any of them OR their supporters lead by example and discard All forms of travel that use fossil fuels... or discard all the products including plastics or synthetic rubber, etc, etc.... because those are All petroleum-based products !!??<br><br><br>5)Almost All Scientists that are onboard the consensus of Man-made climate change are also Funded by governments through grants, etc...  A large majority of Scientists Not funded by government OR Oil companies are Not in agreement with that consensus or the cause and need for fear !???<br><br>  I wonder.... are these government funded studies in Fear of losing those Large sums of Money handed out by the government ?? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14<br><br><br>Now - I\u2019m not calling anyone out or trying to create an argument....

The bombing of Saudi Arabia&#39;s oil refineries would NOT have forced the US and everyone else to consider using their strategic oil reserves<br>2. Without people buying their oil they wouldn&#39;t have nearly as much money to funnel into the mosques and spread their extremist version of Islam<br>3. The US and its allies wouldn&#39;t have any need to put ships and military personnel into the Strait of Hormuz to protect the flow of oil out of the Middle East<br>4.

The volcanic eruption in Iceland . Since its first spewing of volcanic ash has, in just FOUR DAYS, NEGATED EVERY SINGLE EFFORT you have made in the past five years to control CO2 emissions on our planet - all of you.\r<br>\r<br> Of course, you know about this evil carbon dioxide that we are trying to suppress - it&#39;s that vital chemical compound that every plant requires to live and grow and to synthesize into oxygen for us humans and all animal life.\r<br>\r<br> I know....it&#39;s very disheartening to realize that all of the carbon emission savings you have accomplished while suffering the inconvenience and expense of driving Prius hybrids, buying fabric grocery bags, sitting up till midnight to finish your kids &quot;The Green Revolution&quot; science project, throwing out all of your non-green cleaning supplies, using only two squares of toilet paper, putting a brick in your toilet tank reservoir, selling your SUV and speedboat, vacationing at home instead of abroad,nearly getting hit every day on your bicycle, replacing all of your 50 cent light bulbs with $10.00 light bulbs.....well, all of those things you have done have all gone down the tubes in just four days.\r<br>\r<br> The volcanic ash emitted into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere in just four days - yes, FOUR DAYS - by that volcano in Iceland has totally erased every single effort you have made to reduce the evil beast, carbon. And there are around 200 active volcanoes on the planet spewing out this crud at any one time - EVERY DAY.\r<br>\r<br> I don&#39;t really want to rain on your parade too much, but I should mention that when the volcano Mt Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991, it spewed out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the entire human race had emitted in all its years on earth.\r<br>\r<br> Yes, folks, Mt Pinatubo was active for over One year - think about it.\r<br>\r<br> Of course, I shouldn&#39;t spoil this &#39;touchy-feely tree-hugging&#39; moment and mention the effect of solar and cosmic activity and the well-recognized 800-year global heating and cooling cycle, which keeps happening despite our completely insignificant efforts to affect climate change.\r<br>\r<br> And I do wish I had a silver lining to this volcanic ash cloud, but the fact of the matter is that the bush fire season across the western USA and Australia this year alone will negate your efforts to reduce carbon in our world for the next two to three years. And it happens every year.\r<br>\r<br> Just remember that your government just tried to impose a whopping carbon tax on you, on the basis of the bogus &#39;human-caused&#39; climate-change scenario.\r<br>\r<br> Hey, isn&#39;t it interesting how they don&#39;t mention &#39;Global Warming&#39; anymore, but just &#39;Climate Change&#39; - you know why?\r<br>\r<br> It&#39;s because the planet has COOLED by 0.7 degrees in the past century and these global warming folks got caught with their pants down.\r<br>\r<br> And, just keep in mind that you might yet have an Emissions Trading Scheme - that whopping new tax - imposed on you that will achieve absolutely nothing except make you poorer.\r<br>\r<br> It won&#39;t stop any volcanoes from erupting, that&#39;s for sure.\r<br>\r<br> But, hey, ......go give the world a hug and have a nice day.\r<br>\r<br> Ian Rutherford Plimer is an Australian geologist, professor emeritus of earth sciences at the University of Melbourne, professor of mining geology at the University of Adelaide, and the director of multiple mineral exploration and mining companies.

Why would the atmosphere let radiation enter but not leave? Well, it&#39;s very simple: greenhouse gases are (mostly) transparent to light and UV rays, that hit the ground and heat it up. The ground is constantly cooling down by emitting infrared radiation that would usually leave Earth, but since greenhouse gases are opaque to infrared light, it heats up the atmosphere. If we continue releasing greenhouse gases or remove the plants that get rid of the excess, we&#39;ll all cook to death.<br>I hope someone sees this and stops being a climate change denier.", "comment_date": "2019-06-14T18:30:39Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jeremy Deveraux", "comment_text": "Hell yeah drill baby!

Big government got together with wealthly new energy companies and created an organisation called the IPCC to regularly release scary reports so that the populations would cry out to the governments to have more power and take more money. There goal was to get rid of the old energy companies, and give the new ones billions in tax payer subsidies - Obama gave them $150 billion. They are paying scientists tens of billions, and even Exxon is on the scam now and funds global warming scientists to release reports. It means they get tax concessions and sell more and more gas that used to be just discharged or burnt off as waste. Now they make billions from it.

The biggest lie about climate change is, &quot;The science is settled&quot;. Real science is NEVER settled and every true scientist will tell you that. It is a never ending process and we only ever have a view of an intermediate step. The flat earthers were proven wrong. Sir Isaac Newton, one of the greatest names in science, was proven wrong. Einstein, who&#39;s name is all but synonymous with genius was proven wrong. And so have or will all the rest who call themselves scientists be proven wrong, sooner or later. There are always errors in every scientific theory and later theories will overtake them. Laws of science are just well tested theories and they also topple in the face of new facts. <br><br><br><br>I do not claim to know what the world&#39;s climate will do in the future. I do know it has managed to stumble along without our &quot;help&quot; for billions of years. I suspect it will continue to do so. <br><br><br><br>By the way, just how many of the global climate alarmists are not being financed by government funding? Funding that is dolled out ONLY to &quot;scientists&quot; who can be depended on to claim there is cause for alarm. And why have these &quot;scientists&quot; adjusted the data to conform with their preconceived theories? The answer is obvious: the true data, without those arbitrary adjustments does not. It, in fact, clearly shows no real climate change. <br><br><br><br>In case you don&#39;t see the above process: Rich Financial People finance politicians / politicians are elected / elected representatives appoint leaders in government agencies / government agencies provide funding for scientific research / and that scientific research provides the &quot;evidence&quot; for climate change that the Rich Financial People want. And researchers who do not go along with that are NOT FUNDED. But many non-funded scientists DO look at the climate and the &quot;evidence&quot; provided by those funded ones and just shake their heads. It&#39;s a plot all right, just not the one you think. <br><br><br><br>It is not the coal and oil companies who are trying to make a killing here. It is the companies who want to develop the grossly inefficient alternate energy sources. They know they can not compete with traditional energy so they want to &quot;level&quot; the playing field with my money and yours. They are taking tax payer money to develop energy sources that will cost those same tax payers more when they use them. AND because those alternate energy sources are really more expensive, they also USE more of our resources so they are the total opposite of &quot;green&quot;. They gobble up our resources instead of saving them. On that basis along, they should be totally banned, but I do not like the government calling the shots. We simply should NOT subsidise them and just let them compete with the present energy sources while standing on their own feet. No government, no tax payer help ever. Let the free market decide if they are better. Yes, based on price. Price is an excellent way to judge just how &quot;green&quot; something is. In fact, it is probably the only way to quantify just how &quot;green&quot; something is. Higher price equals more resources expended and therefore, equates with less &quot;green&quot;. It really is common sense. Not some &quot;guilt trip&quot; that has been manufactured just to help some new companies that will make these expensive and NON-GREEN technologies and make THEIR investors rich in the process.", "comment_date": "2019-06-05T04:49:05Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Robert Kuhlmann", "comment_text": "You talk about lies of the oil industry?

The actual debate is over significance - whether climate change is mild and manageable, or is an existential threat to humanity. Conceptualising why nobody wanted to put all their eggs in the climate change basket is understandable when end of the world claims are made about almost every human activity that improves human life and development. Even being fair to the actual denialist, the claims of climate alarmists were that by the 2000s the sea level would rise by 10-20ft. Comparing that to what we know now is plenty of reason to be skeptical.

Climate change is something that happens naturally in an ecosystem as large as own. Throughout the many million of years prior to us humans being on this planet, there have been major fluctuations in temperature and C02 levels in the atmosphere that this &quot;climate change&quot; debate can be deemed as completely down to the long term natural variations in the earth&#39;s climate. In the age of the dinosaurs, they were able to exist due to the much higher C02 levels. The mega flora was able to exist due to these high C02 levels. Change in climate is completely down to how the earth changes in its position around the sun and on its axis. With the attention on melting ice caps, it has been proven that the water re-freezes on the opposite side of the globe where it is colder. The variations in temperature are down to less than a degree which is once again completely down to the natural variation in our earth&#39;s climate. On studies of some mountains that are near the area in which I live, over the past decade or so the levels of snow have been gradually rising each winter. Record cold temperatures are indeed being reached, it is just covered up by those who are so set on climate change being the &quot;impending doom of humanity&quot;. In the past the planet has had many ice ages as many are aware of. These ice ages at some point melt with the gradual re heating of the earths atmosphere. Atmospheric change is something that has happened in the past and is now happening again. Everyone who wants to bang on about how we are destroying the planet needs to stop for a second and actually take the time to educate themselves on how it is normal for an environment as complex and diverse as our own, there will be change in its characteristics over long periods of time. Give it a few hundred years and we will be seeing ourselves in a global cooling period and the process will repeat itself.

Live stock covers 45% of the world\u2019s land and only 2% of wildlife left on earth. 91% of destruction in the Amazon rainforest is due to animal agriculture. Every second 1 acre of rainforest the size of a football field is cleared for animal agriculture. The amazon rainforest is the lungs of this earth. Domestic use of water in the US only makes up 5% while animal agriculture uses 55% of USA water. The meat &amp; dairy industry uses 1/3 of earth fresh water. 1 hamburger is equivalent to 3000 liters of water which is then equal to  2 months worth of showers due to the water footprint of processed food. 1/3 of land is decertified due to livestock. 80.4 MILLION metric tons of fish are pulled from oceans each year. 3/4 of world\u2019s fisheries are exploited. For every 1 kilogram of fish caught, there are 5 kilograms of unintended marine species are caught and classified as by-kill. Waste from 2500 dairy cows is equivalent to the waste from a city of 411,000 people. 80% of antibiotics in the US goes to animal agriculture. It is also said that in areas of poverty and starvation their land is being used for livestock to feed westernized countries.ANIMAL AGRICULTURE is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, and habitat destruction. SUGAR is also the leading cause of obesity, all diabetes, and heart disease. Everyday each person is only to consume 25g of sugar per day and by the looks of it we exceed that number by a lot. Americans treat breakfast like dessert. Sugar is in everything you eat, take a minute to look at the nutrition facts on the back of the packaging. Free chocolate milks given by public school systems for breakfast and lunch of students contain the same amount of sugar as a can of coke. 1 out of every 3 people is either obese or morbidly obese. The population is said only to grow with more than 200,000 people born per day. Many mouths to feed. Yearly us humans consume 21 billion pounds of food and 5.2 billion gallons of water. While cattle consumes 135 billion pounds of food and consumes 45 billion gallons. Due to the PATRIOT act in the law we should not blame this on our government. Rather than come together for a solution. The solution is simple, and that is to create healthier lifestyle choices specifically diet and exercise. You can help save our world by becoming vegan. On a vegan diet you save 1100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 sq.ft forest, 10 pounds of CO2, and 1 animals life PER DAY.

Would I call myself a climate alarmist? - No<br><br><br>I agree with the principle of global warming and climate change, but I would argue that the effects of CO2 are exaggerated and some key things about how it interacts within the ecosystem are conveniently left out of most of these type of videos. Such as the effects are logarithmic and one hell of a stimulant for plant growth. (easy enough to look up)<br><br><br>With that said I am still in favor of limiting fossil fuel consumption, not because I think it is going to fry us all in 15 years(we were told this in schools in 1990).  We need to limit them because eventually we will run out, and without any other good viable ways to create the energy our society is so utterly dependent on, it will effect humanity in greater ways than the eventual warming of the earth.", "comment_date": "2019-04-03T14:14:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cmonkey63", "comment_text": "Whoa, when did Matt Damon grow a beard?

From 185 ppm to now 400ppm. This promotes plant growth just as the one you by to use in green houses. Google it, co2 generators. Most plants thrive in 1500ppm of co2 and in  exchange provide oxygen. If this is not convincing do your own real unbiased research. So co2 is not the real problem it could be as simple as natural events on earth. Last one was 800,000 years ago.

While renewables will make a significant contribution to our energy mix and help lift the worlds poorest living in remote areas out of abject poverty they can&#39;t power an advanced industrial civilization with that many people. Nuclear energy has the potential to power our industrial civilization without any carbon emissions. I would argue it can become the most environmentally friendly, safest, and cheapest source of electricity. But we aren&#39;t there yet and won&#39;t be for a while.

They said back in 1989 that if we don&#39;t do something in 10 years we&#39;re doomed, the ice caps will melt, food will be sparse, etc etc.  Well 10 years goes by and then another 20 years on top of that and things aren&#39;t any different.

I can promise you 12 years will come and go and nothing will be that different.  In fact, I&#39;m willing to put on record that ice caps will grow and it will get colder.  Hell, it&#39;s already happening.  We&#39;ve seen snow in the Arizona deserts.  MASSIVE snow falls in the mountains.  Utah has received almost 200% of it&#39;s typical snowfall this year.  The midwest had snow on May 10 last year.  There was basically no spring.  Winter extended much longer and it broke immediately to a mild summer.  <br><br>Sure, it&#39;s gotten a LITTLE warmer over the last couple decades, but nothing outside of natural variability.  Ice caps are still there.  In fact the Arctic is growing, slightly.  Antarctica was at an all time maximum in 2014.  Nobody ever talks about that though because it doesn&#39;t fit the narrative.  The Arctic was reduced by the same amount if not more during the 1930&#39;s and 40&#39;s, then grew back during the 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s.  There are way more days recorded in the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s over 90 degrees, 95 degrees and 100 degrees than the past 2 decades combined and doubled.  It&#39;s mostly a lie folks.  Yes we do cause some warming, but we don&#39;t have a clue how much and the more we study, the less it appears we do.  Exxon scientists were not 100% sure of anything.  They believed it because they started doing the study right out of a dip in our climate and when they saw warming in correlation with the C02 output they said, yep we&#39;re doing it.  However, the understanding of our sun, cosmic rays etc and how they affect cloud cover etc, was not understood at all during that time, as well as a myriad of other things that effect the climate.  The science wasn&#39;t there for them to be able to understand exactly what was happening.  IN FACT 30 years later we still don&#39;t have the science to understand everything.  The IPCC even admits to that.  <br><br>I want to pose a question to you and you tell me what is more likely.<br><br>A group of companies KNOW we are destroying our planet and chose to hide these facts in pursuit of short term monetary gain but causing absolute doom to it&#39;s company and all the people/animals/planet<br><br>OR<br><br>A group of people are making up fake claims of doom for political/monetary gain, KNOWING full well there&#39;s not immediate doom but also know they can get a power grab in this way?<br><br>Before anyone starts saying &quot;yeah right, 97% of scientists are all in on a scam, your so full of it&quot;  know this.  That 97% claim is bogus.  That number was reached by scouring papers that talked about global warming.  Out of those they only included papers that gave a position on whether or not it was man made.  Out of all the papers scanned, only about 36% of the papers took a position.  OF that 36%, 97% said it was caused by humans, BUT they didn&#39;t say how much.

A actual more recent poll was done of 1,821 meteorologists and only 52% claimed it&#39;s caused by man.  Only 37% of those that actually do weather predictions claimed man is the cause.

Wow! that\u2019s definitely how science works! My weatherman can\u2019t tell me if it\u2019s going to be sunny tomorrow but he figured out our warming trend is caused by humans, and not say, the idea that the earth naturally cools and heats over long periods of time do to things like sun spots. Believe humans are the cause of \u201cclimate change\u201d? Alright! You want to hear the real cover up behind climate change?<br>The political left and the Democratic Party have used the argument that humans are the cause of climate change to punish big corporations, put a stop to our oil industry, and basically destroy capitalism entirely for a new wave of \u201cdemocratic\u201d socialism. Let\u2019s take a look at one of the main figures leading the left, AOC. She proposed a \u201cNew green deal\u201d which wishes to get rid of all combustion engines (your car), planes, and FARTING COWS (I wish this was a joke) by 2020 do to the evil effects of climate change. Also repair and remodel every single building in the United States to be \u201cenergy efficient\u201d (Including your home!) To do this her and other leaders on the left want to... you guessed it! Tax those evil corporations who are literally making money off the industry they wish to destroy! Makes so much sense doesn\u2019t it? <br>I\u2019m sorry, but if you believe humans are the main cause of climate change, hands down, with no other explanation you have no right to call yourself a \u201cscientist\u201d just because you got a degree at some leftist loon college where your professor taught you the glories of socialism and communism, two economic system which have led millions to death and poverty. <br>If you do still believe that humans are the cause, hands down.

Just because you stop drinking out of plastic straws, become a hippie and destroy corporations and capitalism doesn\u2019t mean the Chinese and other counties also will. <br>C. The best way to produce less fossil fuels in innovation. As technology SLOWLY increases, we will EVENTUALLY rely less on fossil fuels. <br>In conclusion. <br>Climate change is propaganda from the political left. <br>If you believe humans are the cause of it, a free market is the best way to stop it, not government control. <br>If you disagree with me please leave your hate comment below calling me a racist, evil, capitalism loving, brainwashed denier.", "comment_date": "2019-03-21T03:37:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bobby Arceo", "comment_text": "Help I don&#39;t know what to believe.

And if human actions effect it, then so does literally everything else.  The act of being on the planet means you&#39;re effecting the climate.  3, even if the US went 100% carbon negative, we still would not be able to stop the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere.  4, the greenhouse effect that has been calculated is rumored to have been arrived at using flat Earth physics and grossly overestimates the effect on the atmosphere.  5, the majority of the weather and the climate is determined by the interaction between the two most abundant fluids on the planet: water and air.  Trying to predict the results of that is like trying to balance a pencil on it&#39;s tip.  And lastly, the very people who are dedicated to observing and predicting the weather (it&#39;s kinda like a climate slice) can&#39;t even get their predictions right a week in advance or even get it near correct with live data!

It&#39;s an electric universe. Planet earth is not the on planet to be affected. Once you see the Bigger picture of space weather, earth weather that we see world wide makes sense &amp; you&#39;ll will ask yourself why did I think that co2  had any major impact at all. Ponder this: the big dinars and all the plants &amp; huge trees loved the co2 level that was up to 660ppm then. Verified from ice cores &amp; ocean floor core sampling.

It&#39;s consequently a fair question to ask why Exxon would then continue to drill-baby-drill.  The answer seems clear enough - the naked pursuit of profit - BUT neither Exxon&#39;s scientists&#39; belief in AGW then nor scientists&#39; belief now constitute the necessary proof to resolve the matter as &#39;settled science&#39;.  Then, as now, AGW was a theory.  Then, as now, there was no empirically verifiable proof that human causes are heating up the planet.  Then, as now, the earth&#39;s climate was a system so complex as to defy any capacity to accurately model it over any extended period of time.  As such, then, as now, AGW remains an unproven THEORY.  The best climate models today running on the most powerful supercomputers can&#39;t consistently correlate CO2 emissions to observed climate behavior (specifically, no models forecast &#39;the pause&#39;).<br><br>Bottom line..  Exxon may indeed have covered up their scientists&#39; theories about fossil fuel emissions and the earth&#39;s climate.  A pox on their house for doing so.  But those opinions do not prove - any more than today&#39;s climate scientists&#39; opinions do - that AGW is definitively, predictably occurring.<br><br><br>And environmentalists only sow more skepticism with their repeated sky-is-falling bleats that the time for debate and discussion is over.

This is mostly correct, but generally misleading. Yes, there is certainly no debate among the scientific community that climate change is real and worsening. Contrary to what this video might convey, most in the Republican Party would agree with this assessment. <br><br>The \u201cdebate\u201d does still exist with regards to both the imminence of the threat and the optimal course of action to address it. The IPCC itself projects rising seal levels to occur over the next 100 years, while others in the scientific community predict it to happen sooner. That certainly sounds like debate to me.<br><br>In another way, the \u201cdebate\u201d is also focused on what to do about it. Is the government of the United States the best facilitator of emission reductions? Or are private, non-profit institutions? If the government has a role (which it certainly does) how big of a role does it play? Will enough everyday Americans pressure business to change environmentally unfriendly practices without the need for a government mandate to do so? Should the onus be put more heavily on developing nations, who constitute the overwhelming majority of harmful emissions production, to modernize their energy sectors? These are the questions that Republicans are asking. It is not denial of the issue of climate change. <br><br>I am not excusing the negligent behavior of companies like Exxon or their profit-driven cognitive dissonance. Nor am I excusing any individual politician in the Republican Party who has willfully denied the existence of climate change over the years. I\u2019d just rather not caricature half of the American electorate as ignorant or as harborers of malevolent intent.

They were saying (as are &#39;deniers&#39; of today) that there isn&#39;t significant enough evidence to come to a drastic conclusion. <br><br><br>To digress quickly, the use of the term &#39;denier&#39; in regard to the study of climate and potential anthropogenic effects is extremely alarming. It shows that the issue has moved from being a scientific question to a political dogma nearing a point of becoming a religion in and of itself. Any scientific question should be able to be studied. Those who study them are not &#39;deniers&#39; for straying from the manufactured narrative. They are scientists doing what scientists are supposed to do. <br><br><br>Secondly the idea of consensus on the issue of climate change is laughable. It is a shining example of pseudo science/statistics coupled with the stupidity and danger of mass group think. The studies that show scientific consensus are a blatant distortion of the truth so great that the content can be called a lie. The Cook et Al study that is endlessly repeated by every liberal media platform is a joke that is most often used to prove consensus. <br>1st. It analyzed only the abstracts of thousands of scientific papers that contained the terms &quot;Global Warming&quot; or &quot;Global Climate Change&quot;. If a scientific paper was written to study a particular phenomenon, (lets say the impact of solar radiation and the stripping of &#39;light&#39; atomic particles from the ionosphere and mesosphere) this study would have an impact on the concept of &#39;global warming&#39;, but there is no reason for the scientist to reference it in his abstract.<br>Furthermore, the study included papers that imply anthropogenic causes of warming but do not test that hypothesis. These studies could include potential mitigation strategies, opinions, etc. <br>A scientist saying he/she implicitly agrees with a concept without testing or questioning said concept cannot be regarded as a reliable source for the validity of the original concept. <br><br><br>2nd. The study lumps together people who say humans are the chief cause of warming with those who merely mention factors that are in some way responsible for warming to some extent. Effectivly, if a paper mentions anything related to climate that the editors of the study can tie back to human caused warming, it is counted as a &#39;yes&#39; vote even if it did not pick one way or another. <br><br><br>3rd. (this is the most damming) If the study stated that there wasn&#39;t sufficient evidence to support the catastrophic warming hypotheses, the study was thrown out and not counted as a part of the 97% in any way. 66% of the eleven thousand studies referenced specifically stated that there was not sufficient evidence one way or another and was disregarded entirely. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Next, about Exxon building offshore oil platforms higher up to prepare for rising sea levels. If you genuinely believe this you seem to be an incompetent buffoon or too lazy to google how any oil platform works. The new oil rigs used (just like the one shown in the video) today aren&#39;t tied to the sea floor. Changes in sea level do not affect them in any way.

The next molecule of CO2 has less heat retention qualities than the previous.<br><br>CO2 is a minuscule part of the atmosphere.  Only 4 molecules out of every ten thousand molecules of atmosphere are CO2.  150 years ago, before human industrialization, it was 3 out of ten thousand.

They build research centers in the Antarctic on jacks so they can raise them up each year to keep up with the ice/snow accumulation.

Increased temps increase oxygen fixation in C3 plants but increased CO2 yields greater crop yield. The only more certain negative affect is rising sea levels which can be dealt with decades at a time, excluding river flooding. Overall, we expect 2100 to be 4 degrees C warmer, so for me that&#39;s roughly -16 in the winter months and +34 in the warmer months and isn&#39;t a substantial change as everyone forecasts.

There&#39;s no question in that. None here seem to be talking about inter-glacial period, or the invalidity of putting everything in the heat equation that is not solar forcing on to the human side of the equation. We do need to work for solutions to protect ourselves from the inevitable warming of the planet and the biosphere damage caused due to lack of discipline in waste management. But even the model used for causality and the p-value calculation issues for CO2 are enormous and don&#39;t fulfill statistical significance. A lot of the studies seem to use the similar datasets for studies. This in itself is absurd scientific irresponsibility. Also the 60% value you claim are of not even a fraction of all vertebrates. The study has since been met with enough  criticism from with the community itself.  Please do study deeper on the topic and don&#39;t be okay with just superficial reading. Green new deal will never be fiscally feasible and will lead to mass issues with food production and there&#39;s literally nothing good that will come without going above this in a systematic way. The green new deal is a political tool to misuse our hard earned money in solutions that aren&#39;t backed by facts but outrage at the problems we&#39;ve caused. Critics are there for a good reason,  science has always benefited from the works of critics who go a step further than consensus mongers who push out papers of low quality just to appeal to popular opinion. I love the environment and am the director of a solar panel company, a research scholar in robotics and I love to read indepth, and being  someone who loves all that is human and also nature, I go about treating both well, but I wouldn&#39;t bend the arm of the farmers and poor people by giving unnecessary power to the government to rebuild and order innovation in the way they please. The green new deal is full of wishful thinking and fiscal irresponsibility. We must put efforts to regulate our emissions on the argument that we have the duty to protect the biosphere. But it is not because we must reduce CO2 emissions. As we will begin to enter the next inter-glacial period of the earth&#39;s life, we will have to prepare for the heating up. It&#39;s inevitable.  We must focus our resources in trying to create infrastructure that supports protecting ourselves from the effects and also our ecosystem to the best of our efforts through the process. Somewhat like what Noah had to do for the inevitable flood. Sorry for the theistic example, I know not many like such a statement. But it is what it is. The last iceage stated because of tectonic shift in the American subcontinent and the change it did to oceanic flow and we just happened to evolve into todays world as a happy coincidence.

There&#39;s been radical climate changes before humans and sea levels rises as well. The reality is we still don&#39;t understand climate as well as we think we do. Other than CO2, another green house gas is vaporized water and we can&#39;t even predict how clouds form, heck, we can&#39;t even predict the weather within a 10 day span. From 1800 to now, the global temperature rose 1 celcius degree and the sea levels rose at an average of 9 inches. 12,800 years ago, at the end of the Younger Dryas, average temperatures rose 10 celsius degrees in a span of 10 years, more than a 100 times faster than the one we&#39;ve experienced in the last 140 years. Scientists still don&#39;t understand why this happened. Over the past 500 million years, sea levels have gone up and down dramatically (as much as 700 feet higher than today, other times 100 feet lower). My point is, the data we have shows correlation but doesn&#39;t actually suggest CO2 is what&#39;s causing the temperature to rise, it does create a lot of pollution which is killing millions of people every year though. Don&#39;t lose hope, keep fighting to reduce fossil fuel pollution, keep fighting to make a switch to renewable energy, but that might not fix the problem, only slow it down.

Now there are many different fact-based counter-arguments I could use to explain why that\u2019s wrong. I could explain how the climate has always been going through massive changes since the Earth\u2019s very creation billions of years ago. I could further elaborate on that point by explaining how in just the past two thousand years we have seen the \u201cRoman Warm Period\u201d which lasted from roughly 250 BC to 400 AD, and was even hotter than it is today. Followed by the \u201cCooler Dark Ages\u201d which lasted from roughly 450 \u2013 900 AD. Which was then followed by the \u201cMedieval Warm Period\u201d which lasted from roughly 950 - 1250 AD and was at least as warm as today. Which was next followed by the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d which lasted from roughly 1300 \u2013 1850 AD. After that was another Warming Trend which we are currently in right now. It is generally agreed on by all scientists that before the 1960\u2019s there is no way that CO2 emissions were sufficient enough to play a part in climate change. However, the current warming period started around the 1850\u2019s roughly a century before humans could start playing any significant part in it. This would be an entirely fact-based argument.<br><br>Or instead of that counter-argument I could simply point out that right now Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto are also going through a warming period. Astronomers found this out by measuring the ice on those planets (Pluto isn\u2019t technically a Planet anymore but that\u2019s just semantics). That would also be an entirely fact-based argument.<br><br>However, the argument I would like to focus on is one that\u2019s a little more simple yet still fairly indisputable. Your entire belief relies on mankind&#39;s CO2 emission being the primary factor in global warming. This is the entire core of your belief and if it is proven wrong then your entire beliefs about global warming are false. So let me ask you something. Do you know why climate change alarmists were so big on using the term \u201cglobal warming\u201d in the 90\u2019s but shortly after the beginning of the 2000\u2019s they quickly decided to switch to the term \u201cclimate change\u201d. This was actually pretty simple. The reason why is cause global warming STOPPED. That\u2019s right, around the beginning of the 2000\u2019s the climate stopped warming and has remained flat since then. We are nearing two decades now with no change in the temperature of the climate. So maybe right now you&#39;re thinking \u201coh well, humans must have lowered their CO2 emissions\u201d. And if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking then you are dead wrong. In fact it\u2019s quite the opposite. Mankind is actually expending more CO2 emissions than ever before. In fact about 25% of all CO2 emissions from all of humanity have occurred during this period of no net warming.<br><br>So here\u2019s the deal, your belief is that mankind is the primary factor that contributes to the warming of the climate and the primary way they do this is through CO2 emissions. Your belief requires that the more CO2 emissions humanity is expending, the warmer the climate gets. This is the very core of your belief and it\u2019s critical that it be true or your beliefs are just flat-out wrong. This is not some trivial detail for your belief, this is make-or-break. Now the facts make it very clear that humanity is expending far, far more CO2 emissions than ever before and the climate is not warming. This means that your beliefs and the facts are incompatible. They cannot both be true, it is simply a logical contradiction. You have to choose what has more credibility to you. Your ideological beliefs or the facts. I choose to believe the facts over any of my ideological beliefs. If a fact proves my ideological beliefs wrong then my ideological beliefs adjust or change entirely. Now you have to choose whether or not you will ignore the facts so that your ideological beliefs do not have to adjust or change for them. To be completely honest I don\u2019t think you will. I think you will do exactly as I have said liberals do. You will ignore the facts as soon as they become inconvenient for your ideology. Just as you ignored all the facts about Justin Cooks fraudulence earlier. Generally speaking, you guys hold such blind, irrational faith in AGW that it is comparable to a religion for you guys. For most of you, there is no amount a facts in the world that can deter you from this near-religious faith in AGW.
