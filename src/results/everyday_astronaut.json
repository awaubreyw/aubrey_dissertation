And there\u2019s a wide range of ways you can actually power a rocket engine and make it work. \n\nThey can be super simple, like just opening the valves of a tank under high pressure to having complex pumps arranged in a fashion so confusing it\u2019s a miracle anyone ever figured out how to build them in the first place.\n\nSo today we\u2019re going to talk about cold gas, pressure fed, electric pump fed, open cycle, closed cycle, full flow staged combustion, tap off and expander cycles. We\u2019ll go over their pros and cons and lots of fun examples of each one!\n\nCheck out our article version of this video too for sources and links! - https://everydayastronaut.com/rocket-engine-cycles/\n\n00:00 - Intro\n02:55 - Basics Of Rocket Engines\n\r05:35 - Cold Gas Thrusters\n10:25 - Monopropellant Pressure Fed\n14:15 - Bipropellant Pressure Fed\n\r17:45 - Electric Pump Fed\n\r21:05 - Open Cycle\n25:40 - Closed Cycle [Ox Rich]\n\r31:15 - Closed Cycle [Fuel Rich]\n35:25 - Full Flow Staged Combustion\n44:25 - Tap-Off Cycle\n\r46:45 - Expander Cycle\n52:20 - Summary  \r\r\n\n--------------------------\n\nWant to support what I do?

This UN-CREWED rocket will lift off from Starbase (Boca Chica), Texas under the power of three Raptor engines. At apogee, it will flip into a horizontal (belly flop) configuration for descent. Prior to landing, it will ignite three of its Raptor engines to initiate the landing flip before shutting one down. SN15 will attempt a propulsive landing on the landing pad, potentially becoming the first Starship prototype to successfully do so.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n03:05 - Prelaunch Preview\n08:45 - Introducing MaryLiz Bender!\n11:30 - Inside Starship\n15:00 - Q&A\n05:23:50 - LIFT OFF!\n05:29:30 - Landing!\n06:45:40 - Slow Mo replays!\n\n\nNeed to know more information?

Why are they going from belly flopping and then flipping to tail down and why are they doing that so close to the ground?  Why don\u2019t they just start the flip maneuver earlier and ensure there\u2019s enough time to make corrections if something goes wrong? \n\nWe\u2019ll also dive into the different options SpaceX has with lighting engines, how many engines can they run and at what altitude?

Can you even survive the G forces?! Should SpaceX just give up on the belly flop and do a landing more like a Falcon 9, which has proven to be highly successful?\n\nSo today we\u2019ll look at the wonders of terminal velocity, gravity drag, thrust to weight ratios, and engine throttling to see why SpaceX is trying this belly flop maneuver and see if we think it\u2019s worth it or if SpaceX should go back to the drawing board. \n\nCheck out the article version of this video here! - https://everydayastronaut.com/starships-belly-flop-maneuver\n\n00:00 - Intro\n03:15 - How The Flip Maneuver Works\n06:00 - Why Belly Flop / Terminal Velocity\n13:15 - Thrust to Weight Ratios / Engine Throttling\n21:00 - Gravity Loss / Gravity Drag\n26:25 - Why Flip So Late\n33:45 - Can This Be Safe?\n39:30 - Conclusion\n\nBe sure and follow Cosmic Perspective on YouTube too! http://youtube.com/cosmicperspective\n\n--------------------------\n\nWant to support what I do?

Should SpaceX just give up on the belly flop and do a landing more like a Falcon 9, which has proven to be highly successful?\n\nSo today we\u2019ll look at the wonders of terminal velocity, gravity drag, thrust to weight ratios, and engine throttling to see why SpaceX is trying this belly flop maneuver and see if we think it\u2019s worth it or if SpaceX should go back to the drawing board. \n\nCheck out the article version of this video here! - https://everydayastronaut.com/starships-belly-flop-maneuver\n\n00:00 - Intro\n03:15 - How The Flip Maneuver Works\n06:00 - Why Belly Flop / Terminal Velocity\n13:15 - Thrust to Weight Ratios / Engine Throttling\n21:00 - Gravity Loss / Gravity Drag\n26:25 - Why Flip So Late\n33:45 - Can This Be Safe?\n39:30 - Conclusion\n\nBe sure and follow Cosmic Perspective on YouTube too! http://youtube.com/cosmicperspective\n\n--------------------------\n\nWant to support what I do?

You can watch a full version with clean audio and 4K video (what's shown in the top right of the screen) here - https://youtu.be/uIyKS_9tP08\n\nAnd a slow mo 120 FPS 4K version as well - https://youtu.be/KfMCApWc5xE\n\nOn December 9th, 2020, SpaceX conducted a test of their Starship SN8 prototype in Boca Chica, Texas outside of Brownsville. Despite very low expectations, it successfully lifted off, completed 2 planned engine shutdowns and reached its planned apogee of 12.5km. \n\nThen it shut down its engine and belly-flopped back to the landing pad, successfully relit 2 of its engines, and performed a bellyflop to tail-down maneuver, before losing pressure in the fuel header tank, causing it to lose its engines and crash down faster than survivable, although right on target. \n\nThis was shot from nearby South Padre Island along with Cosmic Perspective (Ryan Chylinski and Maryliz Bender), Spadre (Gene and Rachel Gore).\n\nDefinitely check out Cosmic Perspective's incredible videos from the launch! - https://youtu.be/xrVqLhhd1zo\n\nAnd check out our clean 4K with clean audio version here - https://youtu.be/uIyKS_9tP08\n\nAnd our slow mo 4K super cut with tons of gorgeous shots! - https://youtu.be/KfMCApWc5xE\n\nHave questions about Starship?

This mission, Crew-1 (USCV-1), will mark SpaceX\u2019s first operational crewed launch as part of the Commercial Crew Program.\n\nCrew-1, or USCV-1, will mark the first regular crew rotation mission that is launched on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

The Artemis program is shaping up with checks written and hardware built! So how does a 21st Century program to the moon compare to that of the 1960's?\n\nIn Today's video, we\u2019re going to answer the question, why does NASA think Artemis will be a sustainable program when SLS is sooooo dang expensive AND it\u2019ll take at least two launches to get humans and their lunar landers to the moon.\n\nThis CAN\u2019T be more sustainable than Apollo, right? Well, we didn\u2019t even begin to scratch the surface of the costs, so today we\u2019re going to really dive into the total costs, including development, infrastructure and hardware by giving SLS and Orion a full cost audit.\n\nBut we\u2019ll even show you how the Apollo program and Artemis mission profiles differ including the specific orbits and rendezvous and everything required to get humans to the surface of the moon and even talk about the upgraded safety considerations and hardware involved.\n\nOnce we look at all these details, we can answer the question, 50 years later, is the Artemis program actually an improvement over the Apollo program or is NASA going completely in the wrong direction when returning to the moon?\n\n#ApolloVSArtemis #SLSVSSaturnV\n\n00:00 - Intro\n03:50 - The Hardware\n15:55 - The Missions\n29:15 - Safety & Upgrades\n35:50 - Program Costs\n46:20 - Rant\n52:25 - The Good Parts of Artemis\n55:35 - Conclusion\n\n--------------------------\n\nWant to support what I do?

The Falcon 9 will launch from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, in Florida. The booster supporting this mission (B1056.3) flew on CRS-17 on May 4th, 2019, and again on CRS-18 on July 25th, 2019. The booster is going to be recovered on SpaceX\u2019s droneship,  Of Course I Still Love You. The fairings are going to be recovered on Go Ms. Chief and Go Ms. Tree, which left port on 12/14/19, heading over 700km downrange.\n\nWant to learn more?

The Dragon \u2014 which has flown twice \u2014 will be launched on a Falcon 9 (1059.1) from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral in Florida. The booster supporting this mission is brand new. After the booster releases the second stage and Dragon, it will perform a boost back burn, reentry burn, and landing burn. The booster will land on Of Course I Still Love You, which will be located 344.42km down range.

The Dragon \u2014 which has flown twice \u2014 will be launched on a Falcon 9 (1059.1) from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral in Florida. The booster supporting this mission is brand new. After the booster releases the second stage and Dragon, it will perform a boost back burn, reentry burn, and landing burn. The booster will land on Of Course I Still Love You, which will be located 344.42km down range. It is unclear why the booster is landing downrange, when it is a routine mission for NASA and SpaceX.\n\nWant to learn more?

They're attempt to land near the south pole of the moon at 70.9 degrres south between craters Manzinus C and Simpelius N. \n\nThis would be the first soft landing for India and will be quite an exciting event. The spacecraft, Chandrayaan-2 is actually made of of an orbiter/kick stage, a lander and a rover.\n\nAnd at a total mission cost of around $150 million USD, it's considered to be an incredibly cost efficient mission of this caliber. \n\nSince I'm going on a few hours early, I figure we'll replicate this mission in Kerbal Space Program and give you a sense of how they did it!\n\n----------------------------------\n\nShow your support by becoming a Patreon - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nThe best place for all your space merch needs!\nhttps://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nAll music is original!

They're attempt to land near the south pole of the moon at 70.9 degrres south between craters Manzinus C and Simpelius N. \n\nThis would be the first soft landing for India and will be quite an exciting event. The spacecraft, Chandrayaan-2 is actually made of of an orbiter/kick stage, a lander and a rover.\n\nAnd at a total mission cost of around $150 million USD, it's considered to be an incredibly cost efficient mission of this caliber. \n\nSince I'm going on a few hours early, I figure we'll replicate this mission in Kerbal Space Program and give you a sense of how they did it!\n\n----------------------------------\n\nShow your support by becoming a Patreon - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nThe best place for all your space merch needs!\nhttps://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nAll music is original!

Next attempt: 8/27 at 4:00 PM (ish) central (21:00 ish UTC?\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nSpaceX is targeting a T-0 time of around 5:00 p.m. central (22:00 UTC) the test is subject to change of time OR date. Although I currently plan on streaming at 12:30 local, it is subject to change. \n\nSpaceX plans to try and hop their StarShip prototype vehicle known as StarHopper today with  serial number 6 Raptor Engine. The vehicle will hopefully fly to about 150 meters (492 feet) up will likely translate over to the landing pad about 100 meters away (328 feet).\n\nThis is a very important milestone for the StarShip / StarHopper prototype, but it's also very high risk. Hopefully everything goes well so the program can continue at this rapid pace.\n\nNeed to know more about the Raptor engine and why it's awesome? https://youtu.be/LbH1ZDImaI8\n\nWant to know more about what the StarHopper is or how it differs from StarShip?

Here you go! - https://everydayastronaut.com/rocket-lab-electron-reuse/\n\nRocket Lab just announced they plan to try and recover their Electron rockets using a parachute and a helicopter\u2026 Yeah, seriously.\n\nToday we\u2019re going to dive into Rocket Lab\u2019s plans for reusability including some deep dives on the challenges they face including the forces and velocities. \n\nThen we\u2019ll go into the history of air recovery, and compare Rocket Lab\u2019s reusability plans to other space systems that utilize parachutes such as the space shuttle\u2019s SRBs, the Falcon 9, SpaceX\u2019s fairings, and even ULA\u2019s similar plans they\u2019re calling SMART reuse.\n\nI also got exclusive information from Rocket Lab and Peter Beck himself with some exciting additional details on just how exactly they hope to do this.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nThanks to Declan Murphy from http://Flightclub.io for helping me get all that yummy data!

The vehicle successfully flew to about 20 meters (60 feet) up and translated over a bit to the side as well. \n\nThis is a very important milestone for the StarShip / StarHopper prototype, even though it may not have looked like much!\n\nSorry for the change in exposure, I tried switching from auto exposure down to a fixed shutter speed at the apex and then switched back. \n\nFeel free to use this footage for your own purposes, please just credit Everyday Astronaut, link to this video in the description and maintain original cropping.

                    "description": "(UPDATE) - the vehicle attempted a hop but immediately after ignition it shut its engine down. They then attempted for another try a few hours later but wound up scrubbing. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: There is no publicly available T-0 and the test is subject to change of time OR date. So don't be surprised if this stream gets delayed as well, I'll start streaming once fuel is loading so as not to waste battery or be out in the heat too long.\n\nSpaceX plans to try and hop their StarShip prototype vehicle known as StarHopper today with  serial number 6 Raptor Engine. The vehicle will hopefully fly to about 20 meters (60 feet) up and may translate over a little to the side as well. \n\nThis is a very important milestone for the StarShip / StarHopper prototype, but it's also very high risk. Hopefully everything goes well so the program can continue at this rapid pace.\n\nNeed to know more about the Raptor engine and why it's awesome? https://youtu.be/LbH1ZDImaI8\n\nWant to know more about what the StarHopper is or how it differs from StarShip?

Why on the Moon is that gap so huge?! Isn\u2019t it dangerous to require an astronaut to jump down onto the surface and jump back up?\n\nThe lunar lander\u2019s ladder had nine rungs all spaced 22.8 cm (9\u201d) apart, but the gap between the last rung and the ground was about three times that at a whopping 76 cm (30\u201d)! So really, the ladder wasn\u2019t missing one rung, it was missing two!\n\nI mean sure, the gravity\u2019s only 1/6th that of Earth\u2019s, but wouldn\u2019t it have been so much safer if there was even one more rung to close that gap up a little? \n \nSo today we\u2019re going to look into why NASA and the Lunar Lander\u2019s manufacturer Grumman, chose a ladder of this length, we\u2019ll talk about design considerations of the hardware, the unknown conditions of the lunar surface, and the astronauts who were basically too smooth of pilots to get the ladder\u2019s last rung any closer to the surface of the moon.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nHUGE thanks to my Moon Walker Patreon supporters!

This Falcon Heavy is composed of a new block 5 center core (B1057) and the two block 5 side boosters (B1052 & B1053) from the Arabsat-6A mission.\n\nThe launch window for this mission opens at 11:30 PM EDT on June 24, 2019 and is 4 hours in duration. The Falcon Heavy will be lifting off from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After burning for about 2 and a half minutes, the side boosters will separate from the core booster and boost back to the launch site for a landing at Landing Zones 1 & 2 (LZ-1 & LZ-2). The core booster will continue burning for another minute, before shutting down and separating from the second stage.  The core booster will be landing approximately 1,240 km (771 miles) downrange on Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship, Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY).\n\n--------------------------------\n\nWant to support what I do?

                "description": "00:00 - Intro\n02:55 - Basic physics of rocket engines \n06:10 - Rocket engine cycles \n20:30 - Rocket fuel comparison\n30:40 - Raptor vs other rocket engines\n44:05 - Summary\n\nArticle version - https://everydayastronaut.com/?p=9823&preview=true\n\nSpaceX's new raptor engine is a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine and its so hard to develop, no engine like this has ever flown before! \n\nNow this topic can be really intimidating so in order to bring the Raptor engine into context, we\u2019re going to do an overview of a few common types of rocket engine cycles then compare the Raptor to a few other common rocket engines, like SpaceX\u2019s current work horse, the Merlin, The Space Shuttle\u2019s RS-25, the RD-180, Blue Origin\u2019s BE-4 and the F-1 engine.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough, not only is SpaceX using a crazy engine cycle, they\u2019re also going to be using Liquid Methane as their fuel, again something that no orbital rocket has ever used! So we\u2019ll also go over the unique characteristics of liquid methane as a rocket fuel and see if we can figure out why SpaceX went with Methane for the Raptor engine.\n\nWe'll also break down and explain all the different engine cycle types so you know what the full flow staged combustion cycle is, how it works, and how it compares to the other cycles.\n\nSo by the end of this video hopefully we\u2019ll have the context to know why the raptor engine is special, how it compares to other rocket engines, why it\u2019s using methane and hopefully find out if the Raptor engine will be the new king of rocket engines\u2026\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nRocket engine renders by  @MartianDays https://twitter.com/MartianDays\n\nF-1 Turbopump photo provided by Mike Jetzer/heroicrelics.org\n\nHUGE thanks to my Moon Walker Patreon supporters!

                    "description": "00:00 - Intro\n02:55 - Basic physics of rocket engines \n06:10 - Rocket engine cycles \n20:30 - Rocket fuel comparison\n30:40 - Raptor vs other rocket engines\n44:05 - Summary\n\nArticle version - https://everydayastronaut.com/?p=9823&preview=true\n\nSpaceX's new raptor engine is a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine and its so hard to develop, no engine like this has ever flown before! \n\nNow this topic can be really intimidating so in order to bring the Raptor engine into context, we\u2019re going to do an overview of a few common types of rocket engine cycles then compare the Raptor to a few other common rocket engines, like SpaceX\u2019s current work horse, the Merlin, The Space Shuttle\u2019s RS-25, the RD-180, Blue Origin\u2019s BE-4 and the F-1 engine.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough, not only is SpaceX using a crazy engine cycle, they\u2019re also going to be using Liquid Methane as their fuel, again something that no orbital rocket has ever used! So we\u2019ll also go over the unique characteristics of liquid methane as a rocket fuel and see if we can figure out why SpaceX went with Methane for the Raptor engine.\n\nWe'll also break down and explain all the different engine cycle types so you know what the full flow staged combustion cycle is, how it works, and how it compares to the other cycles.\n\nSo by the end of this video hopefully we\u2019ll have the context to know why the raptor engine is special, how it compares to other rocket engines, why it\u2019s using methane and hopefully find out if the Raptor engine will be the new king of rocket engines\u2026\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nRocket engine renders by  @MartianDays https://twitter.com/MartianDays\n\nF-1 Turbopump photo provided by Mike Jetzer/heroicrelics.org\n\nHUGE thanks to my Moon Walker Patreon supporters!

                "title": "\"27 Merlins\" Music composed to Falcon Heavy's sequence of events",
                "description": "This 3 song album is based on Falcon Heavy's actual sequence of events from its inaugural launch, February 6th, 2018 from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center. These songs represent the emotions I experienced watching the Falcon Heavy launch in person: The suspense leading up to T-0, the rush of adrenaline when side booster ignition occurred at T - 7 seconds, the disbelief and awe at lift off. The following moment was best described by Elon Musk with \"Holy flying f*@k, that thing took off.\" There was anticipation leading up to maximum aerodynamic pressure, when it settled in that everything was actually going as planned, there was pure euphoria.\n\nAt T plus 2:33, with breaths held, Falcon Heavy's side boosters successfully deployed. With the riskiest part of the test flight over, everyone sat in wonder as the boosters began to fall back to Earth. We were listening intently to the radio call outs as we watched them fall, hoping they would make it back safely. Once the engines lit for the landing burn, the crowd screamed in celebration as the twin boosters landed softly. The call out: \"The Falcons have landed.\" \n\nThe live-stream cut to Starman in orbit, an image that instantly became iconic. An image that immediately awakened the public, called for the world's attention, and set a new stage for human space exploration.\n\nThe video has not been altered in any way from the official SpaceX video here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c&t=687s. \n\n(Yes, their T clock does jump a few times) Timing of major events was intentionally written to match all sequence of events. There's also a few fun \"Easter eggs\" like 27 bars before T-0, the first chord being an F Major (that was one major (F)alcon rocket) and audio samples from the webcast.\n\nAlbum coming to Spotify, iTunes, Google Play, and many more in April, 2019.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLIMITED EDITION FALCORN HEAVY SHIRTS!!!

                    "description": "This 3 song album is based on Falcon Heavy's actual sequence of events from its inaugural launch, February 6th, 2018 from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center. These songs represent the emotions I experienced watching the Falcon Heavy launch in person: The suspense leading up to T-0, the rush of adrenaline when side booster ignition occurred at T - 7 seconds, the disbelief and awe at lift off. The following moment was best described by Elon Musk with \"Holy flying f*@k, that thing took off.\" There was anticipation leading up to maximum aerodynamic pressure, when it settled in that everything was actually going as planned, there was pure euphoria.\n\nAt T plus 2:33, with breaths held, Falcon Heavy's side boosters successfully deployed. With the riskiest part of the test flight over, everyone sat in wonder as the boosters began to fall back to Earth. We were listening intently to the radio call outs as we watched them fall, hoping they would make it back safely. Once the engines lit for the landing burn, the crowd screamed in celebration as the twin boosters landed softly. The call out: \"The Falcons have landed.\" \n\nThe live-stream cut to Starman in orbit, an image that instantly became iconic. An image that immediately awakened the public, called for the world's attention, and set a new stage for human space exploration.\n\nThe video has not been altered in any way from the official SpaceX video here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c&t=687s. \n\n(Yes, their T clock does jump a few times) Timing of major events was intentionally written to match all sequence of events. There's also a few fun \"Easter eggs\" like 27 bars before T-0, the first chord being an F Major (that was one major (F)alcon rocket) and audio samples from the webcast.\n\nAlbum coming to Spotify, iTunes, Google Play, and many more in April, 2019.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLIMITED EDITION FALCORN HEAVY SHIRTS!!!

                "description": "Get the full and simple run down here! - https://everydayastronaut.com/prelaunch-preview-blue-origin-ns10/\n\nBlue Origin will be launching their New Shepherd rocket for the 10th time from their west Texas launch site. The New Shepherd is a 18 m (60 feet) suborbital vertical takeoff and landing rocket. The booster is powered by a hydrolox BE-3 engine.  The engine burns for about 2 minutes and 30 seconds, pushing rocket toward skyward the 100 km Karman Line. Following main engine cutoff, the capsule then separates from the booster and continues on its ballistic trajectory past the Karman Line.

The New Shepherd is a 18 m (60 feet) suborbital vertical takeoff and landing rocket. The booster is powered by a hydrolox BE-3 engine.  The engine burns for about 2 minutes and 30 seconds, pushing rocket toward skyward the 100 km Karman Line. Following main engine cutoff, the capsule then separates from the booster and continues on its ballistic trajectory past the Karman Line.

But don\u2019t get me wrong, of course when the actual Starship goes online, I fully expect it to make it to space!\n\nSo today we\u2019re going to do a quick history on SpaceX\u2019s previous fleet of hoppers, why they build them, what this one is going to accomplish and then we\u2019ll build a version in Kerbal Space Program and demonstrate what we\u2019ll hopefully see the StarHopper do in 2019!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to install Realism Overhaul to Kerbal Space Program - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a6PLkDUWF4\n\nThanks to HazeGrayArt for letting me use his awesome Starship landing animation!!!

For now, we're going to just look at what has changed with the vehicle over the years and why it keeps changing. Later we'll do more in depth videos about Yusaku Maezawa's beautiful #dearmoon project and the weird reentry system of the new BFR!\n\nFollow up video: Why SpaceX's BFS will fall like a skydiver and not fly like an airplane -  https://youtu.be/SCCw_M8MAU0\n\nShow your support and join our exclusive discord channel and subreddit by becoming a Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nAll music is original!

                "description": "Elon Musk is again talking about combining two of his companies, SpaceX and Tesla, in a pretty epic way.\n\nInstead of launching more Tesla\u2019s into space, this time he\u2019s talking about putting SpaceX rocket thrusters on their next generation Tesla Roadster\u2026\n\nWHAT?!?!?!? Ok, please please please tell me this is true!!!!\n\nElon claims by adding around 10 small rocket thrusters they can dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking and cornering\u2026. \n\nBut can this actually be true? How big of thrusters will a car need to actually make a substantial improvement? \n\nSurely we\u2019re not looking at putting a Merlin engine on a car, right? That definitely wouldn\u2019t jive with Tesla\u2019s green initiatives\n\nWhat other concerns do we have about a car having small rocket thrusters driving around on the streets? Are we all at risk of having our shin hairs fried off on any random street corner? Or our cars getting blown off the highway any time a Roadster flies by?\n\nWell we\u2019re going to look at some other technologies that are similar, look at the actual cold gas thrusters SpaceX uses for their Falcon 9 rockets, and look at some examples in spaceflight that include using thrusters to increase the downforce of spacecraft. \n\nThen we\u2019re going to look at just how much faster 0-60 we could expect a Roadster to be if we have some reasonable sized thrusters pushing it forward!\n\nTo me, this is the definition of Everyday Astronaut. An everyday thing like a car, with rocket technology!!!

                    "description": "Elon Musk is again talking about combining two of his companies, SpaceX and Tesla, in a pretty epic way.\n\nInstead of launching more Tesla\u2019s into space, this time he\u2019s talking about putting SpaceX rocket thrusters on their next generation Tesla Roadster\u2026\n\nWHAT?!?!?!? Ok, please please please tell me this is true!!!!\n\nElon claims by adding around 10 small rocket thrusters they can dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking and cornering\u2026. \n\nBut can this actually be true? How big of thrusters will a car need to actually make a substantial improvement? \n\nSurely we\u2019re not looking at putting a Merlin engine on a car, right? That definitely wouldn\u2019t jive with Tesla\u2019s green initiatives\n\nWhat other concerns do we have about a car having small rocket thrusters driving around on the streets? Are we all at risk of having our shin hairs fried off on any random street corner? Or our cars getting blown off the highway any time a Roadster flies by?\n\nWell we\u2019re going to look at some other technologies that are similar, look at the actual cold gas thrusters SpaceX uses for their Falcon 9 rockets, and look at some examples in spaceflight that include using thrusters to increase the downforce of spacecraft. \n\nThen we\u2019re going to look at just how much faster 0-60 we could expect a Roadster to be if we have some reasonable sized thrusters pushing it forward!\n\nTo me, this is the definition of Everyday Astronaut. An everyday thing like a car, with rocket technology!!! Hey there\u2019s a reason I call Tesla\u2019s space ships for Earth.\n\nFollow and Like my new series on Facebook Watch with Space.com \"Spacing Out!\" - https://www.facebook.com/SpacingOutEverydayAstronaut/\n\nMy second place Tesla commercial \"Spaceships.

                "description": "Rockets are HUGE, complicated and expensive. As a matter of fact, the rocket that took humans to the moon, the Saturn 5, was 111 meters or 363 feet tall, and had more separation events than dating teenagers. \n\nSo why do rockets always split themselves into multiple parts. Isn\u2019t that complicated and risky? Why throw so much away? I mean, there\u2019s got to be a better way!!!\n\nWell how about if rockets were only ONE stage? How awesome would that be? Well this idea isn\u2019t new\u2026 it\u2019s called single stage to orbit or SSTO and it\u2019s often considered the holy grail of rocketry.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019m going to SMASH THAT HOLY GRAIL and explain why I think SSTO\u2019s SUCK. \n\nIn order to drill this point in we\u2019ll teach you all about the tyranny of the rocket equation and help you understand why every orbital rocket, well, ever is multistage. \n\nThen we\u2019ll take a stroll down SSTO history and look at some crazy designs that in some cases almost worked...\n\nAnd not to be a huge downer, we will take a look at some SSTO designs that MIGHT actually work, including the Skylon spaceplane that uses the awesome SABRE hybrid engine.\n\nShow your support and join our discord channel and subreddit by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nFollow my new Series on Facebook Watch with Space.com \"Spacing Out!\" - https://www.facebook.com/SpacingOutEverydayAstronaut/\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun and his store - https://www.buzzspacemodels.com/",

SpaceX is launching their first \"Block 5\" rocket out at Launch Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. \n\nThey're launching Bangladesh's first satellite called Bangabandhu-1 which is pretty small weighing only 3,700 KG. It's heading to a geostationary transfer orbit. This means the First stage will have to land on the \"Of Course I Still Love You\" drone ship 611 km's down range. \n\nThis upgraded and \"final\" block change of the Falcon 9 features better thermal protection on the first stage for less refurbishment after recovery, retractable landing legs, slightly increased thrust and new turbines inside the turbo pumps of the engines. There's several other small tweaks but this is the culmination of every landed and reflown Falcon 9 to date!\n\nIf you're curious what the heck block 5 is, why its exciting and if you want help with the naming changes, be sure and watch this video - https://youtu.be/X9A1Ny6B310\n\nFollow and Like my upcoming new series on Facebook Watch with Space.com \"Spacing Out!\" - https://www.facebook.com/SpacingOutEverydayAstronaut/\n\nShow your support and join our discord channel by becoming a Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun and his store - https://www.buzzspacemodels.com/"

(its body is aluminum)\n\nMove over SpaceX, there\u2019s a new kid on the block! Well, maybe not move over, but pull up a chair to the orbital class rocket table! That\u2019s right, Rocket Lab has officially become the second privately owned rocket company to achieve orbit with their beautiful Electron rocket.\n\nToday we\u2019re going to give you a deep run down on some of the exciting features about the Electron, then we\u2019re going to compare it to similar rockets including other upcoming small sat rockets, and past small sat rockets like SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 1. \n\nWe\u2019re even going to throw in a Falcon 9 for comparison and see which rocket takes the cake for the cheapest ride to space with a cost per kilogram comparison. Oh, and I mean it when I say cake, I got this for the winner.\n\nThanks Coyd'sLab for catching Humanity Star and sending those pictures! - https://www.youtube.com/user/theCodyReeder\n\nShow your support and join our discord channel and subreddit by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun and his store - https://www.buzzspacemodels.com/",

That\u2019s right, Rocket Lab has officially become the second privately owned rocket company to achieve orbit with their beautiful Electron rocket.\n\nToday we\u2019re going to give you a deep run down on some of the exciting features about the Electron, then we\u2019re going to compare it to similar rockets including other upcoming small sat rockets, and past small sat rockets like SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 1. \n\nWe\u2019re even going to throw in a Falcon 9 for comparison and see which rocket takes the cake for the cheapest ride to space with a cost per kilogram comparison. Oh, and I mean it when I say cake, I got this for the winner.\n\nThanks Coyd'sLab for catching Humanity Star and sending those pictures! - https://www.youtube.com/user/theCodyReeder\n\nShow your support and join our discord channel and subreddit by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun and his store - https://www.buzzspacemodels.com/"

Due to the crazy thick atmosphere of Venus, the probe only lasted 57 minutes on the surface. It was launched to Venus by a Proton-K/D-1 rocket on November 4th, 1981.\n\nThere's some ridiculous things that happened to this and other Venusian probes that we'll be sure and talk about. \n\nShow your support and join our discord channel by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun and his store - https://www.buzzspacemodels.com/"

                "description": "It's the second SpaceX launch of 2018! SpaceX will launch a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a 4200 KG satellite called GovSat-1/SES-16 to Geostationary Transfer Orbit. This satellite serves the Luxembourg Government and a commercial customer SES. This is the 2nd flight of this particular Falcon 9 1st stage, having first flown last year for the NROL-76 mission, but it will be its last. \n\nDespite having plenty of fuel to land, they will be letting this one touch down softly in the ocean after its primary mission is over. This is because SpaceX has so many of these current block 3 boosters around which are not meant for long term reuse, and they require too much refurbishment to reuse them more than once, AND the drone ship needs to be ready for Falcon Heavy's center core next week. \n\nThis is the third time SES has opted to fly on a previously flown booster, they were the first customers to do so March, 2017 with mission SES-10. This is the 6th reuse of a booster for SpaceX. This is the 29th launch from SpaceX's launch pad, SLC-40, and the 48th over all launch of the Falcon 9. \n\nShow your support and join our discord channel by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun and his store - https://www.buzzspacemodels.com/",

When it flies, it will be the most powerful and highly anticipated rocket of the 21st century. \n\nSpaceX will be attempting the ultimate feat in rocketry, strapping three orbital class boosters together to form a heavy lift vehicle. As if that weren\u2019t enough, the Falcon Heavy will be attempting to land ALL THREE of its massive first stages boosters, two by land one by sea. \n\nSpaceX first announced the Falcon Heavy in 2011 saying the vehicle would be ready to launch in 2013\u2026 So why exactly has it taken five additional years to develop a rocket that\u2019s essentially just three Falcon 9\u2019s strapped together? \n\nWell, we\u2019re going to dive into what all has changed since the 2011 announcement including what specific hardware and technology had to be developed. We\u2019re also going to compare the Falcon 9 to the Falcon Heavy in a side by side comparison and explain just why exactly there\u2019s so much more to the Falcon Heavy than just strapping three Falcon 9\u2019s together.\n\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun\n\nShow your support and join our discord channel by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nTranslations:\nFrench - Gaetan Lafitte",

As if that weren\u2019t enough, the Falcon Heavy will be attempting to land ALL THREE of its massive first stages boosters, two by land one by sea. \n\nSpaceX first announced the Falcon Heavy in 2011 saying the vehicle would be ready to launch in 2013\u2026 So why exactly has it taken five additional years to develop a rocket that\u2019s essentially just three Falcon 9\u2019s strapped together? \n\nWell, we\u2019re going to dive into what all has changed since the 2011 announcement including what specific hardware and technology had to be developed. We\u2019re also going to compare the Falcon 9 to the Falcon Heavy in a side by side comparison and explain just why exactly there\u2019s so much more to the Falcon Heavy than just strapping three Falcon 9\u2019s together.\n\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun\n\nShow your support and join our discord channel by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nTranslations:\nFrench - Gaetan Lafitte"

This is the first time Iridium has chosen to fly on a reflown booster and they will also use one for Iridium NEXT 5 as well. Iridium NEXT 4 is 10 x 860kg satellites heading into a Low Earth Polar Orbit. This means the launch will be out of Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is where all Polar Orbits launch from.

This is the first time NASA as a customer will be using a previously flown booster from SpaceX and this is also the first launch from SLC-40, the launch pad that was destroyed during an anomaly on the pad, September 1, 2016.  The first stage booster will be landing back at LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. SpaceX is also reusing the Dragon Capsule from this mission which first flew way back in 2015 for mission CRS-6. The payload weighs a mere 2182 kg's. \n\nLaunch time is 10:35 Eastern local time, Friday December 15th (15:35 UTC)\n\nShow your support and join our discord channel by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/"

                "description": "Elon Musk recently announced SpaceX\u2019s plans to be able to transport people anywhere around the world in under an hour, with MOST long distance trips taking less than half an hour using SpaceX\u2019s upcoming BFR rocket! Hold on, what? Anywhere on Earth in under an hour?! This can\u2019t be possible, right? Well today, we\u2019re going to look into the feasibility as well as some of the challenges SpaceX will face trying to bring this concept to life. We\u2019re also going to take a quick look at history to see what other once thought impossible modes of transportation are now a part of our everyday lives. So, will the average citizen really be getting on top of a rocket and traveling anywhere around the world in less than an hour?

                    "description": "Elon Musk recently announced SpaceX\u2019s plans to be able to transport people anywhere around the world in under an hour, with MOST long distance trips taking less than half an hour using SpaceX\u2019s upcoming BFR rocket! Hold on, what? Anywhere on Earth in under an hour?! This can\u2019t be possible, right? Well today, we\u2019re going to look into the feasibility as well as some of the challenges SpaceX will face trying to bring this concept to life. We\u2019re also going to take a quick look at history to see what other once thought impossible modes of transportation are now a part of our everyday lives. So, will the average citizen really be getting on top of a rocket and traveling anywhere around the world in less than an hour?

They are grid fins, nitrogen thrusters and the merlin engines themselves. We show you how these systems interact and then try and land a first stage ourselves in Kerbal Space Program!\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nShow your support on Patreon - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut"

                "description": "Follow @EverydayAstronaut on Instagram - http://instagram.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Tim Dodd (Everyday Astronaut) - https://soundcloud.com/everyday-astronaut-690255155/sets/everyday-astronaut\n\nSpaceX announced today they plan to send two private citizens around the moon by the end of 2018. \n\nThey will be using their Dragon 2 capsule which will have its first crew-less test flight to the international space station this year followed by the first crewed flight by the second quarter of 2018.\n\nThe two crew onboard will be private citizens who have paid an undisclosed deposit for the flights.\n\nAnother exciting note is they will be doing this with their upcoming Falcon Heavy rocket which is essentially 3 of their Falcon 9 rockets strapped together to become the most powerful rocket since the Saturn V moon rocket which was last flown in the 70s. The Falcon Heavy will have over 5 million pounds of thrust at take off which is 2/3rds the thrust of the Saturn V and more than double that of the next largest rocket currently flying, the Delta IV Heavy.\n\nThis will not only be the first time people will have been to the moon since 1972 but also the furthest into space any humans will have ever gone with an to be announced trajectory. What am I most excited about? Seeing 4k video of the earth rising from the moon\u2019s horizon. \n\nNow do keep in mind SpaceX hasn\u2019t launched their Falcon Heavy yet despite saying it\u2019s only \u201c6 months away\u201d since 2013, but we are finally seeing hardware out for testing so we do have faith it will fly in 2017. \n\nSo where will you be when the first humans will be launched from Earth to fly around the moon? I know where I\u2019ll be, waiting at Kennedy Space Center with my space suit on just in case they decide they want additional company.",

                    "description": "Follow @EverydayAstronaut on Instagram - http://instagram.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Tim Dodd (Everyday Astronaut) - https://soundcloud.com/everyday-astronaut-690255155/sets/everyday-astronaut\n\nSpaceX announced today they plan to send two private citizens around the moon by the end of 2018. \n\nThey will be using their Dragon 2 capsule which will have its first crew-less test flight to the international space station this year followed by the first crewed flight by the second quarter of 2018.\n\nThe two crew onboard will be private citizens who have paid an undisclosed deposit for the flights.\n\nAnother exciting note is they will be doing this with their upcoming Falcon Heavy rocket which is essentially 3 of their Falcon 9 rockets strapped together to become the most powerful rocket since the Saturn V moon rocket which was last flown in the 70s. The Falcon Heavy will have over 5 million pounds of thrust at take off which is 2/3rds the thrust of the Saturn V and more than double that of the next largest rocket currently flying, the Delta IV Heavy.\n\nThis will not only be the first time people will have been to the moon since 1972 but also the furthest into space any humans will have ever gone with an to be announced trajectory. What am I most excited about? Seeing 4k video of the earth rising from the moon\u2019s horizon. \n\nNow do keep in mind SpaceX hasn\u2019t launched their Falcon Heavy yet despite saying it\u2019s only \u201c6 months away\u201d since 2013, but we are finally seeing hardware out for testing so we do have faith it will fly in 2017. \n\nSo where will you be when the first humans will be launched from Earth to fly around the moon? I know where I\u2019ll be, waiting at Kennedy Space Center with my space suit on just in case they decide they want additional company."
