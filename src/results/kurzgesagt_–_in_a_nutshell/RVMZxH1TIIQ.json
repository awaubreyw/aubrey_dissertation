If not, your a prisoner of Satan <br> God loves you, and Jesus Christ lived a perfect/sinless life for you, died on the cross for your sin. And mine, and rose again the third day, victorious over death, hell, and the grave. We must believe this and acknowledge the fact that we are sinners in need of a savior.  If you ask God to forgive you, and come into your heart and save you, (with a humble and contrite heart, with a repentant heart..the fact that you now see your sin as an offense to God..and you are sorry for your sin, and you want to live a life pleasing to him..but you know that on your own power you can&#39;t) he will.  If this is the condition of your heart, and you have a sincere desire to trust him and receive his free gift of salvation..He will save you from eternity in hell and give you a relationship with him.  You can be born again!  Romans 10:13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <br><br>Romans 3:10 as it is written, there is none righteous no not one. <br><br>Romans 6:23 for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (That one may not be exact word for word but it is exact in principle)<br><br>Romans 5:8-9-but God commendeth (proves, shows) his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.   Much more than, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.  <br><br>In John 3, the Bible explains that if you have not been born again the wrath of God already abides on you.  <br>The only thing you have to do is go to hell, is nothing because until you receive Jesus Christ as your personal savior, you&#39;re already headed there my friend.  I say this not to be mean, but out of love because I don&#39;t want to see you go to hell for rejecting Jesus Christ.  <br><br>Romans 3:28 says therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.<br>That means we cannot work our way to heaven, we cannot get baptized to go to heaven, we cannot give money to the church or the pope to go to heaven.. it is only by trusting completely in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross.  Faith in his shed blood! Faith in the fact that he rose again from the grave victorious over hell, death, and the grave.<br>Romans 4:24-51 -if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>You see, we are not all children of God automatically. You have to want to be, and you have to put your faith in what God says about who Jesus Christ is, and what he has done for you.  We cannot have peace with God unless we trust in the finished work of Jesus Christ, and who he is as a person.<br>The Bible says that he is God.<br>Emmanuel =God with Us.  <br><br>Romans 3:22 even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe.<br>When you trust in the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior, (get saved by grace which is God&#39;s unmerited favor, by faith)<br>You are justified.  That&#39;s a legal term which means his righteousness is transferred to you.  Your sin has been transferred to him but in order for you to receive his righteousness it takes faith.<br><br>Romans 2:4 or despises thou The riches of his goodness and the forbearance and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God lead a thee to repentance.<br>God&#39;s goodness allows you to see your sin through God&#39;s eyes, as you acknowledge the fact that you are a sinner and headed to hell, you will see that your sin is disgusting to God.  We are an offense to God.  We deserve hell all of us.  This is a sobering thought, and the grace of God allows us to realize this, and gives us the right view of our sin, and the right attitude about our sin.  We cannot be good on our own power we can&#39;t go to heaven on our own power, we can&#39;t turn from our sin on our own power and earn favor with God, we must ask him to forgive us and save us cuz there&#39;s nothing we can do on our own to earn favor with him.<br><br>Ephesians 2: 8,9 paraphrased- we are saved by grace through faith, it is a gift and not of works, so nobody can boast about it.  <br><br>Will you receive God&#39;s free gift of salvation? Or will you reject God&#39;s gift to you?  He died for the whole world but we must all personally make a decision to receive him.  Not making a decision to receive him is in fact rejecting him.  The Bible tells us that we are with him or against him there is no in between.  <br><br>If you believe all of this with your whole heart and you are convicted of your sin.. pray this prayer.  <br><br>Heavenly father, I know that I&#39;m a sinner and I need your forgiveness.  I believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross, and shed his blood for my sin.  Help me to turn from my sin and please you, but I can&#39;t but by your grace.  Please come into my heart and save me.  Help me follow you with my whole heart.. I can do nothing without you please help me and save me.  In Jesus name amen.  <br><br>If your heart condition is right to be saved, you will have no problem with praying that prayer and will do it gladly.  If you have any questions feel free to ask.<br><br>God says that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved... <br>If God convicted your heart and you experienced godly sorrow about your sin, if you wholeheartedly trust in Jesus Christ alone to save you, then you are saved / eternally secure in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Bible says in 1st Peter 1 that we are kept by the power of God.  Salvation is God&#39;s to give us.  Not ours.. it&#39;s not ours to lose or walk away from.<br>In John 10 the Bible explains that we are held in both the hands of Jesus Christ and the father and that no man can pluck us out.<br>In John 6 Jesus Christ says whoever comes to him he will in no wise cast out (he will under no circumstances reject them).  <br><br>If your heart matches your head.. and you didn&#39;t give the Lord Jesus Christ lip service.. then you can rejoice because you are saved and eternally secure.  Welcome to the family of God.  You can be a disobedient child, or an obedient child.  <br><br>God is such a good Father, and wants to talk to us daily through the Bible and he wants to hear what we have to say through prayer.  <br><br>Hebrews 11:6 (speaking of God). But without faith it is impossible to please him, for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek them.", "comment_date": "2022-06-28T10:25:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Toranimations", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMZxH1TIIQ&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a> did so someone else get destroyed by this poor birdy&#39;s face :(", "comment_date": "2022-06-26T22:27:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Traveling Adventure Variety", "comment_text": "Thanks alot Isaac newton", "comment_date": "2022-06-24T08:12:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Funny How?", "comment_text": "Space isn\u2019t real.

There is immortality in this life and a person can live forever simply by having a child. if someones on a deserted island has a kid its basically a clone as the kid starts with no knowledge and people could teach the kid exactly what they wanted. the new version of the person reborn as a kid just experience life from there point of view. heaven won\u2019t be how jehovas witnesses books show with animals and people of all ages and houses and nature. People won\u2019t age.people wont be able to touch things. people wont need to talk. people wont need a place to live. people wont see animals or nature as they wont need to breathe or feel a sun or cold.  that is all stuff for this place. from there u can keep subtracting all the things until all things from this earth are not essential in the next life. so basically theyre waiting and dreaming of a afterlife that wont have anything from this life as it wont be necessary.l or be of any use. once u subtract all those things that are on earth and not necessary in the next life your left with pitch black. So people who claim they\u2019re light beings and meditate next thing to do is think how that would be. Eternal nothingness. But they then counter it saying they don\u2019t need any material stuff and can handle eternity like that. Maybe a year. But eternity. I dunno about that. people say they want to escape this place and be a glowing white spirit in a place where they dont need anything. they wont be able to touch anything they wont need to experience anything or see people who age or anything. basically theyd be like a eternal ghost blob for 100000000000 years and beyond for all eternity. like a jellyfish stuck in a dark room. this eternity without the things on earth ends up being eternal death anyway pitch black and nothing to do so it seems they havent thought it through. Is being conscious in eternity with the opposite of this place such a good thing? Eternal nothingness and darkness. So maybe the real goal is for eternal life and consciousness in this proven reality. The one the people who\u2019s words have tried to deny everyone of. They say this place is of eternal suffering? But id say most people couldnt be confined in a white room for more than a day. Oh but they\u2019ll create things in there mind and they can experience them for eternity in that afterlife heaven or maybe this was heaven they\u2019ll realise. this is the heaven people live forever in it and dont let people deceive u.", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T14:32:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brother mike", "comment_text": "god or godrial or satan has never been able to escape the father Yahweys firmament or prison ! so man never will moron! planets are fake satanic nonsense! named after satanic gods! you cannot leave earths flat plane ever! until fathers return", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T13:52:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Neblina C.j.L", "comment_text": "Sounds like the narriator from hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy, funny but I do find the cartoon characters are better at getting these idiots here and now to understand better, well , for a few anyhow, the best part of current man , Ran down his mother&#39;s legs long ago .", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T08:34:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neblina C.j.L", "comment_text": "Your so smart, and yes this ant farm is where we study beings that we hybrid with anything and everything from other dead worlds, you see everything , every plant, every bug, fish, and germs came here from a dead or a dying world, this place is like a big file cabinet.

Therefore God stepped in, through his mercy &amp; compassion, to create a peice of Himself, in human form...in the womb of a virgin. This is a key factor, as the debt of Sin caused by mankind.. Required someone from this physical ( human ) realm,to pay; which would&#39;ve been everyone considering the amount of spritual debt we&#39;ve created.<br><br>At that point &amp; forward; only  the blood of God, made Man, would be Powerful enough to cover the sounds of the world, spritually.<br><br>So Christ, the prophesied, only begotten son of God, would/could accomplish this. He was also required to be WITHOUT SIN..to cover All sin. An absolutely pure sacrifice. If He were born of a normal man &amp; woman...he world have inherited, the original sin, which followed all man, since Adam &amp; Eve...So God put His Son, which was a literal peice of his Person, into a virgins womb, (also pure).. And fertilized it by His Holy SPIRIT. A child of purity, formed in a pure &amp; worthy enviroment...born of &amp; from God, but also of humanity. This was foretold to happen, long before the child came.. Because God knew mankind would condemn themselves with sin...so He made a way, for all who would accept His Sacrifice for their sins...His Personage &amp; offspring, Christ Yeshua, commonly known as Jesus. <br><br>For those who have Faith &amp; believed that He came and Died for this debt to be paid. in the form of Christ &amp; For all who were Grateful &amp; showed inward regret, for the sin they had contributed to Mankind&#39;s Huge Debt of Sin ,throughout time.... someone showing THIS regret &amp; sincere remorse for causing Him to have to suffer for Our sake... One who confesses their sinful ways to Him&amp; Repents..confessing Him to be their Savior &amp; Ruler...these are Redeemed... Through Christ... Back to the Father of All.. And washed clean of their son &amp; debt. <br><br>Anyone who does this in sincereity... That person will be indwelt with the Holy SPIRIT &amp; adopted as a Child, Servant, &amp; solider of God, in the Earth. The Holy Spirit then begins to teach, Guide, and cleanse this person, from the inside out... Manning them a new creature..in spirit first &amp; then it begins to manifest into their physical self &amp; character. And it teaches many things, by the spirit...to this Reborn individual. Not only is this person in a continual process of increasing Sanctificaton, but by witness; a representative of the regenerating power and Truth of God, to those, still under condemnation of the Sin debt of Mankind... These are still under the Law of Death/ blood for sin... And practically doomed to fall short on Judgement day. Without the redeeming power of Christ&#39;s Sacrifice, to cover their sin(s)..&amp; being under the Weight of the Law... They will be unable to &quot;pay&quot; their required debt..not by works/ deeds...no EARTHLY payment can be made, but blood/ death. The debt is not only standing... But increasing daily... Without believeing in &amp; accepting Christ&#39;s sacrifice FOR THEM,  without REPENTANCE; which is our end of the deal; so to speak...we hold our own, unpayable debts. Christ was &amp; is the only sacrifice worthy, who&#39;s ever come/ will come &amp; be pure, under the Law of God..to qualify as payment for Earth&#39;s( man&#39;s) spritual debt.<br>There is no substitute, though Satan has given many placebos to Salvation..only Christ was the True ,Holy &amp; Qualified Sacrifice, for the World&#39;s sin, thought time. <br><br>I highly suggest to anyone curious.. Feeling lost/ unsure...to inquire of the Almighty, to speak to them DIRECTLY... Instead of going through Man, in this decieveing &amp; confusing world...Go to Him directly.. With a sincere &amp; Humble heart &amp; ask to Know Him..to speak with &amp; hear Him...to know Truth from the Lies we&#39;re surrounded with, here.<br>The door to Salvation &amp; Knowing God...isn&#39;t through a Religion, a building, or a man, but within a sincere &amp; humbled heart\u2764\ufe0f; being lead by Faith &amp; seeking TRUTH. <br><br>I did this very thing, alone in the woods.. After an exhausting 30+yrs of just living and suffering. I asked God to Know the absolute TRUTH..to know Him/ Her. ( I wasn&#39;t sure \ud83d\ude0f..) at first I was frustrated and arrogant about it.. I didn&#39;t realize How much Respect &amp; Humbleness, is expected, to approach the God of All Things.. Then. When I was humbled alil more by Life..I kept that &quot;same energy&quot; &amp; continued to seek...my heart really wanted what I&#39;d asked....well I&#39;ll tell you what! I got a response...a supernatural intense life changing, soul changing response. The Holy Spirit visited me!!<br><br>Not in a physical form, but it might as well have been, because it was so strong..I couldn&#39;t get off the floor of my tent. It DOES SPEAK...but it happens almost telepathically...in your heart &amp; mind &amp; spirit...and without audible words, I recognized Who &amp; what it was...MY SOUL KNEW!! Like it&#39;d always known... Almost as if it had suffered from a strange amnesia. I experienced Revealation! And when it came, I also recognized Christ, in my midst, the same way...They really are one! Seperate &amp; whole simultaneously! I recieved many epiphanies that day, it changed me &amp; my Life...redirected everything. And it wasn&#39;t through a Religion, or man, or anything like that...it was by His Spirit..I came to REALLY KNOW Him!..I repented &amp; was changed...Reborn!<br>God, Christ, The Holy Spirit..Are SO REAL GUYS!<br><br>You have to understand, God is Most Powerful, He IS SPIRIT &amp; He has personality. He&#39;s NOT THE UNIVERSE... He has Personage. Timeless, Ageless... HOLY.<br>He is our Father &amp; a whole lot more, we can&#39;t wrap our lil minds around. PERIOD.<br><br>He&#39;s been so generous, patient, Merciful &amp; selfless to Us... Though He knows all, He still wants to know us intimately, in a relationship..He wants to build a bond with His children...but like everything in exsistance.. There are rules to how it works. He loves us all, but it&#39;s those who love Him back, accept Him.. Appreciate Him... learn to understand Him, that really get to see Him/ His coming Kingdom.<br><br>He&#39;s the King of all Kings &amp; He desires a particular breed of spirit. What He has always intended.. a Righteous &amp; Holy family. <br><br>I use to think His Word/ law was just Him being busy &amp; controlling...it has taken the Holy Spirit&#39;s guidance, teaching, &amp; understanding...to realize, EVERY SINGLE THING HE&#39;S DONE &amp; SAIDHAS BEEN FOR GOOD PURPOSE!!!...Much of it has to do with Spiritual law( which mankind is very very ignorant of, overall)..&amp; protection in spritual Law.<br><br>We do have a Spritual Enemy, who wants as many as can be condemned, condemned spritually. Doomed. Set for Judgement &amp; hellfire. This is Truth &amp;IS COMING. And it&#39;s not JUST SATAN, but many, many demons &amp; unclean Spiritual forces of darkness... They operate in this world, to entice us to break God&#39;s laws &amp; governance; which is the definition of Sin. By keeping us in Sinful behaviors.. Through enticements of diverse Lusts...&amp; So entertained, we never seek God &amp; REPENT....we are lured into Hell...it&#39;s HAPPENING at greater and greater levels in our world..LOOK AT THE STATE OF THE WORLD GUYS!! the enemy is VERY BUSY. Though we can&#39;t all see then, anyone can clearly observe the evidence of their influences. Greed, Lust, Addictions, Murder, Self- righteousness, Malice, Envy.., shall I go on?.. Every thought a person has, is not just from them.. Both Satan &amp; God... Demons..all communicate inwardly to humans. Within the MIND &amp; heart. This is spritual people! C&#39;mon.. Consider these things!!.. This is where the Bible comes in.<br><br>It teaches you do many things according to this world &amp; the spritual realm. It shows you the rules &amp; about your very should enemy!...it explains this spritual warfare on our planet &amp; many deeper things, that many preachers aren&#39;t/ haven&#39;t taught us!  Satan&#39;s best weapon is ignorance &amp; Lust. That creates easy, distracted prey! Most importantly,Satan never ever wants you to access God Almighty &amp; The Helper,( the Holy Spirit)... Which makes you an effectual solider &amp; child of God, in this unseen , but definitely felt,battle.<br><br>I implore all Man &amp; woman kind..to get over your SELF &amp; seek the Creator.. This world is not at all, as it appears to be. It&#39;s saturated in lies upon lies &amp; only the Holy spirit will give true light to expose the enemies schemes in your life. We only get 1 Life, to get it right.<br>Trust me, I don&#39;t know it all, bit this I know..What we THINK We know, doesn&#39;t even compare to God&#39;s absolute TRUTH..so I once again implore you to SEEK GOD DIRECTLY! <br>It not going to be easy  walking with Christ, but it&#39;s dang sure worth it ..I&#39;d never go back to the blindness!<br>No longer &quot;down with the sickness&quot;, of this fallen &amp; dying world. Being &quot;SAVED&quot; doesn&#39;t do justice, to how much walking with Christ does for a person/ soul. It&#39;s sad , there are many who &quot;fake the funk&quot;...but the true and sincere believers, they KNOW...It&#39;s not a game...its the Way , The Absolute TRUTH &amp; path to Everlasting Life!

That is so very true. Humans like to imprison themselves and at the same time imprisoning others. Because of lot of diminutive systems they have created. On top of that lot of tricks and forceful measures would be used so that people who don&#39;t want to procreate, procreate. Anything that is forced upon anyone ends up being some type of a curse in the end. We&#39;d be told that grey aliens are millions of times civilized compared to us. While they even have inferior physical features compared to us and they don&#39;t even have sexual organs. So that all these diminutive people can continue gaining an upperhand.<br><br>At the same time, people will place highly uncivilized human beings in the highest achelotes of power so as to keep humanity literally imprisoned on earth. Instead those who want to venture out to other planets are unable to do that. Therefore the human specie that keeps on under developing while in their minds they believe they are developing and they believe they are resourced. While they use those resources for destruction. Is the one that follows old and untransformattive ways of living. And the one with powerful, creative and innovative brains is literally being held captive by them.

In 1962 we secretly landed on the moon in an anti gravity spacecraft. In 1966 we secretly landed on Mars in an anti gravity spacecraft and in 1967 we started a colony on Mars (under ground which took 20 years to complete). In 1969 a different space program called NASA, which was to pretend that ROCKETS were the cutting edge technology landed on the moon with the APOLLO missions. NASA was a fake disinformation program meant to keep people in the dark while the military complex did the real space work behind the scenes. <br><br>In the 1980s the U.S. explored our entire solar system, all the planets and their moons, using these secret anti gravity spacecrafts. In the 1990s and 2000s the U.S. Space Command with their anti gravity space crafts then left our solar system and explored other stellar systems like for example system CTA-21 and found an earth like planet there and established another human colony. They explored Zeta Reticuli where the Grey aliens come from and established a base colony there since the Greys are our selected friend. These are the real hard core facts sports fans and all this jazz about &quot;rockets&quot; is just for show to make you all think that we can&#39;t really go anywhere because rockets would take hundreds of years just to reach the nearest system. A Rocket would take 100 years to reach the nearest system while anti gravity crafts takes just a day.<br><br>So your question is why don&#39;t they just let us know. Because if you knew that they were using Free Energy devices to power these crafts then your next question would then be so why don&#39;t they just let us know about these free energy systems. The answer is because then everyone would be using that technology and &quot;they&quot; would to bankrupt . They use alot of money from the sell of oil, coal, fuel. This video is mostly a lie. Its outdated and most people today already know this video is a lie but watch it anyway for the entertainment value. This video is laughable. If the CIA and all other intel comes to us and says shut up we say make us. When they try they disappear. Now both sides have that power so we are just going to give the technology away to the world for FREE.

If it was people would already be there. This is where humanity falls trying to force situations into play. It\u2019s not intelligence it\u2019s stupidity. The only way humans can inhabit Mars is by staying inside of a glass dome or walking around in space suits. That\u2019s not natural, not to mention the materials you\u2019ll need CO2 and oxygen.

It also serves to keep us in a state of fear every time we look up- in our subconscious we feel in a constant state of fear due to being told we could die from rocks of cosmos coming through and killing us all with a big meteorite- bollocks, never gonna happen- I never even seen a shooting star shoot upwards because it can\u2019t happen but it would if we was on a ball earth. We record everything with our ears and eyes from birth and the first 6 years is so very important. As soon as you record from a local source (tv or radio) that you are in immediate danger, you shut down the subconscious and we go into monkey mind (10% conciiisness for your 3D senses and your creative side (Divine side or creative side)  goes into hibernation. We are kept in a constant and a perpetual state of fear and it works. The lie of gravity started off with Freemasons such as Eisenstein and gravity is just a the sort and has actually never been proven.

Every single holy book stated that we was on a \u201cflat plain\u201d and if he could change their minds and deceive man. Men and women of the world stopped going to the church as much due to tv being more interesting what going to the \u201cmoon\u201d and making new exciting news- he would finally have their religious beliefs in shatters and go about changing man to woman and woman to man. We have schools teaching children how to play with themselves from 4 yrs old.

We have been programmed to think it\u2019s ok to let our kids act the way they do because we cannot control them without being frowned upon and our children\u2019s future looked ever more bleak with toddlers seeing faceless people (demons) as normal and someone with a smile as disgusting because we are muzzled dogs looking to bite with infectious saliva if the muzzle comes off.

Why is that because there was a groove from a fake well? the sun wasn&#39;t strong enough to pull in the dust particle but is strong enough to pull in a comet from billions of miles past Pluto??? Lmao \ud83e\udd23 what is this big giant ball of gas called a gas giant doing in a middle of an infinite void that is a almost perfect vacuum? Why hadn&#39;t this gas ball dissipated? Why are there so many things that don&#39;t make sense about space? Another is the shadow of the moon is only 70 miles wide on Earth but scientific method shows that you cannot make a Shadow smaller than an object but they can in space! You cannot create gas pressure without a chamber but they can in space!!? Gas balls of flying around 500 million miles an hour in an infinite vacuum. Space doors open up on TV in the air flies out really fast but these air balls or gas balls just stay that way??!!! The Moon and Sun travel the same exact path in our sky and look exactly the same size to us but they say the moon spins around the Earth and the Sun spins around the Moon they still take the same exact path and look the same exact size cuz they say the sun is 400 times larger than the moon and exactly 400 times further away!!?? Just another coincidence? Did you ever get on a Merry-Go-Round? Something spinning very fast like those rides and you can fly right off from centrifugal force or you would stick to the wall but the Earth&#39;s spinning at a thousand miles an hour and the centrifugal force doesn&#39;t push you away and makes you stick to the Earth??!! all these things are never observable or testable on Earth but they say this is what goes on in space!!

The Music from today got this frequency &quot;440Hz&quot; and that is what makes us being imprisoned on this Planet. Why you ask? Well, the other Alien Races like the Reptilians are here since we came here and they enslaved us with their and out technology from today. They used their higher Technology to block the connection to the higher realms and to bring us to a Point to make us getting earthly Attachments, you have to remove them. Think about it, all these people who got killed, did something good wich was a Sign of &quot;Danger&quot;, if you know what I mean. It means those who were able to help the Humanity wake up could pose an Error. This whole System we know is here to manipulate us, destroy us and the Planet. These Things have gotten out of Control like these ones. Music from today has become negative, try 432Hz or different Frequencies. Drugs, for a good Reason, to destroy us. Sweets, to block the Energy system, they are just like a Drug, if you don&#39;t get it, you&#39;ll go crazy. Try birken sugar, it&#39;s more healthier. The News, for Implants and manipulation, for Fear, Hate and negative emotions. Doctors with their Pills and Stuff, the Chemicals. Movies and Videos for negative Emotions and for manifesting negative Things. Cars, Ships, Boats, Busses, Planes ..., for the so called &quot;fresh air&quot;. The Planes got Chemtrails, what are they? Have you seen the Strips in the Air? They posses Heavy Metal and Chemicals, we brave in. The Plastic in the Water in other Lands or more like on the whole Planet should be gone. We Humans have made about 6 Billion metric tones Plastic per Year! Fish, Animals eat Pastic and so do we. Find Solutions to these Things and your Life will become better but don&#39;t make your self crazy! And for those who played Fortnite, have you seen the Black Hole Event and the Numbers that has been shown to us?

It implies we are meant to leave, when maybe that&#39;s not even true. Sure, our sun will go nova in a few billion years. Chances of us even being around to see it at nil, at this rate, so there&#39;s almost no point in talking about it. Can any human being even comprehend what a billion years looks like? As a species we&#39;ve only been around for 150,000 or so. <br><br>Western science has sold us a dream on technological salvation as the answer to everything. Many ancient scriptures concerning human metaphysics and consciousness practices tell us that humanity has a powerful, innate inner capacity to explore consciousness and the universe by using our spiritual power. What does that mean exactly? I can&#39;t say. <br><br>But consider that maybe the way out is to go in. Paranormal research is really fascinating these days. We know from many case studies and near death experiences that consciousness can become disentangled from the body and travel on its own. <br><br>There is more to the picture than technology.

Everything is a &quot;system&quot; this entire universe is just a big cell. Black space would be blood, dark matter. We are essentially cells within an earth. And then earth is an organ/ism then the solar system would be another organism/organ system with a head (sun) etc then the galaxy then super galaxy and then eventually you get to the universe. The universe to us would be like a body. But what if there is something out there that is bigger? What if one of my cells <br>Is feeling how I am feeling? Conscious enough to want to exit my body and be it&#39;s own conscious being? The universe really is just a big body/organism. This is my theory. But then if you get big enough, does the universe become small enough to be a cell within another organism? Organ? How small just are we? The answer really is just in front of our eyes. God made us in his image alright. Even cells have a brain, powerhouse, etc. A &quot;system&quot;  Whoever made us, super smart. But my question is. How do I get out? And what is outside of the universe? I want to get outside of the &quot;System&quot; which is everywhere. This entire universe is just another system, same as a cell and me. The &quot;prison&quot; the way things work isn&#39;t just in this earth. It is everywhere. The earth, the solar system, galaxy, then the universe itself.Heck,  maybe a black hole is an anal sphincter. So to answer my question I must ask it in my perspective. How would a cell, gain enough consciousness to leave my body? Will answer how could I leave the universal system?  The &quot;system&quot; is the &quot;prison&quot; and the system is everything we know. I wanna leave. And most importantly, if  I leave can I come back if i wish?

All done by pumps, pipes, valves, hoses, a nulzel, a combustion chamber, and a couple of tanks. Buy a firer truck pump, a valve that can handle the pressure, a couple of hoses, maybe a few pipes here, and there, a renforce chamber that can be used for a combation chamber. Also don&#39;t forget the nulzel, and a cooling system. The rest is computers, and programming, and the body. Then you have ion engines witch uses plasma, and you can create ion engines with magnets, copper tubing that can create electric arks, and a tank of gas, or basic air. Do it right you get a ion engine. It sounds complicated, but it&#39;s not, and anyone can build a basic vergen in they back yard with a couple 100 bucks, or a couple 1,000 of dollars.

They could be trying to offer solutions to many of our problems as it was after WWII that they started appearing in greater force.<br>7)Why is there so much poverty affecting even CHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY when we live in an age of plenty and ability to solve so many problems?<br>...when these issues are e can then go on to talk about veganism or gay marriage or whether people have the right to live in whatever country they like.", "comment_date": "2019-08-11T08:28:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "aousaous65", "comment_text": "Love it this is literally the best channel in YT", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T23:38:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fan", "comment_text": "No you are mean our earth is the best place ever why would we just fly somewere dangerous like space", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T15:24:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Savage boy", "comment_text": "EH39 was the season of the week and the weekend", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T10:03:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ck lemri", "comment_text": "Im a guy, i realized that im in a new prison after Marriage", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T00:44:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan pussy gobbler", "comment_text": "What if<br>You wanted to explore the universe<br>But god said<br>Now frick", "comment_date": "2019-08-08T10:19:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "PheralGhoul", "comment_text": "This is in my feed and i dislike it", "comment_date": "2019-08-07T15:10:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ammar Pratama", "comment_text": "Reminds me of a Superjail episode where The Warden taking over earth and turns it to prison", "comment_date": "2019-08-07T14:12:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dedrick Neal", "comment_text": "Bullshit", "comment_date": "2019-08-07T06:21:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VVM", "comment_text": "the earth is flat", "comment_date": "2019-08-06T06:16:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The_Honkler", "comment_text": "THIS IS THE GALACTIC BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T08:52:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PETER FAULDS", "comment_text": "KARMA can never be repayed ,it is used as a weapon to force us to reincarnatee,and this belief only exists in our MIND , change your mind and change your life.....Forgive yourself and forgive others for there IMAGINED transgressions...", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T01:59:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "luxury", "comment_text": "That is mention in quran (OH jinn and human if you can got out from the border of earth and sky try but you cant except in God&#39;s will ) and the people the islam is not the truth !!!", "comment_date": "2019-08-03T19:23:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Millard", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMZxH1TIIQ&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> i like the banana scale can we just count things by banans instead of football fields", "comment_date": "2019-08-03T02:46:58Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Mike Arthut", "comment_text": "Why Earth Is A Prison ..Luke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMZxH1TIIQ&amp;t=10m18s\">10:18</a>-20 NKJV\r<br>And He said to them, \u201cI saw satan fall like lightning from heaven.

There are species of parasites that have such a sophisticated level of control over your human mind that mainstream science will never aknowledge their existence. The nature of what they are and the sheer scale of the level of control they have over humanity would only frighten humans do to the box that the human mind is kept in. Every conceivable aspect of your life from birth to death is scripted by these parasites. <br><br>Humans are kept deprived of essential vitamins and minerals, perpetually polluted with poisonous synthetic chemicals, and poisoned by radiation emitted from all electronic devices. You beings were designed to be controlled and dominanted by non human intelligences. Only those with true human consciousness can give you creatures access to human consciousness....and true immortality.", "comment_date": "2019-02-24T07:39:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Padilla", "comment_text": "Space is fake.", "comment_date": "2019-02-24T07:18:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alan Wayne", "comment_text": "We wouldn&#39;t need to leave so badly if we stopped destroying it for plastic we only use once.", "comment_date": "2019-02-23T17:45:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tecsul", "comment_text": "No one gonna talk how they put markipliers bird in this video?", "comment_date": "2019-02-22T22:47:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Duen-wayne O'gilvie", "comment_text": "I felt sorry for the duck when it started crying", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T21:30:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Marion", "comment_text": "Theres NO Gravity... the Earth just Sucks", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T17:50:11Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian K", "comment_text": "wts if this bs, why is this guy telling us that something is impossible? to those who are watching it knows that there is nothing like that", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T05:36:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wade O.", "comment_text": "translation at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMZxH1TIIQ&amp;t=6m02s\">6:02</a> is: This is not a rocket.", "comment_date": "2019-02-20T15:26:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Billy Casper", "comment_text": "<b>rocket science</b><br>my teachers have said that word so many times as a taunt", "comment_date": "2019-02-20T09:32:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ToastyFresh", "comment_text": "Why didn\u2019t we just pay off the universe before", "comment_date": "2019-02-20T00:00:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "responsibility 3miles", "comment_text": "Earth is prison. right. but you are a horrible liar of novelist..or a dog of illuminiti. so plz\u00a0delete this shit...this is horrible shit...", "comment_date": "2019-02-19T12:50:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Machy", "comment_text": "I\u2019ll just stick with model rockets", "comment_date": "2019-02-18T20:24:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lumia Or\u00f8kiadottir", "comment_text": "we need to build a ship like in no mans sky", "comment_date": "2019-02-18T12:23:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brotaytoh Potato", "comment_text": "Poor Bird <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMZxH1TIIQ&amp;t=1m42s\">1:42</a> \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T17:09:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anonymous", "comment_text": "We can escape a lot of the gravity well using balloons, taking advantage of the atmosphere", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T13:09:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Bacelar", "comment_text": "Why did you call Earth a prison are you stupid that&#39;s where you  were born", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T02:56:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sheebeehs", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMZxH1TIIQ&amp;t=5m05s\">5:05</a><br>Flat Earthers: Hold our beer", "comment_date": "2019-02-16T22:38:47Z", "likes_count": 33}, {"comment_by": "ARequiemForABean 1", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMZxH1TIIQ&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a> no!

We are highly concentrated frequencies and coils. There are 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms of spinning and vibrating energy we consist of.

It would immediately stop if the motor or generator was turned off. But we are connected to some kind of self generating holodeck where what we think becomes images. In this dimension our thoughts/images sometimes take days, weeks or years to pop up. But when we leave these bodies, what we image pops up immediately every time. Read the Seth books. Seth is an electrical being existing in another dimension. I read these books because I had a NDE as a child. These beings I felt and heard loudly. The book &quot;Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul&quot; is wild for your imagination. You will be accelerated, shocked and bewildered that we are not taught this in this dimension. These electrical energy beings formed my childhood and continue to form my existence with their constant focus. When you read this book you will realize that you are not alone. All of us are personalities of our souls. That means we are one with our souls. Through resonance we are able to gain knowledge of amazing proportions. I learned to heal myself and others super fast in my 20&#39;s by reading books. There are a lot of books that teach we are imagery itself. Electrical imagery. There is the book &quot;Healing Yourself&quot; by Rossman M.D. and &quot;Hands of Light&quot; by the physicist Barbara Brennan. There is &quot;The Quantum World&quot; by the physicist Kenneth Ford. And if you want to  know why we are not taught we are electrical/holographic beings, then the book &quot;War Against the Weak&quot; by Black will inform you. But there are many others.<br>I received this email recently from the site Ask a Mathematician, Ask a Physicist:<br><br>What are &quot;actual pictures&quot; of atoms actually pictures of?.<br><br>Physicist:<br>Actual pictures of atoms aren\u2019t actually pictures at all.<br>There are a few good rules of thumb in physics.  Among the best is:<br>light acts like you\u2019d expect on scales well above its wavelength and<br>acts weird on scales below.  In order to take a picture of a thing you<br>need light to bounce \u2026<br><br>The only thing physicists have actually seen is basically a computer<br>image, not the real image, and second, they observe electric fields,<br>not the particle itself. They do not observe particles themselves;<br>they are able to observe only the field. However this alone does not<br>prove anything, but that the electric energy field exists and that\u2019s<br>about it---no atoms, no photons, no electrons, no quarks. no nothing.<br>So no, particles do not exist. Particles exist only inside<br>mathematical abstractions and nothing more and nothing else. We don\u2019t<br>know what actually exists in the real world, except that there are<br>energy fields---electric, magnetic and all other forms and all other<br>kinds of energy fields.<br><br>I forgot to add what exactly is visualized with all these microscopes<br>including STM--the scanning tunneling microscope. What is visualized<br> is the charge density of the electric field.<br>Basically you observe vibrations---electric vibrations.<br>You haven\u2019t seen an atom either. You\u2019ve seen an image you assume to be<br>an atom, but it is simply an instrument\u2019s representation of the atom.<br>It is not the atom itself.<br><br>These techniques aren\u2019t actually \u201cvisual\u201d like microscopes we work<br>with in biology classes. Microscopes use lenses and light to help zoom<br>and focus on small objects. Electron microscopes, on the other hand,<br>use quantum scattering theory to construct the shape of small objects,<br>then the data is transferred to a computer to create a model. The<br>wavelengths of visible light ranges on the order of ~370nm to 750nm.<br>These are all MUCH larger than many particles of interest (and way too<br>large to view atoms, which are on the order of Angstroms\u20130.1nm).<br>Scientists need to be creative to be able to \u201csee\u201d atoms.<br><br>So, no, scanning tunneling microscopes and atomic force microscopes<br>did not prove the existence of atoms.", "comment_date": "2018-06-19T12:00:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Penguin", "comment_text": "Well at least it\u2019s better than real prisons", "comment_date": "2018-06-19T11:51:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheFieryMeteor", "comment_text": "The 4k dislikes are from Flat Earthers", "comment_date": "2018-06-19T10:10:32Z", "likes_count": 1218}, {"comment_by": "Noel2222", "comment_text": "If things don&#39;t want to move on their own, need the energy to convince it to move, and gravity moves the thing (earth to humans), where is GRAVITY getting its energy from?", "comment_date": "2018-06-19T03:08:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "REM3D", "comment_text": "banana for scale (9gag)", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T19:07:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Casper G", "comment_text": "when you put it like this....<br><br>it really seems like a pointless waste of time lol", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T18:45:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Casper G", "comment_text": "dude planet earth is like more beautiful than any other planet ??", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T18:32:24Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Codeyanne Gittens", "comment_text": "Can you do a follow-up video on war", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T16:21:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yeehaw", "comment_text": "Oof", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T15:27:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "inactive one", "comment_text": "The universe is a prison.

( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)<br><br>So basically we build something to get off and we need fuel tanks (1 weight) to hold the fuel (2 power) [In realism power is more like 1.25]<br><br>Goal: Have more power than weight but weight starts at 30k and you gotta get there by adding power up by 2(or 1.25) But at the same time you add 1 to 30k<br><br>It should&#39;ve been 15000 times we added power, but because of the +1 weight for every +2 power it keeps going up and now you have close to 60k weight by the time you overcome it with power. (30000+1x-2x=0 Can anyone figure that out x?) [I&#39;m on summer break and don&#39;t feel like doing math]<br><br>Once you overcome weight with power you should be done, but guess what, theres more! Now when get you finally get out, you&#39;ll have little to no power to carry 100% of the weight so you&#39;ll be going nowhere any time soon. What scientist did is they decided to shed off the unneeded empty tanks. (weight) this makes it easier for your fuel to do more work as now you have little fuel only having to push 5% of all weight.<br><br>By now your in space, you escaped gravity&#39;s prison and your energy credits work so much better now, as in space theres a lot less to no friction to slow you down, so you don&#39;t have to spend so much. (Of the little you have left)<br><br>Great part, cause gravity loves pulling stuff to itself so much, it&#39;ll let you in for free, but it won&#39;t be nice about it.<br><br>Gravity wants to teach you that it doesn&#39;t want you to leave so it makes it self really hard to reenter safely.<br><br>Too steep, you will come back too fast and have so much friction you burn up and die. Not steep enough and you&#39;ll miss and gravity won&#39;t be able to catch you as you wonder off into space knowing youre never coming back. But nail the steepness just right and gravity will catch you and let you in alive (even though its still going to be a pretty hot ride down to the ground)<br><br>Lastly, try to make a safe landing or else you&#39;ll just smash into the ground and cause a huge explosion/crater while dying anyways.

Optical illusion of the strobe lights that are produced and what we see in the stars and all the rest of the stuff are a lot closer in perspective a lot closer in reality than what they are in perspective now a lot of people think that because the frequency travels faster than light itself because the light is only one point one to .2% of the whole frequency is needed to reflect off an object you have to understand the over the abundance of frequency is needed to illuminate that object not even to actually come close to reflecting from the object because the object absorbs the frequency you only get point 1.2% of the actual light that&#39;s in the whole frequency not just part of it and it is not consistent and it&#39;s the same thing as looking at a strobe light if you&#39;re in a room in a strobe light and you think that things are objects appear to be farther than they really are that&#39;s exactly what we look at it when we look at the planets of the universe because all of the stars they pulsates we can&#39;t really actually see stars we don&#39;t we don&#39;t see him we can&#39;t we can see where the gravitational pulls come from on certain stars because we know that somehow maybe because of Dark Matter possibly dark matter I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s even existent but some people do believe it dark matter but it somehow it is either Which Way creates the f*<b>***</b> something has to do with the collapsing planet to create the star now stars are created from collapsing planets that fold on themselves because of their massive there over the hundred times bigger than the Sun or Jupiter and they collapse on themselves from their own gravitational pull now it becomes nuclear fusion after that and it turns into a giant pulsating blob of

Long before we knew that there are other solar systems with revolving planets. He knew this and tried to explain it the best he could at the time and age. Like so many other things that he taught which made no sense at the time to so many, but which are now being realised by 21st Century science and technology, he described the world as being a Saha planet (a world of suffering). Occupied by the energies of those who have built up the negative karma in past existences to reward them with a stint on Earth and not somewhere better (or perhaps even worse). He basically explained this world as a place of opportunity for those born here to realise their bad karma (made by past bad causes) and change it by making good causes. He also said that sadly, instead of doing this, many are instead being motivated by their bad karma content to make more bad karma, destroying this world of opportunity in the process. Well.. isn&#39;t that the truth, look at what we have done to our world already! He left the key that we can use to tap beyond our negative karma and bring forth our deepest wisdom hidden beneath it to change it...

Among all these worlds, it was in the world at the center\u2014with its Mount Sumeru, sun and moon, and four continents\u2014that the Buddha made his advent. Japan is a tiny island country situated in a remote corner of that world, to the northeast of the country in which the Buddha appeared.<br><br>Since all the lands in the ten directions, with the exception of this sah\u0101 world, are pure lands, their people, being gentlehearted, neither abuse nor hate the worthies and sages. In contrast, this world is inhabited by people who were rejected from the pure lands in the ten directions. They have committed the ten evil acts or the five cardinal sins, slandered the worthies and sages, and have been unfilial to their fathers and mothers or disrespectful to the monks. For these offenses they fell into the three evil paths, and only after dwelling there for countless kalpas were they reborn in this world. Yet the residue of the evil karma formed in their previous existences has not yet been eradicated, and they still tend to perpetrate the ten evil acts or the five cardinal sins, to revile the worthies and sages, and to be undutiful to their fathers and mothers or irreverent toward the monks.<br><br>For these reasons, when the Thus Come One Shakyamuni made his advent in this world, some people offered him food into which they had mixed poison. Others tried to harm him by means of swords and staves, mad elephants, lions, fierce bulls, or savage dogs. Still others charged him with violating women, condemned him as a man of lowly status, or accused him of killing. Again, some, when they encountered him, covered their eyes to avoid seeing him, and others closed their doors and shuttered their windows. Still others reported to the kings and ministers that he held erroneous views and was given to slandering exalted personages. These incidents are described in the Great Collection Sutra, the Nirvana Sutra, and other scriptures. The Buddha was innocent of all such evil deeds. Yet this world is peculiar or deficient in that those with bad karma are born into it and inhabit it in great numbers. Moreover, the devil king of the sixth heaven, scheming to prevent the people of this world from leaving it p.42for the pure lands, seizes every opportunity to carry out his perverse acts.<br><br>It appears that his scheming is ultimately intended to prevent the Buddha from expounding the Lotus Sutra. The reason is that the nature of this devil king is to rejoice at those who create the karma of the three evil paths and to grieve at those who form the karma of the three good paths.3 Yet he does not lament so greatly over those who form the karma of the three good paths, but he sorrows indeed at those who aspire to the three vehicles. Again, he may not sorrow so much over those who seek to attain the three vehicles, but he grieves bitterly at those who form the karma to become Buddhas and avails himself of every opportunity to obstruct them. He knows that those who hear even a single sentence or phrase of the Lotus Sutra will attain Buddhahood without fail and, exceedingly distressed by this, contrives various plots and restrains and persecutes believers in an attempt to make them abandon their faith.<br><br>Although the age in which the Buddha lived was certainly a defiled one, the five impurities had only just begun to manifest themselves; in addition, the devil stood in awe of the Buddha\u2019s powers. Yet, even in a time when the people\u2019s greed, anger, foolishness, and false views were still not rampant, a group of Brahmans of the Bamboo Staff school killed the Venerable Maudgaly\u0101yana, who was known as the foremost in transcendental powers; and King Aj\u0101tashatru, by releasing a mad elephant, threatened the life of the only one in all the threefold world who is worthy of honor.4 Devadatta killed the nun Utpalavarn\u0101, who had attained the state of arhat; and the Venerable Kok\u0101lika spread evil rumors about Sh\u0101riputra, who was renowned as the foremost in wisdom. How much worse things became in the world as the five impurities steadily increased! And now, in the latter age, hatred and jealousy toward those who believe even slightly in the Lotus Sutra will be all the more terrible. Thus the Lotus Sutra states, \u201cSince hatred and jealousy toward this sutra abound even when the Thus Come One is in the world, how much more will this be so after his passing?\u201d5 When I read this passage for the first time, I did not think that the situation would be as bad as it predicts. Now I am struck by the unfailing accuracy of the Buddha\u2019s words, especially in light of my present circumstances.", "comment_date": "2018-03-28T03:58:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nice-oscar", "comment_text": "More crap!", "comment_date": "2018-03-27T16:06:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KramTzY Fernandez", "comment_text": "\u201cYou need to give energy to escape earth\u201d Duck:throws a battery and says \u201ctake it!\u201d", "comment_date": "2018-03-26T10:54:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Micah Savory", "comment_text": "This concept of owing gravity is ridiculous", "comment_date": "2018-03-24T22:05:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michele Fornovo Tapia", "comment_text": "Thats why you dont fool with rocket science.", "comment_date": "2018-03-24T02:44:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chillallthe Kildren", "comment_text": "They just made rocket science simple WTF", "comment_date": "2018-03-23T14:23:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brendan Legault", "comment_text": "tintin reference xd", "comment_date": "2018-03-22T23:55:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris-Jan", "comment_text": "I do feel stuk on earth and its too mutsh to take i want out please someone get me a space craft plz really plz plz plz plz", "comment_date": "2018-03-22T18:53:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mika", "comment_text": "NICOLAS KONSTANTIN MOCH IST EINE H\u00c4\u00dfLICHE FRAU", "comment_date": "2018-03-21T10:01:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Voyager_Eternal_11", "comment_text": "&quot;banana for scale&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T09:26:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Napoli", "comment_text": "oooh...you need more blood flow to lift your rocket! wait...is this a sex simulation?", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T23:56:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Fatal Butterfly", "comment_text": "&quot;Banana for scale&quot; \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T22:28:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Levi Strauss", "comment_text": "Lol Tintin reference.", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T15:03:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meg Carter", "comment_text": "Am I the only one who has to go back a few seconds every now and then to comprehend what they\u2019re saying before moving on", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T14:37:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Donidemaru554", "comment_text": "how to give the univererse A PAYBACK<br><br>1.Manipulate reality so you can treat it like a computer<br><br>2.Type these 2 commands:<br><br>command 1: cd /<br>command 2: rm *<br><br>now EVERYTHING is DELETED<br><br>wait, we are DELETED too<br><br>SH*<b>****************</b>", "comment_date": "2018-03-17T19:55:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deviousxen", "comment_text": "I love you, poor bird.", "comment_date": "2018-03-17T17:52:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TCA", "comment_text": "Kerbal Space Program in a nutshell", "comment_date": "2018-03-15T17:22:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AdminAnimates", "comment_text": "So, to move anything, you must BRIBE it?!?!!?", "comment_date": "2018-03-15T15:05:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "French Bread", "comment_text": "Birdo", "comment_date": "2018-03-15T02:27:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julian Daube", "comment_text": "Wieos kurzgesagt?

I mean, it&#39;s rather that the parts were existing by themselves at some point in the past, and as they came together energy was released, ultimately in the form of radiation. If energy had been &quot;used&quot; to put the parts together, then the resulting system (the Earth) would possess excess energy. Think of a compressed spring: energy has been expended to compress it and now it contains that energy which can be used, for example, to propel something away from something else. The earth is the opposite of a compressed spring. Energy has not been expended to put the Earth together, but rather energy has been released while it came together. That energy is currently out and about, and in order to separate the parts of the Earth again (i.e. launch stuff into space) we need to provide energy somehow. At this point you&#39;re back on track, but the introduction is a bit unfortunate.<br><br>Also, what is the &quot;gravity prison at the edge of space&quot;? This makes it sound like (a) space is finite, and (b) the extent of the Earth&#39;s gravitational field is finite, none of which is true.<br><br>Oh, and final note: You don&#39;t really need a lot of kinetic energy to reach a certain altitude as suggested around 4.40.

Or is that purely the comfort that life&#39;s looking for in its explanations? The universe introspects, not while it needs to, it&#39;s just how electric current runs, but there is surely no anti-mirrored-living-creature resembling us.

I might be completely wrong, but it might get us to understand logics in quantum physics, eventually. The antimaterial version would have &#39;life blindness&#39;, as we create matter within artificialism, and that energy source would be the bases of a propulsion through spacetime, where you can omit half the space and half the time, constantly, with a very high exchange rate, at least theoretically.

When you transport your mater is decompiled  and sent somewhere else to be remade but if you are changing where you are in a gravitational field for example moving from a ship to a planet you&#39;ve just lost a load of gravitational potential energy and indeed kinetic energy and momentum if the ship was in orbit. So where does it go? Does it need to be taken into account because what if it is transferred to something else it&#39;s not useful to transport down to the planet and then instantly combust due to your energy being transferred as heat or freeze when you go back to your ship and also with momentum if your momentum is taken into account would this change the orbit of the ship in any measurable way because a human in orbit has a lot of momentum so would this affect you negatively if you need to keep a precise orbit. This is not so much an argument about the realism of the technology in the fiction works but rather questioning the chance that such technology is actually possible practically and if it is possible whether we can reach that level of advancement soon(ish)", "comment_date": "2017-06-08T11:42:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quintiax", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMZxH1TIIQ&amp;t=1m37s\">1:37</a><br>We need to give that duck some more coins to leave his/herr prison!", "comment_date": "2017-06-07T12:50:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Digital Pyro", "comment_text": "great thanks for the sponsored ad.

I am wondering if it would be possible (imagining we have the money to build such a structure) to build a giant tube that goes way deep in the ocean, emptying it, placing a spaceship at the bottom of the tube, then refilling it, maintaining the ship at the bottom during the refill and once its empty, release it. Basically build a giant pressure rocket launcher. I imagine the structure of the tube should be massive to resist the pressure, as well as the strucure of the rocket itself, but since it has less fuel to burn, it will also have less mass than nowadays rockets. So if we imagine that the rockets mass will be half the mass of present rockets, at what depth should we put the rocket down the sea in order for it to leave the atmosphere, if its even possible?

Who needs trajectories when gravity is practically non-existant? If you need an explanation for Zero Point Energy Reaction, well: A singularity is a hyper dense space of matter in which matter and energy are indistinguishable producing massive amounts of graviton particle and energetic bursts. Simply spin an object of significant durability around the singularity and it should perpetually go around the singularity until the heat death of the universe. This can be converted into kinetic energy which can be converted into directed energy outburst or impulse, Using these extreme bursts of energy we can simply exceed the speed of light using warp matter. Warp matter would be required as going to the speed of light and not being instantly turned into energy is impossible without warp matter. ~This has been theoretical science with cherry have a day.", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T02:57:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IvoryTrance", "comment_text": "i love the animation", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T02:56:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sagi Altynkop", "comment_text": "Thanks to KSP I understood everything he said)", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T02:53:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ravedaze", "comment_text": "If I could live forever I&#39;d go to every planet in the universe visiting new life and different cultures.... but I wouldn&#39;t come back to this shithole!", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T02:48:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Katherine Montero", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMZxH1TIIQ&amp;t=1m37s\">1:37</a> The crying bird with the golden coin broke my heart! :&#39;(", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T02:43:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Prince Righty I", "comment_text": "Cute chickens \ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc24\ud83d\udc24\ud83d\udc24\ud83d\udc24", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T02:38:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gkarjala", "comment_text": "Nice.

I am not rooting here for blind optimism, far from it, only for a sort of imaginative cautiousness which seems subtly lacking from K.

You&#39;ve talked about rockets, how they really don&#39;t work for large payloads and you&#39;ve talked about space elevators, how they&#39;re awesome but the tech doesn&#39;t (and may never) exist to create them. I feel like electromagnetic accelerators don&#39;t get enough love when it comes to the topic of how to get things into orbit, and sufficient tech already exists. The only problem is that if you wanted to send up sensitive payloads (e.g. Humans) you would need a very long track to get a safe acceleration, meaning it&#39;d be really expensive. Or you could just use it to ship up raw materials, that could survive the extremely high acceleration and make a significantly smaller facility.

In addition to helping scientists answer fundamental questions about the nature of matter, the material is theorized to have a wide range of applications, ranging from room-temperature superconductors to powerful rocket propellant.<br>Atomic metallic hydrogen, if metastable at ambient pressure and temperature could be used as the most powerful chemical rocket fuel, as the atoms recombine to form molecular hydrogen. This light-weight high-energy density material would revolutionize rocketry, allowing single-stage rockets to enter orbit and chemically fueled rockets to explore our solar system. To transform solid molecular hydrogen to metallic hydrogen requires extreme high pressures, but has not yet been accomplished in the laboratory. In the proposed new approach electrons will be injected into solid hydrogen with the objective of lowering the critical pressure for transformation. If successful the metastability properties of hydrogen will be studied.", "comment_date": "2017-02-01T15:31:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nuke", "comment_text": "Tintin!", "comment_date": "2017-02-01T15:31:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Wise", "comment_text": "I feel like this video isn&#39;t up to par with their normal stuff.

In order to maximize that difference, known as Delta-V, you have to do a few things:<br><br>A. Extract as much momentum from the propellant as possible. To do this, you want the most ideal exhaust gas pressure, which is both why rockets that are designed to be used at sea level have smaller engine bells, and why rockets in space will have much longer and wider engine bells. Look at the Falcon 9 Merlin engines. The bottom stage has room for 9, smaller engines, while the upper stage has one large engine for use in space. Designs for fission rockets also have this trait, but are only meant to be used in space. This is why they all have long engine bells designs that are almost as wide as the test fairings they&#39;ve been put into<br><br>B. Get the ratio of the wet mass to dry mass as high as possible. You want less rocket carrying more fuel, so ideally you want as much fuel in a single tank as possible since the inverse square law tells you that having a tank 10x smaller will carry 100x less fuel, so you would need more tanks to carry more fuel which needs more fuel to lift it which needs more tanks, which would needs more fuel, and you&#39;re not getting anywhere with this cycle of nonsense<br><br>C. In flight, shed excess weight. For any given stage, carrying dead weight lowers the ratio of wet to dry mass, and you don&#39;t want that. This is why asparagus rocket staging is very efficient since it strikes a perfect balance of rocket stability and stage-specific efficiency<br><br>D. Increase your exhaust velocity. To do this, you want very hot fuel. Hot fuel is more energetic, and you want to get that energy made into kinetic energy, which is the basis of fission engines. Basically, they pass liquid hydrogen over a fission reactor to keep it cool, which heats up the liquid hydrogen to very high temperatures, where it is then exhausted out the back as hydrogen gas", "comment_date": "2017-02-01T13:58:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jan harald", "comment_text": "earth is a mental hospital...<br>so yes, kind of necessary to make it hard to leave...", "comment_date": "2017-02-01T13:58:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tuned Rockets", "comment_text": "kurzegast. is saying &quot;you need to go 40 000 km/s to escape earth&quot; incorrect since if you go 1 km/s (relative to earth) straight up you&#39;ll leave earths influance eventually.<br><br>the correct thing is you need 40 000 km of delta v.<br>or am i just incredibly ignorant", "comment_date": "2017-02-01T13:58:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jakub Rozd\u017cestwie\u0144ski", "comment_text": "if you have problems understanding - just try Kerbal Space Program!", "comment_date": "2017-02-01T13:58:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "t0w31", "comment_text": "thumbs up for banana for scale", "comment_date": "2017-02-01T13:58:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ronyo", "comment_text": "Orbiting Earth is easy!
