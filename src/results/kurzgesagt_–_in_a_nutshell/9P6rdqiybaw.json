To make a real worm hole within &quot;physics&quot; we would need to tap into more dimensions of physics and manipulate them for example if we could take a space ship and make a device that can exchange dimensional physics with other dimensions, we could technically trade 1 of our 3 dimensions for a &quot;zero&quot; by sliding 1 dimension into a higher realm of dimensions like using 4D in 3D space to trick a ship into becoming 2D &quot;according to our 3D physics&quot; allowing an entire ship to slip into a massless timeless state than go where ever it wants than shut off the device so you get the 3rd dimension back and are normal again. If you made this it would seem like teleportation since time would not pass for the ship in transit for the passengers or from our point of view on earth. This would work and The Philadelphia Experiment might of been the first step in making such a device. Through a combination of manipulating magnetic fields and gravity fields to fine tuned and super powered amounts we will be able to invent what seems like &quot;teleportation pods&quot; but is actually doing nothing at all to break physics. This can all be done without making a wormhole or a black hole of any kind. I dam near died laughing at the &quot;exotic matter&quot;, are scientists really that dumb they think that the solution to all there problems is going to be some hidden substance they can mine???

But I am still so bad at math that I can&#39;t read symbols on equations like they are distracting me and confuse me. Yes i managed somehow through school but only by imagination and making it feel right or just practicing but always each step learned why I do that. But now I can&#39;t solve equations and how could I do physics and leave law at almost 30 years old.<br><br>Why Am I telling you this? Because I was always a kid with lots of imagination. And what I saw now what Einstein found out I had exactly this in my mind why objects move through space around other objects.<br><br>I even had this imagination that objects fall down with elasticity  to break trough the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of space what I think is dark matter over all.<br>My English is not native but I will try to explain.<br><br>The universe is flat plat and it&#39;s material is dark matter with dark energy.<br>there are other universe and each of them are below the other.<br>This flat universe is elastic. So if something is in it, it falls constantly down. It stretches the universe. Here comes the clue: If the objects falls down and sinks into the abyss of universe it also stretches into the other below universe flat plat. And it sinks and sinks for like trillion and more years.<br>And Then it breaks and all the content from universe 1 comprehends into a small drop which contains all essence of the universe with all information and it drips into the next flat universe plat causing the big bang which is not Bang or explosion, it&#39;s just this small drop intrudes in a new blank universe plat causing to enhance and activate the universe plat and the information in the small blob (like a tear which falls from you eyes) causing to begin processes which led to almost same creation and developing of past universe.<br><br>If you ask why? I can explain too. The universe which I think is flat and already a system in itself. It&#39;s content is blank because nothing introduded so far. But his material is pure dark energy fields and dark matter which have properties. Properties like a straight system of almost eternity small points of energy fields which wait content to drop into the playing field to activate and work. The universe and is small particles are all connected like you pixels on the screen. Exactly that&#39;s how I would describe it. The universe and is particles are like the pixels of your screen. And each pixel is a worker and creator. It only waits for orders and commands. The dark matter and energy is the fuel for all these pixels to work and create all together simultaneously something which you see as objects and atmosphere.<br><br>And when this drop comes into the next universe it&#39;s like sperm giving life and content to a blank clear system. Then everything will arrange in billion or trillion years and will develop with trial and error a perfect system because each pixel is working while each pixel always connects and communicates with each other pixel and all pixel together in the whole universe as an overall super entity pixel.<br><br>Like I sad I see this for the first time but I always thought that we are sinking and falling. And that&#39;s why we think we expand but in reality we only fall constantly down and stretch the universe which is elastic. Causing to stretch many other universe flat plates under our universe to stretch.<br><br>Think of a elastic something gathered above the same elastic thing. If you put a heavy weight on top all level of the elastic thing will fall stretch down and object will fall.<br><br>But then there is a limit were the first on top universe rip apart and all content information of this universe will comprehend back into a single drop which will now fall down and enter a new under neath universe causing to give it live with the informations from the old universe how it is gonna have to work and the pixels which activate because they get information and the dark matter fuelling the dark emergy to work and giving them maybe somehow of consciousness because every pixel like I sad is communicating each mili second (in reality it is real life and it can&#39;t be described with a number because it&#39;s love without a single delay) and each pixel of full knowledge of each other pixel which is trillions of lightyear away and connected to the whole system as a whole.<br><br>We are falling not expending!<br><br>And that is why light is always everywhere and for as humans always faster than everything. Because it&#39;s everywhere 100% of the universe. It is the light from the energy exchange and interactions from all the pixels which work and the dark energy giving them fuel to work and energyze. That&#39;s why it is so fast because it was always everywhere. It&#39;s like the ocean contains water and if we humans thought that water=light, we would measure the speed of the water and see that it&#39;s faster than anything else when in reality it is not fast its just everywhere before now and after.<br><br>And what I forgot each pixel knows over time how to work due the information of the past universe and each pixel will give each atom and particle orders how to work and react and how to behave. Like a switch from a DNA which can&#39;t turn on our off. Every little pixel in the universe has orders and properties and behaves like he has too.<br><br>So basically the future is always written when we live in the present. The present is the future and there is no time like we humans invented. It&#39;s just we are living life and simultaneously with the universe.<br><br>And I think if some of pixels get failures and malfunction that&#39;s why sometimes we get sick or other accidents happen because some particles failed or got desynchronized and can&#39;t connect live without a delay with the other particles in the universe.<br><br>I don&#39;t know what how I do it but sometimes I can see future events to occur like a soccer game where I know that a team will wijj exactly 5:1 or will winn first halt 3:1 or the bar team will win 2:0 and so on or know which persons I will see next in the next day Whig I didn&#39;t see in years.<br>and other stuff. Call me autistic and hyper sensitive that might be the case. Some friend in school told me in a game where we should say stuff about others and guess who that is that I am a mysterious guy.<br><br>I sometimes get answers from someone else or wish something to happen and it happens and in the past I was scared because strange things happened and occurred like I wished or imagined. But i got used to it.<br><br>A couple of month before I asked this strange power that he has to show me what it is all about and what we have to do as humans and what&#39;s our goal.<br><br>The first 2 nights no answer but than on the third night he answered me in my dream and took my hand and showed me what is all about.<br><br>In summary if you die you will exist as a conscious of many particles flying around and seeing everything oj earth but you can&#39;t interact. You also can&#39;t gather knowledge. You only can take everything you gatherer as a human and all your knowledge and education will stay fixed and continue on you new entity beeing which consists of many particles like a invisible cloud connected together.<br><br>I REPEAT EVERYTHING YOU DO TILL YOUR LIFE WILL the only thing you can&#39;t take with you after death. That&#39;s what he shower me. The key and goals of human existing is to gather knowledge and if you for the energy of your consciousness, brain and thoughts is not vanished. It will live in the particles which connect and put everything together and you living on and watching. The bad part is her I REPEAT you stay this way. You are physically trapped and mentally trapped. You can&#39;t access new knowledge or make new memory&#39;s or train you capacity or whatever You stay as an observer which can think but can&#39;t do nothing.<br>He showed me that a small exception exists. If you connect to the universe it itself in its whole you can make interactions like doing wind blows so people in a room maybe think there is someone there.", "comment_date": "2021-10-24T01:03:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ravi christian", "comment_text": "very good", "comment_date": "2021-10-23T12:34:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ninja nerd23", "comment_text": "Nothing is better than getting stoned eating snacks and learning about the universe", "comment_date": "2021-10-23T04:28:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Stewart", "comment_text": "wouldn\u2019t the first black hole work because if time runs backwards then you would die in the black hole then come back to life in the white", "comment_date": "2021-10-22T04:05:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Molledd", "comment_text": "Wait, but is we use exotic matter, it just repel us away when we tried to enter?", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T22:21:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "runningcolt", "comment_text": "call me when it&#39;s ready", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T19:36:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Koko", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t even skip ads on this channel anymore \ud83d\ude2d, yes get that bag!!

It won&#39;t do any good if that other end is another black hole, and we won&#39;t be able to notice if there was one. Second, you said parallel universe, this means, not ours. You also said that we could travel faster than light, so you are saying light will move slower than us through that wormhole. So are they real, my best guess is no. LIGO proved gravitational waves, so space does bend, curve, expand and contract in those waves, but those waves are smaller than the thickness of your fingernails,  we could try and pierce through one of such waves and see if we can squeeze through a molecule of water, but an entire human, those have got to be humongeous waves, those we might be able to find in the close proximity of black holes orbiting each other, but so close that we are on the accretion disk, and on that disk we&#39;re not humans anymore, but hot gas already. also, light is a wave, it blueshifts if the lightsource is coming towards us and it redshifts if the lightsource moves away from us, so the wave of that lightsource doesn&#39;t fade, just like I would hit a baseball in outer space, that ball will have a constant velocity, so my best guess is that gravitational waves are just the same, and if the waves that ligo detected, which was from either rotating neutron stars or rotating black holes, they I see no possible way to even test piercing a gravitational wave so we could try and send a molecule through it, the waves exist, but it&#39;s amplitude is way to small. So how exactly will we bend space in on itself to pierce it and create a wormhole? I say, they don&#39;t exist.<br>We could try and rip open spacetime and create a 2 dimensional gateway and use the dimension of time to travel through, time is the same everywhere, is uniformly so it works the same everywhere in the universe, and somewhere else in the universe open up another 2 dimensional gateway and then pass through, but that&#39;s not a wormhole, but in my mind, it&#39;s our best shot at traveling instantly from one place to another in the universe. How to rip open spacetime, we do that with quark-gluon plasma, since that is capable of destroying the fabric of spacetime, which is also what I think is the core of a black hole instead of a singularity. Somehow, in those equations on how we thought the core of a black hole is a singularity, I doubt they have taken into account the temperature of the core. To make quark-gluon plasma, you have to have a gigantic amount of pressure and a gigantic amount of heat, to simulate the first 10 to the minus 33 seconds after the big bang, when dimensions were formed.

I was in my tent and wanted to peek my head out for some air. When I opened the tent and looked out, I looked up into the sky and noticed a black circle in the sky right above my head. It appeared to be coming closer as the diameter was getting bigger, then it seemed to stop descending as it stopped growing, and was just hovering there. It was all black, not lit up at all (no glowing edge).  Anyways, I only saw it for about two minutes before shrugging it off and getting back in my tent and dozing off. The next morning, I had slept in, and missed my flight, but when I woke up, I remember feeling ODDLY dizzy, and I asked myself, is this a normal feeling, but came to the conclusion that it was indeed not a normal dizziness. I made my way to the airport in a strange daze, I was so out of it, that I didn&#39;t think of trying to renew my plane ticket, but instead purchased another $1,500 ticket that I ended up missing that flight, too. Something was wrong with me and my judgment with the daze that I was in. I went on wandering the streets of Amsterdam making poor decisions and experiencing strange Phenomenon.

It is such a stupid movie that it should be shown in a circus as an example of mental indolence.<br>I completely disagree with the theses contained in the film. In order not to write too much, I will only say that I am a follower of the theory that our universe, after a period of gravitational acceleration - will collapse again - creating a new universe. How it will look like in my opinion - I present in a short video on YouTube and Facebook.<br><br>@<br>@t<br><br>The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether.<br><br>What will the future of the universe be like? Will it constantly expand and disperse in the darkness of the darkness, or will new forms of matter arise? Maybe other theories are an alternative to space? For example, string theory, which predicts the existence of ten dimensions, M-theory, that is, the theory of two three-dimensional surfaces called branches, separated by a small gap along the eleventh dimension. Or the future of our universe is the &quot;new&quot; universe inside a black hole. These and other fantastic theories cannot stand the competition with quintessence theory. Although it has some logical quality, it is not the theory I would subscribe to.<br><br>As you have noticed, dear reader, this chapter is entitled - The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether. This is the title of one of the stories by Edgar Allan Poe. How can he relate to cosmological theories? Well, none or almost none. The story itself is not relevant at all. Reading them a few years ago, I did not pay attention to its title, but in explaining the issue I am writing about, it is a very apt statement.<br><br>The theme of this chapter is the future of our universe. I would definitely like to state that: from the beginning of its creation, its future is strictly defined and determined. The main and primary purpose of our universe is its final collapse. What does this mean Well, that after a period of unusually intense inflation from the first second of our universe, after the era of recombination, the formation of the first stars and modern galaxies, we find ourselves at a turning point in our history, which will be followed by slow, but systematic and finally faster and even faster velocity, all radiation matter will collapse back to the center. It is logical that if the Big Bang was the starting point of the whole process, then the turning point is its return. Okay, but what does this have to do with quintessence theory - this ridiculous-sounding title?<br><br>&quot;Observations made over the past five years have convinced cosmologists that chemical elements and dark matter together give less than half the content of the universe, while the rest are ubiquitous&quot; dark energy &quot;characterized by an unusual property: its gravitational effect is not about attraction, but repulsion. While under the influence of gravity, chemical elements and dark matter are concentrated in stars and galaxies, energy tends to fill the entire space evenly in the likeness of fog. In opposition to these two tendencies, repulsive gravity takes over, which, by overcoming the gravitational attraction of matter, gradually accelerates the expansion of the universe. [...]<br>Measuring the current rate of expansion, assuming it is slowing down, it would appear that the age of the universe is less than 12 billion years. Meanwhile, observations show that some stars in our galaxy are 15 billion years old. By accelerating the expansion rate of the universe, repulsion reconciles the calculated age of the universe with the observed age of celestial bodies. &quot;<br>quote from J. P. Ostriker, P. J. Steinhard, The quintessential universe, &quot;\u015awiat Nauki&quot; 2001, No. 3.<br><br>Considering that dark energy is in 70 percent a component of the massive mass universe and the density of this dark energy is almost negligible, I would compare dark energy to the title &quot;feather&quot;. Let&#39;s imagine that it is fluff that you can hardly see, but there is so much of it that it accumulates in itself is a terribly heavy burden. In this counting, dark matter, ordinary matter and radiation are &quot;tar.&quot; As you know, this substance with a solid or heated consistency has a relatively smaller volume than down. Both these &quot;heaviness&quot; - down and pitch - just like dark energy and matter with radiation are inseparably connected with each other in a simply ingenious way.<br><br>Some stars in our galaxy are 15 billion years old, which would indicate the age of the universe. But according to the theory of repulsive gravity, the age of the universe is calculated at 12 billion years. There is a certain contradiction. It can be explained by The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether.<br><br>As you know, after the Big Bang there was a huge expansion of energy and mass from the center of the explosion. The whole mass was plasma. Mass has a higher density than energy, which is why in this explosion process the mass velocity was after some time higher than the so-called dark energy. Let&#39;s throw a lump of tar, it will fly faster than a large ball of powder.<br><br>So it was the mass that exploded first, followed by dark energy. To bring all this &quot;theory&quot; to an end, it must be assumed that the Big Bang was not the beginning of the process. How is it possible that this big bomb was stuck in time and in a space that, as a result, was not, and suddenly, it is not known for what reason, it exploded. In my opinion, this was not the beginning of space-time.<br><br>I would compare this whole process to the cosmic perpetual motion machine - a self-propelled machine that explodes and shrinks again and again, creating a megacycle. And we are just in the middle of it. If this assumption of cyclicality is true, then the whole process would be like this: matter with a higher density than dark energy has gone away first, but also the first one stops its momentum, because its total weight is lower than the total weight of dark energy. Dark energy has a higher total weight, but due to the low density it follows all matter. Dark energy, finally, thanks to the greater total weight overtakes (penetrates) the whole mass and rushes further into space.<br><br>It is this process that is &quot;responsible&quot; for the entire age problem of the universe. Invisible dark energy, heavier than mass, eventually gravitational pulls this mass with its enormous weight. Therefore, the edges of our observable universe are not repelled by the negative energy of the vacuum, but quite the opposite - they are attracted by dark energy. Although dark energy has very low density, it also has to &quot;slow down&quot; sometime.<br><br>Because dark energy has a very low density, it stretches like very long gum. Thanks to this unimaginable extension, dark energy loses its value as a huge weight. Here comes a key critical moment in the megacycle. The focused mass finally reaches the advantage over the extended dark energy and attracts dark energy gravitatively with all its &quot;firmness&quot;. At first, this one doesn&#39;t have a high &quot;return&quot; speed. But over time this speed increases, reaching such strength that all this &quot;armada&quot; - dark energy and the whole mass of the universe - rushes back towards the center. And this center is the final moment of the megacycle. A new, next explosion is the beginning of the next ...<br><br>So it is this movement back and forth that is the foundation of our universe. This is essential for all its components. I am thinking especially about our planet and its inhabitants. This is only a theory and you need to confirm its assumptions by others. Cosmologists who have at their disposal an entire arsenal of scientific knowledge certainly evaluate it very thoroughly. If what I have written is contrary to science, you should agree with this without reservation. Submitting this theory to the judgment of science, I would like to say that in the event that it turns out to be a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;, the entire rest of this book has virtually no meaning. Perhaps there are some inaccuracies in it, but the basic meaning of the theory of The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether is the cyclical nature of the universe, which is confirmed by some evidence that will be the subject of most of the chapters presented.", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T21:01:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ardelia Mustafa", "comment_text": "Are all of you here at 2 am?", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T19:23:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BonurChamp69", "comment_text": "Awesome video", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T17:17:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mansi The Great", "comment_text": "I love watching this kind of informative videos though it gives me headache.", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T12:48:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blackdragon 7", "comment_text": "The people who put worm holes in henta\u00ef truly are genius\ud83d\ude39", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T12:34:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gloomus", "comment_text": "what are the chances of a wormhole appearing?", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T12:06:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martinab", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t like how they leave the most important part for just a few seconds in the end: wormholes break the causality principle and therefore make no sense to physicists.

Let&#39;s assume you and I are on different planets, me being on the earth and you on some planet where the time is claimed to be slow. Let&#39;s say the claim is 1 hour on your planet = 1 year on Earth. Now let&#39;s say it takes 1 year to complete all the seasons here on Earth and it takes 1 hour on that planet. Our biological clock is evolved to be set to our Earth&#39;s time. Every second our earth&#39;s time ticks, every second our body gets older. Similarly on that planet of yours you are sitting on, it&#39;s the same principle but 1 year on Earth&#39;s age, is yours for 1 hour of that particular planet&#39;s time. MEANING that if I get 1 year older for 1 year of Earth&#39;s time, you get 1 year older too BUT, BUT MY FRIEND you get 1 year older in that 1 hour time count on that planet. We can simply say that 1 year of Earth = 1 hour of X planet&#39;s time. Hence in TERMS OF PLANET X&#39;s time IT&#39;s 1 HOUR and in terms of EARTH&#39;s TIME it&#39;s the same 1 year. Hence we can regard that 1 hour of planet X&#39;s time as 1 year of Earth&#39;s time itself. If you want another example we can use the sun rise or set. Let&#39;s say it takes 1 day for sun rise in Earth and 1/365 (since we took 1 hour of E time = 1 year of X time) Hence for one sunrise we will wait for 1 day on Earth but for the same sun rise we will wait 1/365 days which is nothing but the same amount of BIOLOGICAL TIME YOU SPEND ON THAT PLANET BUT NOT GRAVITATIONAL TIME. OR IN MY TERMS, BIOLOGICAL TIME AND GRAVITATIONAL TIME ARE NOT THE SAME AND NOT RELATED TO EACH OTHER BUT IRRELEVANT OF REGARDLESS WHAT YOU DO AND WHERE YOU ARE, YOU WILL AGE THE SAME AS I DO ON EARTH BUT ON DIFFERENT GRAVITATIONAL TIME. We will spend the same biological time and different gravitational time.

Once you develop extra sensory perceptions (by letting go when you meditate), you receive information from the quantum field (that the shamans call the Nagual, where everything is possible, where our Soul which is immortal resides) via our perceptions (clearaudiance, for those who receive visual information), clear audiance for those who receive information through their ears, kinesthetic for those who can feel, cleargustiance for those who receive inforamtion through their taste, clear sentience through the smell ... at the other side of theis bridge a cave made of quartz can be found with a Council of Light with 13 Beings of Light and the purpose of life is to reach this place (our Soul is reincarnating in a cycle of 108 incarnations, once we reach this place and reach self-realization by raising our Kundalini energy along our central energy channel in our body - meaning along our chakras, endocrine glands where the energy is coming from in our body) ... shamans are humans who have the ability to make their 3rd eye (Pineal Gland - portal to other dimensions) and all the other endocrine glands vibrate at the quantic resonance frequency to raise the Kundalini energy ... scientists should open their mind, start to meditate to become shamans and act to heal the world and every human one by one spiritually ... stay safe and secure, for those who would like to live their healthiest &amp; happiest life they can practice some Soma breathwork energized meditation ... anything that is natural is good for you : fruits and vegetables which are alcaline, bretahing doing sports to be fit, intermittent fasting and even long term fasting by drinking water, which helps to clean the body from the unnecessary cells, lose weight and negatie thoughts ... we live in a Supernature our breath can set us free ...

This paper had excluded the concept of singularities that are perceived to result in black holes. Apart from the Schwarzschild radius, gravitational singularities do not result from the field equations of general relativity. The singularity identified at r=0 is misidentified as being a gravitational singularity when in fact it is the singularity from which length contraction originates for a gravitational mass and recedes away outwards towards the Schwarzschild radius. The Einstein-Rosen bridge described by Albert Einstein more describes the phenomenon of quantum entanglement than anything involving the concept of a black hole. The irony is that the Einstein-Rosen bridge explains the &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; of quantum entanglement that Einstein himself had dismissed. The Einstein-Rosen bridge involves a particle that bridges two separate space coordinates while maintaining the same time coordinate. Quantum entanglement involves two particles of separate space coordinates while maintaining the same time coordinate such that an event in the state of one particle is the same event for the state of the other particle, being that they are connected in time and therefore by the 4th dimension rather than by 3 dimensional space. The curvature of spacetime is also the 4th dimension and without that understanding of it, gravitation would also appear to be &#39;spooky action at a distance&#39;. It is the understanding of time or rather the 4th dimension that explains both gravitation and quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement is simply a 4th dimensional bridge between two particles in spacetime.", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T23:06:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mia Evans", "comment_text": "I love how many hitchhikers guide to the galaxy references there are in kurzgesagt videos", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T18:49:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RichA Rich TV", "comment_text": "The music on this is so good!!!", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T18:49:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Deal", "comment_text": "The tricky thing provisionally mine because pisces approximately tow except a parallel writer. imported, amuck graphic", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T09:00:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GOD GAMING", "comment_text": "My dream is i become a cricketer and second is i am go inside a black hole", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T08:02:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Allan", "comment_text": "Something, something...

My girlfriend saved my life last night. This is a selfie I took in the emergency room after having a severe allergic reaction to almonds. I went into anaphylaxis, meaning my face, my lips, my eyes, my tongue, and my throat all started swelling up rapidly, making it almost impossible for me to breathe. I also had a rash all over my entire body, and I was extremely red. Staying alive had never felt more difficult. At one point, my nasal passage was completely blocked, and it was getting more and more difficult to breathe. They shot me up with Benadryl, steroids, they gave me a breathing tube, and even other stuff that I can\u2019t even remember, and it caused all of the swelling and the rash to go away. Because this was a severe allergic reaction, I need to continue taking steroids and Benadryl for the next week, because it is possible that the allergic reactions could come back at any point over the next week. The steroids and Benadryl make me feel like a zombie, and I really want to take care of my health, so this will be my main focus over the next week. I want to thank my amazing girlfriend, who made the decision to take me to the emergency room the second I started feeling itchy. I was hesitant about going, because I didn\u2019t even want to believe this was actually happening. If it weren\u2019t for my girlfriend driving me to the emergency room only minutes after eating the almonds, there is a good chance that I wouldn\u2019t have made it according to the doctor. This has been without a doubt the hardest few days of my life, but I also look at them as the most important few days of my life. These moments have reminded me about what\u2019s really important in life, and it has made me so grateful to even be here on this earth. I will be prioritizing my health over the next week, and I\u2019ll post updates about how I feel. Thank you all for being patient during these difficult times.

World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity; Similar is the case of money stolen by a thief who hides the ill-gotten money and then misuses it or commits more misdeeds; \u201cwho does not owe it does not fear it\u201d. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth.", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T13:05:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nadal van Nunen", "comment_text": "Ah so interstellar is accurate.", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T12:12:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "erkan mahmut", "comment_text": "you are telling it like it is nearly about to happen to tease us and at the end you say &quot;<br>but that is impossible..&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T11:16:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cthulhu Worship", "comment_text": "If we made a wormhole from earth to space then wouldn&#39;t it drain the atmosphere as the vaccum sucks in all gas from earth?", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T10:31:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ro Games", "comment_text": "I got an idea what if wormholes were like digestive systems sucking you in striping you of your atoms fibers molecules and nutrients spitting you out on the other side a blob of nothing", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T10:01:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eradicator 5000", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P6rdqiybaw&amp;t=0m01s\">0:01</a> creepy Garfield clock", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T08:57:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheMaxymon", "comment_text": "Living for those synth chapter announcements", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T07:41:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Summer's Timely Cringe", "comment_text": "Okay, so we could use exotic matter to keep open the man-made wormholes...<br><br>But wouldn&#39;t that wormhole also push US away?

Kurzgesagt you guys are absolutely amazing!! I personally think that wormholes are possible but, I either don&#39;t get for fail to see why wormholes would create time travel paradoxes because the laws of physics already prevent time travel to the past, so the only way wormholes could generate time travel is if they could take us to the future. although I think this video ignores something that might make wormholes impossible is feedback. if wormholes were in orbit around the earth, light or air would end up in a feedback loop and that could ultimately destroy the wormhole. So we would have to do something to keep our wormholes open so they would not be destroyed by feedback. I have a few ideas on how that could be done, but then again they might be wrong. but anyway Kurgesagt keep up the good work and the science.", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T14:24:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liberty", "comment_text": "suppose you are very far from the start of the wormhole, If the start of the worm hole connects to a wifi modem and the end connects to you holding a cellphone would it connect or not?  <b>hmmmmmmm</b>", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T08:46:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "tristan molejon", "comment_text": "blackhole spins super fast it will turn into wormhole am i rigth??<br>i am a kid", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T04:35:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saiara Sajita Sajid", "comment_text": "The background music is distracting", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T23:33:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jutaan Unboxing", "comment_text": "Love the music", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T21:58:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "twisterslade -.-", "comment_text": "i learn alot from you", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T21:02:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "random user", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P6rdqiybaw&amp;t=1m12s\">1:12</a> that cube is trippie", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T11:36:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yaume Lepire", "comment_text": "Fun fact: &quot;Wormhole&quot; in French is &quot;Trou de verre&quot;, literally &quot;Glass hole&quot;.

ACCORDINGLY, the known mathematical unification of Einstein&#39;s equations AND Maxwell&#39;s equations (given the addition of A FOURTH SPATIAL DIMENSION) is proven and explained. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.

Indeed, the ability of thought to describe OR reconfigure sensory experience is ULTIMATELY dependent upon the extent to which THOUGHT IS SIMILAR TO sensory experience. Time DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, AS E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma. It is ALL CLEARLY proven. In fact, I have also clarified, clearly identified, and corrected the limited notion of curved &quot;SPACE&quot;. MY UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS SURPASSES ALL OTHERS. E=mc2 IS F=ma. A galaxy is basically FLAT. Think !!! GREAT. Notice the black space of what is THE EYE as well. It ALL makes perfect sense. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The Sun AND the Earth are F=ma AND E=mc2, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. GREAT !!! LOOK at what is the BLUE SKY. The EARTH is ALSO blue. NOW, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.

&quot;prove empirically that Allah exists.&quot;<br><br>Answer:<br>One logical assumption refutes the whole basis modern atheism exists, that&#39;s Allah simply doesn&#39;t want to show himself.<br>Allah is testing people to see who will believe and who will disbelieve if he showed himself or his angels test will not exist.<br><br>[He] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving - 67:2<br><br>Analogy:<br> just think about modern academia, the whole basis of academia relies on giving different kinds of tests to the students, if professors, teacher assistants, and lecturers give answers to people, academia and education will fall apart altogether.<br><br>Similarly, this world also consists of a collection of tests, the final test is whether you believed or not, worked well for the hereafter or not.<br>If Allah did anything to break the test, the whole universe and everything in it will be meaningless.<br><br>2- Iblis prevent people from reaching that logical assumption.<br><br>Answer:<br>Iblis the master of trickery has managed to blindfold everyone from reaching one simple conclusion, now that you have with you, what makes you think that he hasn&#39;t done even much worse than that?<br><br>If your mind couldn&#39;t conclude such a simple thing, can you trust your judgment on Allah and his messenger?<br><br>What I&#39;m trying to say is that, through different methods and resources, Iblis managed to make Islam the worst religion ever to most people.<br><br>Honestly, his work is in turning people away from Islam is very clear, yet, he managed to <del>unfortunately</del> disable people&#39;s minds.<br><br>[Satan] said, &quot;Because You have put me in error, I will surely sit in wait for them on Your straight path.<br>Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and their left, and You will not find most of them grateful [to You].&quot;<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P6rdqiybaw&amp;t=7m16s\">7:16</a>-17<br><br>3- Making fun and mocking Allah and his messenger.<br><br>Answer:<br>These days people tell you: &quot;Allah is evil&quot; &quot;Islam is evil&quot; etc...<br>but in reality, these people used the strawman fallacy; as they build a fake version of Islam then refute it, resulting in a fake intellectual win.<br><br>Similar to the first problem, people don&#39;t realize that Islam needs a context for the many <del>seemingly</del> violent verses and hadiths, such as:<br><br><del>The life of Prophet Muhammed -SAW</del><br>Allah revealed the Quran and Sunnah gradually, and everything that happened during the revelation was recorded by the companions, so the context of the Quran and Sunnah not only rely on verses and hadiths, but also on the historical records of everything that happened during it.<br><br>-The life of companions and pretty much everything that happened in the 1st century of Islam.<br><br>-Arabic linguistics.<br><br>-How it&#39;s appropriately practiced.<br><br>This one is very important, because Islam focuses more on practice than fake hypocrite utopic decorative theoretical speech, so the understanding of texts as a whole can&#39;t happen without this one.<br><br>-Rules and guidelines of interpretation set by Islamic scholars both old and modern ones.<br><br>-What scholars wrote about Islam.<br><br>This may seem like a lot of intellectual products to read, but, if you understood Islam the way Muslims do, you won&#39;t find evil, violence, and anything bad.<br>Instead, you&#39;ll find wisdom, justice, and truth.<br><br>Don&#39;t be Iblis&#39; toy, wake up and enlighten yourself, don&#39;t let this world deceive you with its temporary shallow beauty.<br><br>And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, [its being but] the splendor of worldly life by which We test them.

Surely even complex natural phenomenon could create it but it would never function the way you would think.  Things that go into the worm hole, that is a 3-d spiral structure would be destroyed, absorbed, or distorted.

Normally, you can determine the amount of charge inside a box based on the surface integral of the electric field of it dotted with the normal vector to the surface, integrated over the whole surface. But if that box contains a wormhole, that is no longer true, you could have no net charge going into or out of the box, yet the surface integral of its electric field would change, because electric field lines could disappear into the wormhole, and the box would seem to contain a variable amount of charge in it as a charge gets further into the wormhole or further out of it. You always get contradictions when you try to come up with a generating function, with level curves, a requirement for a vector field to be conservative.

Since Nmatter is like matter but repels matter, then it is attracted to itself. This means that with enough Nmatter you would get an Nmatter black hole, a black hole where light would be repelled away from the event horizon. A shiny hole.<br>   This disproves string theory, as a theoretical Electromagnetic wave particle heading directly towards the shiny hole would inevitably stop, therefore slowing down past the speed of light (which is impossible). The only reason that this may not happen is through quantum tunneling, which I don&#39;t understand enough to see why that would be a possibility.<br>   Ok. Lets say that that proton will tunnel as soon as it hits the event horizon.<br>   Now,  A regular black hole to Nmatter would be like a shiny hole to regular matter. Because white holes do not exist in this universe, they would not exist in a parallel. This would mean that a black hole does not send matter to another universe, instead it keeps it in our own. But, to the parallel universe, it would be a shiny hole. <br>   Using this logic our universe has a parallel universe that, as mentioned in the video,  has reverse time and is essentially the same as our universe but in reverse. Every black hole we have is a shiny hole it would have. As our universe expands the parallel universe shrinks. Our universe will expand into heat death or otherwise, and will eventually reverse in an infinitival long time when the parallel universe becomes condensed enough to eventually have a big bang. Then, our universe will begin to shrink.<br>    A wave function!

So, the reason why quantum fluctuations are possible is because matter and antimatter are made in pairs, so the sum of their mass is 0, meaning that they do not violate the law of conservation of energy.<br>I&#39;ll move on to something else now, but remember that, as it will be relevant again later.<br>The reason light is able to move att the speed of...light...is because it has no mass. As something approaches the speed of light, its mass multiplies (this is too complicated to explain at the moment, just trust me), making it harder and harder to accelerate the object. The energy necessary to accelerate anything with mass to the speed of light is infinite, because the mass of it approaches infinity as it approaches the speed of light. Ergo, the only way to move as fast as light is to be massless.<br>Now, going back to the previous statement: matter-antimatter pairs of equivalent mass have a total mass of 0.

The other possibility is the massive pressure difference would destroy the wormhole itself, but likely not before doing significant damage to what&#39;s around it. You&#39;d have to have both ends in different parts of deep space where they can do no harm to what&#39;s around them. So you&#39;d have to have one end in space orbiting Earth and then put the other end in space orbiting another planet, and then fly to them via spacecraft. Even having both ends on Earth is dangerous because different places will have different levels of pressure. Somewhere at sea level would have more than somewhere on a mountain a thousand feet above.

There\u2019s a concept here, a rule, that we don\u2019t know about it seems. I\u2019ve got my own little theory which I slowly add to overtime.<br><br>Imagine a 2D space grid. There are 2 lines on it. It doesn\u2019t matter where they are. From a 2D perspective, they\u2019re the same length. However, one is actually longer than the other. Why is that? What appears to move \u201cSlower\u201d along that line, is actually travelling a greater distance. This is where time starts to change.<br><br>I\u2019ve read that Hawking believed that if a man was headed towards a black hole, we would see a certain \u201cspaghetification\u201d. Distance is not the same and time appears to slow down the closer he gets. The real question here is: Is the man really stretching? There\u2019s visually and there\u2019s physically. Mixing both together is a mistake.<br><br>Imagine that you\u2019re shining a giant fecking laser towards the right side of the sun. Let\u2019s just pretend that you can see the laser wherever it goes for the sake of this example, it would appear to curve somewhat around the sun, correct? Physically speaking, what\u2019s happening? There\u2019s a stretch somewhere, but it cannot happen for free. Where there\u2019s a stretch, there should be negative mass. In this case, they happen around gravity. Where there is gravity, there seems to be radiation. Could radiation be some form of negative mass?<br><br>I\u2019ll leave it to you to fill in the gaps, there\u2019s a lot I\u2019m not explaining here as it would take forever.

The idea is something like this:<br><br>A wormhole pair is created in orbit of Jupiter. For all intents and purposes, they are pretty much next to each other. One mouth is affixed to a starship. The starship goes in a big 500 lightyear (ly) loop, accelerating hard until it&#39;s moving a large percentage of the speed of light. Eventually, the ship arrives back at Jupiter. Due to relativistic effects, the journey the moving wormhole mouth seemed much shorter. So even though 80 some years has passed for one end of the wormhole, the solar system has aged some 500 years. The idea is, if it were the year 2300 when the starship left, you could wait until 2380, the amount of time felt by the starship until it arrived back at Jupiter in the future, then travel to the year 2500.

So alien invaders or visitors might just be the simulated manifestation of a &quot;simulation technician&quot; using special rules to traverse the simulated space time for observation. Thoughts?

Immagine having an object with infinite mass that has so much gravitational potential energy, dropping something could be a way to get energy for us, and if we put a wormhole we can get infinite. So in order for a wormhole to keep entropy equal or higher it would mean that it requires infinite energy to exist or to make something pass trough it, since it should be like that even if we have an infinite massive object or infinite distance from the mass and the dropped object, wich means infinite potential energy. By saying infinite i&#39;m saying that it should not break reality with any given number of finite energy, so for E-&gt;infinite.<br>What i&#39;m thinking is having a universe in 4 or more spatial dimension built like a sphere, an onion, and if you can get to the inner layer you can travel a shorter distance to get to the same place, like taking the inner trajectory of a corner in a race makes you reach the goal faster than taking the outer corner. And the fact that you can come out 100km in the sky and aquire E-&gt;infinite energy, we can say that the fundamental forces that have definable potential energy like gravity and electromagnetism also travel trough dimensions, so getting to the other layer means that you still are being pulled to the centre of the earth, so you have to spend energy to escape the gravitational pull, and even if you can escape it with less effort than in our layer, becouse you have to travel less distance, the energy required to move or stay in the other layer makes the overall entropy higher. ???????", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T20:26:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wiredhand3755", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P6rdqiybaw&amp;t=4m30s\">4:30</a> possible goatse reference?", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T20:25:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Ricardo", "comment_text": "good music and visuals", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T20:25:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bushki", "comment_text": "i love how science is just an idea, that we can prove by doing the same thing and getting expected result....until another idea comes along thats better.....we will look back at these types of videos in years and say &quot;cant believe we all thought that&quot;....its probably fair to say that each person watching this video is more knowledgeable about our universe than 99% of humanity was 200 years ago", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T20:25:22Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Alisha B", "comment_text": "&quot;If you go into a black hole you won&#39;t become the stuff coming out of the white hole.

I&#39;ve heard that you can only see back into time and not interact with it and with wormholes there wouldn&#39;t even be any time dilation to begin with since the negative mass negates the gravity, thus keeping the funky time dilation black holes have from coming about. But then there are some who say that it will cause time paradoxes and time travel but we don&#39;t see or hear from time travelers. In my readings of wormholes, it said that after passing or something that the light from that point in time would reach you and thus you would see your past self passing through from like the sides of the wormhole where everything looks twisted and distorted.

We will never do anything with it, no matter how many thousands of years our civilization survives.  Think of the technological advancements in the last 100 years.  We built a bunch of machines that run on oil and electricity.  We did some neat stuff with medicine, biology and computing.  Nothing game changing, just things that make some humans healthier and richer.<br><br>That said, I&#39;d like to see videos on solving climate change.  For 15 years climate change and the impending collapse of civilization have been on my mind.  Every new report says ecological collapse is coming sooner than the last.  We only create more emissions every year--our foot is on the accelerator.  I have been looking for any sign that we will solve this, and have found none.  It seems everyone is just expecting any day now that some super scientist in their garage to invent a device that fixes everything.<br><br>In the years I&#39;ve looked for solutions to climate change, the only thing that seems even remotely viable is reforestation on a massive global scale.  It would require every nation to work together, which would first require money and concentrated power to be defeated by the people, which itself is a lofty fantasy.  We would, second, need to harness a nearly limitless amount of energy without creating emissions.  Then every military would have to deploy full-force into irrigation, fertilization and planting projects.  Would it even be enough?  Would we not just do more ecological damage in the process?  Would we first need to perfect genetic engineering to make plants with even a slim chance at reforesting places like the Sahara?  Do we dredge the sea floor for soil to pour on our rocky lands?  Or do we plant sea grasses with submerged grow lights?<br><br>These challenges--I think we stand no chance of even scratching them.  I am almost 30 and expecting the end of civilization in my lifetime.  First the vast numbers of climate refugees will be used by fascists to stoke fear and grasp power.  Then ruthless civil wars for clean water, bullets, canned food and seeds.  Devastating summers and winters that destroy crops and create incredible famine.<br><br>So if you&#39;ve got any information I&#39;ve missed to convince me that this isn&#39;t guaranteed to happen, lemme know", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T15:29:46Z", "likes_count": 37}, {"comment_by": "David Akinmade", "comment_text": "Actual Title:<br>Kurzgesagt ft.

Is it a small positive mass from Higgs but lots of negative energy to cancel it out?

Decreasing the volume of an object does not warp spacetime any differently. If you were to crush the sun to the size of Mercury, but keep its mass constant, spacetime wouldn\u2019t change, so the planets\u2019 orbits would be unchanged. What decreasing volume DOES do is allow objects, like a rogue asteroid to get closer to the sun. Based on the gravitational force equation (F=G*m1*m2/r^2), the closer you get to the center of an object, the stronger gravity gets.
