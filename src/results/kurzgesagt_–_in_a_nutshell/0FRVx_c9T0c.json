[{"comment_by": "Kurzgesagt \u2013 In a Nutshell", "comment_text": "To preorder IMMUNE click here: <a href=\"https://kgs.link/ImmuneBook\">https://kgs.link/ImmuneBook</a> \u2013 Its available in English and German and on amazon it should be available in pretty much all countries too.<br>Ohai! I\u2019m Philipp, the founder and head writer of Kurzgesagt and author of IMMUNE! Let me say a few words about it: IMMUNE is older than Kurzgesagt and I began working on it about a decade ago in university. The idea was to explore a super important but also extremely misunderstood and complicated topic and \u201ctranslate\u201d it into a language everybody could understand. I\u2019ve done my best to basically write a super long Kurzgesagt video but with less of the limitations of a ten minute video.<br>IMMUNE is a fascinating and fun journey through your own body, together we\u2019ll be exploring mystery organs, murder universities, your enemies from viruses, bacteria and cancer (and how your immune system might have killed a cancer cell while you were reading the last few sentences) and the incredibly beautiful and amazing parts, cells and systems that keep you alive. After reading it you should not only gain a new appreciation for your own body but also experience disease differently. A flu or something more serious will not be this abstract thing but something you can sort of witness and imagine which mechanisms are active and which cells are doing what. At least personally, knowing how the immune system works always has given me great comfort when I felt unwell. Also 45 illustrated pages by the Kurzgesagt team make the book very pretty.<br>Preorders are incredibly important in the world of books so if you are considering getting it, it would mean a lot if you could do that. Because preorders determine if a publisher will try to get the book into bookstores, so a lot of the book\u2019s success depends on it.<br>I\u2019m incredibly grateful that so many of you have watched these videos in the last few years. And I hope you will give my first book a chance too. \u2013 Philipp", "comment_date": "2021-09-28T13:13:14Z", "likes_count": 2885}, {"comment_by": "Karima H", "comment_text": "I have my own copy so I can follow along!", "comment_date": "2022-09-02T06:38:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "doonsMonk", "comment_text": "Hi @Kurzgesagt  I wateched this video and also read the Immune book.

There are a lot of things that can and do go wrong in the body, and I think that people would like to understand the what and why of these processes so to make judgements based on accurate information.<br><br>For example, I possess ADHD. How does the human attention system work, and how does ADHD differ from this system? A lot of people notice that ADHD, Dyslexia/Dyscalculia/Dysgraphia, Non-verbal Learning Disorder, Major and Minor Depression, Autism, and Anxiety seem interrelated. How can such discrete conditions be so interrelated? Many people disbelieve in learning disorders, or treat learning disorders as a kind of a chronically bad choice may by the disabled. Others claim that learning disorders should qualify a person for disability benefits because of the learning disabled&#39;s difficulty in achieving the ability to thrive as an adult. Which is right?<br><br>This is not even getting into gender identity and human sexuality. In the first days of life, an embryo doesn&#39;t have a gender. It has blueprints that specify a gender, and so it tries to follow those blueprints. But gender is a complicated thing. It takes a cascade of hormones to turn an embryo female. It takes an entirely separate cascade of hormones as an interrupt to the first cascade to make a male. It is conceivable that an error-of-sequence can create someone borne as one sex liking the same sex, or separately, identifying as the opposite sex.<br><br>But then, it is plausible that a combination of social and mental factors, too many and to society-dependent to list, that yield the same result. Which is right? Are both right? I can&#39;t tell, that&#39;s why I ask. As a voter I&#39;m called to make policy, in my small but real fraction of the franchise. To make that policy I need to understand what I&#39;m trying to judge, or else I&#39;m likely to hurt someone trying to follow my gut instinct.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry to take up your time, thank you again for your wonderful body of work.
