The First possibility-(Answer #1) We are alone <br>and we are the only life in the entire universe/multiverse. (I&#39;m sure <br>this hypothesis makes Bible-thumpers, narcissists who are threatened <br>with the idea that they we are not the only game in town, and people <br>with fragile egos very happy. Your Welcome!!) (Answer #2) We are not <br>alone and there is plenty of intelligent life in the universe, but this <br>intelligence in particular, is no better than human intelligence. <br>Unfortunately, our type of intelligence might be the pinnacle form of <br>intelligence in the entire universe. (That is a scary thought, maybe <br>even worse than the thought of us being alone!!)Thus, just like for <br>humans, interstellar travel is also too &quot;hard&quot; for all other lifeforms <br>as well. Just like with humans they also suffer from corrupt leadership,<br> and just like us they also don&#39;t have the collective will to overcome a<br> myriad of personality disorders that stifle advancement and will <br>eventually be their undoing. Furthermore, we have yet to figure out how <br>to travel anywhere close to a decent percentage of the speed of <br>light.(Not that the &quot;powers that be&quot; plan on putting necessary resources<br> towards cracking that code anytime soon.) So what makes anyone think <br>that any other human like intelligent species can pull off what us <br>humans probably never will? (Wishful thinking much? We are talking about<br> humans here! We can&#39;t even agree on global warming let alone invest in <br>the long term survival of our species!) (Answer #3) Super-intelligent <br>alien life does exist but they have not visited us yet. Why? Because we <br>are beneath them. If I was a super-intelligent alien I would not visit <br>us either because we are soooo basic. When is the last time you rolled <br>out the red carpet for the flies that infested your outdoor garbage can?<br> From the perspective of advanced life, we humans are just too basic. <br>They have seen our kind all over the universe many times before and they<br> are just not that impressed. (Answer #4) We are not alone, and the <br>universe is teaming with life! Unfortunately that life is nowhere near <br>as intelligent as humans are (Again, a very disturbing thought!!) The <br>vast majority of alien life is probably microbial, or in the best case <br>scenario, no more intelligent than dolphins, apes, crows, dogs, cats, <br>octopus, etc. If this is indeed the case, then that, in my opinion, <br>WOULD BE AWESOME!! Relatively dim-witted space creatures for the win!!  <br>This would mean that human-like higher intelligence is soooo freaking <br>rare that we are literally the only beings who have it in the entire <br>universe. (That would be a sad commentary indeed!!) Too bad our <br>incompetent species will never get a chance to travel beyond our solar <br>system and see any of these cool relativity dim-witted space creatures <br>due to our species collective self destructive tendencies. :(", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T03:24:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anne Swag", "comment_text": "This makes me want to kill myself", "comment_date": "2022-05-11T16:25:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silent Tomato", "comment_text": "Kurz : r we gonna be destroyed ?

We know for sure that there was no civilisation on earth before us which would have destroyed itself with nuclear weapons, otherwise archeologists would have discovered it long ago. Which means, even if we manage to destroy ourselves with nukes, and even if every single human dies, there are still 0 chances that all life including bacteria will be destroyed. And sooner or later it will evolve to a similar state to ours, but this time it will be prepared: it will know what mistakes we made by examining our remains. Of course, there are other obstacles on the way, let&#39;s say the new civilisation gets wiped out by a giant meteorite, and by the time life evolves again, our sun explodes. But that doesn&#39;t mean it happens to every single planet out there. If life exists on millions of planets, thousands should be able to suvive. What I think is more probable is that, considering the amount of time required for life to evolve, the window of opportunity for contact is so small, that different civilisations never match in time. Either that, or interstellar travel the way we imagine it is impossible entirely, we just don&#39;t know it yet.<br>Speaking of interstellar travel, if the scale of things is so enormous that traveling to another star with the current tech would take millions of years, I wonder why do we even bother thinking about sending humans?

A little math and common sense suggests its whole premise is invalid and in fact, the exact opposite must be true.<br><br>The odds of us finding an alien species are akin to the odds that two microbes on specks of sand at opposite ends of the Sahara Desert will ever cross paths.  Actually, given the true scale of the universe, the microbes have a better chance than we do.<br><br>And that\u2019s only considering the physical size of the cosmos.  Then there\u2019s the time scale.  Once you try to grasp just how staggeringly long \u201cbillions of years\u201d really is, you quickly realize It\u2019s more likely that countless advanced civilizations have risen and fallen across space long before we ever first scratched on a cave wall.  And it\u2019s equally likely that countless more will spring up long after we\u2019re gone.<br><br>Fermi\u2019s Paradox is rooted in a basic inability of the human mind to properly comprehend the sheer size and age of the universe.  Seen from that scale, we are much smaller than the microbes on a single speck of desert sand, and the entire history of our existence spans less time than it takes the universe to blink.<br><br>There could be cosmically-visual evidence of star-spanning aliens right this second on the other side of the Milky Way.  If so, our most powerful telescopes won&#39;t be able to see that evidence for another 100,000 years!  And of course by then, both the aliens and us could easily be extinct.  Let&#39;s not even begin to think about what hyper-advanced alien civilizations existed 10 million, 100 million years, or 1 billion years ago that we&#39;ll have no way to ever know about.<br><br>It&#39;s pretty much mathematically impossible that we&#39;re the &quot;first&quot; or &quot;unique&quot; among developed alien life in the universe.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s equally mathematically impossible that we&#39;ll ever co-exist close enough in time and space to see, hear, or otherwise communicate with them in anyway.  In that sense, for all intents and purposes, we are in all probability &quot;alone&quot; in the universe (so we&#39;d better figure out how to get our species right).  A bit of a bummer I admit, until you remember that human beings are pretty damn incredible all by themselves.  And THAT\u2019s the actual answer.

Fermi states a FACT.. (If)There ARE 11 million intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way, why cant we detect them. The answer cannot be..they are dead. WHY.. because the statement of fact in the question has them alive. Fermi successfully predicted the number of Chimney Sweepers by knowing the  number of chimneys needed sweeping .. ignoring stupid non-facts like the number of chimneys NOT in existence or the number of Chimney Sweepers who died years ago. If you take a disk 100,000 LYRs wide by 10,000 LYRS high and RANDOMLY spread 11 million ALIVE civilizations inside it.. there is NO way any single civilization doesnt know of at least 3 others, the average number being around 6 civilizations known.

This is the only thing that we know that may be used instant messaging from all around universe (well some relays stations needed to the more distant parts). And these messages are completely secure (as far as we know). Think about sending any electromagnetic wave message to Sun, it takes over 8 mins, to the nearest star it takes 4 years, on the other side of Milkyway it takes 100 000 years and so on. Instant messaging is needed to get reasonable communication. Because entangled particles may disrupt atoms and may even cause larger harm, over wast distances, then it is likely that intelligent species are controlling the usage. So we just need to find if any historically entangled particles could be found and if they are connected to the universal communication grid. This may lead to the communications with intelligent species around the entire universe.<br><br>At this point we have also reached a technological limit that allows us to join other intelligent species.

Team; y\u2019all are awesome with how you make these ideas so easily accessible and your adorable animations!! \ud83e\udd29) ...<br><br><br><br>Many people in spiritual circles will be the first to tell you that the next Great Awakening is coming. The Age of Aquarius. Religion, spirituality, politics, culture, metaphysics, science fiction...they\u2019re all more entertained than initially thought. Everything in the universe is relative, we are all relative to one another, whether we like it or not. <br><br>We can try to classify ourselves with economic classes or national borders, but whether we like it or not, we are all just one living beating human race. We\u2019re all like blood vessels and this earth we inhabit, this rock we call home is the organ we give life to. The earth, Mother Gaia if you will, gives us existence and resources and sustenance, in return we give her a purpose for existing. <br><br>So hypothetically, if an alien race were to use our planet for resources, it\u2019d be pointless for them to kill us squirrels. It\u2019s always been my belief that culture and technological advancement are contingent on one another. Great power is only awarded with great responsibility (and whatnot :).\u00a0<br><br>A caveman is brutal and easily kills his fellow caveman for meat, resources, shelter. Yet he\u2019s just caveman. He can\u2019t do much harm. The most vile creatures will always be countered by either fate or another equal power, in my opinion.\u00a0<br><br>Or, I\u2019m not a heavy history buff but the Renaissance. everyone knows about that era of human history. Wasn\u2019t it like a time marked by **both great cultural and technological advancement? Or better yet the second half of the 20th century? It was an era that saw leaps in both our understanding of space, technology, nuclear weaponry, and human rights. Carl Sagan, Nelson Mandela, the bombing of Hiroshima, Malcom X, Stonewall, Reagan, Hitler, Bob Ross, RBG, Marsha P Johnson etc etc. The list goes on. I\u2019m not saying these people/events are good or bad, but I mention them because they represent the great leaps in our understanding of both theoretical thought and humanity in the last 50 years only. Gorbachev, Princess Diana, Mother Teresa, the Popes...the Beatles, Queen, Jane Goodall, Ellen, 9/11, Pixar movies, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the DMZ between the two Koreas etc etc etc.\u00a0<br><br>Culture is contingent on politics, politics on technological advancement, technological advancement dependent on the growth of humanity.\u00a0Once we realize that all these things are and will always be relative, then that can probably assuage everyone\u2019s squirrel fears in this little comments section.\u00a0 We, humans, created the deadliest most devastating nuclear weapons once, dropped it twice and by some miracle in the heavens,,have not used them since. We, collectively, as a human race are terrified of the devastation it could bring. And that\u2019s the beauty of evolution. As we all collectively grow smarter, we inevitably grow more sentient. The two forces work in beautiful tandem. imagine, hypothetically of course, if cavemen had access to nuclear weaponry..hehe lol. <br><br>And now back to aliens...the stars of everything right now at the moment. I personally searched up this video because I did spot a ufo a few weeks ago. but that\u2019s besides the point. <br><br>Aliens. If there even was such a powerful enough civilization, strong enough to wipe us clean, you don\u2019t think they\u2019d be a bit more sentient themselves? Culture and advancement are dependent on one another. The two facets of society also probably love each one another a lot too. They build off the other. Feminine and masculine energies. Yin and yang. Art,beauty,family,love,aesthetics + advancement,technology,politics,work,practicality. They balance each other out, perhaps this is a universal sentiment all across the universe...it\u2019s the most fundamental sentiment there is in my opinion. <br><br>So, if there was a higher, as you put it, a more \u201cadvanced\u201d civilization out there...aliens. Do you guys really think they\u2019d be mindless brutes...hell if they wanted to use our resources on here wouldn\u2019t they have done so by now? If they had the power to wipe us out easily, they also have the power to infiltrate our society, meet our puppies, watch our sunsets, meet our children, learn our culture, learn our hopes, dreams, fears and wishes....and as any advanced society would know, a clear conscience probably weighs much more than a couple of logs and an ocean lol. <br><br>I\u2019m optimistic. I think we underestimate higher life forms, if they even do exist. And ~~hypothetically~~ let\u2019s just say a higher alien force just one day said \u201cscrew it, we need those forests and also their sun\u201d, well it\u2019s not like we would know and its not like we\u2019d even be able to stop them anyways (not trying to sound morbid but its the honest truth). Or An asteroid could hit us, the sun could explode, the rain could endlessly pour from the sky like in the biblical times... it\u2019s why regardless, we should never ever ever take a single day for granted. The pandemic taught all of us that too. The probability of Yellowstone erupting and instantaneously destroying all life within the US is just as likely as \u2014god forbid\u2014a family member of mine getting into a car accident. Dear Lord what a thought. So whether aliens get bored with us and just instantly wipe us out, or some other awful disaster occurs, we must always remember these proverbs, found and reiterated in nearly every single ancient text and every white mom\u2019s home goods wall plate and those are<br><br>Always be grateful and never take what you have for granted, <br>Carry with you pure intentions in your heart,<br>Love and light above all else,<br>The universe is not chaos; take care to trust in God/allah/buddah/source,,,but always trust that there is something higher out there,<br>And because you followed that last step, now you can have faith in knowing that everything in life will always be balanced out and everything will always work out for the highest good of all. Do not worry about anything.

This man named Dr Steven Greer has a lot of proof about technology he even has pictures of aliens or extraterrestrials he has even summoned them as well with video proof and it is repeatable he has been doing this for a long time no one believed him until now but during that time no one believed him he kept disproving them this guy even had a near-death experience he had experienced an elevated consciousness which in turn brought a lot of knowledge to him and connections to the other side as well so the Fermi paradox is 50 years old and it is outdated same with the concept smoking cigarettes was healthy 50 60 years ago.", "comment_date": "2021-08-14T03:11:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Davies", "comment_text": "I love these videos \ud83e\udd29", "comment_date": "2021-08-14T01:37:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charles Meyrick", "comment_text": "whoever is animating these is a delightful geek and I enjoy the Easter eggs they pop into their illustrations", "comment_date": "2021-08-13T23:08:22Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "kitti pron", "comment_text": "Wow Mass Effect !!", "comment_date": "2021-08-13T20:55:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "noliecannoli", "comment_text": "shout out to the advanced civilization made of Mews.", "comment_date": "2021-08-13T18:31:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ngoe nhok", "comment_text": "I found a Mew in one of the aliens", "comment_date": "2021-08-13T17:20:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harrison Lingo", "comment_text": "I love all the sci-fi references in the animations!

Like you had one video where you just make the assumption that any intelligent species won\u2019t want to libe alongside nature, and i spat my drink out when you said that. Why? Why do you assume that. That isn\u2019t just arrogant as human beings, it\u2019s a very western centric point of view. As a history major, I can say it wouod be difficult to imagine what our world would look like if the Ottoman Empire or China had industrialized before Great Britain. Like, there are many civilizations, including ones that spent time as powerful hubs of our world, that were much more focused on living alongside nature as we are. In fact, how about this arrogant assumption : What is the whole constant struggle we should dominate our environment is a less intelligent way of thinking. What if every species that passes a certain threshold stops seeking to dominate other life forms, and we just haven\u2019t advanced enough to realize that? What if aggressive natural resource destroying intelligent life is what is rare and not intelligent life in and of itself. Anyways, I an not just saying yhis randomly. I\u2019ve read theories like those above that you just choose to conveniently ignore as I guess it doesn\u2019t represent your ideas of human nature. Well I disagfee witg your ideas of human nature, I think as we face our own extinction in the next few hundred years we will realize we are doing it wrong. I thinj the survivirs of capitalism (a doomed system) will realize that endless profit is not the way to encourage life. I think eventually another part of human nature will win out. Compassion. Love. Living alongside our fellow animals and plants in this ecosystem called Earth. I think by the time we start colonizing say Venus or Mars, we wioo have already outgrown the capitalist ideals of domination and constant struggle that currently dominate our political discourse.

The universe is very old and yes, we might have missed out on trillions of life forms already.

Or in other words, if we left to some interesting-looking planet today (devoid of life) it might have an intelligent society by the time we arrive. Besides all that: someone needs to be the first intelligent lifeform. Even if it&#39;s very unlikely to be us, it might be us. <br><br>In that case, we are all alone.

In which trillions of intelligent societies might come into existence. <br><br>I&#39;m choosing to believe that we have reached peak technological prowess already, and humanity (or what remains of it) is actually tens of thousands of years more advanced than the time we currently &quot;live&quot; in. We are just in a simulation of our own choosing. Each and every one of us is part of a simulation that has a limited set of rules. Many trillions of humans choose to live entire lives in different times.

If you lived a bad life, then you were damned to be locked away from the remainder of the universe until your time has passed, hence Earth. Look at the facts, we are on a small rock in the middle of a void with no connection with the rest of the universe. There are rapists, murderers, wars, and we have to work for the rest of our lives until we die. We truly are living in hell. Earth is where souls get sent to be punished.<br><br>Considering that Earth has been around for 14 billion years, humans have only been around for roughly 200,000 years. Who&#39;s to say that intelligent extraterrestrial life didn&#39;t come to Earth 60 million years ago? They probably did, saw dinosaurs and deemed our planet unintelligent. Or what if they came a billion years ago and saw baron wasteland. The point is, they would have had to come at the exact moment in time that intelligent life was habiting the planet. Keep in mind that we didnt start using radio signals until 98 years ago. So 98 years out of 14 billion years is a slim chance.

In stargate you have ancients, beings composed of energy, that exist beyond our reality of existence, they live within the Universe but rarely are seen by anyone, and seldom interfere in the lives of beings within the universe. Now imagine, for these beings to communicate, they can send messages however humans would simply dismiss them as anomalies, they can take a physical host and speak through that host that acts as a receiver, but humans would just call them crazy. If shown amazing this by this individual, first they would be amazed, but then once explained they would call it science and simply dismiss it until they were given something that they could not or would not understand. Humans would perceive all communications and interactions from such creates as magic, when in reality it is our crude understanding of the universe, that limits our scope of understand what is possible versus what isn&#39;t.", "comment_date": "2020-05-15T06:14:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bina Shah", "comment_text": "no you are not the only one searching for existential dread in 2020!!", "comment_date": "2020-05-15T04:59:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "San Sng", "comment_text": "We might survive if donald trump is not president", "comment_date": "2020-05-15T01:27:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phillip Yarosh", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=1m52s\">1:52</a> mew.", "comment_date": "2020-05-15T01:22:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leszek Szpunar", "comment_text": "I love ftl reference and the kestrel ship :D", "comment_date": "2020-05-14T22:13:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roumen Popov", "comment_text": "ha ha, Loved the Star Control 2 reference about the self-replicating probes with just 4 instructions :D", "comment_date": "2020-05-14T18:44:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Randy Marsh", "comment_text": "South Park has had it right all along.

It would absolutely be what hyper-intelligent beings would do. Why allow such horrible things like depression, sorrow, pain, anger, regret, and boredom consume your life? Just upload your consciousness to your very own heaven, and exist in a constant state of bliss until the power source dies, and/or your consciousness is transported to a new star. Of course, this would require a civilization that has moved passed wars and prejudice, since such a fragile system would leave untold numbers of beings vulnerable to outside influence.<br><br>Nier: Automata actually tackled this as the possibility for humanity&#39;s future. During a prolonged alien invasion on Earth, all of mankind was wiped out. The last remaining humans uploaded their consciousnesses, along with all of the knowledge their species had accumulated over its entire existence, to a massive hard drive on the moon. Back on Earth, self-sufficient androids that were created to defeat the alien invaders and their armies of machines were left without purpose, after the aliens finally left. After humanity&#39;s extinction, the android leaders decided to formulate a lie that humans were alive and well on the moon, awaiting the war&#39;s end. This was done to give the androids a purpose, in spite of their creators leaving them behind. This begs the philosophical question of what it actually means to be &quot;alive&quot;.<br><br>The androids were designed by humans to simulate their behaviors and emotions. As time went on, the androids&#39; AI became more and more complex. They were evolving. The same happened with the machines the aliens left behind. They gained consciousness, becoming sentient beings. They developed feelings, personalities, attachments, faiths, and fears. One of the game&#39;s endings took it a step further and had one of the android characters send their consciousness to the same &quot;hard drive&quot; holding the souls of all of humanity.<br><br>This all may sound far-fetched, but imagine if we actually managed to create AI that could learn and adapt without limitations.

The fermi paradox has two assumptions: (1) alien life exists, and (2) if it exists, we&#39;ll know.  This contradicts the fact that there is no alien life that we are aware of.  There are a lot of theories going around trying to explain how alien life exists without us knowing about it, but no one wants to address the first assumption.  Those who support the idea that alien life exists want to believe it because they&#39;ve already decided that the evolution of life must be so common that it must be happening everywhere, constantly.  Their entire worldview is built on that assumption, and they absolutely need it to be true in order to save their worldview.", "comment_date": "2020-03-07T01:29:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blind Liberty", "comment_text": "&quot;What is my name?&quot;<br>&quot;Uh... little green?<br>&quot;No, my name is Dende.&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-03-06T15:16:21Z", "likes_count": 129}, {"comment_by": "Ultra_Legion", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=3m15s\">3:15</a> another mass effect reference XD", "comment_date": "2020-03-06T07:45:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "abhilash jain", "comment_text": "I will die for that squirrel", "comment_date": "2020-03-06T06:44:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Neonic Plays", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=4m32s\">4:32</a> and then there\u2019s people who think that in 10 years regular pc sized quantum computers can do that", "comment_date": "2020-03-06T05:37:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leksi Kush", "comment_text": "what if every soul on earth said om at the same time. would that frequency reach life elsewhere? lol", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T23:19:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rudimentary Schooling", "comment_text": "What if we already live in a type of matrioshka brain and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t see any", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T22:34:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian Moore", "comment_text": ".... . .-.. .-.. - - - ..- -..<br>HELLO?", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T21:38:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aguagcat", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=5m07s\">5:07</a> dendeee", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T18:43:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ranjeeve Beenessreesingh", "comment_text": "am i the only seeing pokemon in the alien depictions?", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T16:14:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ub77c\ud31d", "comment_text": "5\ub144\uc804\uc5d0 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc601\uc0c1\uc774\ub124 \u314b\u314b\u314b<br>\uc544\ub2c8 \uc774\uac8c \ubb50\uc57c \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T12:00:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bup", "comment_text": "Was that dende", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T02:51:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Big Chungus", "comment_text": "Nice command and conquer reference", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T01:56:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trish Bhatia", "comment_text": "Why do we always think that aliens would be more technologically advanced than us?<br><br>Also, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=5m06s\">5:06</a> DENDE", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T00:56:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "beeschorger", "comment_text": "this is why i wish i were born in the future... i will never get to see how cool or awful it will be like", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T00:10:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hayes", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=1m52s\">1:52</a> is that mew from Pok\u00e9mon lol", "comment_date": "2020-03-04T23:40:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "hababa habibi", "comment_text": "mewtwo", "comment_date": "2020-03-04T22:43:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wendolyn Saurio", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=3m14s\">3:14</a> Mass Effect!", "comment_date": "2020-03-04T21:23:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Michael Washington", "comment_text": "I just think we aren&#39;t nearly as fascinating as we think...if a civilization has mastered interstellar travel ...if they have figured out how to not only travel faster than light but produce ships capable of harnessing that power...we would be so beneath them it would be a joke.", "comment_date": "2020-03-04T20:44:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brilliance of lives", "comment_text": "One way to make sure there is no life in the universe is to somehow destroy it.", "comment_date": "2020-03-04T17:59:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "will2see", "comment_text": "The reason why Fermi &quot;paradox&quot;

Now you say: &quot;There are probably 10 000 stars for every grain of sand on Earth, in the observable Universe.&quot; - Please, stop making things up! The original assertion was something like this: There are approx. so many stars in the whole observable Universe as grains of sands on all the beaches of Earth. This is, of course, a very vague assertion too, because what do you consider to be a beach and how deep do you want to dig into? But now, you went to a higher level of absurdity. Now you say that there are 10 000 stars for every grain of sand of the freaking entire Earth!!! Jesus! Enough of this exaggeration! Let&#39;s make a super quick calculation, ok? There&#39;s approx. 2*10^11 galaxies in the observable Universe and there are approx. the same amount of stars in an average galaxy (maybe little less...). That means we are talking about something like 10^22 stars, ok? Now, grains of sand come in different sizes, but somewhere between 0.05mm to 4mm. Converted into volume, this is a pretty big range of volumes!!! So let say that the average size of a sand grain is around 0.5mm. That&#39;s 8 billion of them in a cube meter. Like the actual number of humans on Earth... So you need a cube of approx. 10km in size full of these 0.5mm grains of sand. So we are talking about a 2mm thick layer of sand covering the entire Earth. That&#39;s approx. how many stars are in the entire observable Universe. I think that this is much more exact than talking shit about some 10 000 stars for every grain of sand on Earth...", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T19:01:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "logicOnAbstractions", "comment_text": "&quot; Indigenous life: Mostly Harmless &quot;<br><br>I see what you did there.....", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T18:11:23Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Abe", "comment_text": "what if we are wiped out at first then they planted us then they realized that we are too dumb and abandoned us", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T17:06:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gaurav bora", "comment_text": "i only watch this for the animation.", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T09:49:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hawaii flamethrower You", "comment_text": "Saggy tits", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T07:55:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "robin wang", "comment_text": "Dark Forest hypothesis.", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T05:15:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rhojan Dano", "comment_text": "The Morse Code message says: HELLO?", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T03:19:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hamish Neilsen", "comment_text": "It&#39;s deep thought", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T03:16:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "meow", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=1m25s\">1:25</a> so like it takes a shit ton of time for light to travel. and you\u2019re saying that maybe there could\u2019ve been life a long time ago... but whatever we observe in space is actually the past... it\u2019s however long ago it took the light to travel for us... so this does not seem possible", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T03:01:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EnterpriseKnight", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=3m59s\">3:59</a> hey, is that the ship from FTL?", "comment_date": "2019-11-15T12:06:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tiny Rocky Planet", "comment_text": "what&#39;s good with immortality if you have natural reincarnation, unbelievable the amount of energy spent to solve a problem, which does not exist, do more meditation and you will know.

There are no words to tell you how freaking big it is. Light is fast but for as fast as it is, it still takes a full YEAR to go from the surface of the sun to the Oort cloud. A freaking YEAR. Not very fast sounding is it? Well that&#39;s not true. Light is really fast but this example I&#39;ve given you is same for a Formula one car to cross the Earth a couple times (If anyone feels like it, do the math to figure out how many times it could in one year). Or just giving it a REALLY long racetrack. They&#39;re fast alright but it will still take time to go from point A to point B. If anyone out there is listening the signals we put out would at best be static due to the signal spreading out over time as it crosses these distances. It would be nothing more than the vacuum of space to someone who&#39;s listening. The same would go for us. We could be receiving hundreds or thousands of signals. but we detect only the equivalent of the static vacuum of space.\r<br>\r<br>Another issue is the HUNDREDS of things that had to happen for our existence. Earth first had to survive creation. Then it had to survive early solar life of constant clashes of planets and meteors. THEN it had to get a moon (however it got it). THEN it also had to be the right size to achieve space travel. THEN it had to get water somehow. Then at long last it had to calm down its 6 hour day rotation to get to a slower rotation. Then it had to somehow miraculously get life. We STILL aren&#39;t even close to being done here, because THEN this life had to survive long enough to achieve multi-cellular life. Then it had to evolve into something with some kind of basic intelligence. Now i will mention that the dinosaurs were not needed for us to evolve as the only effect on our civilization was the creation of dragons and some really neat movies and some pretty cool skeletons, so we can skip this step. THEN life had to evolve some kind of grasping limb, whether it be a hand or a an advanced tentacle limb. THEN THAT SPECIFIC LIFE had to evolve into us. And this is the simple version, after all this life also had to compete with other versions of itself as well as every other life form vying for dominance. OH I FORGOT: The sun must also be formed in the habitable zone of the galaxy itself. Yeah there are that many crazy chances to NOT get us as intelligent beings. Right now we are int the step of surviving wiping ourselves out like a bunch of morons. So as cool as we all think aliens are, the odds of their existence put them at maybe ONE single plant per every 7ish galaxies I would think. Life is either unique to us, or EXTREMELY rare.

Especially at the speeds required to meet other civilizations within fifty or so generations of living on the ship. Time dilation. Until we can figure out how to move uninhibited by this, we can not travel without sending off colonies who would be saying goodbye to earth, moving through time and space at such levels that even with all our tech, we can&#39;t ever hope to see them again and might as well assume they died. Personally, speaking in theory, I think the loophole would be to do what startrek did. (I think it was startrek, I might by thinking of futurama.) To make a bubble around the vessel and then move the bubble. We are holding still, everything else would be moving around us. Thus ignoring the time dilation via not moving! As to how this would be possible, no clue. If I can make any recommendations to any scientists that might possibly be reading this, I&#39;d start looking into gravity. The way it stretches both time and space like it does is very promising!

And we&#39;ve only seen like a billionth of a fraction of a percent of the observable universe? That&#39;s like glancing out the window of your house, seeing the neighbor&#39;s light is off, and concluding the entire town has been evacuated. There&#39;s nobody there, or we would have seen them! Seen something! Even though we admit we don&#39;t know all the rules of the universe? Or how everything works? Or even how life starts, or might work for other beings? We&#39;ve seen the briefest of glances, and based it on yesterday&#39;s understanding of physics, which seems to be always advancing and upending previously held sacred truths. And how do we define the life we are searching for? Only as carbon based, water and food dependant, oxygen breathing, used to a certain level of gravity and heat and light? Are we only looking in the &#39;habitable zone&#39; for beings like us? Or grey aliens with big heads, E.T., the X-files? Maybe robots or AI based on our known technology? Or is life defined as consciousness, as sentience? We could be looking in the wrong place for the wrong kind of creature. We don&#39;t know how &#39;life&#39; sparked our bags of meat to consciousness, our carbon atoms arranged in the manner they are. Pick another element or 5 or 20, imagine all of the different ways they could be arranged. Imagine that there are elements, maybe buried deep in our earth&#39;s core, that we have not encountered yet despite their existence close to our own. How could these potentially interact with elements we do know, on a planet with more or less heat or gravity, an atmosphere thinner than ours, or thick and soupy (our planet&#39;s atmosphere hasn&#39;t always been conducive to human beings&#39; survival; we couldn&#39;t have walked with the dinosaurs 250 million years ago, or existed in the atmosphere of a young earth)? We can&#39;t even survive everywhere on our own planet. We need oxygen and special clothes for our highest mountains, submersibles for the deepest ocean. We haven&#39;t even discovered every living thing on this planet, or been able to figure out how many of them live. Some creatures on earth have gills instead of lungs and can cope with pressure 7 miles under the ocean. We can&#39;t communicate with them so deny their intelligence, their sentience. And they&#39;re EARTHLINGS. I don&#39;t know how humans could cope with other non-human beings, its not in our nature to welcome foreigners, whose method of language will probably be vastly different. Who may not even have skin as we know it. And we speak of colonization as if it is an eternal, universal concept, when really only a few members of one species here has had a hard-on for it for a few thousand years. It doesn&#39;t seem insane to look objectively at one&#39;s species eventually going extinct and accepting that as simply *what happens*. Instead of trying to move heaven and earth, building rockets, charging forward with ethically ambiguous technology, all to possibly save one&#39;s species millions of years in the future. If nothing lasts forever, and we believe the entire universe will one day go dark, why fight against the inevitable? We as humans will all die, we get a few years, our descendents get a few more, species evolve, die out, their memories are lost to whatever succeeds them. We are not special, first or last. We cannot win against a catastrophic filter. We are some of the weakest creatures on our planet. Other species are bigger, stronger, tougher. They can fly high, swim deep, run fast, leap and bound. They have fur and feathers and thicker skin. We pride ourselves on opposable thumbs, theory of mind, vast intelligence. But because we cannot speak the language of other creatures we don&#39;t actually know how smart they are. (Maybe whales and porpoises, with their big brains, have happy lives with their families, are not burdened with material items.) We understand so little! And what we can imagine or theorize is all based on this itty bitty sliver of time and dirt we inhabit, based on the subsection of the species that studies such things, who admits that much of what is theorized doesn&#39;t even conform to natural laws as we experience them. <br>Look, I don&#39;t know shit about shit. Not physics or chemistry. My mind can&#39;t wrap around a million years, or even a light year. I don&#39;t want to live through a global pandemic or a zombie apocalypse. (Seriously, fuck zombies.) I just think that we have to throw all of our expectations out the window when imagining other life in the universe. Question every single expectation. Without open minds we will never get anywhere. But regardless, no one gets out alive. Death is a trip we will all take. We can only hope, whatever it is we hope. (Sorry this is super long, dis-jointed, and rambly. This only reflects my opinion based on my current knowledge. I am always trying to learn more. If you want to teach me something, or correct me where I&#39;m wrong, you don&#39;t have to insult me to do it. I like civil discussions with people smarter than myself.

Earth itself has gone through really catastrophic scenarios through its history, and mankind either wouldn&#39;t exist or was nearly wiped out several times. You see, Universe itself has billions of years, and our history as civilized and cooperative beings is barely 12000 years. Chances are there were lots of civilizations around us throughout these billion years, and they lived thousands of years and eventually got wiped out by a cataclysmic event, just like we can be at any moment, and just like dinosaurs got extinct. Then you would say we would eventually find ruins: yes, maybe, or maybe a meteor collapsed their entire planet, or maybe were hit by a sudden gamma ray burst, or exploded their own world by misuse of their technology, and so on. The thing we miss is that we just recently got the technology to observe space, and not even that efficiently. Thinking that these thousands of years we exist as intelligent beings are any meaningful compared to billions of years of the universe existence and its possible timeframes is silly. So: has ever existed complex lifeforms around the universe during its timeframe? Quite probably, but not guaranteed, since complex life as we know needs A LOT of circumstances and events that enables it. Are they alive in our current timeframe?

It&#39;s assumed that all life is material. Maybe it&#39;s not. Maybe material life is rare and non-material life is the norm. We know there are dimensions beyond 4D. In those dimensions, there are no time-space limitations. You can go from A to B instantly because A and B occupy the same point. There may already be other intelligent life right here on Earth that exists parallel, watching us, but we can&#39;t see it because we lack the faculties or we are too focused on technology. <br><br>The Fermi Paradox is entirely predicated upon a material universe with material life. Maybe that&#39;s not how it works. The great filter probably has more to do with that. A species remains materialistically focused until their star goes nova and snuffs them out.<br><br>The other possibility is that what spiritual wisdom traditions say is true. When the physical body dies our consciousness leaves and goes elsewhere. Maybe the human experience is temporary and we&#39;re not supposed to leave Earth. When humanity eventually goes extinct, consciousness just finds another planet to be on. We don&#39;t even know yet what consciousness is. Evolution looks only at organic material and genetics. So far we don&#39;t even know the nature of the presence that is asking these questions. I wish science would focus more on that than building primitive machines to go to ridiculously far places.

WE don&#39;t see these abilitties and don&#39;t want to believe in there. But in same time, some of individuals which are many less than 40% of population are getting to know, learning. Because they hate primitive and common ways. Succesfulll people, sports men, billionaries they choose to do something more than avarage Joe. Many of us born in zone with existing dogma. It can be religion or even social status like poverty. They think that nothing can be changed and stay living their lies. Other zone is other religion, language etc. So if you believe in bible as you born in zone with most catholic society and churches and your family friends, neighbers were also beliving so you also doing same. It&#39;s not choose - its a must because when you say you don&#39;t give a fuck they will be laughing at you, saying that you&#39;re dumb moron. In every zone is same. You would have a choose in religion whenever you would know at least as much about other zone religion as you know about your current zone religion. But you simple don&#39;t because you&#39;re too lazy. With aliens you can not believe and not doing research also but when you do that you find that preivious human civilization from this earth was seeing others and writing about them. In fact many religions in earth could be created because they interpretation of things happen in earth because they were low stage apes and others were looking like gods for &#39;em. Maybe this is a reason why they don&#39;t show to us or maybe they show but we don&#39;t want to believe in them because same like previouse it is shock for us. Long time ago when humans were technologicaly shitty they suddently draw a map of our solar system, build buildings which we can&#39;t build today because they too advenced. (great pyramid, nazca, machu picchu at many more worldwide). I saw repeating pattern today. This buildings were mathematicly perfect which is tottaly close to nature rights. Thats why they don&#39;t fall after thousnds of years. Same we can find today signs on fields which examined by scientists show same mathematicly perfect.

Assuming sustaining an interstellar to galactic civilization is even possible, (and it might not be), space is really big, colonizing planets is really hard, and we have absolutely no idea how long it could take to develop that kind of technology or when alien life first appeared on a given planet.

It might just not be technologically practical or even possible, when you consider that (in addition to many planets being resource-poor or downright uninhabitable) most colonizations would be a one way trip and just communication between planets could take years, so unless faster-then-light is possible (which is likely impossible) there wouldn&#39;t be much point in building an empire that you can&#39;t even control. <br>So TL;DR, I would propose a &quot;great barrier&quot; type solution to the paradox, only instead of all civilizations wiping themselves out at a certain point, it&#39;s just really that hard to make an empire that big.

And we can imagine, seeing our history and it&#39;s tendency to repeat itself, that this is an incredibly hard to achieve feat. Most probably, the majority of the intelligent civilizations will never get beyond this step.<br><br>But let&#39;s assume that some species do pass this filter. What next? The nearest star may not host planets. Or even if it does, it may not have any planet in the habitable zone. Or even if it has such a planet, that planet may well be populated by another intelligent civilization, developed enough to defend itself against a colonizing ship. And if we take into consideration the possible diseases on the new planet, diseases that our conquering civilization has no immunity against or research about, then we can imagine how hard it would be to conquer the first planet.<br><br>Furthermore, let&#39;s assume that this conquering civilization gets to a first planet...then another one...and so on. It will get to the point of controlling about 8-10 planets. Keeping in mind that not every star would host a convenient planet, we can assume that the stars of the conquered planets won&#39;t be &quot;close&quot; neighbors. This means that even with wormhole technology, communication would go really slow. Moreover, as different planets have different environments, over the course of hundreds or thousands of years, the colonies would most probably suffer significant DNA changes that could even affect them psychologically. These 2 problems would make it nearly impossible for the civilization to keep itself united and internal conflicts would most likely emerge again, and we go back to the firs step mentioned.

If extraterrestrials exist, why haven&#39;t they revealed themselves to us? Just look around you and you&#39;ll see the answer, many of us are already accusing them of being evil and they haven&#39;t even said hello yet. Think about this for a second, outside of our internet and media, there is literally no information regarding aliens and their intentions. What we &quot;know&quot; is taken from movies or obscure websites like Reddit and 4chan where anyone can say anything. But, for some reason a very large portion of us think we have it all figured out. The arrogance is deafening. Sometimes, we&#39;ll see a report of a UFO on the news, but there&#39;s no real information there. Aliens have not revealed themselves because, we as the human species are not easily swayed by facts or evidence, we are a heavily opinionated and hard-headed species, we will hold onto our histories. Even as old information gathered throughout our history is discovered to be flawed through new science and technology, we&#39;ve still built our societies and cultures around those flaws, and will not look to new ideas or innovations so easily. You can see this even now. Things such as life-extension for humans by hundreds or even thousands of years is seen as controversial, some people say they wouldn&#39;t want to live that long, they don&#39;t see a point in living thousands of years. The reasons they give for not wanting to live that long are hardly even thought out. They&#39;ll get bored is one of the most popular reasons put forth - and that is foolish. With so many innovations and ideas in reach such as quantum computing, avoiding death, traveling and inhabiting different planets, possibly interacting with other alien civilizations and exploring their various cultures and arts, I really have to question how in this universe anyone can say they would get bored. A person incapable of deep, critical thinking would say they would get bored, and it&#39;s those types of people (and they are abundant) that I think are problematic to an alien race trying to reveal themselves to a group who are already half-ignorant to their existence. They can probably hide whatever traces of their existence they want from us and will continue to do so until we evolve a bit more in our heads.

Not all parts of the galaxy are so inhabited. There are great unexplored regions. There are many hidden races. Trade and commerce between worlds are only carried on in certain areas. The environment that you will emerge into is a very competitive one. The need for resources is experienced everywhere, and many technological societies have outstripped their world\u2019s natural resources and must trade, barter and travel to gain what they need. It is a very complicated situation. Many alliances are formed and conflicts do occur.<br><br>Perhaps at this point it is necessary to realize that the Greater Community into which you are emerging is a difficult environment and a challenging one, and yet it brings great opportunity and great possibilities for humanity. However, for these possibilities and these advantages to be realized, humanity must prepare and come to learn what life in the universe is like.

As we progress in our understanding of how our universe works and if we are smart enough to not destroy ourselves we will reach other planets, possibly other galaxies, perhaps other universes.

To think that in the end of our universe all this evolution will prove useless does not make sense unless we die failing to evolve far enough. There is a reason for existence. The reasons may involve intelligent design but this begets the question from whence did the designer come. To think that sentience from our universe will cease to exist at what is thought to be the death of our universe does not make sense unless we in our universe have not evolved far enough. Evolution is the compelling proof that there is a reason for existence.

It&#39;s shit. Squirrels can&#39;t communicate ideas at all. They don&#39;t have the self-awareness to know what an idea is, nor do they have the desire to communicate it with us. So of course we can&#39;t communicate ideas with them. Humans can use logic, they are self-aware, they can communicate ideas, they know what they are. They have language, and the ability to record their ideas and build off of them. They have the desire to communicate. <br><br>Comparing that to something that inherently can&#39;t communicate on any real level, and has no desire to, is a shitty analogy. Another species with logic, the desire to communicate, advanced language, etc. should be able to find a way to communicate, even if it&#39;s difficult at first. <br><br>Just because aliens may have more complex ideas or ways of thinking than we do, doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re squirrels to them. If anything, their intelligence should make it easier to communicate, because they&#39;ll be able to come up with an intelligent system and think of many possibilities to make it work. And thinking that they won&#39;t check radio waves signals for signs of life? That would mean they aren&#39;t very smart at all. If their goal was to find life, and they were super-intelligent, they&#39;re going to be including many forms of possible communication... and something as fundamental as using wavelengths of light? Uh yeah, that would be included.", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T07:25:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zkkn", "comment_text": "i saw mew multiple times in this video, and had to make this comment", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T07:08:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Asafe Gonzaga", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=2m38s\">2:38</a> <br>I didn&#39;t knew that Mew was a alien XD,  that explains a lot", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T06:37:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "loenteloente", "comment_text": "The Reapers are Coming!", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T06:14:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miltiadis Nedelkos", "comment_text": "I loved the &quot;aliens stopped conquering planets because they&#39;re on drugs for simulated trillions of years&quot; theory \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T05:47:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Em", "comment_text": "We&#39;re like the Jon Snow of the universe", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T05:19:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GeekTechZone", "comment_text": "We are at the boarder of digital technology but we still have quantum technology to explore", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T04:37:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Festive Gus", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> Did anyone else get the FTL reference?

The base assumptions are that 1. civilizations generally seek self-preservation, 2. in order to survive, civilizations must grow, and 3. technological progress is nonlinear and unpredictable. To show how this works, we&#39;re going to use Civilization A and Civilization B. A is more technologically advanced than B at the start of our thought experiment, but the 3rd axiom/assumption means that B could be more advanced than A in a matter of years. A discovers B, around 10 or so LY from A&#39;s host star but B doesn&#39;t know about A. A knows it can&#39;t keep its existence a secret from B for too long and that its technological lead is unsubstantial and likely to change eventually, both due to the 3rd axiom. Additionally, there&#39;s no way for A to know for sure whether or not B is benevolent or malevolent so, logically, the only course of action for A to take is the complete annihilation of civilization B. The logical extension of this is that there may be millions of civilizations in our galaxy, but each of them reached the dark forest conclusion independently and they know broadcasting any signals for long enough is suicide. We could be one among millions or billions of intelligent species in a perpetual standoff, each forced to murder anyone who speaks up", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T04:25:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "big boy", "comment_text": "I always love the pok\u00e9mon easter eggs in the vids", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T04:19:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BlaixenU", "comment_text": "I just resized if there are other world&#39;s with life it&#39;s logic that they would want to kill other life cuz they wanna dominate", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T04:11:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BlaixenU", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=1m50s\">1:50</a> it&#39;s a mew in a buble", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T04:09:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lodicolo", "comment_text": "+1 for Dende at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=5m05s\">5:05</a>", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T04:05:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dboi jah'skush", "comment_text": "we need to boldly go where one one has gone before", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T03:10:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chrishaad Gibson", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=4m08s\">4:08</a> you said 100,000 years but shows 10,000 years in the animation lol", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T03:09:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chene Scott", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=5m06s\">5:06</a> little green!", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T03:04:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kael Molo", "comment_text": "Watch &quot;Unacknowledged&quot;.

No we are not and I am 100% certain there is something here watching us. What it&#39;s agenda and purpose is I have no idea. I&#39;m not a simple minded person and what I saw there is no earthly explanation for. I live 2 blocks north of Detroit. I went out on the porch to have a cigarette. 2 cop cars went racing down the street at a high rate of speed. I thought to myself they&#39;re after someone. So I walked out to the side walk to see what was going on. The cop cars pulled into a parking lot and turned off their lights. Then I looked up to the sky. There were six bright lights high in the sky. I couldn&#39;t see them from my porch because of the trees. The lights were over a mile away. They were very bright unlike aircraft and they were clustered together. They seemed to merge with each other and break apart. Then they disappeared one at a time and reappeared in another part of the sky almost instantly. I&#39;ve used telescopes and I&#39;ve seen a lot of different aircraft everything from AC130&#39;s warthogs f16&#39;s passanger jets large and small black hawk helicopters. I&#39;ve seen many things in the sky but I&#39;ve come to the conclusions this wasn&#39;t earthly. We are not alone. I&#39;ve seen video of the exact same phenomenon in other states and other countries from around the world. We are being visited. One day mankind is going to find out.

When outside the atmosphere we use about 1/3 of the fuel to get to the moon (2/3 of it is the part used to exit the atmosphere). So we COULD theoretically use normal rocket fuel to get OUT of the atmosphere but then use something like Ion propulsion (which is a form of electric propulsion that creates thrust by accelerating ions with electricity). Ion propulsion DOES need quite a bit of electricity to get started so I propose that we (once we have the technology) use a fusion reactor to provide electricity to both the shuttle AND the ion thrusters<br>If anything doesn&#39;t make sense please tell me and I will fix it<br>:)", "comment_date": "2017-07-31T17:58:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "derpy waffle", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=0m10s\">0:10</a> THAT&#39;S A MEW", "comment_date": "2017-07-31T17:27:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shakil", "comment_text": "There are aliens and they&#39;ve found us, but stayed separate because their intelligence told them that the human will fuck up everything!<br><br>Source: \u03c0\u00a2_\u00a2\u00f7`", "comment_date": "2017-07-31T09:27:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "in_q", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> isn&#39;t that a F.T.L.

(Again, this is thinking on a human example; there&#39;s the possibility of some super-resource hungry supertech out there that actually demands the kind of resources needed to make a galactic empire have to deal with scarcity)<br><br>Ideological conflict is all but inevitable between life forms, but I&#39;d argue that, by and large, the observable trend is that more sophisticated intelligences tend to not resort to the &quot;blow it all up&quot; button.  Compare the Cold War to the Crusades, for instance.  <br><br>In the Crusades, a bunch of Europeans said to the Muslim world &quot;your religion is wrong&quot; and as a result decided to walk over to the Muslim part of the world and start killing people (until the Muslims demonstrated that they were better at killing people, at which point the Europeans kinda called it all off and started practicing on eachother again).  <br><br>In the Cold War, a much more technologically sophisticated United States told a similarly sophisticated Soviet Union (and vice versa, I kinda get the impression that it wasn&#39;t either side exclusively that started the Cold War) and said &quot;Communism is wrong.&quot;  The Soviets said &quot;Communism is right!  See, we have people orbiting the planet!  And nukes!  Lots of nukes!&quot;  To which the US said &quot;We have lots of nukes too!  Oh, and that guy walking on the moon is American!&quot;  And so on.  Point is, unlike the primitives in medieval Europe, nobody pressed decided that the solution to the disagreement was to make everyone die...just to make sure that they all died if one of them decided to kill all us.  Small progress, granted, but...progress!  <br><br>Granted, there are also still religious people around who decide to kill all the dissenting religious people they can find, but this is a minority.  No country ...at least as far as I&#39;ve heard... openly supports the religious groups that go about doing that.  And the general consensus of the international community is that you really shouldn&#39;t be doing that even if you&#39;re keeping it quiet.  A dramatic difference from medieval Europe, no?<br><br>My point is, if you scale up maturity along with technology, by the time you hit technology capable of sustaining an interstellar empire...or even just practical interstellar travel at all...you&#39;ve probably got a species that&#39;s long since figured out that war isn&#39;t a productive method of solving problems.<br><br>What&#39;s far more terrifying to me is the indifferent aliens.  Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy provides a good example (despite the absurd reasoning) - aliens just drop by, say &quot;Earth needs to not be here&quot; and wipe us out along with our planet.  At that point, it&#39;s not really war, any more than stepping on an ant is.  There&#39;s no risk of resources, we&#39;re just the ant that got underfoot, or that squirrel failing to comprehend why the forest needed to be cut down.  If we&#39;re lucky, our first contact scenario (assuming that&#39;s aliens dropping in to visit, not us going out there) is with a Star Trek Federation type, or maybe the Centauri from Babylon 5 (exploitive trade deals are survivable when compared to some alternatives.)  If not, our biggest problem is likely going to be getting them to comprehend that we&#39;re sapient and shouldn&#39;t be squished.<br><br>If we&#39;re really lucky, those jokes about how humans and a lot of the animals we just deal with on a regular basis are actually kinda terrifying. :p", "comment_date": "2017-05-17T17:43:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "/:", "comment_text": "What if we are the most intelligent life form?", "comment_date": "2017-05-17T05:02:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NoahTre", "comment_text": "You say squirrels weird lol.", "comment_date": "2017-05-16T22:12:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "delete me delete", "comment_text": "nutshell you should make a book cause this stuf is interesting", "comment_date": "2017-05-16T20:42:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trest", "comment_text": "This is your best video.", "comment_date": "2017-05-16T13:38:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MagnumRoland", "comment_text": "they won&#39;t do what we do to animals. we&#39;re the ones that are cruel.

If we we&#39;re to travel in light speed to a distant starsystem or something similar the perception of time would be entirely different depending on where you we&#39;re observing the travel. <br><br>Hypothetically, if a spaceship was to instantly accelerate to light speed (99.99999999%) to a star system 1000 light years away. The people on the spaceship would observe them arriving instantly. However, people observing this from earth would perceive the trip to take 1000 years.  <br><br>If you reading this, was to hitch a ride with a light photon. (Hypothetical speaking) that was traveling from the sun to earth. Everyone on earth would perceive the travel time to take about 8 minutes and 20 seconds. You, however, would perceive the travel time as an instant.  You would instantly arrive at earth due to time dilation. <br><br>Okay, so let&#39;s travel to a star system 10 light years away. Let&#39;s say we have an incredibly advanced spaceship and we can travel in 85% of lightspeed. We put one clock in the spaceship and one on earth. <br><br>When the spaceship takes off and begins it&#39;s travel the time on the spaceship will move slower. The clock will tick slower in relation to the clock on earth. However it is not observable for the people in the spaceship at the time. They will perceive time as moving at the same rate as on earth. <br><br>When you arrive at your destination, let&#39;s say you can compare the two clocks again.

Compared to almost every  other mammal, whose offspring are capable of running, using their senses to identify objects, avoid obstacles and have basic survival instincts hours after birth, our babies are pathetic. Intelligent is an evolutionary advantage, but only after the development of tools and basic understanding.

Technology almost always moves toward greater complexity and greater efficiency, less energy to do more work, so no Dyson spheres. Eventually a advanced civilisation will simply stop wasting energy broadcasting radio noise into space. Think the planet Pandora from the movie Avatar.

Where the plant life forms a planet wide fibre optic neural network that the locals can upload themselves to when they&#39;re near death.

It&#39;s not even vaguely realistic to expect to contact something half way across the milky way at around 50,000 light years let alone from another galaxy.<br> Is a conversation that takes 1,000 years from question to reply realistic? Then how about 100,000 years?<br>2) Civilizations (I think) will mostly burn brightly, use all their resources and die back in a few measly centuries.  (We&#39;re certainly tearing through our resources and our population&#39;s growing exponentially-[it&#39;s been pointed out to me it&#39;s not exponential, so let&#39;s say very fast?]).  So the odds of industrialized intelligence being &#39;there&#39; when we or they look are hugely remote. <br> Life on Earth took 3,500,000 years to get from the single celled to us having radio, that&#39;s 3 1/2 Billion years to our having inter-planetary communication ability.  (We&#39;ve been able to send / receive radio, etc. for  120 years out of 3  1/2 Billion.)   So the vast majority of the time, even on a planet that definitely will raise industrial life, that life spends just about all it&#39;s existence with an IQ around that of the mould on your cheese.  So, inactive re. radio, etc. communication.<br>  Still, it&#39;s not impossible.

It\u2019s just been too intelligent to come here.\u201d -Arthur C. Clarke<br><br> I had an existential crisis while watching this spectacular video. I know full well that I probably will not live to see the majority of human history - provided we don&#39;t destroy ourselves in the next 50 years - or even our first contact with alien life. Though, on the topic of aliens, two reasons we may not have seen life before could be:<br>1) For the most part the technology that we use is based around specular light, and the observation of fluctuation and interference from the many types of Waves and Rays on the electromagnetic spectrum. I mean we can&#39;t even observe all forms of energy on the electromagnetic spectrum.  In all likelihood Alien life that is able to traverse the Galaxy would probably have some way of warping or bend light to make it so that we are not able to observe them or there effect on space.<br>2) Why would life that is able to explore the vastness of space come to see us? MAYBE, if they hadn&#39;t seen any other form of &quot;intelligent&quot; life besides themselves before they might come to us in hopes of communication. Or just MAYBE they would like to experiment on us for the sake of science but besides that I can&#39;t imagine a space faring species ever wasting the resources necessary for such insignificant purposes. Many of the other habitable planets in the galaxy - by our definition - are a lot larger than our own planet and have an abundance in resources and if they did have life, would probably be far more interesting based on the pure quantity of life.<br>Then there is the idea that alien may come here to harness our resources. Why? Sure if they used an automated system as described by the video, we might just end up being a target but, considering planets such a Venus and Mercury and even the gas giants have such a vast amount of potential for energy production, I doubt the earth would be a target even in our own solar system.

We have already reached and almost passed the first test of advanced civilization, the power of splitting an atom. Granted no one has used it owing to fear, but in time fear becomes complacency and thus leads to no nuclear holocaust. The second test of civilization is unification. As I see the world today, steps are being taken to unite the world. The internet unites the world&#39;s thoughts, English is quickly becoming the most used language (both second and primary) used in the world. So, the world is quickly on it&#39;s way to unification. The last test is the  one I&#39;m concerned about. What happens when humans discover the power of anti-matter, dark energy, and dark matter? Your guess is as good as mine. I suspect we have about 100-200 years before we have a grand unified theory of everything. Once (if) we have that, I believe that humans will have their gateway to the stars and will be a a type I civilization that controls the entire energy of our home planet. Once humanity is united, there is little that is impossible to us.

Self destruction.  The Internet didn&#39;t really happen on an everyday-person level until around 1990.  We&#39;ve been in the global Internet age for a whopping 25 years.  Our species is INSANELY YOUNG.  Only in its infancy.  As technology progresses, it will become easier and easier for us to destroy ourselves.  3D printing, bio-engineering, nano-technology, etc., all could potentially open doors to doomsday scenarios.  Perhaps most intelligent life throughout the galaxy has just destroyed itself.  <br><br>Tangent:  Humans are still warring and murdering each other like savages, allowing destructive regimes like North Korea to progress, denying the most basic rights to billions (e.g. Chinese Internet censorship, free-thought/religious/women&#39;s rights in Middle East, oligarchies in Africa).  To make it through our next filters, at the very least, we&#39;ll need to stop thinking of ourselves on generational timescales and start thinking of the bigger picture.  How will humans in 1000 or more years look back on us?  The word &quot;savages&quot; really is a relative term.  Stop thinking with a 2016 mentality.  <br><br>2. The singularity.  If it happens, however it plays out, it could completely wipe out our entire sense of anything and everything.  If suddenly computers start solving problems and making decisions, our goals and aspirations (or those of advanced alien civilizations) may completely change.  If AIs engineer themselves to be trillions of times (infinitely?) smarter than 2016 humans, will they still value space travel?  Who knows what they will value.<br><br>3. Fortune.  Modern humans evolved during the ice age, which means that evolution happened very quickly due to small population sizes and aggressive natural selection.  If our planet didn&#39;t have ice ages, it&#39;s probable that the first creature to evolve enough to take control of the earth would be much dumber than us, more destructive, more warring, more aggressive, less environmentally-conscious.  If this is the case, it would suggest that the ice age made us smart enough to not destroy ourselves and to pass through more filters.  Most other planets with the right conditions for life would not experience such specific conditions as to force a species to evolve intelligence past a self-destructible state.  Thus, survivable intelligent life is much more rare than it otherwise seems.<br><br>4. Magic.  Actually, probably the most popular viewpoint.  The majority of earthlings and every culture in history believe in a magic god or something similar to explain things that they cannot otherwise explain.  <br><br>5. Alien altruism.  If they&#39;re out there, it actually seems fairly likely that they are watching us right now.  With our primitive minds, it&#39;s hard for us to understand why they would just sit by and watch.  Maybe they just have a much better sense of environmental stewardship than we do.  They don&#39;t want to interfere for ethical reasons.  <br><br>6. Physical limitations.  There&#39;s a lot of information online about how humans ever visiting other stars in the flesh is actually fairly unlikely.  In 2005, NASA unveiled its Space Launch System, which would take us to Mars.  It was referred to as &quot;Apollo on steroids.&quot;  In other words, the same basic technology as the 1969 moon landing, but bigger.  The Elon Musk-types are inspiring us by making space travel more affordable and interesting, but ultimately using the same modest force of propulsion.", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T16:54:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anita Miller", "comment_text": "Who else saw Mew?", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T16:48:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abena Boateng", "comment_text": "kind of reminded me of the last star in the 5th wave trilogy", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T16:41:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jan Ritter", "comment_text": "and maybe we are to advanced to aliens", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T16:31:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nestoras Zogopoulos", "comment_text": "tiberium war aliens reference at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=3m00s\">3:00</a> damn that sticked to the theme so much", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T16:24:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "APersonsName", "comment_text": "Liquid dinosaurs <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=2m57s\">2:57</a>", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T16:11:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Halo born678", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=5m47s\">5:47</a> at the bottom right there is that asteroid and a ship in it I forgot what the anime is called but I think that&#39;s where it is based of :D", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T15:48:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fossfeen", "comment_text": "computery guy", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T15:21:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Malex", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=0m40s\">0:40</a> Is that the computer-y guy from DHMIS 4 in the corner?", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T15:15:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Underworld Umbreon", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a>, FTL?rly?cool", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T14:50:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tamboric", "comment_text": "i saw mew in the bottom left", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T14:43:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "armag3ddon", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t wait to turn type III and go around harvesting the resources from minor species. \\o/", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T14:06:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Benny Yuan", "comment_text": "did anyone else notice mew at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=0m07s\">0:07</a>?", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T04:04:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NordicKappa", "comment_text": "lol Found Mew at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=1m52s\">1:52</a>", "comment_date": "2016-06-22T19:48:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xdan", "comment_text": "Suddenly hyped for No Man&#39;s Sky.", "comment_date": "2016-06-22T19:08:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Antonio Segura", "comment_text": "Gotta say it, I love how you almost always show some Pokemon on your videos!

The probes would plot a course and speed such that all the different probes would reach the Sphere at the same point of time in the far future.  So Probe #1 might capture a human ship around Saturn 200 years in the future and Probe #2 captures a ship 10,000 light years away and a million years in the future, but both probes would arrive at the Sphere at roughly the same time.  And thanks to time dilation from near light speed travel, both ship crews would only experience a few months of time before arriving at the sphere.

On Earth out of a billion species we&#39;re the only intelligent ones and for most of our time on the planet having enough intelligence to reliably create fire was enough to ensure our survival. Evolution will work the same way on any planet with a self replicating system subjected to environmental selective pressure (ie life) on Earth survival of the fittest meant pretty much every species around us every single possible adaptation to the environment. Intelligence was not commonly selected for. Animals became faster stronger smaller able to fly ect ect. Only one species became intelligent enough to create technology. And this also requires not only high intelligence but also a social species. A race of super intelligent IQ 200 lions would never develop a nuclear bomb because you require a team of specialists all working together. Life span also has to be relatively high. Few species on this planet naturallly live more than a decade. Then there&#39;s the question is travel to other stars even possible. If we do ever build a generational ship it will take thousands of years to reach the closest star (any number of things can go wrong along the way) and even then what can you do with a few thousand people in a remote solar system?

Even religious masters and teachers teach us ancient ways to leave this reality and experience a realm higher than this tangible reality. But we are so naive that we think that this physical realm is the absolute reality when in fact this physical realm is only an illusion. Our ancient forefathers kept on teaching us that technology is not the way to travel to another universes, it is through the transcendence of the spiritual consciousness that allows us to break material barriers allowing our souls to travel vast distances. Even Edgar Cayce said that in his sleep when his consciousness is free it can travel or roam in vast distances. Our bodies and our material technologies are useless in interstellar travel the key is just in our brains. There are many parts of our brains that we do not use.

It has to do with the evolution of the type of self conscious life form capable of perceiving the universe in a way that contact with them is even possible.<br><br>That is a huge question and as of yet the answer seems to be that the type of life form that we associate with &quot;intelligent&quot; life might be extremely rare.  And it&#39;s not hard to imagine why.  When we look back on the development of the human race it&#39;s hard to imagine how that could be replicated on another world.  There is prevailing idea in science that self conscious intelligent life is the end goal of evolution.  That all ecosystems and life naturally progress to the point that intelligent life must develop.  However, I think that is a hopeful idea that we hold onto and might not reflect the realities of the universe.<br><br>Just looking at it on a basic level, nothing about evolution or the systems we think governs the evolution of life necessarily dictates that a self conscious organism has to develop or even needs to develop in any given ecosystem.  One of the most successful life forms on Earth were the dinosaurs, who dominated the ecosystems of Earth for 160 million years.  And in all that time we cannot see any progression towards a more intelligent life form.  They had no barriers to develop intelligence and yet they stayed at animal level intelligence for the entirety of there existence.  That right there is a big clue that self conscious intelligent is not really necessary in an ecosystem for life to evolve and thrive.  Even though we have experienced extreme levels of growth in our population in such a short period of time,  the overwhelmingly vast majority of the life forms on this planet are simple bacteria.  In the grander scheme of things bacteria and single cell organisms are the dominant life form on Earth.  So in that scheme of things intelligence is not truly necessary for life to evolve or flourish in any ecosystem.<br><br>Then we get to the issue of the development of our intelligence and the factors that allowed us to expand our scope of knowledge and perceptions to where we can question our very place in the universe and ask &quot;is there anyone out there&quot;  If you look at the evolution of the human race you can&#39;t but notice just how many incidental and circumstantial factors played huge roles in our ability to grow smarter and exploit our environment and explore our universe.   Our stable magnetic field. The position of stars in our night sky.  The moon&#39;s very existence.  The distribution of minerals and metals on the Earth surface. These are just a few of the multitudes of factors that played huge roles in our development of intelligence.  So many factors have to be just right to allow for the type of evolution that led us to where we are today.  And in reality none of these developments are actually necessary.  There is nothing we can see in our evolution that says we couldn&#39;t have been stuck in stone age technologies to this day.  Or even an earlier form of development.  It&#39;s just not there.<br><br>So in fact if we do ever explore the cosmos I feel we will be largely disappointing with what we find out there.   We will find many &quot;Earth like&quot; planets, or at least planets capable of forming the type of organic life that we see in our world.  But the complexity of that life with vary wildly from world to world, as each planet&#39;s development will strictly dictate how far in evolution that life can progress.  I would venture to bet that the vast majority of life in the cosmos never gets beyond the single cell stage.  It&#39;s the easiest and most robust form of life that can exist.  On the rare world we might actually find ecosystems like we see on earth, with varied forms of life in the single and multiple cell variety and may even have animals that we can recognize.  But most of them will only have that type of life, because again intelligence is not necessary for life to thrive.  It will be the extremely rare planet where we could even find anything that we could associate with self conscious intelligent life.  But again unless the factors are just right the ability of that intelligence to develop to the point where they can perceive a universe outside of their world they will never need to develop that type of intelligence to thrive as a species.  Just look at our history as a species.  The human race manage to migrate and populate every continent on earth long before civilization develop.  In fact several earlier hominid species managed to do it as well and we an be sure they are not the type of &quot;intelligent&quot; life we are looking for.  So when we do find the rare planet with life forms we would consider &quot;intelligent&quot; they may be locked in a level of development that prevents them from exploring the universe and asking the type of questions we do.  There would be no need to if they are a successful species living in tune with the ecosystem.  So there may only be a small number of planets were intelligent life exist, but most of those life forms never develop the sophisticate civilizations we see on Earth.  We may in fact be the only type of life form in our galaxy even capable of exploring the universe.  Maybe every galaxy out there only holds one or two planets where such a thing arises.  And just accounting for the vastness of our own galaxy the chances that we are anywhere near a neighboring life form like that is extremely rare.<br><br>Then you get into the final problem about relative timelines and parallel development.  For all we know several intelligent life forms have existed in the galaxy over the billions of years but rarely do more than one exist at the same time and never are they near enough to each other to make contact possible.<br><br>Just my 2 cents, I hate to be pessimistic about the prospect of finding intelligent life but that&#39;s how I see it.", "comment_date": "2015-09-25T22:39:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bad End Happy", "comment_text": "Namek :D", "comment_date": "2015-09-25T21:38:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aneik", "comment_text": "Reapers!", "comment_date": "2015-09-25T21:19:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carousel Blind.", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=1m50s\">1:50</a> who is that Pokemon", "comment_date": "2015-09-25T19:37:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lautaro Fonseca", "comment_text": "I&#39;m really into this crap", "comment_date": "2015-09-25T18:39:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Baller 1778", "comment_text": "Too late to explore the world, too early to explore the universe...", "comment_date": "2015-09-25T17:38:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miguel Mil-Homens", "comment_text": "We are like Jon Snow, we know nothing!

This is why we use radial velocity to see how stars and other objects that are far away move. As the light loses energy it shifts more and more to low energy levels- ie. blue to red and red to infrared and so on. Radio waves are near the bottom of the electromagnetic range when it comes to energy levels. Radio contact is impossible because in order to travel to 99.99999% of the universe, the radio waves would disparate long before they got there.<br><br>Next, to send something with mass (creature or machine, etc.) to most of the universe would take much longer than how many light years are between the two destinations. Keep in mind- nothing with mass can accelerate to light speed thanks to relativity. Accelerating anything with mass even near light speed would require such a massive amount of energy that the gravitational affects (tidal forces) alone would destroy and spagettify the atoms of the object trying to be sent.<br><br>Not to mention the fact that no material has a long enough half life to survive a hunted million +year trip to another galaxy with enough structural integrity to still function.<br><br>Then there is the energy consumption issues and so on and so forth.<br><br>Also, the statistics are terribly wrong here. A planet doesn&#39;t have to be earth like for life to survive on it. Nor does the star have to be sun like. Nor does the planet have to be in the sun&#39;s Goldielox zone. Gravity and rotation and hydrostatic equilibrium stability as a million other factors come into play. Let alone the radiation issues. <br><br>There may be hundreds of billions of times more livable planets out there or maybe only tens of millions. We don&#39;t know.<br><br>Also, how are we to assume life evolves along a similar path to ours over any time period. Evolution is strongly tied to the environmental pressures of the environment of the life in question.<br><br>Maybe we&#39;re at the hight of intelligence or mate we are an oddball of life in the universe and most life is smarter than us or most life doesn&#39;t care about social interaction or something totally different.<br><br>These are only the smallest of the problems that there are with discovering life in the universe.<br><br>Although statistically impossible to nail down, it seems very likely that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe but it seems extremely unlikely that contact will ever come.<br><br>Sorry to be the stick in the mud on this one. I actually help find extrasolar planets through zooniverse&#39;s transit data from the Kepler satellite and I hate to say it, but articles like the one above are just rehashing of the same misunderstandings and misconceptions from decades past. It&#39;s a way to capitalize on the click bait available through the sudden overwhelming interest in space thanks to the new Pluto pictures.<br><br>", "comment_date": "2015-07-15T17:04:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sedthh", "comment_text": "why are all the assumptions about how evil aliens could be? humans are becoming more and more peaceful as we advance, as being able to live together in peace is one of the fundamental basics of having advanced projects<br><br>I&#39;d argue that aliens this advanced should be really compassionate", "comment_date": "2015-07-15T15:18:01Z", "likes_count": 100}, {"comment_by": "VegaNavarre", "comment_text": "And the Sidonia shows up again, love seeing her as a cameo.", "comment_date": "2015-07-15T12:21:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben", "comment_text": "This offends so many of my Christian friends.

Other civilizations roughly equal to ours are simply too far away for communication -- or, in the scope of billions of years, such civilizations have simply died out before our recent ability to send signals was developed.  Which leads us to what I think is the most compelling, and logical, version of the theory: the great Filter.  Development of life on earth suggests it is NOT easy, or necessarily inevitable.  Survival is also difficult in a hostile universe.

And eventually this rivalry died out.<br><br>Most of modern extraterrestrial activity nowadays revolves around economical gains (be it fast data transit through communication sattelites, or possible H3-excavations on the moon) or sientific research.<br><br>Colonising other planets for simple &quot;preserving of species&quot; is currently out of question. Like it would probably be good to have some place where people would still live if earth goes boom, but with current level of expenses this colonisation would take... not worth it.<br>After all, overstressing out present resources to get this &quot;second home&quot; might really endanger our current home. Especially if you take there is no guarantee colonisation would be successful.<br><br>Dealing with overpopulation by the means of colonisation is something often mentioned in sience fiction... but then again - Wars seem to deal with excess population quite effectively and cheaply. Grim as it may sound I belive humanity will rather kill half of itself and keep all Earth resources to itself, rather then spend half of resources to send some people away.<br><br>The only remaining reason for colonisation is - getting access to more resources. Let&#39;s face it - this is actually why humanity ever did colonisation. In 99% of times it did end up in colony declaing independance when it gets developed enough, but in the original idea it was always sending resources to metropoly. So I expect us (and all species with similar psychology) to use this reason for colonisation.<br>And unless you have FTL propulsion, such interstellar colonisation is out of question. No point in spending resources on colony ship if the closes time it can bring profit back is like in 200 years, no one would even invest in this.<br>So there are two possibilities:<br>1) FTL is not possible. Like never ever. This mean that all civilisations are locked in type II. Never capable of setting colonies outside of their home system.<br>2) There are FTL civilisations out there... but they are not using radiowaves for communication. At least not in interstellar range. Why would you sent a message by radio, when you can send an FTL courier that will bring your message faster? Or if they have FTL propultion, they are as likely to have FTL communication as well.<br><br>PS: One other reasons for colonisation I missed, and only now remembered:<br>&quot;Brave new worlds&quot; - let&#39;s call it like this. It is a lot like &quot;dealing with extra population&quot; but might occur even if there is no population problems, but instead there are many people who are not content with their present residence, for cultural, political of economical means. Like refugees that are willing to venture to some place - be it even the other planet - in bare hopes that life there would be better than at home.<br>This is also a possibility, but honestly - as our technological level increases - more and more people are being content with their life. As our societies and political systems evolve, less people are feeling pressured to leave... So likely by the time we hit the technology capable of bringing us to the stars, there will be not enough people willing to leave comforts of our home planet and venture into wilderness. Probably people would not be able to survive out of civilisation by then. Like present-day city dwellers are quite likely to die if they are placed in some wild and harsh enviroment, like desert, or jungle.", "comment_date": "2015-06-22T16:13:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Schmidtstone", "comment_text": "Hahahaha xD <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI&amp;t=04m00s\">04:00</a> nice try, but i saw that!!!

We need an entire biosphere to support us. If we find another Earth like planet, it&#39;ll probably be living in a version of Earth like the Archean or the Protozoic, where it&#39;s just microbes in the sea and an atmosphere with too little oxygen or perhaps made of methane. Most of Earth&#39;s history, it looked like that and only for about 13% of Earth&#39;s history, has complex multicellular life been present.<br><br>So if you arrive at such a planet, you will need to terraform it, but adding in all the microbes and waiting for them to colonize the planet and bring about an oxygen based atmosphere. (1) Then you need to add in filter feeders like sponges and algae like kelp to speed the process. Sponges would help spread oxygen below the surface layer, aiding the spread of eukaryotic life to the lower levels. After oxygenizing it, you need to warm the planet up, as the process of oxygenizing an atmosphere, cools the planet down as carbon gets locked away in microbial mats (2). Earth had to fight off many ice ages and/or snowball earths every time oxygen levels jumped and continental drift was the saving grace that subducted trapped carbon and released it via volcanoes. If the world is warmed, photosynthesis can happen faster and flooded continents provides mineralization and shallow seas for life.<br><br>To prevent a cooling, a planet needs burrowers to kill off the microbial mats (3) on the sea floor and filter feeders to control photosynthetic microbes and detritivores to recycle the dead matter faster. Coral reefs, which exist in sunny warm areas with low nutrients, need to be developed to produce oxygen. The coral filter feed desperately needed nutrients and hands it off to the algae growing on it and they share resources with each other. A coral reef has more tiering than a microbial mat and thus is more effective at making oxygen and their skeletons grow and create larger reefs and more photosynthesis opportunities. But the world might get too warm so it has to be cooled (4) so more predators need to be introduced (starfish, nautilus, crabs, and when more oxygen arrives, fish).<br><br>Our goal is to get enough oxygen to make an ozone so life can move to land. Then you need to get mosses and the associated microorganisms onto the wetlands to finish oxygenation (5). Then we need to get fungi to break down the rocky surfaces for the woody plants and ferns that will follow. We have to start with conifers and ferns, since insects don&#39;t exist to pollinate flowering plants. Then the trees will ultimately break into new soils and drop the nutrients when it dies and thus be washed into the rivers, changing ocean chemistry and fueling an algae bloom (6) which is deadly to the ocean life you introduced. Then you need to introduce fungi and bacteria to break down dead trees, or else the carbon gets locked up and the Earth cools down (7) and the trapped carbon could trigger a later extinction if released later all at once (8). Then you could introduce the rest of the parts, such as flowering plants, insects, birds, mammals, etc, to make it a viable world.<br><br>This list of conditions is close to the order of events and life earth went through to create a biosphere that supports. Each number represents an extinction that happened on earth when that change happened and earth always bounced back and moved forward, but each one, could have gone wrong and ended development of complex life before intelligent life could arrive.\u00a0<br><br>So, for an alien species to travel far, and introduce species to build a biosphere on another planet, will take time and require bringing all these stock species and keeping them alive. And we no longer have species like trilobites that can serve as an effective detritivore in lower oxygen conditions and we only one a few nautilus species left and they might not even know how to be predators in low oxygen conditions anymore.<br><br>So that bears the question, if we can&#39;t terraform, can we survive in indoor colonies on a planet without a biosphere supporting us for a long period of time? This was kind of a brain exercise to me, but it explains the Fermi Paradox perhaps a bit better, by both explaining the trials Earth had to go through, and the difficulty of truly inhabiting new planets.", "comment_date": "2015-06-12T04:04:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Galaxis", "comment_text": "I like the idea that we are near the end of discovering what is possible for generation of energy and propulsion because so far, science suggests that it is so.

Then, within that extremely sparse population, none of them come up with anything substantially better than petroleum or solar panels or neuclear fission. So, they just never have enough energy that their population also decides to dedicate to the search for other life in the universe to ever come anywhere near finding it. Maybe 100 years from now, we won&#39;t have all of this energy, massive wars will destroy all civilizations (like Mad Max) and when things settle down, we&#39;ll have a small population that concerns itself with survival and all of this exploration stuff is put aside.

I believe that any aliens that are advanced enough to get into space would also be wise and peaceful. Therefore, they would not want to interfere in our affairs and potentially cause havoc and chaos. Just imagine all the possible riots or chaos that might occur on Earth if people found out that aliens were real. So, if aliens are peaceful, they simply wouldn&#39;t come here, being afraid that it might unduly affect our development.

Based off of this, and where we are know, one can infer that it takes awhile for the conditions of life to appear, and unless a planet existed quite a bit before ours they would probably not be close to, or further along technologically.<br> <br>2. Evolution and how it might work on intelligence. Humans as a smart species (compared to any other animals) didn&#39;t get this way by chance, we got this way by fighting each other. A monkey (for example) finds a stick and attacks another monkey with it (again, for example), other monkeys see this and learn from it, a monkey sees a rock fall and kill another monkey, learns from this and starts throwing rocks. Onward, and onward this goes to a period of &quot;sentience.&quot; (Pause for intake of breath) To play back on the original idea, this is just another factor that would affect/effect (too lazy to look up the difference between the affect/effect) whether or not they would be even close to our level.<br>     A. There is even another factor to this! It also depends upon what a animals behavior might be. Aggressive or Neutral? Some animal might learn to throwing of rocks, but just not ever care about it or use it. This factor could be played upon in insane amounts of difference. A couple of these factors could be added to the Drake Equation.<br><br>3. Random animal and plant life that just doesn&#39;t give crap whether or not we die or find and harvest/train them.<br><br>4.

I mean yes, I belive there is some form of life in the universe besides us.

The speed of light may be the fastest thing in our law of physics, but think about it for a second. What if our laws of physics don&#39;t apply to them. And they have discovered their own laws that, in their circumstances, work and act way differently. Maybe the speed of light is their legal speed to travel between their home planets and they can go way much faster. Think on something that works based on tachyons, and boom = faster than the speed of light. We think we know a lot about physics but 99% of the physics we know applies here, on Earth. Other planet maybe have different gravity, different resistance etc. So with that kind of technology they can travel really fast, making the empty parts of the universe feel like a 10 hour drive on the highway.<br><br>Thing is altho I belive there is someone, somewhere, I don&#39;t belive we are going to find out. Humans will die as a species and we won&#39;t meet the other species from the universe. IF ... the universe is infinite, then there&#39;s a really high chance that they are way, way far away. So it would take millions of years for them to get to us, even with a technology that we cannnot imagine, like I&#39;ve said above. Because you know...infinity is... infinite.<br><br>We will die alone.

I am really curious about how we achieved that. How could we have built a rocket that is fast enough to get away from the gravity of earth and get to the moon and land on moon safely and get away from the gravity of the moon and return earth. I know that we frequently send shuttles and soyuz rockets to space and bring them back. Considering that it is far less complicated than landing on moon which has no atmosphere we can use for decreasing the speed of vehicle, it seems like a great achievement. I have researched about the rockets they used for the moon landing but i couldn&#39;t find any article that explains the moon landing detailed enough i can understand.

Sustaining an interstellar civilization and all the resources that would require would be a bit ridiculous when all a Matrioshka Brain would need is power which could easily be supplied by a star for as you said trillions of years. A very powerful quantum computer may provide the ability to do such a thing aswell as being able to potentially extend our perception of time to stretch those trillions of years we&#39;d already have. A virtual environment could be a lot more convenient and open up the possibility for people to experience things that would be impossible or absurdly difficult in reality.<br><br>Also to be able to start progressing in technology you don&#39;t need to be incredibly intelligent or have the entire species able to invent new tools. You&#39;d only need a percentage of the population to be able to exploit their environment to their advantage and make things easier for them, and then you would start progressing. That&#39;s why now we have some people capable of understanding the mechanics of an atom, with others who think i&#39;d be a good idea to use nuclear weapons. As for alien species, they would probably have the same story at least until their technology allowed them to surpass that, and social interaction is a key part of civilization so empathy might be a necessary evolved trait for a society. In that case I think that aliens even if they were more intelligent than us would just leave us alone. In a universe as big as ours an offensive strategy is a bit crazy so If we ever were a threat anyway defending would be more practical. Home field advantage is amplified significantly when you have to transport supplies light years. A &quot;grey goo&quot; weapon in the universe that was automated might work but again would require an alien civilization to be unsympathetic or be the biggest act of terrorism the universe has ever known.<br><br>Our history has shown technological progress can happen very quickly and is getting faster, so any communication with aliens would either be with something incomprehensibly more advanced than us or far behind us, although at this stage the former is much more likely.  The civilization that&#39;s less advanced would be the only one to benefit and as they would likely blow them selves up somehow if they were clued into the advanced technology too quickly assuming that those two civilizations could communicate which would be very hard, natural progression would be safer anyway.
