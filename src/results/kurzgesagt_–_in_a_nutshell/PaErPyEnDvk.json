One singular cry from it in it\u2019s native cave could create a tsunami so big I could wipe out half of Africa. The bellower is said to only wake on certain occasions. For example, when there is more plastic in the ocean than fish. Or when president trump goes swimming. If the bellower wakes and we\u2019ve completely cleaned out the ocean it will shrink to a smaller size to fit in with the wildlife and emerge from the cave. It will eventually wake. Every 10,000 years or so it wakes up and checks on it\u2019s oceans. So next time you see plastic on the beach, pick it up and put it in it\u2019s rightful place.

I struggled I did everything humanly possible to get a cure for over five years with no reasonable solution. Last year I started introducing more natural stuffs to my system then became more interested in nature. I realised that everything natural has a purpose and God made them to serve a purpose. I repented and asked God for forgiveness because he alone can deliver me of this impurity. I searched blogs, websites, more on God and nature. Early this year I met this herbal DR Utu contact on how he have successfully cured people of their diseases problems, I copied his contacts to give him a trial, I&#39;m determined to be cured, Nature is broad so I know there must be a cure somewhere no matter what it cost or what I will see. Lo and behold he was my last. He prepared and sent me herbs which within two days of use I started noticing rapid change in my system after days of used he asked me how I was doing and I replied pretty well, weeks later he said go for test. I can&#39;t wait to confirm this herbalist claim I did test the following day I did the second test to clear doubts and still hsv2 -ve. I can&#39;t keep silent when many are out there believing there is no cure. To confirm this cure for your self contact DR UTU on his direct digit whatsapp .  +2347032718477  you can still email him on    drutuherbalcure @ gmail .  com <br>There are many people out there who never know of this just as I share do same, If you are HSV lucky for you to see this.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

Notable locations in which sampling is scarce are the deep ocean (usually deeper than 200 m) and deep layers of soil (usually deeper than 1 m). For some organisms, such as annelids and marine protists and arthropods, most estimates neglect these environments, thus underestimating the actual biomass.

Over fishing is such a horrendous problem as sonar instrumentation has given us the ability to commit commercial genocide on sea life as they have no where to run or hide against trawling nets and radar and the loss of an individual is comparable to the loss of entire peoples in terms of the consequences when things live so slowly that they started their lives when our great great great great great great grandparents had yet to be born.<br><br><br>And we must be wary of the potential risks harvest of manganese nodules and other forms of deep sea exploitation as among deep sea creatures many don&#39;t reach sexual maturity for hundreds of years while living for thousands of years only to be destroyed by short sighted greedy humans in an instant. A Greenland shark takes over 500 years to reach sexual maturity and some corals down there are over 20,000 years old. We have no business down there aside from research and even scientists need to be more careful about how they do research since every sample harvest is unsustainable when the organisms in question were born before the dawn of civilization and where microbes take years to double their populations.<br><br><br>The deep sea and subterranean biospheres are alien to us as they live at incomprehensibly long timescales in the harshest conditions and environments possible.

I&#39;ve heard it over a hundred times by now. I know there isn&#39;t much to talk about anyway because we haven&#39;t discovered much still, but you could at least say something that not many people would even think to say. Maybe give your own opinions about it? Or telling us how these dark depths started out as far back as the dinosaurs? Or even try and use data we have today to maybe think about and predict what the deep sea could turn into in the far future? I&#39;m not saying you should just rewrite everything that&#39;s been noted about the deep sea, but I&#39;d really appreciate it if you could spice things up. Too many people say the same thing, and too many times I&#39;ve been reminded of it.
