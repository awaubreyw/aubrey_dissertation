Why plasma between stars in interestellar space is hotter than far regions of the solar system that are closer?<br><br>I mean its not strange interestelar plasma is hot but far regions of solar system are near absolute cero very cold and are closer and its a very big \u00e1rea...<br>Untill now they put in fusion reactors more energy than the energy they get to produce fusion reaction but maybe when they achieve self sustained reaction it gets dangerouse ...<br>In 1961 Rusia se tested tsar bomb a fusion bomb and that winter was cold on europe with some anomalies around the World...<br>Anyway the sun is also a fusion reactor quite big and its free have you noticed?", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T23:07:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Federal Bureau Of Investigation", "comment_text": "Deuterium brought me here \ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T04:20:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Flowt", "comment_text": "My money on a time machine.", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T02:31:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pushpa Kumar", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t know the pixels in that laptop can render infinity", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T08:33:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Green_EyE_Cat_Studio", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZsaaturR6E&amp;t=5m38s\">5:38</a> year 2022, the gamble of 10B is not worth, but buy twitter for 40B is wort the money.", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T19:23:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Abraham Sanchez", "comment_text": "Birb", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T01:27:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "freestyle with sam", "comment_text": "Can you explain about iron man arc reacter Eanger sorce", "comment_date": "2022-05-02T13:17:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "S2 w", "comment_text": "high risk high pay", "comment_date": "2022-05-02T10:38:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pirate Style Jutsu", "comment_text": "This video helped me learn a lot about Spider-Man 2. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd", "comment_date": "2022-04-30T20:22:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Harvey", "comment_text": "At t-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZsaaturR6E&amp;t=3m28s\">3:28</a> that model should be approximately as big as a city block", "comment_date": "2022-04-29T19:59:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Projekt Taku", "comment_text": "if we perfect fusion energy, could we put it into our bodies?

Is Fusion Clean?\r<br>In the long-term Fusion is the source of energy we need; it is a clean and powerful power. One station could light up a city for years. Fusion, however, is an extremely risky and expensive step forward to take. Fusion energy plants would cost 1 billion AUD to create even just a prototype just to see if it was viable, this sacrifice is necessary to help power the world and the rise in population. So, is Fusion the future? This report states the many reasons Fusion is the futuristic tech we need to survive.\r<br>What is Fusion? Fusion energy is in theory harnessing the power of the sun, in a nutshell Fusion a thermonuclear process which means that the ingredients for it to happen need to be extremely hot.  unlike fission where one splits the atoms Fusion energy is combining Nuclei. Since Nuclei are all positively charged, they repel each other, in order to get the Nuclei to combine the Nuclei must be going extremely fast and to get them up to the necessary speed the Nuclei must be extremely hot. As the Nuclei fuse into heavier atoms, they release energy. To date there are two different types of Fusion reactors, the Magnetic Confinement Reactor, and the Inertial Confinement Reactor.  Magnetic Confinement Reactors use super conducting electromagnets cooled using liquid helium. The Inertial Confinement Reactor uses high tech lasers to heat a pellet of fuel, imploding it to make it hot enough to fuse.\r<br>Fusion would be one of the cleanest sources of energy ever, due to little waste Fusion poses almost no threat to the environment and since Fusion cannot go nuclear a melt down would never be severe enough to do damage to people or the environment. However, Fusion would leak Tritium into the ocean system, Tritium is a highly radioactive toxic element that, in large amounts, could do serious damage to the environment. However, the amount of Tritium waste is so minuscule that it poses no effect to the environment. Waste isn\u2019t the only problem with Tritium, Tritium is extremely rare and can only be found on nuclear war heads and in the atmosphere making it extremely expensive. There is a solution to this lack of Tritium, the same reaction needed can be made using Hydrogen, but not any Hydrogen can be used, it must be Hydrogen three. The problem with Hydrogen three is it is also extremely rare to find, however, the moon has a layer of Hydrogen three on it due to solar winds and storms. This means that before we can harness the power of the sun, we need to harness the power of space travel. \r<br>Fusion energy is still just an experiment and although Fusion can be created it cost more energy to create Fusion then the Fusion creates meaning that the technology needs to be improved before it is ever viable for commercial use. When and if Fusion is created it would be so efficient that tiny amounts of salt water could power cities for years with no waste, this is due to the reactors use helium or Hydrogen to power the reaction and salt water is filled with hydrogen. However, not just Hydrogen would work Hydrogen3 or Hydrogen2 also known as deuterium and tritium. These hydrogen atoms are much heavier than plane hydrogen meaning that the pressure that they can create would be higher therefore giving of more energy than just normal Hydrogen. Deuterium is a stable element and can be found in abundance in sea water, Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen with a nucleus consisting of one proton and one neutron and has an atomic weight of 2.014. Tritium on the other hand is an unstable and rare radioactive isotope of hydrogen, its Nucleus contains one proton and two neutrons, it has an atomic mass of 3.016. Tritium is extremely hard to find on earth, there are trace amounts of it in the atmosphere, luckily, it can be made by irradiating lithium metal. Since Tritium is so rare another element is needed to for Fusion to go anywhere. This is where helium-3 comes into play. Helium-3 is an isotope of helium and is light and stable. Helium has two protons and one neutron, it is only one of two known stable elements with more protons than neutrons, it has an atomic weight of \u22483.016. unfortunately, it is also extremely uncommon on earth meaning that the moon is the most viable way to get helium 3. Over billions of years of solar wind, the moon has huge deposits of helium-3 scattered everywhere.\r<br>What are the dangers of Nuclear Fusion? It is commonly thought that Fusion would be extremely dangerous considering it is a miniature sun on earth, however, in comparison to other forms of fuel/energy it is extremely safe. If the confinement chamber for the plant failed, the plasma would expand and cool ending the process of Fusion. Tritium being highly radioactive could have severe effects on the planet however the amount of waste it produces is minuscule and would have no effect on the surrounding environment. Fusion cannot yet be weaponized meaning it could not become a bomb.\r<br>In conclusion, there are no negative effects on the environment using fusion meaning it is already superior to current fuel sources today, it cannot be turned into a bomb or melt down like nuclear fission and it would be almost limitless energy. However, Fusion is currently unknown and a big gamble, with extreme prices. The need for extremely rare resources such as tritium or hydrogen-3 means that before it could become commercially available, a moon base would be needed.", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T02:18:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glynne Tolar", "comment_text": "This video is so full of false or misleading material but covered up in a British voiceover.

Hydrogen-based technology will spread because humanity has realized that fusion does not take place inside the sun but in its crown sphere. Anyway, this was measured. The base plasma wave and the ionacoustic wave generate flares and this forms solitons. That is, he whips himself just like in an atomic bomb. The atomic bomb does not need a large size ( like sun) because the shock wave is fed from the fission implosion like a multi-node star scatterer. In this sense, its operation is misunderstood or unpublished ... That is why such a nuclear bomb is made up of pure flaer.  In a broader sense, it is a MASER due to the 1.7 GHz resonance of Hydrogen-Oxignen. \r<br>\r<br>We experimentally validated the idea (FOXHUND project)  outlined above and our project also received an award because it transforms the material into a small-scale fusion reactor of that size. \r<br>That\u2019s why the American ZAPHIR project is nowhere near us. We Eastern Europeans did it for much less money.\r<br>\r<br>Kirill Chukanov ( Eastern Europeans) many others realized this. Thus, the already operating fusion energy generating part was realized. They gave China the technique. China has come up with a workable version of the QUANTUUM DRAGON project and has filed patents for its Maser - Plasmotron system.\r<br>The Project was then taken out of Mr. GAO&#39;s hands and made a national strategy program in the field of military and space research. \r<br>\r<br>With this, the mass production of successful fusion reactors was thus relocated to China. China has strong self-defense capabilities. This has made the anti-fossil fuel technique unconstrained by standard tricks. From here, the branch of the NASH tree cannot be pruned to the advantage of friends of fossil technology. Our lives are no longer important here. Anyone who knows Father Pio&#39;s sacred prophecies can applaud us now.  Wealth is not only important for the survival of our species, for life. God level game...\r<br>\r<br>It has become clear that the now retrograde U.S. energy technology lobby needs to be cleared centrally out of the way. Against the elite of the Western hidden powers, the eastern countries are forming a common position. It follows that they will take over the role in the energy and electric car industry.

It\u2019s not complete yet, but I\u2019m working on a way to contain a plasma field with resonant standing waves of sound. This would allow for fusion from hydrogen to helium in a light, simple, portable, source of high energy output. Right now, they have to use incredibly large, and unbelievably expensive, giant magnetrons, and cryogenics to create fusion. They use lasers all converging on one single point to get the temperature for fusion, but because it\u2019s plasma, it wants to expand like a bomb, and they have &quot;try&quot; and use magnetic fields, and pressure, to contain it. But, nobody is using sonic resonance. The idea hasn\u2019t occurred to them. If you\u2019ve ever seen footage of UFO\u2019s projecting a contained beam of light then you understand what I\u2019m trying to do here. The frequencies would have to be so far off the charts that it will require quantum computers to synchronize the timing of the harmonized light waves, sound waves, and pressure waves, to create a gravitational wave sphere in a vacuum to contain the plasma without walls. It\u2019s taking the frequency of the CMB and tracing it back to it\u2019s origin, and &quot;that\u2019s&quot; the frequency to match. It ascends infinitely, and descends infinitely, at the same time (erasing time) in both directions, to infinity. It\u2019s like creating a wavelength so fine that it becomes flat to unite with the base of the lowest waveform, like a loop. It Essentially oscillates around itself. This field will not even let heat escape so the cryogenic liquid hydrogen stays there, and stays at absolute zero. You have to remove the CMB from the liquid hydrogen to get it to freeze. The field should remove it from time and space. When liquid hydrogen is brought to absolute zero, it doesn\u2019t disappear, it kind of flips inside out. The nuclear charges balance and matter becomes energy, and this energy immediately becomes condensed matter that if you remove the electrons, it becomes helium from hydrogen. It involves a bunch of superstitious hunches like how I think that if you take a series of frozen, superconducting, Tesla coils, and hook all of their ends up in a circle, you get an infinite loop where the rotating magnetic field around them sends current through the coils that never escapes because it\u2019s in a perfect vacuum, so it is forever recycling the current and turning amps into volts forever. Higher and higher forever. It can\u2019t arc out like a novelty plasma ball because of the vacuum. I have an idea of how achieve a true perfect vacuum. That\u2019s the whole key. That, and how to get sound to it intrinsically. The vibrations would have to be coming from within the device, and be able to monitor the frequencies of the rotating magnetic field, and the laser light, and harmonize with them. It takes 3 points in space to make a plane. So, it takes three self contained, viable forces for self contained fusion. I would say wish me luck, but it\u2019s becoming clearer and clearer as each day passes what is required to achieve this in an intuitive way. I\u2019m still not sure if the standing sonic wave sphere comes from within the plasma field, or from outside in. Anyway, the one consequential force that they\u2019ve been overlooking is sonic resonance that completes the system. I\u2019ll get it figured out to where it makes sense to anyone I present it to.

Gathering the materials required to produce solar panels and the storage for said energy, together with the upgrades our electricity grids would need to support the peak energy creation leads to a much larger carbon footprint than nuclear. The only forms of renewable energy that do not have this problem are hydro and geothermal. Hydro is honestly the best option in my opinion, but it&#39;s very damaging to the environment on a river scale. Perhaps in the future, waves can be used to generate our electricity but salt water is very taxing on mechanics. Geothermal is even more expensive than nuclear fusion since every place will require a different power station and there is only limited energy available per station. Sadly, our governments seem less and less enthouiastic about developing new forms of energy, and the likelyhood of fusion happening seems slimmer and slimmer with every recession we see in the developed world. Sure, the first plants might cost way too much to ever be viable but the same was true for nuclear fission in the beginning. The vast majority of the world wasn&#39;t worried about greenhouse gasses at all when nuclear fission was developed.", "comment_date": "2021-07-27T09:42:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aarit Jhindal", "comment_text": "Can you please send a sources document for this?

Kurrzgesagt;  &quot;When the payoff is unlimited free energy for everyone, it might be worth the risk&quot; morally we do not have the right to gamble with other peoples, future generations or the Earths life.The views offered in this video are in essence mistaken and almost certainly intentionally dishonest, even if it&#39;s statistics are not necessarily fabricated, but are in some cases impossible to verify. It is dishonest in clearly trying to say nuclear energy saves lives and is one of the safest forms of energy. It is dishonest to say it &#39;saved two million lives&#39;...there isn&#39;t such a clear correlation, for a start, fossil fuels could have been replaced with wind, solar or other energy generations schemes; but there are many reasons to clearly fear man made nuclear energy ; deaths occur from pollution due to coal no doubt, but Fukoshima caused around 160.000 to evacuate, ruined tens of thousands of lives in one stroke in a way coal never has and it may be decades or perhaps never-in human terms- that the actual site area can be made safe. I believe it is clear that statistics favouring nuclear, diminishing it&#39;s negative effects are simply the result of the industries power, backing and money and the insanely power crazy nature of some physicists. One British nuclear plant is already \u00a3700 million over budget on it&#39;s deccomissioning and the fact that they say it &#39;will take AT LEAST 100 YEARS to do it&#39; shows they do not know how to and this massive problem is just adding to the colossal and totally unnecessary burden we today are leaving to future generations. Some nuclear toxins last tens, hundreds of thousands of years and the many hidden ramifications are so far and wide that we do not even know how to evaluate them, but one thing is for sure, the nuclear industry is built, literally on a foundation of lies and scientific power madness, linked to insane people in power with nuclear bombs at their finger tips. The mining of Uranium has furthermore devastated natural habitats an date lives of Indigenous people from the America&#39;s through the Sahel all the way to Australia; nuclear energy generated by man is a crime against humanity and the Earth, the Native Americans have it right when they say; &#39;Humans should not be messing around with the power of the Sun!&quot; meaning nuclear of course, not solar! True there is certainly a &#39;dark side to green energy&#39;, the hidden costs behind say electric cars, the steel in wind turbines, the copper used in all this electrification, but nuclear is an absolute abomination of crazy scientists, militarists, finance and politicians. This is the real truth, driven by genuine concern for life, not desire to defend profits and power which this video clearly is. Look at the massive amount the world is having to pay to help Russia control Chernobyl...all that expertise, energy, resources should have been spent on something beautiful, life enhancing, but instead colossal amounts of labour, resources, energy are being spent on TRYING DESPERATELY to manage a disaster that was entirely avoidable and is a crime against the Earth and humanity!", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T15:19:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bear Miller", "comment_text": "The parsimonious mexico contextually measure because step-sister informally employ until a furry furtive wealth. giddy, violet peer-to-peer", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T16:52:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richardsen", "comment_text": "Wait, how do they reach the very high temperatures required?", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T02:57:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "HDdiamonds", "comment_text": "what is ur opinoon ojn black mwen", "comment_date": "2021-04-02T22:58:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anti Imperialist ML", "comment_text": "get rid of all nuclear weapons in the world and invest all the nuclear material to nuclear fission and fusion research and production we can&#39;t fix the worlds problems while imperialism and capitalism exist", "comment_date": "2021-04-02T09:29:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Daffa_FM", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZsaaturR6E&amp;t=6m10s\">6:10</a> flat earther detected", "comment_date": "2021-04-01T15:04:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bereket Philipos Kindo", "comment_text": "The thin stopwatch randomly push because list aboaly interest unto a new oak. tangible, waggish kidney", "comment_date": "2021-04-01T09:19:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pankek 199", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZsaaturR6E&amp;t=1m21s\">1:21</a> cheater", "comment_date": "2021-04-01T06:49:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "slatined", "comment_text": "M going to get lot of money so I can buy this and give the world nuclear fussion", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T08:22:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter i", "comment_text": "It is worth the risk even if ITER failed, because we KNOW it&#39;s can be done.

Ever stolen (anything--the value is irrelevant)? Jesus said, &quot;Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart.&quot; Have you ever looked with lust? If you have said &quot;Yes&quot; to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we&#39;ve only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. That&#39;s how God sees you. Nothing is hid from His holy eyes. Will you be innocent or guilty on the Day of Judgment? Listen to your conscience. You know that you will be guilty, and therefore end up in Hell. That&#39;s not God&#39;s will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: &quot;God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; He was bruised for our iniquities. Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. He is your &quot;ticket&quot; to Heaven. He is the &quot;way,&quot; He is the &quot;Door,&quot; the only &quot;mediator.&quot; There is salvation in no other name, so pray something like this: &quot;Dear God, I repent of all of my sins (confess them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. Please forgive me and grant me your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus&#39; name I pray. Amen.&quot; Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read (see John 14:21).

I&#39;m told, by my lecturers and industry experts who work at places such as the JET reactor in the UK, that fusion is no longer a scientific problem, it&#39;s down to engineering. Even though fusion has been 10 years away for 50 years, it is making progress. Even nuclear fission is cleaner than most forms of wind and solar power, but fusion is next level. Unfortunately with fusion, testing it is expensive as reactors are expensive. Virtually any other form of power generation you can test till failure (in fissions case you can even just blow up reactors and make a new one), but with fusion its millions to billions to make a test reactor, nevermind test it till failure! That&#39;s one of the main reasons progress is so slow. <br><br>Great vid as per, getting so many snippets of info into one place.

If you want to learn more just go on the Greenpeace website and read there reasonings for opposing nuclear energy , FYI the article is insulting and filled to the brim with misinformation. At least the Sierra club is okay with fusion research even though they oppose fission energy so much that they literally said we need a \u201cNuclear Free future\u201d also note that Sierra club is anti nuclear because this guy called David Brower made them anti nuclear against the organizations will and now they just oppose nuclear energy because of what he told them. Greenpeace on the other hand takes it to a to a totally new level of narrow minded ignorance. There are a lot of things that people say should be in a sustainable future like energy efficiency, electric cars, 100% solar and wind, all electric everything, Climate change resilience, but in reality all that is just a ton of BULLSHIT that \u201cenvironmentalists\u201d are going to use to destroy industry, lower quality of life even farther and on top of it all reduce the human population to \u201cmore sustainable levels\u201d.

Thomas Edison used every combination of metal and other materials to get the light bulb to work.  For the fusion reactor, the scientists need to think outside the box.  They must try different environments until one get a stable fusion reaction.  Try a vacuum environment.   Like the one on the moon.  Try causing a fusion reaction in an environment filled with one or more of the six noble gasses.  Try causing a fusion reaction in an environment filled with nitrogen or hydrogen or carbon dioxide.   Hydrogen cant ignite without oxygen so no explosion is possible using hydrogen.   Try causing a fusion reaction while being bombarded with microwaves or x-rays or gamma rays.   Lazers have already been tried...try a combination of gasses and radiation and lazers until you get it right.  Thomas Edison knew how to think out of the box and he worked his staff to death until an answer was found.  Try a low gravity environment like the one on the moon.  That is where the helium 3 is to be mined to power the fusion reactor.  This would also stop the &quot;not in my backyard mentality&quot; since the moon is far away. ..build the fusion reactor there  and just convert the power into a microwave beam and send it back to the earth.  Remember, the larger the chamber is, the more stable the fusion reactor will be.  What is wrong with the scientists?  The earth is choking to death on smoke and smog and fission power radiation.

In a nutshell fusion will be allways less efficient then nuclear energy ( the energy produced by the same mass is 4x higher than in nuclear plants, yes. but do the math: 10x more heat then u got on the sun, also means u can simply devide 4/10 =  0,4 means nuclear plants will allways be 1,6 % more &quot;efficient&quot; because the energy you gotta put in the system is 10x more then it would be required on the sun. meaning this system cant even keep itself allive even at an efficiency of 0,99999 because it barely does this on the sun where we got 10x more effective fusion. and there it doesnt even cause to explode the whole mass. which should happen when we expect -&gt; that fusion can grant energy to produce 10 times the heat like on the sun while still keeping the fusion system working. totally impossible, easy math . omg sience is full of idiots these days . i dont even argue anymore bye , what a waste of time and money, scam pseudoiscience this makes me engry, they should rather put all energy to harness the energy of huricanes", "comment_date": "2019-10-31T13:49:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Lee", "comment_text": "<b>all of the nuclear waste produced by all the nuclear fission plants in human history can be stored within the confines of an end zone on a football field.</b>", "comment_date": "2019-10-31T05:35:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LevanKof", "comment_text": "Make a video about Graphene!

Also the Spark reactor being 1/2 the size of that for a proof of concept which it is estimated it would only take 20 - 30 million to make the Spark reactor because it&#39;s on the scale of test reactors we built today and the costs for that are actually pretty solid.<br><br>It will only be able to run for short periods of time because the vacuum chamber isn&#39;t big enough, but it&#39;s enough for a proof of concept. Basically this all derives from advances in super conductors which enable a doubling in field strength, and your power in a fusion reactor is area x field strength to power 4, so by doubling the field strength you can either get 16x the power with the same vacuum chamber area, or reduce the size of the vacuum chamber are by 16 times for the same amount of power.<br><br>Which improves the economy vastly, honestly I think we should just scrap ITER and put the money into one of these new full sized reactors, as we are not even halve way through building ITER, so going for this instead which should be able to be build ~16x faster would be a better option. as it would still be finished 8x faster than ITER.", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T02:05:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Doe", "comment_text": "I want to see Mass Effect tech be made.

High temperatures will only cause atoms to go their separate ways (e.g. outwardly motions). To be honest, the sun produces heat and light through fission on its dense radioisotopes. No doubt that the atmosphere of the sun is enriched with hydrogen and helium gases and this doesn&#39;t imply that the sun generates heat and light by fusing hydrogen gas into helium gas. The upper atmosphere of the earth is also enriched with hydrogen and helium gases that derived from proton emission and alpha emission respectively on decaying radioisotopes within the core of the earth. Face this: Einstein&#39;s famous equation, E=mc^2 is wrong otherwise garbage also can be used to make nuclear bombs as\u00a0 long as it is matter or it has mass. Energy and matter can&#39;t interchange one another according to Einstein&#39;s famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. All forms of EMWs including light and heat are dynamic photons per volume per time in different saturations. During the detonation of an atomic bomb, gargantuan amount of heat and light have been emitted out. The loss mass during the detonation is equal to all dynamic photons that have been dissipated out during the detonation that released from splitting nuclei of uranium-235 atoms. Therefore without any doubt that photons have mass. Capturing those dynamic photons will cause severe change in momentum therefore a &quot;typhoon-like&quot; winds blew outwardly from the zero-ground. Einstein&#39;s famous equation is the foundation of modern physics. If Einstein&#39;s famous equation is wrong or not true, this will bring the downfall of the entire modern physics. Fusion is a &quot;bluff&quot;! It only takes place during the last phase of the implosion of the entire universe before Big Bang. Only dense and very dense stable elements will be churned out during the last phase of implosion of the universe. As the universe expanding further, those used-to-be stable elements will eventually turn into radioisotopes after the angular momentum of their nucleons is no longer able to resist the strong repulsive forces among protons within their nuclei. Decaying\u00a0on those dense radioisotopes will emit out intense heat and light, this will cause the emergence of stars within the universe. If you are interested in real discoveries, I would recommend you to read my book, The Unification Theory - Volume One and you will be amazed with lots of new, interesting discoveries.

A nuclear reactor&#39;s failure runs a similar course as you mentioned for the fusion reactor, it runs away, the water boils off, and having lost the water used as a moderator, the reaction shuts down. Yes, overheated fuel can melt down and potentially escape containment, just as with the other. It does not explode.

Logiknya adalah kita boleh bayar guna mata wang kripto di pejabat kerajaan dan swasta. Habis yang berlambak-lambak e-wallet yang baru dilancarkan bagai cendawan tumbuh selepas hujan pula bagaimana?<br><br>Apa kata kita dengar penjelasan daripada Mufti Wilayah Persekutuan, SS Dato\u2019 Seri Dr. Zulkifli Bin Mohamad Al-Bakri berkenaan Hukum Penggunaan Mata Wang Bitcoin di bawah:<br><br><br><br>*Awas, penulisan ini adalah panjang, jemput baca sampai habis kalau nak tahu secara mendalam.<br><br>Tapi bagi mereka yang nak versi ringkas pula:<br><br><br> <br>Berdasarkan pemerhatian terhadap amalan semasa, bitcoin lebih dilihat sebagai satu aset pelaburan, dan ia tidak menepati tujuan asal penciptaan bitcoin itu sendiri, iaitu sebagai mata wang alternatif kepada sistem mata wang fiat yang sedia ada<br>Hukum ini boleh berubah jika penambahbaikan dilakukan terhadap bitcoin samada dari sudut pengeluaran, pengawalan harga, sistem keselamatan di bursa dan regulasi untuk mengelakkannya daripada diekploitasi oleh pihak tidak bertanggungjawab<br>Bitcoin yang terdapat pada masa sekarang tidak menepati ciri-ciri mata wang yang telah ditetapkan oleh Islam, diputuskan bahawa Bitcoin mampu mengundang pelbagai kemudaratan terhadap sistem kewangan sesebuah negara. Oleh kerana itu, penggunaan Bitcoin yang ada pada masakini sebagai satu mata wang adalah dilarang bagi memelihara kemaslahatan umum.<br>MUKADIMAH<br><br><br>Isu ini telah dikemukakan oleh orang ramai ke Pejabat Mufti Wilayah Persekutuan menerusi pelbagai medium antaranya aplikasi whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram dan Twitter.<br><br>Mutakhir ini, Bitcoin yang merupakan salah satu daripada jenis mata wang kripto menjadi satu fenomena baharu yang kian mendapat perhatian di seluruh pelusuk dunia. Kemunculan mata wang seumpama ini dianggap sebagai alternatif baharu kepada mata wang sedia ada dalam urus niaga di abad ini.<br><br>Justeru, jika dilihat secara saintifik, bitcoin ini merupakan mata wang digital yang dibangunkan di alam maya dengan menggunakan perkakasan komputer sepenuhnya. Ia bukanlah bersifat fizikal seperti wang kertas yang ada pada hari ini. Keghairahan orang ramai terhadap bitcoin ini telah melonjakkan harganya ke tahap yang tinggi di mana pada awalnya ditawarkan pada harga USD65 dan kini dikatakan harganya berada pada paras USD6,281.76 bersamaan dengan RM26,340 (setakat 13 November 2018).<br><br><br> <br>Baru-baru ini juga, terdapat laporan yang menyatakan sistem emel Media Prima Bhd. telah diserang oleh sekumpulan penggodam siber, dan mereka meminta sebanyak 1000 unit bitcoin sebagai bayaran untuk sistem tersebut kembali kepada sediakala.[1] Ini menunjukkan bahawa bitcoin menjadi sasaran kumpulan penjenayah memandangkan sifatnya yang lebih sukar dikesan berbanding mata wang biasa.<br><br>ISU DAN MASALAH<br>Pada hari ini, urus niaga di alam maya cuba diperluaskan dengan menggunakan bitcoin sebagai alat pertukaran (medium of exchange). Kewujudan sesetengah premis yang kini menggunakan bitcoin membuatkan ramai pengguna cuba mendapatkan mata wang ini meskipun ia bukanlah mata wang yang diiktiraf di kebanyakan negara di peringkat antarabangsa.<br><br>Maka berikut dikemukakan beberapa persoalan yang timbul di sebalik penggunaan mata wang ini, antaranya:<br><br>Adakah bitcoin merupakan mata wang yang sah menurut kaca mata syarak?<br>Adakah bitcoin boleh diperdagangkan dan digunakan dalam transaksi urus niaga?<br>SEJARAH MATA WANG DALAM ISLAM<br>Pada zaman pemerintahan Islam, semenanjung Arab pada ketika itu tidak mempunyai mata wang yang tersendiri. Pada abad ke-6 dan ke-7 masihi, orang Arab terutama yang menetap di Mekah dan Madinah telah memenuhi keperluan mereka dengan menggunakan mata wang syiling yang dikeluar dan digunakan di wilayah-wilayah Empayar Byzantine dan Empayar Sasan yang berjiran atau menggunakan mata wang peninggalan kerajaan silam.[2]<br><br>Setelah terdirinya kerajaan Islam di Madinah, penggunaan mata wang emas Byzantium, solidus dan mata wang Sasan, drachm atau kedua-duanya lebih dikenali oleh orang Arab sebagai dinar dan dirham diteruskan tanpa sebarang perubahan.[3]<br><br>Walaupun banyak usaha-usaha memajukan ekonomi umat Islam di Madinah dilakukan, namun Rasulullah SAW tidak mengubah dan mencetak mata wang baru menggantikan mata wang yang digunakan ketika itu sebaliknya Baginda menerima penggunaannya.[4]<br><br><br> <br>Penggunaan mata wang sedia ada ini berterusan sepanjang pemerintahan Khalifah Abu Bakar, Umar al-Khattab, Uthman bin Affan, Ali bin Abi Talib dan Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan.[5] Perubahan yang berlaku ketika zaman pemerintahan mereka adalah sekadar menambah beberapa ungkapan pada mata wang sedia ada dan tiada usaha menempa mata wang baru dilakukan.<br><br>Pada kemuncaknya iaitu pada zaman Khalifah Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, mata wang Islam dengan jati diri Islami yang tersendiri telah dikeluarkan.[6] Perubahan yang besar meliputi tindakan menghilangkan lambang-lambang tidak Islami dan pada sesetengahnya menggantikan dengan yang lain telah dilakukan. Umpamanya, tanda salib yang terdapat pada mahkota atau topi besi maharaja Byzantium telah dibuang. Begitu juga tanda salib yang ada pada bahagian hadapan dan belakang syiling.<br><br>Selepas daripada usaha tersebut, secara ringkasnya penggunaan syiling emas dan perak sebagai mata wang umat Islam terus berlangsung sehinggalah berakhirnya kerajaan Islam di Turki.[7]<br><br>Sebagai kesimpulan, penggunaan syiling baik perak mahupun emas sebagai mata wang telah dikenali lama sebelum Islam dan tidak bermula dengan orang Islam. Selain itu, pengeluaran mata wang syiling adalah sentiasa berada pada tangan pihak yang berkuasa di setiap negara atau kawasan dan inilah yang berlaku sejak dari awal sejarah sehingga zaman moden.[8]<br><br>KONSEP MATA WANG DALAM ISLAM<br>Mata Wang dalam al-Quran dan al-Hadis<br>Pada dasarnya, konsep umum mata wang yang disebut di dalam al-Quran adalah menjurus kepada mata wang dinar dan dirham.

Energy and matter can&#39;t interchange one another according to Einstein&#39;s famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. The law of conservation of matter and the law of conservation of energy are right. Whereas the law of conservation of energy-matter is wrong. Therefore fusion process even if it is feasible but it will fail\u00a0 to produce additional energy. Because to build a larger nucleus, we need to saturate those nucleons with more stationary photons, instead of releasing out additional photons to the surroundings. So there is not even any trace helium has been detected in any tokamak reactors all over the world until to date. This implies that fusion process is just impossible to take place on earth. Even if it could, it would require\u00a0lots of photons rather than releasing photons to the surroundings. Fusion process is feasible during the &quot;final&quot; implosion of the entire universe where there is high saturation of photons pools around the center of the universe.\u00a0With the presence of high density pressure (acting forces\u00a0from all directions towards a single spot due to the presence of strong gravitational forces of the celestial body), smaller, simpler nuclei would be fused to a larger nucleus at\u00a0the\u00a0same time their nucleons would be saturated with abundant photons that are readily available at that\u00a0 time. So many dense and very dense radioisotopes will be churned out. As the universe continues to expand after Big Bang, angular momentum of nucleons would be used to do work against gravity to fuel expansion. The weakening of\u00a0angular momentum of nucleons of dense and very dense &quot;radioisotopes&quot; would weaken the stability of nucleus and subsequently causing decaying and dynamic photons would be released to the surroundings. Therefore this is how and why all stars are emitting out heat and light through fission process rather than fusion process. Precisely fusion process has been misunderstood. If you like to know more about fusion process, I have just published an article on fusion process on my Facebook on 18th June, 2018, and you may read that. If you\u00a0 are interested in real discoveries, I would recommend you to read my book, The Unification Theory - Volume One and you will be amazed with lots of new, interesting discoveries.

LFTR reactors are crazy amazing, clean, entirely safe, ultra efficient - and they aren&#39;t theoretical, a few have actually been made! Some were already made decades ago. Not much attention was paid to them (or other on 2nd or 3rd gen reactor designs) back then, because of the cold war (and making plutonium). Fusion is a nice dream, it seriously is, but everything we know about it strongly indicates it only happens in the most extreme places like white hot star cores hundreds of times bigger than the planet you stand on. Trying to harness fusion is very likely something that&#39;s simply not possible in any realistic way ( trust me, I&#39;d very much like to be wrong). However, it&#39;s kind of a moot point - we have thorium! It&#39;s common! We have enough to power human&#39;s needs for hundreds of millions of years, arguably up to a billion, with almost no footprint, no long term waste, clean as a whistle, meltdown proof, and it&#39;s already a solid proven concept. People are trying to chase down the golden goose of fusion, yet we already have something just as good around (which doesn&#39;t involve <i>mining on the moon</i> ). Thus I strongly suggest people start spreading the word around!

Lithium actually can degenerate into deuterium and helium three in the core of a fusion reactor because the reaction causes beta radiation. One of the neutrons of the fusion reaction breaks of relative to the speed of light and hits surrounding particles. This can cause lithium to radioactively decay. This means that a stable fusion reaction only needs hydrogen as fuel and lithium present once the reaction has already started. The reason this is important is because the only way fusion reactions become viable as a source of power is to make the reaction stable. A long fusion burn makes back the energy of ignition within a few seconds of activity. So even a fusion reaction lasting 5 or so seconds should be viable as a source of fuel since you would receive double or more of the energy you put in. The biggest hurdle to fusion right now is that the longest fusion reaction was a little more than a second with most only lasting fractions of a second. That&#39;s because the fusion cores aren&#39;t big enough to feasibly feed more fuel into the reactor cell to keep the burn going. That and adding fuel is really hard to begin with since that would most likely depressurize the chamber. The are some groundbreaking theories on the topic, but this video makes fusion reactions sound like only a possibility instead of the inevitability that it actually is.", "comment_date": "2017-10-13T03:18:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grace Heather", "comment_text": "Oh boy here\u2019s the apocalypse we\u2019re gonna mine the moon till there\u2019s none left \ud83d\ude31rip you guys", "comment_date": "2017-10-12T14:55:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Coonstar", "comment_text": "And what to we do when we run out of water to drink?", "comment_date": "2017-10-12T13:02:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "frederick ambaritaa", "comment_text": "the problem of tritium&#39;s rarity could be avoided by connecting a fission reactor filled with lithium ( read why below) to he fusion reactor <br>although tritium is rare you only need a minute amount of it to start the reaction and then it is completely self sustainable due o the fact that you can create tritium by the fission of lithium using a neutron.

Plus, Tritium is one of the two possible products of the D-D reaction, so if you want to use Tritium in your fusion, you can get it that way.  He3 is the other possible product, so if you want that...again, use the D-D reaction to get it.  Once you&#39;re there, D-T and D-He3 both make He4, which is the most common form of Helium.<br><br>So literally all you need is heavy water, an electrolysis machine, and a fusion machine that doesn&#39;t burn more energy than it makes (plus the energy needed to isolate the heavy water from the rest of the water and the energy needed to electrolyse that water to get the deuterium away from the oxygen).<br><br>A couple of safety hazards that you missed, though they&#39;re relatively easy to deal with.  First off is that all of this fuel is hydrogen, which is kinda a problem if you have any fires around.  See the Hindenburg for details.  Second is that the fusion reactions pretty much all throw off neutron radiation, which is really scary for traditional radiation shields because it goes right through things like lead, instead latching onto light elements like hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.  Basically stuff people are made of.  However, water makes for a really effective shield because it has a lot of hydrogen and is quite dense, so you just need to make sure the fusion machine is surrounded by water.  Also, even if things do go wrong in the worst possible way, both of these will tend to have very localized effects.  And a side benefit of that water screen is that the neutrons latching onto hydrogen in that water are making more deuterium and occasionally tritium (it has to hit a deuterium atom for that, so less likely), which means you can have that water tank be the storage for water going through the deuterium extraction process and get better yields from it.", "comment_date": "2017-05-31T04:42:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unhinged Connoisseur", "comment_text": "Aaaannd now people will use all the earth&#39;s  supply of seawater for energy", "comment_date": "2017-05-30T19:03:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unhinged Connoisseur", "comment_text": "We have the Z Machine!

On earth, you would have to replicate the conditions of the inside of a star to get individual particles to fuse. To create those conditions, a considerable amount of energy is needed. You also need fuel so again, unlike stars that already have fuel, you would need to get fuel because on Earth, deuterium, tritium, and helium-3 aren&#39;t lying around in concentrated pure forms. Once again, you need energy to produce the fuel. Since you need an unnatural mechanism to replicate the conditions of the inside of a star, you will use what you have available. Unlike stars that only fail when they completely run out of fuel, on Earth you will have materials that will be exposed to all sorts of particles and will rapidly degrade. You will need both energy and raw materials to feed the beast that is a man-made fusion reactor. Failure to constantly replace parts will lead to constant failures with the reactor and eventually you will burn through so much cash the only way to stay in business is to get links in Congress. Unfortunately for you, Republicans don&#39;t like you so you will lose. You then have to accept the principles of capitalism and shut your business down because  you lost more money than what you made.

We&#39;ve worked on it for 60+ years. Even with advanced synthetic future materials Tokamak wouldn&#39;t be even close to the best choice of fusion facilitation, but government is milking billions of tax dollars on this stupidity. There is a known previously developed \u201csun in a bottle\u201d to coin his phrase. Not sun hot, but a constant average of 700 degrees Fahrenheit, and self stable because of expansion it won\u2019t go above 800 degrees. ... This cartoon talked about fission producing waste as if there\u2019s no fission technology which is nearly waste free, when in fact there is, it\u2019s just not allowed to be developed. Our current LWR fission fuel is 100% waste when done fissioning! Very long term toxic waste accumulation nightmare! This is solid fuels inherent problem, because solid fuel fission atoms are too far apart for complete fissioning. And far worse, if there&#39;s a meltdown it&#39;s an unstoppable unmitigated disaster of mega proportions.  LFTR the old GALT Chemical Reactor of the 60\u2019s has been kept from humanity at all cost. LFTR&#39;s chemically assisted so the atoms are as close as you can possibly get them, yet no possibility of meltdown. The information age has brought this to light, so now the US DOD is giving all our knowledge, old and new, to the Communist Chinese Government to lock up any intellectual property in that gloBULL Empire controlled dictatorship. Today\u2019s solid fuel water cooled fission only uses a pathetic .05%. Whereas the \u201csun in a bottle\u201d chemically assisted fission called LFTR uses 97% of the fissile potential, about 1% becomes sellable high valued isotopes, about 2% becomes waste, which is completely safe after a 200 year half life. We can easily deal with that. All present forms of energy production have environmental impacts, but none including so called renewables come anywhere near as clean as LFTR, no contest, not even remotely close. Plus, cheap LFTR energy will bring us to the synthetic material age, so Helium 3 fusion can actually be done. Spark to coil induction though, not Tokamak. Tokamak can be done with carbon synthetics for the magnetic suspension coils, but by the time we have that technology we\u2019ll just use the scalable power production where power is needed fusion spark magnetic field to coil induction. No massive, wasteful, vulnerable, albatross power grid needed, like large centralized Tokamak&#39;s would require. <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115372275668075364660/posts\">https://plus.google.com/115372275668075364660/posts</a>", "comment_date": "2016-11-22T14:30:39Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Elsa Bienenstock", "comment_text": "Hi Steve, I just wanna say I love your videos (and your voice too (:)!

One has to wonder exactly how usable electricity is obtained from fusion.  Fusion reactions produce neutrons.  Neutron detectors are a sure fire way of knowing if your fusion reactor is working or not.  Neutrons emitted from a fusion reactor have to be slowed down and captured in a wall of lithium.  The lithium heats up, and the heat is used to generate steam.  The steam turns the turbine.  This is not very much different than how most nuclear reactors work, sans the whole meltdown scenario.  However, when neutrons collide with matter, they can turn the matter radioactive.  Thus, fusion reactors do produce nuclear waste.  Neutron collisions also degrade the materials used in the reactor, as elements within the material convert into different elements with different properties after being hit by a free neutron.", "comment_date": "2016-11-11T06:09:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C Danny Johnson", "comment_text": "Your videos are extremely educational.

The current plan with fusion power is to take deuterium from seawater and use lithium to breed tritium.  Then use the deuterium and tritium in the reactor.  Processing the deuterium and tritium takes far less energy than the fusion reaction can produce, making it feasable.  Deuterium and helium-3, like you mentioned, are a possible method, but acquiring He-3 is very difficult.  It is also possible to use only two deuteriums, but this is difficult.  <br><br>Heck, even regular nuclear fission isn&#39;t as bad as people claim.  Look at Fukoshima: a 40 year old plant was hit by one of the worst possible natural disasters and hasn&#39;t managed to kill anybody yet.  Even the excess-cancer risks are tiny compared to natural radiation.  Only 30 people (all plant workers) recieved doses large enough cause a noticeably higher likelyhood of cancer (still really low).  Chernobyl was bad, but it was also easily preventable: they didn&#39;t even have a containment building (like all first-world reactors use).  In the US, more people have been killed by solar power accidents than nuclear power accidents (even though nuclear power produces 40 times more energy than solar).  The nice thing about the waste is that it&#39;s so small: most reactors keep the waste on sight so they can monitor it and it doesn&#39;t take up much space.  That&#39;s probbaly why we haven&#39;t had any issues with storing it.  Heck, if you recycle the waste (like France does), you only need to store it for about 300 years before it is safe.  The exception is nuclear weapons: the waste from the production of nuclear weapons has been pretty bad (mostly because nuclear weapons were developed before we really knew what to do with the waste).  But since we arent mass-producing nuclear weapons anymore, at least that isn&#39;t going to get worse.", "comment_date": "2016-11-11T05:56:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H D", "comment_text": "did you say 10 billion dollars?<br>The US has dumped more than that in projects that benefit a few select.", "comment_date": "2016-11-11T05:56:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hu3rrik", "comment_text": "Aaaaaaaaaaaaand that&#39;s why Vegito will kick Zamazu&#39;s ass", "comment_date": "2016-11-11T05:56:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nihal S", "comment_text": "Could you make a video on artificial photosynthesis some time in the future please?", "comment_date": "2016-11-11T05:56:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NewJak14", "comment_text": "New fission reactor designs are solving the waste and safety issues of nuclear fission.

The (now heated) liquid Lithium would then run through a heat exchanger to boil water, and an extractor to retrieve the precious tritium.<br>The point about producing no waste, unfortunately, is not true; those high-energy neutrons activate everything, making the walls of the reactor hideously radioactive (depending on design, the neutron flux is roughly 10x higher than for a fission reactor).<br>Helium 3 offers a more accessible fuel alternative but is still hard to get to.<br>Proton-boron fusion would be great, as no activating neutron radiation is produced and boron is plentiful (in comparison to H3 and Tritium), but the rate of the reaction is orders of magnitude less than for a D-T reaction, necessitating temperatures of billions of degrees for a viable reactor (not currently feasible, and unlikely to be), and far higher plasma pressures too.", "comment_date": "2016-11-10T20:22:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joel", "comment_text": "i just kept waiting for a steven universe fusion joke.", "comment_date": "2016-11-10T20:22:45Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "AK 90", "comment_text": "Quantum mechanics for next video!", "comment_date": "2016-11-10T20:22:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Vandale", "comment_text": "Wow, it seems your video quality is getting better.

This is due to the fact that a reaction 3He+D may not result in radiation causing Neutrons, but there are still Deuterium atoms flying around in there and since Helium 3 and Deuterium need more energy to fuse, than D+D reactions, there will be D+D reactions, causing neutrons. The second flaw with Helium 3 is that it is located <b>on the moon!</b> That is 300.000km at least, plus the atmospheric ascend, plus sustaining a permanent moon base. That is more input cost than you&#39;ll get out of it. Especially because we will need at least 150 tons of 3He, if we want to power the whole world with it. And how much 3He is there per cubic meter of moon dust? I can not say for certain, but we would still need to sift through tons and tons of lunar regolith and only get a single kilogram.

I understand it would be extremely expensive but when the payoff is near unlimited energy with almost no environmental issues (and the only ones that there are are mostly negligible). the other potential issue other than Tritium Water is that while the fusion itself is clean mostly clean, ... well notice that i said mostly. deuterium has 1 neutron, tritium has 2 neutrons, deuterium and tritium fuse to form helium. but helium only has 2 neutrons, just like tritium, so where does that extra neutron go? it gets flung out of the plasma, unaffected by the super-cooled toridal electromagnets (btw im talking about the tokomak design, i dont know very much about the others so this may not be an issue with those) due to neutrons having no charge. I forgot what the magnets would be made of but lets say they are iron for simplicity&#39;s sake, when those neutrons fly out, they will likely merge with whatever they hit, now if they hit the magnets, to start with its no issue but the iron that makes up those magnets is eventually going to turn into something like iron-60, a radioactive isotope of iron, which will eventually decay until the magnet is no longer functional,  and then that magnet has to be replaced, and those magnets wouldnt come cheap. again its all about weighing up the pros vs the cons. personally im pro-fusion but thats just my opinion.", "comment_date": "2016-11-10T18:59:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mr.obvious", "comment_text": "hey kurzgesagt.
