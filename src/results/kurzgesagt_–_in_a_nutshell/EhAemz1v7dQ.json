In a word, cost.  Least expensive of all is gas, indicatively about 1-1.5 mln usd/MW.  Adding a combined cycle, 1.5-2.  Coal goes for 2-2.5.  Hydroelectric 2-4. Solar 1-1.25 (has gone down a lot over the years). Wind 1.3-1.5 onshore, a bit more offshore.  Nuclear 6-8! Ouch!  The first pair is relatively inexpensive, but you must buy the fuel, gas, coal, diesel, fuel oil for its entire lifespan.  Nuclear too, but this cost is minimal.  Then comes the time required to build each installation.  Wind and solar are quickest, a thermal plant for gas, coal or liquid fuels can take a couple of years, hydro can be 2-5 years or more, depending on size and complexity, and nuclear...10-15 years! But this is not all of the story.  Then comes the percentage of hours in a year that each generation method may be used.  Solar works only with sunshine, much less on cloudy days and not at all during the night. Better in summer than in winter, and closest to the equator helps.  On average, 20-35% of the time.  Same with wind. Just works when the wind blows. Similar percentage.  Next comes hydro.  Most dams create a lake, the higher the better, the more electricity it will generate.  But then usually there are rainy and dry seasons, so they can operate a third of the time, except those dams on the biggest rivers, where it can be 50% or more.  Fossil fuel plants of course can operate round the clock, but they are expensive on a dollar per MWh basis, so they are used when there is no better option, typically during the evening electricity demand peak (when prices are highest, obviously).  Here nuclear reigns supreme: it can generate upwards of 95% of the hours of the year, effortlessly.  So far supply.  Demand (and selling prices) change throughout the hours of the day and with the seasons, or special events.  Lowest at night when people sleep, then it goes up in the morning, and is highest in the evening when lights are on, food is cooked, tv is watched, etc.  Also on unseasonably cold or hot days, and during the most popular sports events.  People gather and watch the game on tv and don&#39;t consume much electricity.  Solar generation is highest between noon and early afternoon, when prices are lowest.  Wind blows when it blows.  Nuclear and hydro can take full advantage of the highest prices, and fossil fuel plants are normally lit up for peak demand.  So from this very brief introduction we see that nuclear has very high initial investment costs, it requires a long time to build, but long term it offers the lowest costs per MWh, which is the number that counts.  This leaves out the poorer countries that cannot afford the expense.  Then there is the other sticky issue, that in many countries electric generation is by public utilities, frequently state owned.  No politician will make an investment that will only be ready in a decade, and will be inaugurated by the opposition party.  Perhaps a good reason why of all places nuclear plants go strongest in China.  The communist party believes they will be in charge forever.", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T16:25:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason", "comment_text": "Short answer.

The political, economic, social and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind energy and electricity storage technologies has improved dramatically over the past few years. In contrast, the adoption of nuclear energy and CO2 capture and storage (CCS) in the electricity sector has been slower than the growth rates anticipated in stabilisation scenarios. Emerging evidence since AR5 indicates that small-scale technologies (e.g., solar, batteries) tend to improve faster and be adopted more quickly than large-scale technologies (nuclear, CCS)...&quot;.

Unlike fossil fuels, uranium has never been part of<br> Earth&#39;s energy cycle, without humans causing a nuclear reaction, this <br>energy would remain trapped forever. <br><br>It is 1950s technology, using steam power, an even older technology of <br>the 19th century when global warming was just being started, to run <br>turboines. It has thus added the sum total of energy released to the <br>problem of a warming world, and cqannot be considered any part of a <br>solution. Yet nbuclear cultists continue to claim it is thechnology for <br>the future, that anyone who opposes it is a Luddite and doesn&#39;t <br>understand, that nuclrear supporters are advanced and hampered by the <br>ignorant. Actually the reverse is true, modern technology is harnessing <br>power from wind, water, tides and sun, this technology did not exist <br>back in the 1950s when nuclear was started principally to supply <br>plutonium for weapons. The mind set of its fans is thus fixed in the <br>1950s, and no amount of raqtional argument or logic seems capable of <br>persuading them it is not what it seems. That&#39;s why I call it a cult; <br>based on false beliefs, mired with secrecy and misinformation, and <br>growing every more costly so much so that nuclear builders demand a high<br> energy cost paid by consumers to profit them into the future. So <br>electricy bills would need to rise and rise to pay for the costs whiuch <br>run into many billions and are revised upwards during the course of the <br>ten years or so build time. Renrewables at the sdame time are halving in<br> cost annually and are now the cheapest and fastest means of supplying <br>actual clean cheap energy, something nuclear constantly claims when what<br> it produces is worse than dirty and costs the Earth. <br><br>The only possible future is 100% actual renewables, and not those <br>claimed as renewable which are simply not, such as geothermal, which <br>again adds all the energy created to the already warming planet, energy <br>which would otherwise remain deep in the planel&#39;s crust. Nuclear power <br>pumps billions of gallons of hot water into the oceans, considered waste<br> by the blinkered nuclear cultists and of no consequence, illustrating <br>their total ignorance of not just the ecosystem but of energy reality. <br><br>It would be good to see Wikipedia reflect this reality and not be so <br>encouraging and complacent about nuclear. And I haven&#39;t once mentioned <br>nuclear disasters, of which there are hundreds but only t5he biggest are<br> mentioned, and the continuing problem of sp-ent fuel, which has always <br>going to be a problem for future generations to cope with, I think <br>future generations are going to have trouble enough simply surviving the<br> shattered world we will be leaving them. Another problem o9f nuclear <br>never considered or mentioned is the fact of sea levelk rise and the <br>inconvenient fact that nuclear power stations are almost always situated<br> on coasts at sea level for access to unlimited cooling water, the <br>energy so transferred being pumped straight into the sea. Perhaps <br>nuclear fans can enlighten everyone on what will happen to a flooded <br>nuclear pile? <br><br>And with Thwaites Glacier due to break off into the sea in a matter of <br>2-5 years, I wonder if any politicians are considering how to <br>decommision all the existing nuclear plants in the world before that <br>happens.

They also believe there&#39;s a lack of political will to build nuclear reactors, which it really isn&#39;t. The problem of building nuclear is the high cost. Nuclear is not financially viable. That&#39;s not even getting into all the general issues with nuclear power. They don&#39;t create clean energy. The water that is used to cool the uranium rods is poisoned in the process and the plant solves that by using two water systems of an isolated cooling fluid for the rods and another fluid to heat up into water vapor to run the turbines who actually produce the electrity. Nuclear power plants can therefore not be built anywhere. They&#39;re only viable in coasts and rigorous safety measures must be made in order to avoid polluting the water source it brings in to run the turbine operation. That&#39;s not to mention the issues of waste treatment and iodine enrichment among residents in the vicinity. These are all things that make nuclear energy expensive and uncompteitive.

Sure that electric power proportion among globals could be raised but it would not prevent us from burning any oil, gas or coal at all or simply reduce the greater part from global emissions. <br><br>Agriculture (ruminants, rice cultures, fertilizers...) release a lot of gas emissions too (which are not necessarily made from CO2 but have the same effect on global warming), same about industrial uses such as cement, aluminium or steel production.Think of a building made from no cement or steel, hard to find competitive alternatives while people need some place to live in. Even wind energy require a lot of aluminium whose production is heavily polluting. <br><br>Beside, transportation implies greenhouse gas emissions and switching fossil fueled cars, trucks, boats and even planes for eletric powered ones would require HUGE batteries which would get complicated to even create in sufficient numbers, not to mention that solar panels themselves rely on these materials and last for thirty years at best with almost non-existent recycling of used panels. Same goes for wind energy by the way, devices are just buried into the ground and raising demands from aluminium foundries to provide new ones.

The new reactors are designed much better and they have advanced failsafe technology so the chance of a disaster goes from 1 every few decades, to 1 every few thousand years. Nuclear disaster and operational casualty numbers are also comparable to coal power plant worker casualties per KW, and once you factor in the deaths caused by coal pollution in the world, it\u2019s a no brainer. Nuclear, even with old tech reactors, is the safest form of solid baseload power. New tech reactors take that casualty number per KW and drive it down even further. <br><br>Now that comparison between big disaster casualties and coal worker/pollution casualties is a bit of a bad one, but it still gives good perspective to how horrible coal is. What needs to happen to make nuclear truly safe from disasters is to increase funding to develop safer next generation reactors and there needs to be extreme regulation on operation protocol and reactor design. <br><br>Nuclear waste is becoming less and less as well as reactors become more efficient, and there are some very safe storage strategies. The amount of nuclear waste is minuscule as well, as I\u2019ve heard that the nuclear waste produced over the lifetime of nuclear power in the USA only takes up a single medium sized room. Deep underground storage with robotic access is a great method.  I\u2019ve heard of ideas where you put the waste deep into a certain geological area where the earths geological processes suck it down into the mantle. If rockets become more reliable, then sending payloads into space isn\u2019t even a bad idea either, as silly as it sounds. It wouldn\u2019t hit anything for billions of years, and it\u2019s 99.9999% likely that it would just be consumed by some star somewhere.  Given the small amount of nuclear waste created it wouldn\u2019t be much of an issue, as long as the chance of rockets exploding decreases dramatically.<br><br>Renewables like solar and wind are a great idea in lots of places, but it cannot be implemented nearly fast enough and depending on the power source it isn\u2019t a great option for reliable power. It\u2019s also quite expensive and resource intensive. Obviously that\u2019s far in the future, if at all, but the regular deep underground storage is totally fine today. There have been no accidents related to waste storage in recent time with modern knowledge, or maybe even ever. <br><br>I hope fusion ends up working out because that would truly be the best option for power and it would solve the worlds power issues forever. But for the time being, until we crack the fusion code, we must use nuclear to avoid extinction from climate change.<br><br>We are running out of time, and constantly discussing the improbable future of a world powered by solar and wind is wasting it.

I&#39;ve often heard that if we were to make nuclear a &quot;major player&quot;, handling the bulk of our energy needs, we would rather quickly run out of Uranium fuel. Uranium can be sequestered from sea water, but not in the quantities that would likely be required.<br><br>Thorium remains a theoretical alternative due its incredible abundance, but thorium plants (like the Fluoride Salt reactor) are very caustic and have only been tried out at lab scale, not yet at industrial scale.<br><br>My general issue with the &quot;we should invest in anything that helps us&quot;.... is that not all players are created equal, not even close. Wave power is a good example, even with good efficiency, covering all the oceans with wave power generators generates a tiny fraction of what solar power could provide. It is, I&#39;m sorry to say, not a technology we should be investing in. We have got to get some of these technologies to tipping point where market economics take over and we see rapid adoption (aka if solar becomes cheaper than fossil fuel, than solar production gets rapidly adopted by the market and the rest tends to itself). Trying to push a bunch of different technologies to that point is incredibly wasteful and slows down each one.... and we are running out of time.<br><br>At the end of the time, we need to pick a couple of race horses and run with them.

toxic chemicals being used\u2026<br><br>Regardless if the wind blows or not (as mentioned in the video)\u2026<br><br>While solar energy and wave energy (should a proper solution for this type be

that exist today already are pretty small and is capable of safely contain any radiation even if it were to malfunction against all odds\u2026<br><br>They are buried underground and is encased with protective \u201cshells\u201d\u2026 <br><br>Even in the case of a leak they would still not make it past the outer layers therefore there won\u2019t be any radiation\u2026<br><br>While I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s 100% safe due to the fact that it could still be sabotaged from the outside if someone were to blast through all the protective casing\u2026<br><br>Or if some natural disaster were to happen (but in this case the nuclear plant might just be no worse for wear)\u2026<br><br>The nuclear power available today can use the fuel from old models and be active for hundreds of years without even using any new fuel\u2026<br><br>Yes even if it can lasts us for millennia\u2019s to come it will eventually run out unless we find ways to create new nuclear fuel\u2026<br><br>But assuming that enough time has passed for this to happen it\u2019s entirely possibly that sustainable renewable energy sources has been developed by then\u2026<br><br>Assuming that humanity lives to this point\u2026 our current path of reinstalling coal and other energy sources while shutting down nuclear plants just to satisfy some political agenda needs to stop\u2026<br><br>Again renewable

Because they didn&#39;t wanted the american to destroy their ground, americans just. Killed them and took it, while being sure it stays a secret. Those materials are needed for you phone, TV,  tablets, computer..<br><br>PLEASE, ALWAYS CONCIDER THE FULL ASPECTS OF IT.

The terrain changes and the soil is damaged. It gets pressurized to the point where the natural pores dissappear and it no longer the water through. Ramps of soil that are built near highways drain the terrain of water. The underground water dries out too. The surface becomes dense and further prevents from water draining. Erosion happens more frequently. Vegetation dries on the newly drained landmass. Those surfaces spread and desert grows. Precipitation diminishes which further contributes to the area becoming dry.

So a huge solution to helping the climate is real investment into A new contender to battery&#39;s and combustion engine and increased investment into making better battery&#39;s.

You completely ignored examples like Denmark which have been able to rapidly reach high levels of renewables while almost exclusively using wind power and electrifying sectors like heating. Today there are only 2 coal power plants left in the entire country and off shore wind power is rapidly installing more capacity. You only showed a graph from California which is quite misleading because it is literally the opposite situation in Denmark where off shore wind is the main source of wind power, in winter wind generation often reaches close to 150% of power demand and on some days even exceeds 3x the energy demand. In general off shore wind tends to produce the most during winter and at night and in the early morning, which nicely fits together with solar power. Nuclear however is hardly fit for filling these gaps though as it is best for baseline power, you really can&#39;t just turn off a nuclear reactor so instead we just have to leave it running and disconnect it from the grid, meaning that if we massively invest in nuclear now in 10 years we&#39;re just gonna have a bunch of reactors that sit idle most of the time doing us little good. Off shore wind of course isn&#39;t possible everywhere but there&#39;s also a lot of potential for bi phase geothermal power which has yet to be explored at all as well. The focus on nuclear just seems counter productive when there are several areas of renewables which could benefit from a lot more investment while nuclear provides relatively little bang for it&#39;s buck.<br><br>Like your source for the claim that there are increased calls for nuclear power is one article from 2013, and the IPCC report which says that most paths for carbon neutral by 2050 involves nuclear but that several others don&#39;t.

Ask a historian why almost every nuclear reactor (93%) on earth is the same type, the Uranium-235 reactor. The reason, you ask? The US and Soviet Russia developed them as a way to have enriched uranium on tap after ww2 as a way to get around international sanctions on stocking enriched uranium for the purposes of building nuclear bombs. Fun fact, Uranium-235 comprises less than 1% of all naturally occurring uranium on earth. So the current state of nuclear power? Nearly all active plants were built decades ago using less than optimal designs even for the time (The LFTR has existed nearly as long as the Uranium-235 reactor) so that the wealthy nations had a loophole for international law cuz nuclear bombs are more important that energy output, resource abundance, or even cost effectiveness. <br><br>Also, the video kind of makes it seem like renewables aren&#39;t able to output enough energy for the worlds current consumption. Lets get something straight, they&#39;ve been able to output enough energy to replace fossil fuels for nearly 2 decades, there just hasn&#39;t been a good way to store that energy. They touched on that a little, but they didn&#39;t focus on it nearly as much as they should&#39;ve. Solar alone could&#39;ve killed fossil fuels 20 years ago even with the terrible efficiency it had then. Wind could&#39;ve killed fossil fuels 15 years ago. Hydropower has constantly been getting better and better for nearly half a century. The only thing holding them back, technologically, is energy storage. Thats it. They aren&#39;t incapable of producing the energy, theres just nowhere to store it. Which isn&#39;t even a problem if you use nuclear when the renewables aren&#39;t generating enough power for whatever reason.<br><br>Electric cars have existed for nearly a decade, with most major auto-manufacturers finally taking them seriously and trying to snap Tesla&#39;s crown of &quot;best EV maker&quot; from them. Wireless charging units have existed for years and are even being deployed for prototype mail trucks. The entire pedestrian ICE industry is obsolete and the enterprise ICE industry isn&#39;t far behind.<br><br>So, in all honesty, there isn&#39;t a reason why we CAN&#39;T transition.

I loved that you clarified that there aren&#39;t any &quot;perfect&quot; energy sources, even in the case of hydroelectric (destroys lots of fauna and flora), eolic (consumes some rare materials and disturbs bird migration), and solar (rare materials, low efficiency, high production cost). I just want to comment on two things that may interest you guys in possible future researches/videos/whatever:<br>1 - Talk about the importance of the &quot;decentralization&quot; of resources/energy for specific regions in our world. For instance, some regions unfortunately not have proper conditions to get 100% of their current energy requirements from renewable sources, while other countries do not have enough technology/money to make such investments in short and(or) long terms. Another point is that countries like Brazil have opportunities to obtain &quot;renewable&quot; energy sources like sugarcane biomass, for instance, which has a great impact in several aspects (economic, environmental, transport) even though this was not mentioned. <br>2 - Another huge point that many people forget in our direction to sustainability is the availability of materials, certain chemical elements (e.g., lithium and other rare metals for electric batteries and smartphones), which are increasing the demand for mining, therefore destroying several environments in our world.", "comment_date": "2021-04-24T16:51:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unknown Ape", "comment_text": "My opinion is that we should focus on nuclear for the time being and archive that technology while still bettering renewables but nuclear would be the safe choice as it would slow the timer that is climate change", "comment_date": "2021-04-24T16:40:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seyam Rahman", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhAemz1v7dQ&amp;t=2m08s\">2:08</a> how did magnemite get in this video?", "comment_date": "2021-04-24T16:35:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shoubhik Saha", "comment_text": "Renewable are fancy fantasies..just a gimmick ...

Yes, Nuclear reactors running causes fewer deaths during their operation, but as we&#39;ve seen with the epidemic turning off a power plant or a factory causes an immediate restoration to the biosphere while nuclear waste has to be stored indefinately. I see nuclear energy as an energy debt borrowed from future generations who will be forced to care for our garbage for longer than human civilization has existed. That doesn&#39;t seem very reasonable to me. In fact, it&#39;s very selfish to borrow from our grandchildren. It&#39;s short term emissions may be low, but it&#39;s long term is way too high for comfort.<br><br>The compromise that I have is this: Lift the ban on breeder reactors and instead ban the extraction of new nuclear fuel from mines. Use the existing nuclear waste to produce energy through the end of the lives of the current reactors and only build new reactors if doing so would further decrease the nuclear stockpile and waste we already have. Phase nuclear out with as little waste as possible left over for future generations to deal with.<br><br>While this phase out is going on, transition towards the use of things like kinetic batteries to store energy (i.e. pinwheel or well style) and with the ability to store such energy begin widespread use of things like the typhoon generator to capture and store the energy of major storm events such that we don&#39;t need to produce any other energy. Or we could build geothermal power stations around locations like yellow stone (and simultaneously reduce the risk of a mega volcanic eruption powerful enough to end the human race). Or any number of other proposals. <br><br>Trading one evil for another just isn&#39;t the answer. <br>I would FULLY support the movement to create new plants that are designed to make use of our existing nuclear waste, but I have ZERO support for the movement to increase the use of nuclear fuel in general.", "comment_date": "2021-04-22T05:22:56Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "carlos juliao", "comment_text": "<b>kurzgesagt peeps</b> - please tell me that the final portion of this video is being made into a game - HUGE potential for that", "comment_date": "2021-04-22T05:01:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tudor Razvan", "comment_text": "Hopefully fusion reactors will help alleviate this issue in the future", "comment_date": "2021-04-22T04:53:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Vogel", "comment_text": "&quot;Opinion part starts here&quot;..... <b>Still speaks straight facts</b>", "comment_date": "2021-04-22T04:50:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rainynight02", "comment_text": "Would help if the people calling for all this weren&#39;t hypocrites. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f<br>If people would actively chose to use less electricity, the overall demand would drop to where it&#39;s needed not just wanted, and better able for us to cover it.<br><br>I say go nuclear.", "comment_date": "2021-04-22T04:43:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ayaan Shaikh", "comment_text": "Love the Tenet reference @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhAemz1v7dQ&amp;t=6m16s\">6:16</a> !!", "comment_date": "2021-04-22T04:38:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NCake", "comment_text": "Great video!

When I give actual ratings for the various energy sources, these will be relative comparisons to how well they do compared to a typical 1000kW Coal fired power plant (oil is fairly comparable, natural gas is actually quite poor as it has a lower energy density so a natural gas power plant has to consume a much larger raw volume of fuel for the same power).<br><br>ENERGY DENSITY: This means how much raw land area does a power plant of a particular type need to create the 1000kW reliably<br><br>LOCATION DEPENDENCY: This means how dependent is a particular power plant type on being placed in a specific topography (for example, you&#39;re not going to be able to put a hydro power plant in the middle of a flat desert, but several other types can work there<br><br>FUEL CONSUMPTION: This is for the raw mass of fuel needing to be consumed to provide the power<br><br>RELIABILITY: This represents how effectively a plant can provide its power output at all times, 24 hours a day.

The storage of waste is another thing that we still haven&#39;t worked out completely and just shooting it into space isn&#39;t an option because nobody wants a rocket to fail and create a dirty bomb, also Uranium&#39;s heavy.<br>I was in my early teens when Fukushima happened. In school we started to read a novel which was written some years after Chernobyl, where a nuclear power plant in the heart of Europe explodes and the whole of Europe suffers the consequences. I watched with tears in my eyes television, where fire fighters and other personel, fully knowing that they&#39;d suffer the consequences of radiation for the rest of their lifes, if not dying because of it, still packing their things and heading towards the nuclear reactor, trying to contain the destructive power contained within. I am now in my second semester of studying engineering and I&#39;m already thinking about what I want to specialize myself in during the master, if I want to go towards aerospace, which has always been my passion, or if I want to go towards nuclear engineering, which I think would give me the greatest sense of purpose. I still need to pass my classes until I can make a decision of course.<br>In my eyes, the big campaigns started all over the world had positive and negative effects. Old Nuclear Power Plants, in the vicinity of one I live, have been looked at again and deemed unfit to continue service, rightly so. But the negative effects far outweighed the positive ones. What people tend to forget is that Chernobyl was a gigantic accident with mistakes made on every level and Fukushima was hit with an earthquake and a tsunami. I&#39;m not trying to undermine the effect these accidents had, Chernobyl&#39;s surrounding area has started healing and the japanese are still occupied with cleaning up the mess and will be for some decades but they were mistakes, faults, accidents that weren&#39;t foreseen. It was a great push towards sustainable and renewable energies but it was taken too abruptly without planning, based solely on fear. Yes, take the old ones off the grid but replace them with new plants, safer plants, more efficient plants!<br><br>Yes, renewables are the definite way forward but we need something to close the gap until then, until the manufacturing lines for the wind and solar power plants are, until the viable building zones have been found, until the reliability problems have been fixed. Continuing nuclear power development isn&#39;t working against renewables, something people didn&#39;t understand or didn&#39;t want to understand ten years ago, it is holding the gate open by force until we can find a way to stop it from closing. Until we can live and advance truly sustainable, the least of evils is the right choice, which undoubtedly is nuclear power. What really ticks me off is that during all those years where nuclear reactors could&#39;ve been vastly improved upon and research could&#39;ve been done, super powers focused and still focus on waging war half way across the planet, flexing their own puny might that won&#39;t even last a minute compared to the live span of the planet and the one that we humans could have (had).<br>I desperately hope that the recent push back towards nuclear power will work or I&#39;m afraid that we&#39;ll have to stop focusing on how we can save our planet and every living thing and instead have to start looking into how or even if humans can survive, even if the ecosystem we rely upon does not, which is a task that will be not only improbable but impossible.", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T13:12:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mag pie", "comment_text": "The nucler waist should go back in to the mine where we get it from", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T13:12:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moai", "comment_text": "i like the ending music, so peaceful.", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T13:06:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Melinda", "comment_text": "You should do a video on the recently invented Allam Cycle and net-zero natural gas plants!", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T13:05:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ke Sis", "comment_text": "Could you please touch on how production of renewable tech still uses carbon-emmiting power sources and the numbers of the whole cunnundrum?

At some point, ecosystems will be affected so much that food safety will be affected and people will lose their jobs.

Each generating station will consist of a 5x5 grid of 25 separate 10 gigawatt nuclear power plants. Every power plant in the grid and every plant around the world is cookie cutter, exactly the same in layout and design. A worker from one plant should be able to swap positions with another worker on the opposite end of the world with no change in work.<br>Considering we have had no trouble finding coal, oil, or natural gas in the 100 or so years we have been mining it, acquiring uranium should be no issue. While massive open pit mines are not preferred, when uranium has 300 X the energy density of coal, we only need 1/300 of the environmental scar we currently have to replace the entire coal industry.<br>Nuclear waste consists of irradiated water or salt, mechanical parts, and the spent uranium itself. Sealed inside a solid meter of lead, all the nuclear waste in the world would take hundreds of generations of humans living in the same house to feel the effects of radiation. But to assure that nuclear waste can never contaminate the environment: a box about 15 meters squared should hold the nuclear waste of 25 plants for 75 years, the edges are rounded, 1 millimeter of Xenon-124, followed by 2 meters of solid lead, 5 centimeter steel shell, 1.4 million cubic meters of concrete to cover the whole thing, in the bottom of a 5,000 foot deep open pit mine (yes I just swapped from metric to imperial) located in Colorado.<br>Fission plants provide base load power, they produce the same amount of electricity all day, every day, for 80 years. Global energy consumption is at 23.4 Petawatts, thought at times it can be only half that. Using Nuclear as our sole source of energy, would mean getting excess electricity in the terawatt range. And with that extra power we could: desalinate the oceans and irrigate every desert on earth, separate hydrogen and oxygen from water and release beneficial oxygen to the atmosphere, and use the hydrogen produced to power any vehicle with an internal combustion engine.<br>Batteries are a pipe dream, they always have and always will be inefficient. We can and should produce more energy than we use, so long as the excess is being used to benefit us or the environment we live in.<br><br>Nuclear power is the energy source of the future. It produces no carbon emissions, has the best safety record of any power generating plant type, can operate in any location without relying on natural forces, produces less waste than all but one power plant type, and uses less fuel than any power plant type. The opponents of Nuclear energy and the politicians they voted in are holding back our energy generating potential, suppressing technology that could have helped us end climate change before it began. Opponents of atomic energy are the equivalent of the church silencing people for saying the world is not flat, a superstitious mob stuck in the past.", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T07:38:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ArthurMint", "comment_text": "uh, what about fusion?", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T07:38:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abstract Sheep", "comment_text": "there is no global warming, stop this nonsense", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T07:17:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Programmer 47", "comment_text": "Just to let everyone know, &quot;Green&quot; Party activists are not green.

Investing in both , nice idea but we are in post pandemic recovery, every penny or cent needs to work hard.   In the UK, we ought to put our efforts and funds into harnessing the power of our coastline , waves tides etc.  We had a vision in the 1970s that could have made us self sufficient with tidal power but the EU priority was for solar and wind and we abandoned that thought but tidal energy is baseline power with little outages for seconds as the tide changes.

Without cheap electricity, we would never have started recycling scrap metal.  Replacing fossil fuels with anything that does not cost less will hurt recycling efforts.<br><br>Combined cycle nuclear generating plants that use closed cycle, gas core reactors can use magnetohydrodynamic cycles at the high temperature end, gas turbines in the middle, and steam turbines at the low temperature end.  By varying where the energy is extracted, the end-to-end thermal efficiency can be controlled, so the electricity produced can vary faster than the thermal output of the fission reaction can be changed.  A nuclear generating station that can actually follow loads would reduce demand for peaking power, dropping the need for storage, as well as reducing costs.  In an environment where the difference between the cost of base load power and peaking power shrinks to the difference between running at best efficiency and at part load, power that needs a high peaking rate price will become unviable.<br><br>The Achilles&#39; heel of renewable power is that you cannot have a dispatcher call a wind or solar electric power producer and get a guaranteed amount of energy at a guaranteed time-- the energy is either available, or it isn&#39;t and projections are only as reliable weather predictions, so the amount of power available at a given point in time is only known when that given point in time actually occurs.

The need for this waste processing doesn&#39;t at all outweigh the reliability and cleanliness of nuclear power though, quite the opposite. It&#39;s the smallest price to pay.<br>As for the financial and regulatory downside, that&#39;s not a problem with nuclear power, it&#39;s a problem with human society. Let&#39;s build a 1 gigawatt plant, and be very pessimistic and assume a total construction cost of 12 billion dollars USD. That&#39;s a very high cost per watt. But even 12 billion, that&#39;s a tiny .2% of the federal budget as of last year. If the US government spent just a measly 5% on nuclear power, yall could be building nearly 19 plants per year if we use these prices. The more likely figure would be around 30. And the more plants are built, and the more companies enter the business, the more competition you have, and the price per watt of construction goes down.<br><br>Cost is not a downside, the money is there.

One final note, focusing on building conventional nuclear powerplants as we have done so far means locking us into a power system from the past. One with little flexibility. These nuclear powerplants are very expensive and will require a lot of running hours to be worth it. However what we really want is highly flexible technologies that can turn on and off quickly to fill the gaps with variable renewables like wind and solar.

Some US states are already supplying a majority of their needs with wind and sun, and there are plent other renewable sources directly from solar to be exploited at no cost to the climate; PV, wind, wave, tidal, hydro and rivers. Since globally we on;ly use 1% of avai;labler energy from the sun, there is ample room to expand to as much as we will ever need. Using solar-based energy isn&#39;t just about no emmissions, it&#39;s usiung energy which would otherwise be hitting Earth and much of it being trapped by greenhouse gases, this energy is extracted and used to do work for us, only being returned to Earth after it has served its purpose, net zero gain. <br><br>Nuclear, as well as being the most expensive form of making electricity, and using wasteful old tech-tech steam energy to turn turbines, has huge carbon costs they never mention; mining uranium, extraction, transportation round the world, processing, manufacturing and dealing with the waste. The cost of building just one plant is in tens of billions of pounds stirling [\u00a3], and even more in dolars [$], and uses tens of thousands of tonnes of concrete, itself a high carbon emitter. And the cost keeps rising, in the time it takes to build one plant, the cost is likely to double, while every year the cost of solar halves, and is already the cheapest by far of all methods of electricity generation.<br><br>All fossil fueled electricity can be replaced easily with renewables, at a fraction of the cost of one nuclear plant. Solar roof tiles are already in use [Elon Musk] and many methods of storage extra to those already used are being developed; hydro, flywheel, gravity, gas.fluid compression, underground heat, chemical,  etc. When the intermittancy of wind or sun is mentioned, it is already out of date by tyen years, it is a desperate attempt to keep alive the idea that renewables can&#39;t be ythe answer and that they need &#39;base load&#39; for when they are not generating. This is all nuclear has, so I don&#39;t blame those with their lives invested in it by a bad decision on university courses for lies and exaggeration, they have been sidelined by histpory and reality, and have nowhere to go but to retrain in the renewables sector, which is expanding fast, and is an exciting challenge to good minds. <br><br>Childish cartoons is presumably an attempt to convince children and adults with child-like minds. But it won&#39;t work, reality is indisputable, and no countries are about to contemplate building yet more prodction lines for spent fue;l rods that have to be stpored above ground and ke[pt cool for a very long time or they are lioable to start reacting aghain, and we all know the dangers as illustrated by Fukushima where fish caught in the sea can&#39;t be eaten, and Chernobyl, where mutated animals roam and give birth. <br><br>The energy from nuclear is 100% extra to an already heating planet. It wasn&#39;t part of that from the sun a;lready being trapped, and is an increase in what is heading us to extinction. If you stand close to a nuclear plant, say like Sizewell in the East pof England, you see where most of this energy is going, straight into the sea as cooling water, that&#39;s why they are always sited close to the sea or a river. Directly heating oceans, when sea-evel rise is already threatening low lying coastal areas, where nuclerar plants are situated, doesn&#39;t seem to be the most sewnsible thing we should be doing. But the nuclear cult has never been strong on sensible. Nuclear energy was only ever a PR excersize for nuclear weapons. &#39;Atoms for Peace&#39;  was their slogan, qand it&#39;sd no coincidence that the nuclear police who guard these places are all armed and licenced to use lethal force against intruders. Give me a peaceful PV roof any day!<br><br>Nuclear enthusiasts are almost all male, werre inspired by the poqwer when still children, and made a wrong decision about what to study at university. The die was cast, they can&#39;t do anything else, they need taxpayers to pay their salaries forever while they play around with ideas for fusion and other wet dreams that never come to anything. A tiny cult which has been trying to convince people since the fifties that they can love the bomb and have npo need to worry. and after every meltdown or tsunami disaster, we are told it won&#39;t happen again. The public only know about a few of them, the rest have been silenced and covered up, especially in the US  where there have been many accident&#39; apart of ThreeMile Island; The United States Government Accountability Office reported more than 150 incidents from 2001 to 2006 of nuclear plants not performing within acceptable safety guidelines. According to a 2010 survey of energy accidents, there have been at least 56 accidents at nuclear reactors in the United States (defined as incidents that either resulted in the loss of human life or more than US$50,000 of property damage). [Wikipedia] The amounts of radioactive pollution are not mentioned, they all just add to so-called &#39;background radiation&#39; we all live with. Interestingly cancers are rising around the world, even dogs are dying from cxancer when relatively young.<br><br>So, do we need nuclear. No. There I&#39;ve saved you watching this childish drivel. The salient fact is how much this &#39;animation company&#39; received from the nuclear industry. They have so far bought a couple of minor &#39;environmentalists&#39; to put over the same old same old arguments, since they haven&#39;t any new ones this is all they can do. It&#39;s 50s technology [and thinking] Concorde has already been retired, and that arrived in the 7-s, council tower blocks build in the 60s have all been torn down as neo-brutalist monstrosities that trapped people in misery. How much longer can this nuclear charade be kept going? Solart [power doesn&#39;t need this kind of publicity, it simply sells itself. People willingly pay out to have it on their roofs and do away with electricity bills, instead, receiving payments for all the energy they feed to the grid while not needing it. The ICE cars and vans will spoon be of the past, electric vehicles are the only ones still with rising sales, all car makers are switching and bringing out EVs of their own, and calculating how long they can actually sell internal combustion polluters. There are now electric triucks, alectric cargo ships, and what next electric planes? There certainly won&#39;t be nuclear cars and planes as were promised in the 50s!<br><br>&#39;It&#39;s not always windy and the sun doesn&#39;t always shiine&#39; - when that is said, as it is at 5.24, you know this is aimed at 9 year olds with learning difficulties.

Many wind turbines are offshore, I live near three large offshore North Sea windfarms, the only time they aren&#39;ty all turning is when one or two are being serviced. PV panels harvest energy when the sun is hidden by clouds, only visible light is filtered out and not much at that.

ENERGY = HEAT and if you use Solar energy you add a lot of heat to the atmosphere with only a small amount of that energy being used. If you don&#39;t believe me, just think about how much heat your laptop produces. Any electricity we use is also releasing heat into the atmosphere.

Water vapors rise faster than atmospheric air without water, which will create an updraft which can be harvested with ground-based wind turbines (which can also be much smaller, much safer, and much more environmentally friendly).

When you factor in reprocessing spent fuel, given that 95% some percent of fissile uranium goes unspent in a fuel cell, those uranium and thorium reserves could last far, far longer. It still wouldn&#39;t be entirely renewable, but it&#39;s enough to last us for the foreseeable future, giving time to develop true renewable tech further.<br><br>Secondly, while nuclear plants are very expensive to construct, their operating costs are a fair bit lower than fossil fuel plants, so I&#39;m the long run it&#39;s absolutely cheaper. The main issue is getting investors to go in on the huge initial cost, because it does end up taking longer for a nuclear plant to pay itself off compared to a fossil fuel plant, despite the lower operating cost.<br><br>Third, nuclear power is safer than fossil fuels by a wide margin. Even accounting for those big disasters, nuclear energy has caused fewer deaths and injuries per watt-hour than any fossil fuel. Once you account for injuries, illness, and deaths resulting from pollution, it becomes even more clear that nuclear is way safer.<br><br>Fourth, one of the main obstacles to expanding nuclear power generation is the building waste problem. Even with reprocessing, we&#39;re still going to need a long term method of waste disposal. Suffice it to say that while methods for this have been proposed and studied, absolutely nobody is willing to allow the construction of a waste disposal site &quot;in my backyard&quot;, i.e. anywhere near them at all. Nobody is willing to let the science people solve the really big problem. For more detailed example, look up the Yucca Mountain Project, and prepare to be profoundly disappointed in humanity.<br><br>Finally, as far as I can tell, one of the biggest reasons why fuel reprocessing isn&#39;t done right now is because governments are absolutely terrified of anyone getting access to nuclear refining methods because nukes. Nuclear proliferation is a big issue, and it&#39;s something I wasn&#39;t able to get around to talking about in my essay. To make a long story short, the most compelling solution to this issue is to enforce stricter nuclear disarmament and hopefully remove nukes and mutually assured destruction from the diplomatic equation. To be perfectly honest, I have NO expertise on this particular subject, and the details are beyond me, so take everything I&#39;m saying about the nuke issue with a hefty grain of salt.<br><br>Anyway, if anyone wants to see sources, I can provide, but bear in mind that most of what I read were academic journal articles that I accessed through my university (specifically through JSTOR), and might be hard to get to otherwise.", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T19:52:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zdude69", "comment_text": "You forgot albania we get most of or even all our power form hydro when we&#39;re getting this not purchasing power from other countries", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T19:51:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "khhnator", "comment_text": "and what we actually gonna do: nothing", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T19:48:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "syntax", "comment_text": "You must give it to the french 67% from nuclear is just amazing.", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T19:47:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam McKay", "comment_text": "Would love if china could give this video a watch...", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T19:47:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ale Forsberg", "comment_text": "maybe be shouldnt consume as much energy that we are doing today.", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T19:44:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Dunlap", "comment_text": "There is a problem with this video.

A significant portion of &quot;renewables&quot; is &quot;biomass&quot;.  Much of &quot;biomass&quot; is simply burning trees, bushes and other plant material.  This is actually far worse that fossil fuels because <br><br>a) it produces more green house gasses and solid particulate pollution that fossil fuels do.<br>b) it is significantly less efficient  (and therefore far more costly) than fossil fuels.<br>c) it often receives government subsidies and is lauded as a &quot;green&quot; and &quot;renewable&quot; source when it is in fact worse .<br><br>2) Consistency.  This is a huge issue for solar and wind. <br><br>a) Peak electricity usage happens after the sun goes down.  Like the video mentioned, storage facilities could help this problem, but facilities large enough to allow solar to power a significant portion of a power grid would be far to expensive to be practicable at this time (not to mention being hard on the environment).<br><br>b) Weather.  Solar and wind experience frequent and often unpredictable spikes and lulls in production.  Unless you want random frequent blackouts you need other predictable and controllable power sources for most the power grid.  Because of these variations, no more than 15% of any power grid can consist of solar and wind.  <br><br>Another big issue that most don&#39;t realize is that the other electricity sources have to ramp up or down based on the production based on how much power solar and wind are adding.  This adds difficulty and increases costs. <br><br>3) Availability.  Tidal, geothermal, hydroelectric power do not all of the consistency issues that solar and wind do, but they have a different issue.  They are only available in specific and limited areas.  As a result, we can not expect any significant increase in power from these sources in the future.<br><br>While solar and wind are not bound like those mentioned above, they do have their own location restrictions.  <br><br>4) Environmental impacts.  Renewable energy is not some magical energy source that is perfectly clean and does no harm to the environment, though most of them (biomass being the glaring exception) do produce fewer green house gasses than fossil fuels.  <br><br>Solar energy plants emit more radiation than nuclear powerplants.  They require large amounts of rare earth metals requiring heavy strip mining operations. Their shorter lifespans mean they will have to be replaced about twice as frequently as traditional powerplants.<br><br>Wind is far cleaner than solar.  While it does kill its share of birds and bats, it does not require the large quantities of rare earth metals that the solar plants require and their production only costs a fraction of the energy (and therefore green house gas emitions) that solar energy plant construction requires.  <br><br>5) Quantity.  Hydro power is the #1 source of renewable power.  This along with geothermal and tidal are essentially already producing at their max level most 1st world countries.  They will not be able to take over any of the fossil fuel&#39;s share of the load.<br><br>Wind and solar comprise around 5% - 6% of the US&#39; energy production.  Fossil fuels account for 80%.  Is it possible for wind and solar to increase production by 1600%?  <br><br>Nuclear.<br><br>1) Long term storage.  While nuclear powerplants produce comparatively little waste, part of what it does produce can be dangerously radioactive for many decades.  If nuclear energy production is ramped up, we will need long term answers to this problem.<br><br>2) Government Regulations.  A medium sized powerplant can run for a year on a piece of uranium the size of a car.  About 96% of that car sized piece of fuel ran be reprocessed and recycled to be used again in a powerplant.  However, such reprocessing is currently illeagal within the US.  Back in 1977, President Jimmy Carter banned reprocessing claiming that it was not cost effective and that it could lead to nuclear weapon proliferation.  Both claims have since proven false and several other countries currently recycle their spent nuclear fuel for use in their own power plants.<br><br><br><br>Summary: The cleanest and most consistent renewable energy sources are already largely maxed out. Wind and solar have the potential to expand, but have their variability and inconsistency currently prevents them from providing more that a small percentage of any power grid.  That percentage could grow with better energy storage technology, but it is unlikely to ever be the main power source in any decent sized electrical grid.  Renewables could shoulder a bigger load, but will never be able to shoulder all or even most our energy needs.<br><br>Nuclear power faces popularity issues and  in some places regulatory challenges.  However, if we want to minimize fossil fuel usage, nuclear power is the one best equipped to carry the load.", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T16:34:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GrandTurtleSageDean", "comment_text": "I think that what is more significant than where the electricity comes from, is how the electricity storage containers impact the environment.

(Incidentally the fuel fifty years ago was reprocessed and reused in U.K. Magnox reactors).<br>This too is less than ideal as the grid load varies; France exports a lot of it&#39;s electricty to neighpouring countries to suit their running, if you look at France&#39;s demand it is very flat compared to the U.K. for instance.<br>Small modular recators may be a solution to this negative but there seems little happening in that field?<br><br>Where fossil fuel and hydro power plants excel is that they are synchronous and can modulate output as demand (load) fluctuates. Also they have  a very high inertia in their generators which smooth out fluctuations on the grid, especially when faults occur. The grid runs to a very tight frquency control and if this variation exceeds 0.5 Hz in the U.K. partial grid trips occur. The reason that there are very few is due to the characteristics of fossil fuel and hydro plants. It is not an option to get rid of them with current and prospective technology (batterise are not an answer).<br><br>Another common misconception is that renewables are cheaper than conventional, they most certainly are not, especially off shore wind and solar. It cost a lot to accomodate them onto a grid, costs that are not seen but felt in the cost per unit electricity.<br>Sorry for the length of this post but it is not a simple matter to replace fossil fuel generation, just ask Germany who tried their hardest, and are currently having to un moth ball coal power plants.", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T14:59:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fistofstorm", "comment_text": "no", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T14:55:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "laskin riubn", "comment_text": "took us 2h of podcast to get to.

It then immediately phrases the argument against nuclear power as one being one about safety which the industry wants as it has already won that argument where it matters. In fact the biggest argument against nuclear power replacing fossil fuels is different.   These plants typically are designed have an energy output of X amount over 40 years or so then followed by refit or decommission.  Studies have found that the energy put into mining materials and all the processing of them including construction of these power stations exceeds the X they create.  They are far more expensive to build than ordinary power stations. This means that all the carbon footprint is upfront and they are not better than traditional generation whose carbon footprint is measured against energy output over their lifetimes. This becomes apparent in the cost of these nuclear plants, in effect we are paying for the energy they create upfront too, 40 yrs later that upfront cost to the power companies they are still paying back to banks seems to be outweighed by the cheap electricity for which they are still charging 2x the price of other power generation to consumers. On top of all this the taxpayers usually have to pay for the decommissioning costs and all the energy consumption that will take.  Moneywise they can be made more economically sound because materials, processing and some construction can be bought from abroad at third world prices. However the carbon cost is the same or worse from such places.<br>To sum up they are not green, they are a huge accounting trick.", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T08:27:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Voidex", "comment_text": "If a country dont want nuclear energy, we can deliver it forcibly with our rockets.", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T08:26:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MasterFeiFongWong", "comment_text": "Electric Generator Design that&#39;s powered by it&#39;s self once it gets going &amp; perpetuates more electrical current then is needed for it to run continuously on it&#39;s own. <br> Step 1: Calculate how much energy you need pumped into an electric motor to make a vertically positioned circular platter with magnets in-bedded horizontally around it&#39;s left side and right side (so there pushing force is pushing out sideways relative to the vertically spinning disc) to spin as fast as you need it to. Also better to make sure these magnets are shielded around their sides &amp; back  with metal that has high permeability so the magnetic field they are emitting is focused fully out sideways. :D Step 2: Calculate how many sets of copper coils you need to be interacting with magnetic fields to achieve this &amp; to perpetuate more electrical current flow then is needed. :D Step 3: Build a round horizontally positioned platter covered in all these copper coils pointed down that does not move (Is stationary) :D Step 4: Build a round platter covered in powerful magnets pointed up that can spin and place it directly under platter with hanging copper coils. :D Step 5:  Position the vertical platter that is  motorized close to the horizontally positioned platter covered in magnets pointing up so that when the vertically positioned platter spins the in-bedded horizontally positioned magnetic fields slam sideways against the edge of the horizontally positioned platter causing it to spin. :) Step 6: Make sure enough of the copper coils are feeding their electrical current into the electric motor and the rest of the copper coils are linked into a set of rechargeable Battery&#39;s placed in the closest most convenient spot. Step 7: Build a duplicate setup of horizontally positioned discs with hanging copper coils and disc with upwards facing magnets and assuming the first set of discs are positioned to the front left side of vertical spinning disc, position the other duplicate structures to the front right, the back left and the back right of the vertically positioned motorized disc. As the vertically positioned motorized disc spins the horizontally in-beaded magnets will now hit into all 4 horizontally positioned discs causing them to spin. so you will effectively be using the spin of one disc powered by one electric motor to spin 4 constructs that are each generating electrical current. now build this whole setup multiple times over and use the current perpetuated by it to power up scaled electromagnetic generators that are equal to or more powerful than the ones used in a nuclear power plant. You will now have a device that is self perpetuating off of it&#39;s own electrical current perpetuation and no nuclear waist to worry about.<br> Here is the reason why my device does work. You see even tho the more electrical load you impose on a system ends you up with greater back emf hindering your devices ability to move and generate current, there is a way to work around this. My device multiplies the amount of mechanical motion that is taking place because of the 1 motor. On top of that, it eliminates any extra resistance that could have been imposed on the motor by making the other wheels spin by having the magnetic fields hit the rotating discs the way I described. You see, the vertically positioned disc connected to the motor is perpetuating the spinning of at least 4 main discs that are spinning magnets at no extra effort on it&#39;s own part because as it spins around powered by the motor, it is the horizontally positioned magnets that are shielded by high permeability metal that are using their magnetic push out sideways to force the other horizontally positioned discs to spin. So even tho each of those 4 discs spinning are somewhat hindered by the back emf it does not change the inescapable fact that each disc is perpetuating the flow of current in the copper coils above them and the amount of electrical current being perpetuated between all 4 discs is greater then the amount of electrical current the motor needs to run at max potential. It is called over unity and the extra electrical current the motor does not need can be fed into larger more elaborate electric generators. Imagine 12 of these designs contributing to the power needs of a much more powerful design (Probably electromagnetic) that is utilizing this same idea of multiplying the number of horizontally positioned discs that spin because of the motion of one powerful  motor spinning a vertically positioned disc cleverly positioned so that it spins at least 4 other discs at a much higher velocity because of it&#39;s more powerful design. In short its all about multiplying what the first motors disc is interacting with &amp; second, up scaling the design to more powerful designs that utilize the same principles.", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T08:26:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NeutroniXimus", "comment_text": "Thorium reactors vs. uranium reactors.

None of that has anything to do with how more advanced nuclear tech works.<br><br>That&#39;s what a meltdown is, when a first generation reactor (that are still used today, with added safety tweaks) has a cage of control rods and fuel rods, which needs to be monitored or the cage melts (the whole mechanism) and the now melted uranium sinks and breaks the entire thing. It works, it can be used well, but it&#39;s so old, crude, and outright obsolete, even compared to a 2nd generation reactor we could have made in the 1970s! I&#39;m not even kidding. Along this same line, these reactors are water cooled, which is frankly an old, shoe-horned, first generation limitation that even it&#39;s designers were keen on changing. Water doesn&#39;t belong in a practical reactor design. Using atomic energy, an ideal temp is 800 degrees celsius. That&#39;s not a big deal, the glass your windows are made of are melted at much higher temp. But water turns into steam at a hundred degrees celsius. So if you use it it cool a reactor, it limits the entire thing very much. SO - they pressurize it to a very high amount to keep it from steaming, so it can run at 300 degrees. Higher, but still very limiting. I don&#39;t want to overplay the disadvantage - it can be done well, but again it&#39;s an old, crude, frankly silly thing to have to build it around. Problem is, when something dramatic does happen, we&#39;re talking about hot pressurized water that wants to become steam. We have a <i>meltdown</i> - melted uranium going down, in water - a needless problem that doesn&#39;t need to exist. Water-cooling become steam, and steam just wants to frolic in the atmosphere with whatever it carries along. It&#39;s just a dumb cooling choice from the get go. Again, it&#39;s so primitive, and hasn&#39;t advanced or been allowed to advance, hardly at all. <br><br>You could have further, substantially improved multiple generations past that by now, and <i>we know it.</i><br><br>Thorium is more abundant than uranium, more than twice as much. Actually, it&#39;s estimated to be about <i>4 times as much.</i> Further, it&#39;s relatively easy to design it so all the material eventually undergoes fission (there&#39;s steps involved, but I&#39;ll keep it simple), making it far more efficient at using it all for power than typical reactors. And this is a big one - this means much less radioactive waste (granted, not that large to begin with) that takes merely a few hundred years to decay to something boring without radiation, as opposed to <i>tens of thousands.</i> Think about that.<br><br>Blah blah blah. <br>TLDR - Thorium energy is abundant. LFTR reactors (and others) No pressurized water, no need for high pressure anywhere. Totally feasible, advanced nuclear power doesn&#39;t need cages or control rods, and meltdowns aren&#39;t possible or <i>even a thing.</i> Small, comparatively trivial waste management. Conventional power plants are mostly first generation 60&#39;s ideas with lot of added safety systems slapped on.<br><br>Advanced nuclear power is not the same as conventional nuclear power. I&#39;m just a random youtube commenter, I know a lot of this stuff, but I&#39;m not a scientist, and there are probably things I goofed up in this post. Look it up. <br><br>Get the facts from experts, get on board. Allow atomic energy to advance, even a little, like every other technology.

Their high-temperature operation also allows them to directly replace industrial heating needs, which are currently provided almost completely by fossil fuels.", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T15:23:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1 \ua731\u1d1c\u0299 \u0299\u1d07\ua730\u1d0f\u0280\u1d07 2022?", "comment_text": "This guy could be my science teacher for 12 years and I wouldn\u2019t complain", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T15:23:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Todd Howard", "comment_text": "I mean thorium", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T15:22:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T10", "comment_text": "Now do Hydrogen", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T15:21:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eccentric Wisdom", "comment_text": "Electric cars will surely help then", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T15:21:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Snutte Plays", "comment_text": "GO, GO NUCLEAR", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T15:21:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arron Tay", "comment_text": "Can you explain blue ammonia for your next vid?", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T15:21:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liya Yoseph", "comment_text": "Society would be 1000x better if kurzgesagt ran it", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T15:20:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Loading Academics", "comment_text": "at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhAemz1v7dQ&amp;t=1m45s\">1:45</a>  Kurzgesagt has Sekiro: Shadows die twice on his animated screen is legendary..

Like we even buy other countries garbage and waste in order to burn on our own. In one way, we are reducing the amount of waste, but this does also ultimately cause emissions. Maybe I&#39;m unaware of our own fossile fuel levels and that small 2-5% is actually representing what I just mentioned, but just in case that it isn&#39;t. Then it&#39;s good to know that part of that renewable% number (outside of hydro) is consisted off waste burning. Yes it may in theory not be as bad as fossile fuels because it&#39;s a much smaller amount than traditional gas, oil, coal etc, but we&#39;re not fault free. The reason I mention this is because I find that here in Sweden, we get so easily complacent about almost anything that regards our country. Wether it&#39;s how we handled covid, our approach to school and mental health or even things like border control. Our open borders isn&#39;t just a problem for forming ghettos, but we&#39;ve had numerous accounts of severe weapon/military smuggling the past 20 years. And I don&#39;t mean foreign people/countries smuggling without Sweden noticing, it&#39;s the other way around, our military has been able to smuggle from places like Estonia etc, in order to generate profit for its own sector. <br><br>Basically I just mean, please when it regards Sweden, be more objective and or devil&#39;s advocate, I think our country legit gets so much praise that our citizens become lazy and complacent, thinking that this country is perfect and doesn&#39;t need any improvement.

We can also build more waste-to-energy plants alongside nuclear and renewable plants so that we can replace fossil fuel plants even faster... By doing this, we might also be able to solve garbage and waste problems, and yes, although incineration plants also produce a lot of emissions, its still a lot better than fossil fuel plants cuz it emits less pollution than fossil fuel plants and it also solves waste issues... Plus, these incineration plants are just alternative and temporary solutions, they are also meant to be replaced and taken down once enough renewable energy plants and nuclear energy plants are already in place... Nuclear power plants can also be replaced in the long run by renewable sources, but that will take a very long time and might even be impossible, since renewable energy sources produce 8x less than the production of nuclear plants...

And if we invest in research for nuclear, it might even be what we need in the long run (Fingers crossed for practical fusion one day). My main concern with renewables have been batteries, which creating and disposing has not gotten better, at least not good enough. Of course they need research too, and might one day be good enough, but even if it&#39;s just batteries we use in our cars after charging them using power from nuclear, we need to research batteries for that reason. Or maybe we can eventually move cars to hydrogen, which I&#39;ve yet to understand why we haven&#39;t. You drive 300 miles, you&#39;re running low so you pull over, pump your car full of hydrogen in 2-5 minutes (unlike charging batteries for hours) and then drive for another 300 miles, water comes out the tail pipe. Hydrogen is the most abundant resource in the galaxy. And people say it&#39;s explosive, just look at the Hindenburg.... right and what have humans used to power cars for over 100 years?

Quotations around &#39;modern&#39; because these designs have been around for decades, but never got off the ground because the big nuclear countries wanted to focus more on Uranium because the enrichment process is necessary to weaponise uranium.<br><br>Even then, as bad as uranium is, it&#39;s still way safer than people think. Chernobyl and Fukushima both had serious problems; Chernobyl was an outdated design that wasn&#39;t properly maintained, and being run by people that weren&#39;t properly trained and Fukushima was built in a tsunami prone area with many analysts telling the owners that an accident like what happened was inevitable years before it actually took place. Also, meltdowns aren&#39;t explosive. I see so many people characterise meltdowns like they&#39;re nukes, when all it is is the nuclear material inside the reactor melting through its containment (which, by the way, a solution has been found for this problem that makes meltdowns entirely safe; now it just shuts down the plant by dumping the material into a reservoir deep underground where it can cool down).<br><br>If the average person understood this, nuclear would be widely considered a highly viable energy source, and would likely be used in every developed nation. It frustrates me so much that the main argument against modern nuclear energy basically boils down to &#39;people don&#39;t want it&#39;, which is such a horseshit answer.

They are not an endless natural resource unless we start mining from space I suppose. Production will get more and more costly both economically and energy consumption wise. Electric vehicles, solar farms and wind farms require a lot of these minerals and the demand is going to explode as the entire planet is changing it&#39;s energy infrastructure. We need ways to counterbalance this. Nuclear energy could be one of the solutions, at least temporarily. We also need to do other things such as increase the forest covered areas of the Earth and lower all consumption, especially in the western world. Fusion power is 30 years away, but personally I think investing in education and reserach would benefit us tremendously. Battery technology, all green technology and knowledge on these issues can be improved if we put enough focus and resources into it. A lot more than electrifying the industry is required to stop global warming, probably a combination of all these things, but hopefully we&#39;ll find a way to come together and fix this issue.

This can be seen in the lobbying and public influence work done by orgs such as the Heartland Institute and AEI. These groups are funded by the oil industry and only seem to believe climate change exists when it&#39;s time to virtue signal about nuclear. Furthermore, there&#39;s a perception that this diversion is exactly what fossil fuel and extractive industries want. Nuclear also just requires way more work to make politically palatable in general, due to public fears, unfounded or otherwise. It elicits such emotions that some people will NEVER be convinced. There&#39;s an additional concern, one that I&#39;m not convinced of, that nuclear could become an entrenched interest, a new Big Oil that becomes difficult to phase out in spite of any negative externalities. <br><br>Thus, the worry among even environmentalists open to nuclear like myself is that giving any political oxygen to nuclear will exhaust political will, activist energy, and economic capital and slow the transition. You said it best Kurzgesagt: &quot;why make it harder on ourselves?&quot; It&#39;s already hard politically to transition from fossil fuels. Scientists, techies, and engineers tend to trivialize the work that goes into changing hearts and minds, but as someone whose been trying for over a decade, unpacking the baggage of nuclear, enough to make it viable, is a practically Herculean task in its own right. I gave up in 2018 when became clear that we can no longer wait for the ideal politics to materialize, and we have to pivot.<br><br>I&#39;m also pretty disappointed that Kurzgesagt failed to address by far the most promising source of renewable baseload power in the near term: geothermal power. Thanks to fracking tech, called EGS when used for geothermal, it&#39;s now possible to create artificial hot springs anywhere in the world using only water as a transfer medium. It requires less effort and funding to make politically feasible and increase efficiency, and it&#39;s already more cost-effective than nuclear in most of the world. And regarding induced seismicity, despite early hiccups, it&#39;s actually safer than fracking as the pressure in the wells is lower and applied evenly. Conveniently, it also makes use of tech, equipment, and skills that were pioneered by oil and gas as well as the latest geological exploration tools developed by Big Tech. Thus it represents the perfect political compromise: totally clean, relatively safe power with minimal effect on the environment, no need for re-skilling oil &amp; gas employees, and it gives FF companies a stake in real decarbonization, not some carbon capture synfuel fantasy land.<br><br>Lastly, these solutions are still, despite the hurdles, not all-or-nothing. Where there are political roadblocks to nuclear, i.e. The Americas, Western Europe, Japan, attention could be focused on EGS and it&#39;s shallower and simpler cousin AGS. In fact, that&#39;s already started to happen. In quake-prone Japan, buildings, infrastructure, <b>and most importantly people</b> are more tolerant of earthquakes than they are of nuclear energy. Thus, the Japanese gov&#39;t, while ice-cold to nuclear, has broken down regulatory hurdles for EGS and is investing directly into its development.", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T05:57:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Monkey D.

This does NOT mean it is possible to retrofit existing, inefficient coal-fired power plants to this level of emissions, but some carbon reduction tech has and should continue to be deployed on these. A newly constructed plant however could incorporate all the proven carbon reduction technologies, plus newer sequestration methods, not to mention be nearly 100 percent efficient. Two big reasons among many that make such facilities unlikely to be constructed is a lack of political will and the lack of an economic imperative. In the US, coal power plants of any type are a political non-starter in some areas, as equally in other areas are regulations making next-gen pollution controls such as these mandatory. Power companies cannot build where they are not allowed to, and will do so in the least expensive way, incorporating cost adding pollution controls, despite improved efficiency, only as the law requires, and carbon emissions still do not have any associated costs either. It is a real shame that even a few of these facilities will probably never be built, because of the over 300 years of coal reserves in the US alone, a many-decades-worth portion of these are already mined, sitting outside of old existing power plants. If we took that existing mined coal, and used it to fuel new plants like this, it would at least buy us some much needed time to electrify everything and give installation of renewables and energy storage technology and infrastructure a better chance to catch up and take the lead.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ). <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved.<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019.", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T01:30:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "A Glass Of Water :]", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhAemz1v7dQ&amp;t=2m14s\">2:14</a> I see a pokemon", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T01:30:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beanuu", "comment_text": "That sekiro Easter egg is top tier", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T01:30:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mevada Vraj", "comment_text": "His channel:- 1m views in 10 hrs <br>Then 2 m views in 20 hrs<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.Then after infinite hours it will be -1/12 views\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T01:30:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "anime iphone", "comment_text": "time to put a stop to china and india, thanks kurzgesagt", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T01:29:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sai3000pro", "comment_text": "I say go nuclear for now and invest in it, then try and replace nuclear with renewables.", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T01:29:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shien \u2122", "comment_text": "Top 10 energy storage company stocks", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T01:29:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "harbl99", "comment_text": "In 2019 renewables + nuclear power have exceeded fossil fuel usage from a mere 20 years before.

Those 6,420 million people would not be alive if not for the industrial revolution and the abundance of inexpensive energy it provided.  Now consider life expectancy.  In 1750 life expectancy was around 35 years; today it is about 78 years.  This increase is directly attributable to the advancements in technology that would not have been possible without the energy derived from burning fossil fuels.  Lastly, consider economic growth.  The world economy was pretty consistent for most of human history.  One measure of that is GDP per capita (not an ideal analogue but one that is easily researched).  According to a study done by British economist Angus Maddison, the world GDP per capita in 1700 was around $616 (measured in 1990 international dollars).  By the year 2008 that had risen to $7,614, a more than 12 fold increase.  It is easy to &quot;blame&quot; fossil fuels for the harm that they cause, I am not saying that they do not have negative effects.  However, let&#39;s not forget that fossil fuels and the industrial revolution got us to where we are today.  I would argue that they have had a far more positive impact on human civilization than some would like to admit.  Let&#39;s consider the good that has come from fossil fuels along with the bad.", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T23:41:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vdsj", "comment_text": "we need nuclear energy if we wand to leave our planet", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T23:41:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate Spors", "comment_text": "I love the renewable energy superheroes!", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T23:41:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tomas Garza", "comment_text": "Its been a lot of videos about nuclear power, from several youtubers.

So, the straightforward argument here is that for the time and money to build a single nuclear plant, we can build 4 times capacity of renewable. <br><br>And, it takes 2-3 yrs including FEED phase to add 1 GW capacity in wind offshore and more than 10 yrs (easily more than 15 yrs with FEED and permitting) to build similar capacity in nuclear, which adds to risks. And the offshore wind is getting cheaper, while traditional nuclear is getting more expensive. And safety and insurance issue. And special requirements to security. And non-prolifiteration issues. And the operator will be firmly attached to a single fuel producer (which can be a huge political issue). Note, I didn&#39;t even talk about waste yet...<br><br>Of course, system cost is not only generation cost, we need to manage swings in power supply from renewables. But, conceptually, it is not that different for nuclear - nuclear power cannot be (cheaply) adjusted up and down to meet the demand requirements. Flex power nuclears have huge cost per MWh, and normal solution is to export excess power to neighboring countries, which has similar destructive effect on the grid as renewables do. And since nuclear needs scale, the grids have to be rebuilt about multi-GW monsters, which is a lot of extra cost and time.<br><br>Also, we can&#39;t really quickly ramp up nuclear construction - building and operating the plants requires very specialized skills from the developer, operator and regulators. It also requires creation of very specialize infrastructure. You can&#39;t just bring and drop such technology to a new country, it takes decades and billions of $$ just to build the framework of operation and regulations and etc.. This is not a process that anybody is willing to accelerate, and it is understandable. Everywhere where the nuclear energy is successful, it is feeding from synergy with an active nuclear weapon program (and transfers some hidden costs there). <br><br>Indeed, we need to keep investing into nuclear, but the traditional nuclear business models do not work for a long time already. The nuclear generation will remain a niche solution for decades to come. Modular nuclear plants sound promising, but we nothing yet about their cost and reliability. Maybe they will find a nice niche in the new markets - e.g., green H2 production.", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T23:21:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Floyd Godwin Alipala", "comment_text": "His voice can stop climate change", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T23:20:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ET FY", "comment_text": "We won&#39;t be able to &quot;stop&quot; climate change, The fear of &quot;go back to the stone age&quot; is the exact reason why we will hit the wall hard, with the help of any technology, even fusion.

Roughly, energy is mandatory for economics to run, and when energy is consumed,  it is forever lost ( entropy ) . I do not like this explanation, because it is like saying bikes and airplanes are the same thing because with both your go from point A to point B, but please bear with it.  With this entropics point of view, you want  to support the economy, maximize the energy production, and minimize the entropy. In your video , it is interesting to see that you slice energy producing regarding the impact on global warming. Makes sense, totally agree. But let&#39;s see the video with the Entropy aspect. coal, oil, are the best regarding entropy, because the carbon/oil resources are renewable ( oil takes longer okay, but coal/oil/tree ARE really renewable ). You maximise the energy production , with renewable material. But let&#39;s discard them because of the global warming. Now let&#39;s see the &#39;&#39; green &#39;&#39; part . Is it really renewable ?  it is interesting to see that in the video, we slice &#39;&#39; green &#39;&#39; energy in two components : renewable, and nuclear. Well both of them seems not so renewable. Nuclear, well, uranium/plutonium are quite limited on earth.But still (i&#39;m French heh ) , nuclear &#39;&#39; might &#39;&#39; be the best way to minimize entropy on a maximum energy production, and minimize global warming, even if it has a high cost and a limited ressource. In contrary the &#39;&#39; renewable &#39;&#39; energy, might not be so renewable : no solar panel recycling, rare earth resource using to produce them, a high energy cost in order to produce a solar panel who will ... produce energy.. Are solar panel / windmill really the future for humanity ? What could be the alternatives for more efficient ways to produce energy  ? taking into account the economics/entropy and global warming ? I do not have the answer. There are some researches. In nuclear domain, we host in france an international work in progress, the ITER ( studying the nuclear cold fusion ) . In renewable energies, i have no knowledges on alternatives to windmill/solar panels. So what alternatives we have for energy producing for the future ? Should we produce more , or slow down the energy producing ? Hence having an economics growth/ demographics growth slowdown instead ? Or go for on a humanity scale for an inifinite production like a dyson sphere program ?

My response:<br><br>1. Nuclear is a non-renewable resource and the industry is already dealing with shortages of Uranium. The National Nuclear Regulatory Commission has stated that approving plans for different types of plants could take 25+ years.<br><br>2. The nuclear industry has been lobbying heavily for years for funds to extend the lifetime of their business. In doing so, they seek to redirect funds that could otherwise be used to improve renewable energy production technology. Since nuclear isn&#39;t viable in the longterm (and many of the new designs have notable flaws) this lobbying effort is motivated more by a desire for job security than altruism.<br><br>3. The IPCC has stated in their report that it was likely possible to meet the 2050 zero emmisions goal with only renewables, but that they didn&#39;t explore that option because they wanted to reflect what countries were already doing (using nuclear.) Basically, the argument that renewables can&#39;t meet our needs is still unproven.<br><br>4. The true cost of nuclear lies not only in the prohibitive costs of designing, approving and commissioning plants, but in the disposal, which has mostly been borne by taxpayers. The safety issues involved are another significant problem that needs to be addressed before further investment in nuclear should even be considered.<br><br>Basically, it boils down to what we want to spend our money on.

A power source that, while technically non-renewable, relies on an isotope of hydrogen that is in rather abundant supply.  (Deuterium makes up 0.02% of all hydrogen, but there is a LOT of hydrogen around, so the deuterium we have on planet should be enough to last us until we&#39;re either capable of mining comets and gas giants for more deuterium or we&#39;ve found an apocalyptic threat that we didn&#39;t avoid for a change.  Maybe King Midas is a prophecy and he&#39;ll accidentally touch the planet.)<br><br>Of course, renewables will have their day.  When we finally get fusion to the point where it&#39;s a viable power source, it will take decades to get the technology widespread enough to make a considerable dent in the world&#39;s electrical production.  But I suspect it will supplant renewables at least partially once we have it up and running.<br><br>As for the more immediate timeframe, I believe 100% we should be investing in both nuclear and renewables.  I worry that the hardcore nuclear proponents are overly optimistic - there&#39;s only so much fissile material accessible on Earth, and while waste can be refined into usable fuel for a second round (and possibly more, I&#39;ve not looked into that system in detail), there will definitely be less and less energy available from the reprocessed fuels, because Thermodynamics is king.  <br><br>But any sort of development in nuclear power displaces the market share of fossil fuel energy, which should be everyone&#39;s chief concern right now.  Even the coal barons and oil magnates.  Because those stockpiles are limited just as much as the fissile material stockpile is, and even if policy makers let them mine every gram of coal and pump every drop of oil, they will eventually run out and have to find something else.

Something like 85% of the U235 put into a fresh nuclear fuel rod still exists as U235 in the spent fuel rods. It&#39;s madness to not scavenge that back out and turn it into more fuel rods. Yes, there&#39;s some plutonium produced by the process, but you know what? That doesn&#39;t have to go to atomic weapons. Plutonium works just fine in a power reactor, as a matter of fact there&#39;s ALREADY a blend of radioactive metals used in existing power reactors that contains Pu-239. It&#39;s called MOX fuel, which stands for &quot;mixed oxide fuel&quot; because when it comes to nuclear technology nobody can seem to say just exactly what the dang stuff does right on the name for it out of concern largely stemming from a phobia of all things nuclear, that &quot;someone will try to make a nuclear weapon out of it&quot;.<br><br>Fear of the &quot;other&quot; N word (the word is &quot;Nuclear&quot;) is totally illogical IMO.<br>For example, it would be pretty simple to create a dirty bomb if you gave me enough of something so mundane as bananas.<br>I could extract the potassium out of the bananas, then isolate the radioactive portion of that potassium (yes, bananas are slightly radioactive), and then use high explosives to scatter that across a section of the landscape.

We cannot keep dragging our feet on this. But one undeniable fact is that when we engage mass production of one particular new age reactor design, the price, duration of construction drops drastically, France had it and did it cheaply when their nuclear reactor golden age in the 1975 to 1985. Furthermore, the new age reactor designs (large designs) are smaller even still due to their new attributes and innate passive safety that does not require a massive pressure containment structure. <br><br>If each new reactor core, be it from the European SAMOFAR project or LFTR projects, generates in excess 1.6 GWe, each reactor replaces 800 onshore windmills (with an average capacity of 2MW), however without taking capacity factor in mind which averages in the US at about 35%, which sees the number of wind turbines it replaces becoming 2285 units. And with a life span of 20 years, you would have to construct the same fleet of wind turbines a total of 3 times to achieve the same life span coverage of a nuclear reactor of 60 years, which can even increase if the maintenance was provided. This sees the number of windmills 1 nuclear reactor replaces multiplied 3 times over, making the realistic number of windmills &quot;6850&quot;. Offshore windmills fare a little better with an average capacity of 3.4MW and a higher Capacity factor seeing an average of 50%, giving the following numbers, 440 replaced by the nuclear reactor, and 880 replaced after the capacity factor is calculated into it. And to achieve the same lifespan of 60 years, we are still looking at a grand total of 2640 offshore windmills.<br><br>We are at a tipping point, Nuclear reactor designing has been stagnant and stale due to lack of support and funding since the late 1980s, however nuclear reactor energy can be the most effective and quickest to roll out and combat climate change than any other option. However, we have waited too long, it takes serious spending in R&amp;D today, now, to ensure we have a commercially viable design in time (hopefully by 2030), so that the industry can shoulder the transition and bring out a fleet of quick, reliable, safe, cheap, carbon zero, and massive amounts of electricity. If we wait too long the new age reactors won&#39;t come in time to combat rapid and self-sustaining climate change.<br><br>By the year 2035 or 2040 our industries are going to be more occupied replacing current fleets of windmills and solar panels rather than expanding it, besides all the low-hanging fruit and easy locations where we can fit windmills will be occupied soon and getting the same capacity factor is going to become harder and harder. It stands to reason that the &quot;Not in my backyard&quot; mentality will show up hard considering the number of windmills and solar panel needed to be placed.<br><br>This isn&#39;t to say we should stop Wind and Solar Technology from being happening, quite the contrary, but as it has been shown, the expansion of renewables is too slow to keep up with current expansion.  We strongly believe nuclear energy if properly funded and developed and commercialized can be rolled out much faster and cheaper than renewables once it reaches economical maturity. We need to increase capacity factors, we need to increase lifespans, and we need to increase the recycleability of the windmills and solar panels before we can rely on this technology, and i don&#39;t see this happening in time.<br><br>I would strongly recommend that you treat nuclear energy in this light, New Age Nuclear is so much more potent, than the already existing Nuclear technology which is from the 1960s and 1970s and still manages to compete with current energy sources.

Done I had to point that out because I&#39;m tires of seeing the same lie spread over this on the internet.<br><br>Also there is one thing you didn&#39;t mention much or imo wrong actually is the cost of those future nuclear power plants:its not gonna be cheap, in fact it&#39;s gonna be a very expensive energy especially considering the price of renewable.<br>Right now renewable are cheaper than the current VERY cheap nuclear energy we have with very old plants that are paid for few times over. The new costly ones we&#39;re &quot;trying&quot; to build in the west are gonna cost more than any renewable.<br>Just refurbishing the current power plants we have to make them last about 15 years longer are gonna cost about 50 BILLIONS euros JUST for France&#39;s power plants..<br>That&#39;s doesn&#39;t include price for dismantling them afterwards or the upkeep for the waste etc etc..<br>So I can&#39;t help but thinking that those billions we&#39;re throwing at that energy could be used not only to build more renewable but invest in storage technologies and research for more efficient panels etc.<br>It&#39;s gonna be hard to give resources to both nuclear and renewable, at least not efficient that&#39;s for sure.<br>There are tons of bright ideas for energy storage to fix the issues with renewable, some brilliant that can store energy for years, some low tech that cost peanuts with simple cranes and concrete blocks, some with the production of hydrogen that could solve a lot of issues (for instance fuel for planes etc) and so on.<br><br>Anyway like I said you did a great job on this video, all options should be considered because the goal is not to be right for our egos, it&#39;s to save what can still be saved for our biome, but while I used to be pro nuclear back in the days, in today&#39;s time it just seems inefficient to invest so much time money and effort into a technology that will inevitably be a dead end (unless we plan to nuke each other&#39;s up at some point, in which case we&#39;ll need that sweet plutonium).<br><br>For now all I can regret is to see Europe failing miserably at investing in the technology of tomorrow, our solar panels industry has been completely wiped out by China because we couldn&#39;t protect ourselves from china&#39;s dumping, and we can&#39;t get together to spend our money on real progress like the USA does, that really makes me sad, not by stupid patriotism but as a human being wishing we could fix our mess.<br><br><br>Also one thing you sure didn&#39;t mention: the best way to reduce fossil fuel is to simply save up on electricity, not producing electricity is the ONLY way to emit nothing.

It is quick and easy, but we know it causes harmful waste. Yet, we are eager to label this as the solution to achieve our &#39;mission complete&#39; status once more. And just like coal, once in place, we risk repeating history, not being so eager to address those problems until they become critical, just like we did coal. <br><br>The goal is to save the planet while also not repeating history, replacing one harmful waste with another. This is why nuclear is often looked down upon. I&#39;m just as confident the people who once said they could make coal &quot;clean&quot; (that never happen, now did it) are the same type of people who today say, someday we can make nuclear &#39;clean&#39; too. Until you can actually do it, we shouldn&#39;t be in a hurry to be building out nuclear (let&#39;s not be conned again or make similar past mistakes).", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T19:32:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SmokyVirus1486", "comment_text": "Solution for nuclear watse thorium reactors thorium produces less waste and there is more of it on earth than uranium", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T19:32:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day", "comment_text": "<b>10 THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT THE CLIMATE</b><br><br><b>\u2460</b> Throughout most of its history Earth had no polar ice caps and the average global temperature was between 8\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C warmer than present time.<br><br><b>\u2461</b> We are in the middle of a 2.58-million-year-old glaciation \u2013 the Quaternary Glaciation.<br><br><b>\u2462</b> The current global warming started about 12,000 years ago.

It&#39;s not just the storage of the waste that would still be produced even with newer generations of nuclear power plants. We simply don&#39;t have have enough ressources to completely switch to nuclear energy. The worlds energy demand increases drastically, but much like oil, coal or gas, Uranium, which is the base material for every nuclear fossil, is limited. And not only that, we cannot even use all of it. <br><br>Most Uranium available is the stable isotope Uranium 238 (99.28 %), which is basically useless for energy production. In order to get nuclear fuels, we have to get it from the natural Uranium, by enrichment or by making Uranium decay into Plutonium. These are processes we can handle, but are extremely costly and the know ho is not available to everyone. Not to mention that not every country in the world has access to Uranium deposits.<br><br>Also there is a geopolitical component. Several treaties forbid sharing the know-how to enrich Uranium, because of the fear it could be used for weapons. And to be fair, it could. That&#39;s why the knowledge is strictly limited and every attempt to gain that knowledge, is strictly monitored by every global power. This situation would also place countries possessing Uranium deposits in a very strong position, forming a global cartell, regulating the flow of fuel to their own liking. Much like the OPEC does with oil. And that could lead to similiar crisis like the 1973 oil crisis. <br><br><br>So what&#39;s the alternative? Well, while we could increase the share of nuclear energy on the global market, we won&#39;t be able to cover our energy demand with it. Especially since the reduction of carbondioxide means, we need to electrify every aspect of our lives. Traffic, industry, private homes, everything. Good estimates tell us, that we would at least increase our demand for eletrical energy by a factor of 2.5 to 3. That&#39;s impossible to achieve only with nuclear energy. Except we manage to get nuclear fusion running anytime soon. But let&#39;s be honest, even if ITER and other projects are succesful, the first commercially usable power plants won&#39;t be available until the late 2050s or even later. Too late. <br><br>Instead we should focus on a better mixture, including not only modernized nuclear energy, but also renewable energies, water and energy storage technologies.

With rising sea levels, many sites may have to be abandoned!<br><br>We cannot use most of the existing power plants much longer for safety reasons. Most of them are already dangerously old and have reached the end of their service life! Extending these lifetimes would be very risky because most of the material of the reactors and the cooling circuits is already fatigued.<br><br> New plants would be finished in 5 years at the earliest, if the construction would start TODAY! That is MUCH too late for avoiding the climate change!<br><br>But those &quot;modern reactors&quot; do not even exist in reality yet, there are no prototypes! Research and development of those devices would take decades and consume billions of money. Time we don&#39;t have for fighting climate change and money that could be put to a better use a lot quicker.<br><br>It&#39;s not like we could just &quot;dump&quot; all the existing nuclear waste into a &quot;new kind of reactor&quot; and then &quot;burn&quot; it or &quot;melt&quot; it until most of it is gone. Only a small percentage of all existing nuclear material could be used. But there are no known technical processes yet that could manage to separate the waste.

Wind power being the worst over all after considering everything. But what about those massive batteries you will need?<br><br>So if we wanna JUST run the grid on renewable sources, (not including electric cars) you would already need MASSIVE amounts of batteries. If the sun gets covered by clouds and it doesn&#39;t rain, the only powerhouse lessening the load and trying to fill up the giant power packs are hydro power. And the juice in those packs will go down fast! If it is around the morning, for more then 1 day, the grid will surely lose power. Plus these type of renewables can&#39;t create enough extra electricity when people aren&#39;t using it very much to make up for a day that everyone might use it a lot. <br><br>Now imagine adding A TON of electric cars that are trying to charge on that same grid.

Find efficient ways to place those things places to make power where it would be doing nothing. Wind power, im honestly not a fan of wind power but you could add some wind turbines some places if you really want to but they are bad for nature, they are dangerous, and don&#39;t make enough power to make up for it. Hydro is again a very good alternative. It can cause some problems with water animals but it is WAY better then what wind power does. So we will use hydro for some big waterways that won&#39;t passively impact natural fish migration. Then we move onto nuclear which is the best option here along side hydro. It makes massive power, has zero carbon impact, and it won&#39;t stop based on environmental conditions. That is how it should go, as well as the government instead of investing in electric cars, incest in synthetic fuels because some people don&#39;t like electric cars for a reason, and its overall a much better solution to allow people to drive their current car and become zero emission overnight then buy a brand new electric car that has a high carbon impact because of battery production.<br><br>I know in the popular market electric cars will be more popular because they are cheaper to run and they can hold more stuff without a big engine, but they&#39;re are many reasons why you might want an ICE car.

Electric arc furnaces are not capable of doing that. They are used for processing iron in its reduced form (steel scrap), essentially a form of recycling. Iron/steel recycling is already quite high (over 70%) and yet is not enough to supply the current demand, so the need for iron produced from ore.<br><br>Coal is used in the reduction iron ore because at high temperatures carbon bonds more strongly with oxygen than iron. This is basic principle of the reduction of any metal ore. Coal also has the right strength to support the weight of the ore in the blast furnace and, of course, is the cheapest option. In some places (e.g., Brazil), for some specific applications and limited production volumes, charcoal (renewable source) is used as an alternative to coal, but other issues arise, remarkably the use of slave labour for its production.<br><br>Electrolysis of liquid iron ore is currently not viable. The seemingly most prominent solution nowadays is direct reduction of iron ore by direct reduction of iron oxide by hydrogen.

It superficially seems cheaper to continue using the coal power plant you already have than to build a new anything.

The result is that we&#39;re bottlenecked by effort, not the capability of renewable power.

Carbon capture is absolutely necessary for reversing the damage we&#39;ve caused but it also presents a lot of opportunities. There are companies and organizations like Carbon Engineering working on carbon capture that have also been able to create extremely clean synthetic fuels from the captured carbon and hydrogen from water. One of the large problems with both carbon capture and nuclear is funding. If carbon capture can partner with carbon neutral electric sources that also require water like nuclear and hydro, they can sell the synthetic fuels on a large scale with extra power that they produce. One problem with nuclear that I&#39;ve heard of is that they can&#39;t sell their full production capacity fast enough for there to be enough profit. I&#39;m sure that that&#39;s the case with hydro as well. Selling synthetic fuels could be the push for innovation in all three businesses and it could potentially start to outcompete large oil companies. <br><br>Another thing is that if enough carbon capture and carbon to fuel infrastructure is but in place powered by carbon neutral energy, that would mean that anything that is powered by those fuels like anything from cars to power plants would all be carbon neutral without changing that infrastructure.

If you want to heat up the Earth you must build a glass or plastic wall surrounding the Earth to stop convection cooling and <b>through mass mechanical energy transmission,</b> also known as the Newton\u2019s Cradle Effect. The gases in our atmosphere are always in motion.  They are not stationary like your asphalt driveway that heats up in the sunlight.  All of the gases in our atmosphere, even the tiny trace gases such as carbon dioxide (.04% of atmosphere) fully participate in convection cooling and the Newton\u2019s Cradle Effect, which carries heat from the surface of the Earth up to the stratosphere, where it is eventually radiated into Space.  You cannot build a usable boat out of a badminton net, and you cannot build a greenhouse out of a free flowing gas.  \r<br>\r<br>For scientific detail, please Google <b>The Renewable Energy Disaster + Christopher Calder + 50webs</b>", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T16:51:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ry Ry The Science Guy", "comment_text": "Nuclear energy is safer, cleaner, and more powerful than any fossil fuel tech today.

The dangers to humans have already been discussed in another video, however the danger to nature is often overlooked. Hydroplants are great, until you realize they destroy entire ecosystems and endanger entire species that use rivers for migrating and spawning. Windmills provide protection for fish when built at sea, however the building itself damages hearing of marine life. Birds of course are also effected by windmills, not long ago a white-tailed eagle was cut in two near where I live, and the noise they make may have an impact on local wildlife as well, especially considering more and more are built near or inside nature reserves because people don&#39;t want them near their homes (another fun fact btw is that bird fatalities can be avoided by painting one of the blades, but that would make them more visible so no-one&#39;s doing it). I&#39;d say solar energy probably has the lowest amount of impact on nature, however I&#39;m fairly certain the amount of area they need to produce the same amount of electricity compared to one nuclear power plant is insane. Add mining activities and you might think nuclear energy does more damage to nature, but don&#39;t forget that all these solar panels and windmills need rare earth materials to be produced as well. <br>We need nuclear power and the fact that NGOs like Greenpeace are still against them is horrifying.", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T16:51:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gablaw", "comment_text": "Why this video presents renewebles as a better energy source than nuclear ?

Also I&#39;m surprised that they also addressed the reasons of high costs in the west (as reported by Grubler 2010) and the cheap and quick reactor builds in the east (Lovering 2016) which is due to the West stopping builds after Chernobyl (circa 1986), while South Korea kept building and retaining the skills to build nuclear plants.

They are simply too energy dilute to be truly viable. <br><br>In order to power current world needs (which are growing), we would need to cover the equivalent of the entire country of Spain in solar panels (roughly 200,000sqmi). This produces a number of problems. At that scale we begin to run into manufacturing as a major pollution concern, as large quantities of metal and plastic must be produced for the purpose (including handling, use, and disposal of hazardous materials). Economically, it is incredibly expensive and resource intensive to produce this many panels. Practically, panels must be located in areas which receive enough sun of a proper intensity. Electricity will need to travel from these areas to where it is needed, and this factor is pretty much prohibitive for many countries which are sufficiently far from the equator. Large solar installations also come with some serious environmental concerns like land clearing, displacement of wildlife, disposal of depleted/damaged materials, and harm to birds. <br><br>Wind is FAR worse. In order to power the world it would take roughly 2.3 million sqmi of wind farms. It is the most unreliable source of energy in common use (about half as reliable as solar, which is the 3rd least reliable. Hydro is the 2nd least reliable). It requires far more land clearing and has an even worse impact on wildlife, particularly birds. In the production of 1 wind turbine roughly 250 tons of CO2 is released. The use case for wind is so minimal that it is completely laughable to suggest that it could play a major factor in world energy production. <br><br>Now a comparison to nuclear. 1000-MW nuclear energy plant can be placed on 1sqmi, vs 50sqmi for solar (in an area of good sun) and 250sqmi for wind (in an area of good wind quality). Nuclear is the most reliable energy source. Nuclear is the safest energy source, with 0.04 deaths per terrawatt hour (0.15 for wind, 0.44 solar, 1.4 hydro, 4 gas, 36 oil, 161 coal. This metric includes deaths from accidents, like Chernobyl, along with construction and operation). The new generation of thorium reactors are projected to produce 1/1000th the amount of waste that current nuclear technologies use. This video acknowledges that waste can be turned into new fuel, and in general there are technologies emerging that capture energy from radioactive waste to be used in the power grid or for other use cases. Nuclear fuel has the potential to be almost completely waste free.<br><br>So yes, solar is the future if you are thinking about a dyson array...but while we are bound to earth nuclear is the only viable option. If you don&#39;t believe me, try pricing out solar and wind options for your home (exclude subsidies - which is a way of distributing losses across society - for a more honest cost/benefit analysis).", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T16:35:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ck Infinity", "comment_text": "I already have the answer it&#39;s yes", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T16:35:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evan Kazmierczak", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhAemz1v7dQ&amp;t=2m05s\">2:05</a>: A wild Magnemite has appeared!", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T16:35:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bajantexan87", "comment_text": "Nuclear energy has nutty energy density, and what&#39;s more, as innovations in fission come along, there may come a point where we can have fusion reactors online.

An estimate by TED-Ed showed that to power the world with solar panels you&#39;d need roughly 95,000 km\u00b2 of land, or about the size of South Korea. Nuclear on the other hand, only requires about 1/24th the amount of land at about 4,000 km\u00b2, or about the size of Delaware. Wind is just stupid because for that you&#39;d need a little over 21 times the area of wind, or 2,000,000 km\u00b2, the size of Mexico. You can argue that Solar and Wind will over come these challenges and shortcomings, so will nuclear. The big problem with nuclear is the stigma around it as well as the politics, If Political Party A wants to do nuclear, Political Party B is against it, if Party A then says they&#39;re now against it, Party B is now for it. Another thing is that every source of power has limitations on how much it can produce, &quot;renewables&quot; have it far more than others due to their nature. You can only get so much from the sunlight, the wind can only blow so hard, and there is only so many rivers and lakes that need Hydro and the water can only move so fast.

The way these work is that they convert 238U (which is the vast majority of Uranium, around 99.2%, but can&#39;t directly be used for nuclear fission) into Plutonium (which can be used for nuclear fission). This means that, for the same amount of mined Uranium, you can get around 100x the nuclear fuel, cutting down on waste by about that same factor, and the waste that you&#39;re left with mostly has a shorter lifetime than what you get without breeder reactors. However, there are two challenges. First, you need to engineer your breeder reactor to do the conversion to Plutonium, which means you&#39;re optimizing it for something other than simply producing energy as efficiently and effectively as possible, which leads to tradeoffs. But that&#39;s fine, that seems worth it, and we can do it, in principle. The second problem is the real killer: it is much, much, much easier to do the sort of refining and enriching necessary to make a nuclear bomb when you&#39;re working with Plutonium rather than Uranium, so anti-proliferation treaties tend to discourage or ban producing Plutonium on purpose. And, honestly, as much as I love nuclear energy and the idea of breeder reactors, that kind of makes sense. I think that we should work on it, work toward a world where we can trust each other enough to feel good about producing Plutonium for the sake of even cleaner and more efficient nuclear energy, but we should have a century or two in which to work out the political details necessary for that, so I think it&#39;s worth waiting on breeder reactors and work with nuclear energy without breeder reactors while we&#39;re figuring that out.", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T16:14:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fabrizio Carbajal Pimentel", "comment_text": "Nuclear energy is a path that will guide us to the use of renewable energy", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T16:14:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Davide Armao", "comment_text": "I think that we all agree the best way to stop climate change in the safest way would be: keeping the energy produced with nuclear tecnology constant and improving the amount of energy produced by renewvable resource.

For one thing, it is a little disingenuous to claim in one video that nuclear is safe, then say in the next video that costs for nuclear energy are only high because of regulation. The regulations are what makes it safe; safety is fundamentally what is incurring the high cost. You also don&#39;t mention at all the nuclear weapon proliferation/nuclear terrorism risk that comes with a significant expansion of nuclear power around the world. <br><br>Secondly, when addressing climate change, there are pretty important economic factors that likely make renewables + storage a better solution short term. The important thing is that renewables have a lower up front cost and construction time. The lower up front cost makes it easier to attract investors/political capital for renewable projects than it is for nuclear, and makes it faster to pay off the debt to reinvest in new projects. If we are investing in nuclear at the cost of renewables, then there is a huge emissions opportunity cost that comes from the delays in decommissioning fossil fuel power sources while you wait for your nuclear investment to pay off. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to have 10-20 years of emissions while a new nuclear plant is constructed, when we could have invested the same amount of money in a larger production capacity in renewables + storage that is ready in 5 years, and nearly paid off before the nuclear plant has produced a single kWh.<br><br>Finally, I just want to point out that most of the new energy production capacity over the next century is likely to come from developing countries, where the two points I have mentioned become even more important. These countries unfortunately tend to have poorer regulatory structure, so human factors in safety become a much larger consideration. In addition they are going to be more susceptible to conflict and the effects of climate change, so nuclear plants are more likely to be hit by situations outside of design parameters. Under these conditions, the idea that nuclear is strictly safer than other energy sources becomes a much harder sell. Probably more importantly, these countries tend to have cash flow problems, so the high up-front costs for nuclear are also super problematic.<br><br>Overall, while I agree with your thesis that nuclear is an important part of the energy equation, I think you have done yourself a disservice by overselling its effectiveness at fighting climate change. While we shouldn&#39;t be rushing to shut down nuclear power plants, and we should be continuing research advanced reactor designs, we also shouldn&#39;t be rushing to build nuclear if it comes at the cost of renewables. There are situations where new nuclear reactors will be warranted, but it will likely be much more limited than what you seem to imply in the video. If we were having this discussion 20 years ago, when renewables were significantly more expensive and we had more time to fight climate change, then a large expansion in nuclear would probably have been the way forward (at least in the western world). There may be a time in the future when new designs or changing economic factors means that investment in nuclera makes sense again. As it stands we&#39;ve run out of time, and &quot;big nuclear&quot; to solve climate change doesn&#39;t really make sense anymore.<br><br>If I am wrong, I would love to see these points addressed in a future video!", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T15:51:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u674e\u674e\u6d4e\u6df3", "comment_text": "long time no see", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T15:51:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oscar Guinane", "comment_text": "Yes", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T15:51:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dominick Yeo", "comment_text": "The future is hydrogen fusion", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T15:51:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grzegorz Sobkowicz", "comment_text": "Uranium fueled reactors take all the spotlight, while no one talks about Thorium reactors.", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T15:51:29Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jo\u00e3o Vaz", "comment_text": "I really don&#39;t know how Kurzgesagt are able to keep working and producing such amazing videos.

Also they need replacement propellers at least yearly but the material they are made of is (to my knowledge) not reusable so they just bury old turbine propellers. Also solar panel production is weighs quite heavy on the enviroment and I don&#39;t exacly know that it has a service time long enough to balnce out the harm their production generates. Yes, you mentioned all of them have their own problems but when we talk about renewable energy sources we always forget to mention their problems in detail. I&#39;m going to use my country for an example. Hungary has a lot of farmlands and in order to make wind turbine and solar panel energy farms it would need a lot of space so less farmland which present a small economic problem (and also ruins the astethics of the land). I don&#39;t support of course energy production by old means (coal, oil and gas powerplants). I support energy production via nuclear power plants. To my knowledge Germany shutting down their nuclear reactors and reopening its coal powerplants already have some effects on the enviroment and air quality.

Belgium just decided to close all nuclear power plants in the next few years. Everyone (every political party) seems to love it. They want to replace nuclear with natural gaz. This is an environmental and health disaster but the green party loves it so much and is extremely proud to say &quot;other countries will reduce their carbon emissions to compensate&quot;. We literally have reports publicly stating that we are going to pollute way more, but no one cares. It drives me absolutely crazy. And then, when it comes to building HVDC lines to support wind energy, no one wants them! I have no idea how to vote (in Belgium, France, and EU, the green party&#39;s official position is that nuclear = bad, natural gaz = no one cares) green and not support their pseudoscientific claims about nuclear, as well as their uninformed ideas on how to build electrical grids. And France is going in the same direction. There are way more urgent problems than nuclear energy, like, I don&#39;t know, a mass extinction, rising seas, increasing amount of natural disasters, droughts, destroyed crops, etc.<br>Sorry for the rant, this video may be the most important you&#39;ve ever made, I loved it.", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T15:42:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ula\u015f \u00dcst\u00fcn", "comment_text": "Not Kurzgesagt team inventing 4 new League of Legends champions in a single video", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T15:42:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dimitrije Pesic", "comment_text": "Ok but I need to know who had the idea to put Sekiro as the videogame on the screen xD", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T15:41:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Whateverslav", "comment_text": "Fuck yeah, LIQUID THORIUM HERE WE COME.", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T15:41:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bold Book", "comment_text": "<b>rubs hands together</b><br>No we don&#39;t need other energy sources, the ones we have will suffice to give me and my investments a good life", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T15:41:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Mackeen", "comment_text": "Breeder/Replicator Nuclear facilities were originally built the same time as the single use reactors... but greed won the day and it is our main one now for some reason...

I&#39;m not hearing any of these kind of ideas from the left in general.<br><br>In addition to that, Roger Scruton has very good views on ecology and this has strengthened the conservative debate on maintaining a nuclear backbone, on how to tackle climate change, how renewables shouldn&#39;t be treated as a utopia until we are able to rely on them blindly. I would vote conservative if they didn&#39;t stress a nationalist agenda, but to be honest, they&#39;re the only ones who seem to actually think about these kind of issues with a clear mind, listen to the scientists instead of trying to push their own ideology or turn this crisis into another profit margin (liberals), and I find it rather worrying that the left, which is supposed to be progressive and open to scientific debate, is this ideological block that prefers to tear each other apart over minute details on identity, treating every subject with political correctness, rather than trying to have a sensible debate. Even with this whole pandemic they keep talking about their ideological views, instead of trying to co-operate. Only a few parties are talking about how this pandemic has a gruesome impact on poor and excluded communities, most of them being rather communist. Green party just does nothing besides showing their sympathy, congratulating everyone who is trying to solve it, and saying we should &quot;think out of the box&quot; for solutions.

Until it is feasible nuclear power is the best option. 1. It is extremely reliable  2. It creates ludicrous amounts of power, and 3. All know disasters caused by nuclear power were through human error. With our better modern designs and the ability to recycle nuclear waste we solve two problems. We reduce the chance of a disaster and we effectively negate the nuclear waste problem. The only thing I do not like about nuclear is how expensive nuclear fuel is and how rare it can be coupled with the fact it is non-renewable.

However with the latest Technological advancements in Nuclear Energy, the next generation of reactors will be safer. Research in the USA in regards to next generation reactors look very promising and exciting. Far safer, getting more energy out of uranium as currently we only get about 10% of the energy out of Uranium then discard it which is crazy so part helps the waste issue is we get more energy out before we bin it and if we can deploy recycling of fuel rods, very helpful.

Of the myriad classification criteria we had available - renewable vs. non-renewable, fossil vs. &#39;green&#39;, etc. - we decided to employ centralized vs. distributed as our basic taxonomy. Source availability, infrastructure requirements and scalability are all factors that determine whether a particular type of energy fits best within these two categories.<br><br>For example: Nuclear energy, at least with our current models of production, requires fulfilling extensive infrastructure needs - such as fuel sourcing, facility security and waste disposal processes to name a few. Therefore the scale of production must be large enough to outweigh these tradeoffs. Contrast this with wind or solar - which can and are widely deployed at much, much smaller scale; my friends have both solar panels and a wind generator on their sailboat. They are apples to oranges in this sense that they fulfill different energy needs.<br><br>The better comparison for Nuclear exists between it and other centralized sources such as legacy fossil fuel.

Not to mention, there\u2019s already talk and development on nuclear fusion energy, which could be very beneficial and is way less risky. What I tend to see as the counterpoints to nuclear (fission) energy relies on the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d The three major and notable nuclear disasters that have occurred have been Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island. Chernobyl was due to poor building and management. Fukushima was due to poor timing of events (the tsunami that hit the generators, not allowing the nuclear power plant\u2019s core to cool down). And in Three Mile island, which was what made many people afraid of nuclear energy, the containment building actually did its job and prevented a total meltdown. There are a few others that have happened in history, but those are the most known three. The only problems I see with nuclear energy is the waste it produces and storing it, since the half life of much of the waste is very long and there aren\u2019t many outside places to store it. Also, I remember seeing that nuclear power plants in France use a different type of uranium than we do in the U.S.. The uranium they use is a lot more prevalent in the world compared to the one we use. France also uses a different type of nuclear power plant structure than we do, which I think is related to the type of uranium they use. I honestly wish that nuclear energy was a more popular idea, but many people are scared of the possible outcomes, even though the chances of a meltdown at all are very low. Maybe we\u2019ll have nuclear fusion in the near future, which would be very nice.", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T14:27:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leonardo Rodrigues", "comment_text": "Fiquei um pouco deprimido, mas dei o like! <br>Moro no Brasil e vejo que este pa\u00eds poderia ser refer\u00eancia mundial em produ\u00e7\u00e3o energ\u00e9tica, por meio das fontes mais eficientes e sustent\u00e1veis que poderiam existir, mas somos compelidos a ir na dire\u00e7\u00e3o contr\u00e1ria, para nos mantermos irrelevantes nesses aspectos e n\u00e3o amea\u00e7armos a pujan\u00e7a e os privil\u00e9gios de quem est\u00e1 com o poder.
