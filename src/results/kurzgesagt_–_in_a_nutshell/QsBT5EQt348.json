Of all the environmental problems our planet is facing today, overpopulation is the one that sometimes slips from the radar. Overpopulation places a great demand on resources and land, which may be the reason for widespread environmental issues in addition to impacting global economies and standards of living.<br>Poverty is to be believed as the major cause of overpopulation. High mortality rate and lack of educational resources, leads to high birth rates, resulting in a large population.<br>If overpopulation grows, this effect is said to be so widespread that the United Nations has predicted that the 48 poorest countries of the world contribute to the largest population growth. They estimate that the combined population of these countries is expected to be 1.7 billion in 2050 from 850 million in 2010.<br><br>The effects of the overpopulation are quite severe. One of these is the lack of natural resources. Earth has the capacity to only produce a limited amount of food and water, falling short of current needs of the people which are increasing day by day.<br><br>Rapid population growth makes the choice between high consumption and investment needed to bring more consumption in the future more scarce. Economic development depends on investment. Therefore, rapid population growth repels the investment needed for higher future consumption.<br><br>With a rapidly growing population, the adjustment becomes difficult to manage with economic and social change. Urbanization in UDC creates problems like housing, electricity, water, transport etc. In addition, the growing population is at risk of permanent environmental damage through urbanization in some rural areas.<br><br>The rapidly growing population transforms the economy into mass unemployment and low employment. As the population increases, the ratio of workers to the total population increases. The result is that with an increase in the labour force, unemployment and low employment increases. Rapid increment of the population reduces savings and investment.<br><br>Domestic consumption of exportable goods also increases with rapid population growth. As a result, there is a decline in the exportable surplus. On the other hand just to meet the demand of the rapidly growing population, more food and other consumer goods are needed so that demand can be fulfilled.", "comment_date": "2022-04-23T19:20:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "hockeystick", "comment_text": "the Earth&#39;s population is not a problem... its the political and economic systems we deploy that have caused the issues", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T16:41:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Sakalauskas", "comment_text": "The 5th stage can exist,but you will only have 1.5 children in your life,maybe this will happen if our population is to high", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T19:26:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ian Bartczak", "comment_text": "But can our planet sustain 8 billion people living like the developed nations?  no.

Correctly More Developed Countries (MDCs) have a more developed economy people have access to birth control while women have access to education and can have lives without having kids. In Less Developed Countries (LDCs) they don&#39;t have that. More people are engaged in Subsistence agriculture and doing stuff to survive and feed there family not focused on other things. Whereas in MDCs less than 2% engage in Commercial Agriculture and other people are engaged in specialized jobs in a commercial economy. It&#39;s much different. And to develop a country is a lot of time, effort, money, and determination from the people and it does not always work out. And in an effort to develop a country they get loans from world banks and sometimes this can end up exploiting a country economy. Our population will eventually level off. The medical revolution and the 2 &amp; 3 Agriculture Revolutions  will diffuse to the LDCs. This video sums this up pretty well and is amazingly simple and easy to understand.

We&#39;re energizing ground water tables with positive electron charge and telling storms not to come here, and with electron to magnetic earth ground charge a low depression stir where h20 reaches ground and which replenishes water like it should rarely happens, so it just evaps off, that&#39;s why lightening is more likely to hit the lone farm house rather than the neighborhood.

And with more jobs everywhere, everyone will have more for each other and dollars will go further everywhere. All the kids playing on dad&#39;s monopoly game will have a fun life and get back to serving one another.

You split the ocean stream for indoor fresh water and salt water fish farming. You build or convert 40 story buildings for indoor farming. Every acre under roof is an 80-120 acre farm, but instead of 12 hours of light, there&#39;s solar glass panels and you have 24 hours of light, 12 months of growing instead of 6, so maybe an 80 acre indoors is like 320. You grow too much food so the empty good truck picks up the blemished felt and vegetables for fertilizer. You can have a cow floor, a dairy farm and a chicken floor in what was an office building. One person drives an hour with gas and clogs tollways to drive to a city where someone else has to drive an hour to his town to work. Now they both work from home, they can get paid more and write off an office in their home, empty office building can be converted to indoor farms, and the sprinkler system can be used for irrigation. You can grow every crop in the world, everywhere, indoor, with every climate and 24/7/365 agriculture, and not even smell farm animals in a building <br><br>For what it costs to build housing here and grow food on welfare, we can pay people who want to go to another country and build indoor farms and drag ocean lines and build clean energy waste water stations.

We&#39;re energizing ground water tables with positive electron charge and telling storms not to come here, and with electron to magnetic earth ground charge a low depression stir where h20 reaches ground and which replenishes water like it should rarely happens, so it just evaps off, that&#39;s why lightening is more likely to hit the lone farm house rather than the neighborhood.

And with more jobs everywhere, everyone will have more for each other and dollars will go further everywhere. All the kids playing on dad&#39;s monopoly game will have a fun life and get back to serving one another.

You split the ocean stream for indoor fresh water and salt water fish farming. You build or convert 40 story buildings for indoor farming. Every acre under roof is an 80-120 acre farm, but instead of 12 hours of light, there&#39;s solar glass panels and you have 24 hours of light, 12 months of growing instead of 6, so maybe an 80 acre indoors is like 320. You grow too much food so the empty good truck picks up the blemished felt and vegetables for fertilizer. You can have a cow floor, a dairy farm and a chicken floor in what was an office building. One person drives an hour with gas and clogs tollways to drive to a city where someone else has to drive an hour to his town to work. Now they both work from home, they can get paid more and write off an office in their home, empty office building can be converted to indoor farms, and the sprinkler system can be used for irrigation.

The real reason for declining birthrates was primarily the economics reasons of each family and the increasing pressure on human production which affect most people today in several ways.

In the United States, the marriage rate has dropped below that of the Great Depression.

And finished the 2nd. World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth.", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T20:22:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sue cli", "comment_text": "If you like this you have a big dick", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T14:07:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mathia Lucas", "comment_text": "HOW I GOT CURE TO MY DIABETES WITH THE HELP OF DR ORIANE NATURAL HERBAL CURE\u00a0<br>I can\u2019t believe this.

Many Production Companies Has To Be Stopped<br><br>We manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. So if we can minimise our products, pollution would be less.<br>We produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. Cold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be prepared or served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things so much pollution could be reduced. Also these companies need so much water and electricity, we could give that water and electricity to places where water and electricity supply is less. As the world is facing pollution problems, we should stop producing things which is not a necessity for humans. In this way we would create less pollution. <br>If we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don&#39;t colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in white natural colour. <br>What about the companies that are going to be stopped, they would have debts to pay. The companies which cannot pay the debts just excuse them. We will think that if companies are going to be shut down then how the Industrialists and so many people who would lose their jobs, how will they survive. Well companies and people&#39;s on one side and the earth on one side, which should we save, the earth is more important.<br><br>2. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form<br><br>We can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. <br>But if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.<br>So if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world.<br>This must be done. The World is researching on how to clear the earth&#39;s pollution, but if we stopped many companies like bread manufacturing company and others which are not required as a necessity, so much pollution could be reduced and maybe we won&#39;t even have to research on how to clear the earth&#39;s pollution.<br><br>3. Pickles should not be stored<br><br>Most of the people buy pickles to eat, while some make it at home. If pickles are bought from a store then a company has also to make glass bottles to store the pickles. If made at home then still glass bottles are required to store the pickles. <br>But if we make pickles at home and only cook how much is needed for one time then we won&#39;t need glass bottles to store the pickles. Glass bottles when manufactured it creates water pollution.<br><br>4. We Should Stop Using Makeup Products<br><br>Many women&#39;s all over the world do makeup. Makeup is not a necessity for humans. Instead of doing makeup to look beautiful, women&#39;s should do exercise daily. If they exercise and sweat, eat fruits daily, they would have less dead skins and be naturally beautiful. They could save so much money if they stop using makeup products. If this is done then all the makeup manufacturing companies can be shut down. In this way all the pollution resulting from the makeup manufacturing companies would also be stopped.<br><br>5. How To Reduce Transportation In The World<br><br>If one country invents a thing and then exports it to other countries in the world, much transportation is needed. Instead of that the invented thing should be taught to every countries in the world. If done like this transportation would<br>be less needed. Only raw materials should be imported and exported<br>from one country to another. Countries should not import and export eatable things if it can be produced in their own countries. If one country has excess agricultural food grains, fruits, then only that country should export that things to other countries. If this is done, so much pollution can be reduced because of less transportation.<br>If one country has invented a thing and they would think that if they taught other countries the method to invent that thing, then they would lose profits, but that will not be the case as other countries when they will invent a thing, they will also teach the method to invent that thing to all other countries in the world.<br>If pollution problem was not present then no problem, one country after inventing a thing could transport it to all other countries in the world, but now as pollution problem is present, then this should not be done.<br><br>6. Electricity Pollution<br><br>We create electricity from many types of sources like coal, water, etc., but it creates pollution. If electricity created from windmill and solar energy then no pollution occurs. But still to manufacture windmill and solar machines pollution would occur.<br>As I previously said that if we shut down many manufacturing companies which are producing things which are not a necessity for humans, then the world would not require so much electricity. Then maybe we could provide electricity to the whole world from windmill and Solar panels which are not pollutant. If we stopped producing electricity from coal, water, etc., then the pollution resulting from them won&#39;t occur. Shouldn&#39;t we take this step to protect our earth as already our earth is suffering so much from global warming and climate change. Is their any other choice, I don&#39;t think so. <br>At present the world is researching how to solve the pollution problem, it would take how many years I don&#39;t know and also would it possible or impossible, God knows. Could we wait till that time when scientists would find how to solve pollution problems and till that the earth won&#39;t have a major natural disaster, nobody knows. We must shut down many companies which are not required as a necessity for humans.<br><br>7. Free Things To The Peoples<br><br>As I previously said to shut down many companies which are not required as a necessity for humans, if done then many would become jobless and lose their business. <br>So to solve this problem the world has to make food, clothing, shelter, medicine, surgeries and education free to the peoples. If this step is taken then we can shut down any company we want. The government&#39;s of every country should arrange agricultural lands in new places for farming and supply water and seeds and all other things necessary for farming free to the people&#39;s who have lost their source of income, if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own. If this is done then no one would starve for food and robberies can be reduced so much in the world.<br>Many people&#39;s should do agriculture and farming. Many people should study botany subject so that they have knowledge of plants and they should do farming. <br>A book must be written about how much amount of food of any type a person should consume, to cook foods half or full, because if we eat too much of a thing then some problems arises due to that. The lands of the companies can be turned back to forests, trees can be planted or turned into a farm.<br><br>8. Firecrackers should be banned<br><br>Firecrackers should be banned because it is harmful for animals. Animals have different levels of hearing and when we burst crackers which have a loud noise the dogs run away from that place. The dogs may hear the noise more louder than humans. When we fire the rocket cracker up in the sky and it bursts and if any bird is near to the explosion then that birds internal organs are damaged and they die just because of that explosion sound. Also peoples who have asthma illness, they face problems during Diwali. So much papers and threads are used in manufacturing crackers. The persons working in the manufacturing companies also suffer.<br>Now when their are animals rights for not harming them, then this step of banning firecrackers must be taken.<br><br>9. Hair cutting salons are not required<br><br>Instead of cutting our hair and shaving our beard in a salon, if everybody learns how to cut hair, then in a family everybody can cut each other&#39;s hair. If this is done then no need of hair cutting salons. All those hair cutting places can be used for other purposes.<br>We require scissors, blades, razors, shaving brush and shaving creams for hair cut and beard shaving. What if we use a hair removing soap for our hair cut and shaving purposes. Their is a soap for hair removal and it is also cheap. For women&#39;s who need hair cut for them scissors has to be used to cut the hair, no choice for that, but for men&#39;s hair cut and beard shaving if hair removing soap is used, he would become bald, but if we do this then we won&#39;t need to manufacture blades, razors, shaving brush and creams. All those manufacturing companies can be shut down and hence less pollution for the world.<br>People use hair dye to colour their hairs. The hair dye manufacturing companies after production dumps its waste in rivers or seas which pollutes the water. So all hair dye manufacturing companies should be shut down. For the sake of our planet earth this step must be taken.", "comment_date": "2020-07-04T05:42:41Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Pedro Ivo G.S.", "comment_text": "However, how can the stabilised countries pay so many eld people?", "comment_date": "2020-07-04T02:12:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude67.\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63", "comment_text": "We should remove genitals at birth to control population", "comment_date": "2020-07-03T20:55:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mayor of cap town fifi balls", "comment_text": "Before watching this video : fuck the virus <br><br>6 minutes and 39 seconds later :", "comment_date": "2020-07-03T18:30:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SHREYAS", "comment_text": "Over population means more problems to survive <br>Covid-19 : don&#39;t worry I will handle it", "comment_date": "2020-07-03T11:22:41Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Dumer 122", "comment_text": "Until Mars happens", "comment_date": "2020-07-03T03:06:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Galore", "comment_text": "How About Cannibalism, It Would Solve Over Population And World Hunger", "comment_date": "2020-07-03T00:56:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Piyush Gedam", "comment_text": "Well Syria did it in 5 years!!", "comment_date": "2020-07-02T20:56:27Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Rachel Highly", "comment_text": "So you feel like if these are on a cicule over the years", "comment_date": "2020-07-02T18:46:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rachel Highly", "comment_text": "So cool is this what could happen to us in the next century.", "comment_date": "2020-07-02T18:43:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mystari", "comment_text": "The good comments were buried to make space to terrible overused coronavirus jokes, sad.", "comment_date": "2020-07-02T17:06:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Shining Emeralds", "comment_text": "H\u0344\u0360\u0313\u030e\u032f\u0302\u0345e\u035c\u033f\u0347\u030b\u0362\u0331\u0303\u0358l\u035d\u031d\u0347\u033e\u0309\u033e\u0303\u031cl\u0352\u033f\u0312\u034b\u0340\u0361o\u0329\u033a\u031e\u0320\u0361\u0310\u035c\u0315\u035a", "comment_date": "2020-07-02T12:23:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Toasty Volvo", "comment_text": "SUPPORT YOU ON PATREON?!

To make a comparison for every European in 1900 today there are 1.9 Europeans, for every African in 1900 today there are 10 Africans and in the future perhaps from 25 to 40. Furthermore many countries for religious or cultural reasons sabotage any family planning plan . The world until the industrial revolution had its demographic balance which saw Asia have 60% of the world population, Europe 15%, Africa 10-15% and America 10%. The industrial revolution had increased the European population to 25-33% of the world population, which allowed Europe (thanks to the simultaneous presence of a large population and the best technology) to dominate the world. Today Europe at 5-7% of the world population is heading towards an even greater decline, on the contrary Africa which today has reached 17% (from the minimum of 7% in 1900) will reach 25-40%. Does this mean that Europe will exist only as a geographical extension, moreover how will it be able to compete economically, politically or culturally with an Afria that accounts for 40% of the world&#39;s population? So the biggest problem of the modern demographic transition is that it is too irregular creating continuous global imbalances and causing entire peoples and cultures to decline as well as favoring the extreme right. Furthermore, European countries have entered the 5th phase, that is birth rates lower than 2.1 which lead countries to lose population and to grow old. Countries like France can withstand fertility rates below 2.1, because they have a lot of immigration but above all because their rate is very close and is 1.9 making each generation 5% smaller than the next. But countries like Italy or Ukraine cannot solve the demographic drop with immigration, because they have too low fertility rates (1.2-1.3) which lead them to an intergenerational drop of 40%. This means that the new generation will have to support a generation 140% bigger. Except for Africa which has a fertility rate of 4.4 children, the rest of the world has a fertility rate of 2 children not 2.5 (which are given by African fertility). The fundamental problem is African fertility.<br>S\u00ec, ma il problema \u00e8 che la transizione demografica \u00e8 troppo irregolare nel mondo, portando al conflitto etnico e al declino culturale. mentre i paesi europei l&#39;hanno raggiunta un secolo fa, l&#39;Asia e il Sud America stanno arrivando l\u00ec con maggiori problemi (citt\u00e0 molto pi\u00f9 sopraffatte delle loro controparti europee allo stesso tempo della transizione), l&#39;Africa \u00e8 ancora nella fase due da un secolo e probabilmente lo sar\u00e0 per almeno altri 30 anni o pi\u00f9. Per fare un paragone per ogni europeo nel 1900 oggi ci sono 1,9 europei, per ogni africano nel 1900 oggi ci sono 10 africani e in futuro forse dai 25 ai 40. Inoltre molti paesi per motivi religiosi o culturali sabotano qualsiasi piano di pianificazione familiare. Il mondo fino alla rivoluzione industriale ha avuto il suo equilibrio demografico che ha visto l&#39;Asia avere il 60% della popolazione mondiale, l&#39;Europa il 15%, l&#39;Africa il 10-15% e l&#39;America il 10%. La rivoluzione industriale aveva aumentato la popolazione europea al 25-33% della popolazione mondiale, il che ha permesso all&#39;Europa (grazie alla presenza simultanea di una grande popolazione e alla migliore tecnologia) di dominare il mondo. Oggi l&#39;Europa al 5-7% della popolazione mondiale si sta dirigendo verso un declino ancora maggiore, al contrario l&#39;Africa che oggi ha raggiunto il 17% (dal minimo del 7% nel 1900) raggiunger\u00e0 il 25-40%. Ci\u00f2 significa che l&#39;Europa esister\u00e0 solo come estensione geografica, inoltre come potr\u00e0 competere economicamente, politicamente o culturalmente con un&#39;Africa che rappresenta il 40% della popolazione mondiale? Quindi il problema pi\u00f9 grande della moderna transizione demografica \u00e8 che \u00e8 troppo irregolare creando continui squilibri globali e causando il declino di intere popolazioni e culture oltre a favorire l&#39;estrema destra. Inoltre, i paesi europei sono entrati nella quinta fase, ovvero tassi di natalit\u00e0 inferiori a 2,1 che portano i paesi a perdere popolazione e invecchiare. Paesi come la Francia possono resistere a tassi di fertilit\u00e0 inferiori a 2,1, perch\u00e9 hanno molta immigrazione ma soprattutto perch\u00e9 il loro tasso \u00e8 molto vicino ed \u00e8 1,9, rendendo ogni generazione pi\u00f9 piccola del 5% rispetto alla successiva. Ma paesi come l&#39;Italia o l&#39;Ucraina non possono risolvere il calo demografico con l&#39;immigrazione, perch\u00e9 hanno tassi di fertilit\u00e0 troppo bassi (1,2-1,3) che li portano a un calo intergenerazionale del 40%. Ci\u00f2 significa che la nuova generazione dovr\u00e0 supportare una generazione pi\u00f9 grande del 140%. Ad eccezione dell&#39;Africa che ha un tasso di fertilit\u00e0 di 4,4 bambini, il resto del mondo ha un tasso di fertilit\u00e0 di 2 bambini non di 2,5 (che sono dati dalla fertilit\u00e0 africana).

The western civilazation  was and will still be for many years to come influenced by the religion of christ  and some standars wich they didn&#39;t:1)allow people to chose their partners, 2) to have as many kids possible. So due to this  religius and cultural aka class differences everybody should have as many people as possible  nomater how rich or poor he was, or how pretty or ugly he was, not as smart or stupid he was. This may seem far but in Greece where i came from this was happening 40 years ago. So this led to have every bad gene combination as possible. But this also led to a good or even brilliant gene combinations to be fucked up due to class differences. Then science and biology came up and know the cultural standards have changed slightly in Greece. The most important is that know everybody can fuck everybody he wants  aka combine his genes to a person that real natural selection wants and have as many kids he wants. But  this is leading to the class  and cultural problem (aka enviroment) and  which is also as important as the gonotype. Greece has the worst educational problem in Europe. This leads to another problem. Good gene combination to be lost due to class differences and not even exist and bad gene combinations to have many children because they have the money to afford  to have as many children as possible. So if whe don&#39;t die in a war the next few decades or from coravirus this will leed to a smaller population with huge class differences. I know many friends  my age that can&#39;t find a pussy to reproduce because their gene combinations are fucked up or because they are smart a.f. or pretty or athletic and don&#39;t have children  or one children  because they simply can not afford it! So how you clean up this mess? Very simple... Create a  rough but also brilliant (without religion off course) and equal educational  system that is free for everyone? So what will happen if you  treat all students as fair ass possible and ass rough ass possible(my suggestion is from Greece specially is to take all the kids from their parents at the smallest age ass possible)? You will get the right things in the right place at once. You will have  the future generation that knows science,population genetics and evolution  and also will have the opportunity to have as many kids ass possible. No one can make someone a fool for being stupid then(or fucked up in nother way). He will know that his genes are his problems and not the enviroment. This mutual understanding of  &#39;&#39;week&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;capable&#39;&#39; , will also lead to extremely capable people to have as many kids ass possible and to week (by genes not by nature) to have as little kids as possible. This will happen of course if people like living and want to have children! I&#39;ve read too much biology and i&#39;ve chosen to be a nihilist (due to some physical problems), so the conclusion! If you live in a western civilized  country where religion is banned that gives equal changes in education  to most of her citizens let nature take his course! In a few decades the population will only have good gene combinations(due to free choise of sexual partners) and the   there will not be extremely rich or extremely poor people. The nazis where all wrong and the communists off cource!!!  The firts thought that phenotype is only due to genes and the communists thought that it is only  due to the enviroment!  I hope that in the future all people will understand that simple thing that Phenotype is the combination of genotype and the enviroment!!! But as Nietzsche told the hope is for the fools. Imigration and of course cultural respect will prevail!

The wealthier a country is, the lower its birth rate becomes over the years, as it transitions. Wealth also breeds education, which encompasses many aspects. Incidentally, the best birth control is life expenses. A wealthy country, means a very expensive and high standard of living, which acts as the most effective birth control mechanism. How expensive is living in a certain city or country, remains quite relative to that one city or country. Even in countries with subsidized utilities, no taxes, and very high income like Saudi Arabia, birth rates have went down from 7.3 in 1970 to 2.2 in 2019,( The Replacement Level is 2.1) which means that it will continue to go down further. Which proves the fact that egotistical altruism is the best form of altruism. As elevating the living conditions, and economic perspectives of other places, will be beneficial for all, as the first by-product of such an occurrence will be the sharp decline in breeding, as people shift their priorities elsewhere. The question that I ask, do we have enough time to make these changes viable for other places that continue to dwell in abject poverty?

People in developed countries live much longer, consume much more of the Earth\u2019s resources, pollute more, add more to climate change and contribute more to the displacement / extinction of other species.  As an example, in North America each person on average uses 100 times more water than a person in Africa.

Moreover, at least 20% jobs must be reserved for them  by the Central &amp; State Govt. Same facilities must be given to the couples who do not have any child. <br>ii) In some States &amp; in some communities also, the growth rate is very high. So, a huge penalty of Rs. 1 crore must be imposed on the families having more than 1 child. <br>iii) The concept that, marriage is compulsory in India should be changed. The bachelors do  not have any social status here. Rather they are often criticized and insulted by others by saying that the bachelors have loose characters and they are often go to the Red Light Areas. But, the bachelors&#39; are helping our society very much to check the population growth. <br>iv) A strict law must be implemented immediately regarding these matters.", "comment_date": "2019-08-18T10:56:38Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Nate Es", "comment_text": "The UN: The 12th billion person will never be born<br>Humans: Hold my beer.", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T18:13:11Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Yogirajsinh Zala", "comment_text": "And here indian hundu and muslim leaders saying &quot; aur bacche peda kro hamara dharma khatre me he&quot; means&quot;give more birth to children our riligion is in dangure&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T16:01:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spacy", "comment_text": "I love ur vids do one more on black holes", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T15:47:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Golden Doggo", "comment_text": "yes", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T13:50:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheEmpty Gamer", "comment_text": "The average kids were 2.5??? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348&amp;t=4m06s\">4:06</a>", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T12:38:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AvengeVoltaire", "comment_text": "U underestimate Islam...", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T00:49:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Raphael B", "comment_text": "Thanos please help", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T21:10:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joel Cohen", "comment_text": "Everyone should see Hans Roslin videos about this topic.", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T20:43:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YouTuber123", "comment_text": "1-3 kids per couple is enough, but more than that is just selfish to the environment.", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T17:52:50Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "Il Leone", "comment_text": "How will the global population grow and influence the environment in the future?", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T17:45:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mitchnet-pvz ok", "comment_text": "Propagandagesagt", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T14:55:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jake Tan", "comment_text": "a tad too optimistic.", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T03:24:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "General Tso", "comment_text": "Your overlooking that people are living much longer and there are far too many people in the world now.

In other words, the people most able to be good role models have fewer children and those who are less likely are having more than them.<br><br>The biggest argument for population growth is that it is economically viable, is there anything that has the word economy in front of it that id actually any good?

So that balances out with the people who have more than two children throughout their lifetimes. Both of these life paths are fine, there are benefits to raising a family and there are benefits to not. <br><br> If a percentage of people keep going through the future with this mindset, it could result in a stable population or we might be facing a different problem, underpopulation. (Idk if that&#39;s the correct term) An example of this is shown in Germany, where low birthrates has been news for years. And if overpolulation does start to become a problem in the future, it&#39;ll most likely solve itself. With food, water, living space, and other life essentials becoming more expensive people will most likely not have enough money to have kids, especially more than two.", "comment_date": "2019-04-07T19:51:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "crusherskingdom", "comment_text": "Duh \ud83d\ude44 we will end up like soylant green", "comment_date": "2019-04-07T14:32:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Florin-Titus Niculescu", "comment_text": "You (and the Gates&#39;es) are forgetting about Africa.

I&#39;m not really buying it. I&#39;m not trying to be some conspiracist or anything, but think about this.

That also means for the population to double, every couple of the WORLD (still assuming that everybody has found a match) on average must have four children each. So with that being said, how many people do you know have four children? Think about it people, I&#39;m not going to tell anybody what to think, but shouldn&#39;t we at least consider the possibility that the global population might be inaccurate? Even if every couple didn&#39;t have two children, many people die without even having children at all, how could the global population possibly even be growing? The people that choose to have children literally need to have enough to compensate for all the others that do not, so for every three people that choose not to have children, the couples that DO CHOOSE to have children need to have six babies on average to make up for the others for the population to even remain STABLE. Though it might seem obvious, i&#39;ll point out that if every couple only had one child, the potential population would diminish by 50%. Yes, we can throw life expectancy into account, but then we still have to consider how exactly the population was able to &quot;double&quot; with life expectancy down that much. 7.4 billion is a LARGE number, and when you venture around the world, it&#39;s kinda interesting to wonder where the fuck all these people are.", "comment_date": "2018-10-30T02:14:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mymumleft", "comment_text": "isn&#39;t there a fifth stage that Japan has reached?", "comment_date": "2018-10-29T13:43:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lean Dancel", "comment_text": "Solution Pay people to punch each other\u2019s balls", "comment_date": "2018-10-29T08:34:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phillip", "comment_text": "More people are living like sh*t", "comment_date": "2018-10-29T07:27:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Sun", "comment_text": "Your video must&#39;ve inspired Thanos.", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T18:05:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u502a\u82d7", "comment_text": "\u597d\u50cf\u5f88\u6050\u6016\u7684\u6837\u5b50", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T13:06:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gelato", "comment_text": "Colonize the planets!", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T01:40:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "// Orange Sky //", "comment_text": "Hi there...

Anyway, stupid people believed them and now there are more and more families with at least 3 children comparing to the years that we were growing up in which most families usually had at most, 2 children.

Well frankly, I believe this conclusion to be largely inaccurate because of the following:<br>1. The argument presented that extreme poverty is decreasing has flaws, and as resources become more and more limited per capita, the decreasing trend may not hold true forever. According to the graphical evidence used in the video about poverty, the graph showed that essentially 100% of the population of the world lived in extreme poverty back in 1815. That means that whomever created the graph was considering &quot;extreme poverty&quot; to be some unexplained value judgement based on today&#39;s standards (like an average life expectancy being greater than 40 years). Whatever the value judgement is, extreme poverty should not only be based on a value judgement based on today&#39;s standards, but also on the standards of the time. For example, I would argue that in 1815, 99% of the population was not living in extreme poverty, This might lead to the perception that the percent of the population living in extreme poverty at any given time should actually be a fixed value (at something like 6% of the population), but fixing a poverty rate at a certain value also leads to an incomplete analysis because if someday 99% of the population was enslaved, and forced to work hard labor, then a fixed percent (such as 6%) would not accurately reflect how much of the world is living in poverty. The reality is that even though we tend to recognize extreme poverty when we see it, extreme poverty can not easily be defined nor measured because we all have different perspectives of what it is.  When analyzing the issues of an increasing population, I would argue that it is not wise to base any conclusions about the health of our planet on some vague concept of the &quot;extreme poverty&quot; of humans, but rather on the overall ability of all of the rest of the planets species to survive on the planet in a natural environment void of human interaction.<br>2. It is very unlikely that the overall rate of population growth will ever reach a value of 0% or less unless political actions are taken because as growth rates begin to approach 0%, certain individuals and organizations get worried about the economy and begin to campaign for increasing the size of the population citing historical economic data as a reference, and people begin having more babies again. The problem is that as the population increases, and resources become more and more limited per capita, proportional population and economic predictions based on historical data will suddenly be irrelevant when a limitation of resources eventually forces an unprecedented population bubble to burst. By that time, yes the size of the population might begin to stabilize, but not without some drastic economical and environmental setback that will probably come as a drastic reduction in the overall Quality Of Life for all humans and species together. Alternatively, if governments could collectively step in early enough, they might be able to slow the population growth rate to a small enough percent where the human species could figure out how to evolve without affecting the natural environments of all the rest of the species, and we might be able to maintain a high Quality of Life, but I am very skeptical that we will be able to get our act together for that. I suspect we will continue to grow until we have utilized about 99% of the world&#39;s land area for human capitalistic purposes and only after a huge number of the earth&#39;s species go extinct, and only after a majority of the population begins to struggle to be able to earn enough to have a decent Quality of Life by the standards of the day will the population begin to stabilize. I also suspect that at that point the average Quality of Life for someone will be very different than it is today; yes, more technology and human created entertainment may exist, but there will be fewer interactions with true nature as it will be much less abundant and accessible.  Other things may become less accessible too, like meats, as they will become increasingly expensive. In the end, true nature is what we will have lost, and that will be the greatest shame that our ignorant logic (as is evident by this video) will have brought us.<br><br>With exception of the content of the narrative, I would like to apologize for my strong criticism of this video to the editors and producers of this film however, as I thought the graphics and editing were decent.

They&#39;re on the industrialisation age level. Take the Philippines - wrong. The country&#39;s education system can not cope with the exploding population. Nor can its other systems. Plus the power of the church (which may however be fought back out of sheer survival necessity). We&#39;re at the stage where young mothers and children don&#39;t necessarily die at high rates, but nowhere near 2 kids. A dangerous feel-good fairy tale. 5.

Alot of us cant find any work or stable homes despite living in this &quot; RICH NATION&quot; (UK) as you describe. I live in poverty...as do most people i know we fight over fucking scraps and get almost zero help from government services ( police actively work against us, they dont ever care about crimes against us , but continually harass and search us, they  are disconnected from us).  Well of people like you price us out and us we are not tribal we dont hold any political power like  first generation immigrant do , and then mass immigration and their tribal mentality put nail in head. <br><br> The kids of these immigrant  half  of them will succeed ie the ones who stay in their tribes , the other half end up like me, broke and lost as they tried integrating but failed as  people like you only pay lip service to integration and cultural diversity. its a lie. Its tribal mentality  that allows immigrant to succeed , and their kids  ones  who want to integrate  get fucked over  and fucked  over hard UNLESS they already successful.<br><br> Then you get gangs, as the kids realize  ONLY TRIBES  can succeed. Not every  failed kid will end up in gangs, the other choice is drugs or depression.. Most uk first born immigrant kids  are in depression or drugs. ALOT OF THEM!! The mass immigration laws allow the drugs to keep flowing ( im not complaining, i think anti drug laws are flawed, but black market drugs are not the answer either). real question is how many kid do depressed, culturally disconnected or addicted people make? thats the real question. in my experience , they can either go crazy and make too many or none at all.<br><br>So i cant see how a country like uk can ever stay in  stage 4, its  population will drop down back in to lower stages in pockets of areas. Same thing will happen in other countries. SO   i call bs on your  prediction. Population MAY continue to rise. Unless ,  those poverty stricken mentally disconnected people  are somehow different to poor people in third world countries or that they are statically negligible<br><br>Need to look at this in detail imo which you didnt do.

I am really enjoying your channels content, and the spread of scientific knowledge prepared in simple and beatiful graphics is really awesome! Theres just one thing about the topic of overpupulation that i run into twitter yesterday as i linked this very video to another person to convince them that overpopulation wouldnt be much of an issue, pointing at the examples of the transition of britain, bangladesh, iran and other mentioned. This kind person seems to be a german physicist workin on topics universal basic income, climate change, degroth economy AND overpupulation. So first i thought this guy would be another &quot;uninformed&quot; right winger nationalist that doesnt want to have refugees in &quot;the west&quot;. But this clearly wasnt the case, his point of view is pretty much humanitarian and social conscious. So to make a long story short: He linked me an article about &quot;16 Myths of overpopulation&quot; and after studying the paper, i think you might oversee mostly the myths number 13,14 and partly 16. I am clearly not a right winger, nor do i dislike migrants, i love them and parts of my ancestors were refugees themselves. So i want to stress that my intention is clearly not to support right wing views or believs, but a global political solution and awereness to this serious problem. May you take that article in consideration? I have a feeling this would be helpful for the internetcommunitys to clarify the strong issues we all seem to face in future.

What we can say, for sure, is that we&#39;re getting close to capacity, with respect to our current agricultural technology, and resources.  Furthermore, the potential for a catastrophic population spike, is looming overhead, and all it takes is a new generation&#39;s &quot;baby boom&quot;, with abortion, and birth controls being constantly politically debated, we can&#39;t say with ANY certainty what the future actually holds.

Most people agree (on all sides of this issue) that humanity is over consuming, but this issue oddly splits people around the issue of there simply being to many consumers.

I&#39;m not sure when in history the population out grew the resources but there are plenty of examples where the resources dwindled to levels that couldn&#39;t support the population.  <br><br>Yes, the population will correct itself through the war/genocide, perhaps even disease but the reality is there are limited resources even today,  just ask any of the millennials out looking for work to pay off their huge education debt. These are population size problems. <br><br>The other issue is, the poor have demonstrated they don&#39;t reduce their procreation, some even using it to exploit a welfare system that basically pays them to have children.  This growth leads to a population that votes for more handouts and resources that they can&#39;t earn otherwise because of the job market. <br><br>So...we may never get to the 12 billion mark but still the number we have now (that IS growing) is already over burdening  the resources we have.  <br><br>Apocalypse now.", "comment_date": "2017-04-20T20:32:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aerinna", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348&amp;t=6m07s\">6:07</a> WTF is she cooking?", "comment_date": "2017-04-20T18:24:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fert", "comment_text": "glad to see Malaysia", "comment_date": "2017-04-20T11:51:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yol Mak", "comment_text": "My solution to overpopulation is EASY, FAIR, JUST, NON-VIOLENT + MEDICALLY SAFE:  Sterilize every woman on the planet after her second child.

Sterilization of a woman is a very simple + safe medical procedure and can be done right after the second child is born.<br><br>The formula could be slightly adjusted. We could decide 1 child per woman for the next 50 years and then increase it to 2 children per woman. Because we are already overpopulated now and it would be better for everyone if the population decreased a couple of billions or so. Everyone would be richer, everyone would have more space and land.

Whether or not the population will stabilize in the near future is irrelevant if we can&#39;t sustain the population.

The reason for the drop in number of children has been because in the past children were an asset.  They helped with the farm... so people had more of them.  As society became industrialized and people had jobs that they went to, children became a financial burden.  Those very capable people with the most demanding jobs had the fewest children leading to a lower birth rate in industrialized countries.  Because of the structure of our liberal governments and welfare systems we are now paying the least capable people on the planet to pop out children at an alarming rate.  We have uneducated unemployed single mothers starting at 13 years old with 11 kids by the time they are done.  Our college students are getting a poorer education than they have in the past.  College graduates are often unprepared to add to the productivity of the workforce.  What we have is a seismic shift in class structure.  The very wealthy class is having children and making money.  The middle class is not having children while working their butts off to pay more taxes.  The poor are having welfare babies who will never add more to society than they are consuming in resources.  The globalist liberals will not mention this because welfare is the method of buying the vote of the soon to be majority.  This system is paid for by the middle class and by debt.

It ignores the more important social/cultural/economic factors which play the main role in family planning.  Acceptance of contraceptives as a family planning options (e.g. religion plays a major role here), what are there economic incentives and disincentives to having a large family?  These factors vary dramatically from country to country.  Its not like every family on earth naturally wants 2.5 children (even if they all survive).  The video presents this as though it is some kind of natural law.  The natural law is given by evolution.  The individual who passes their genes onto to the largest number of progeny in the next generation wins.  We might be thinking apes, but we have natural drives and the video seems to ignore that.<br><br>2) Video ignores the secondary problem of affluence growth that comes with decreases in global poverty.  Basically not only are there more people today, but each person alive demands more resources per person in their consumptive habits than in the past.  Even under an optimistic situation of leveling the population off at 9.5 Billion by 2050 as per UN census trajectories, the trajectory of affluence increases is speeding up not slowing down at a global level.  So, the population size might level off but the resource use intensity will continue to grow well after population is no longer growing. <br><br>3) Yes it is true that a larger population produces more geniuses.  It is also true that a larger population houses more maniacs,  more dullards and more just average folks.  Genius dilution is an even more pressing issue in our smother-mother generation today where every kid is a winner.  You can have a lot of geniuses in the population but if society can&#39;t sort them out and rise them to their potential beyond the dullards you can&#39;t bank continued efficiency gains in the technology/food/energy production sectors.", "comment_date": "2017-03-10T02:20:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fudge Capitalist", "comment_text": "White births are not subsidized by the state.", "comment_date": "2017-03-09T22:35:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ioni\u021b\u0103 Alexandru", "comment_text": "use condoms people", "comment_date": "2017-03-09T17:09:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "King Cangre", "comment_text": "2.5 kids o_0", "comment_date": "2017-03-09T00:33:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DesertWinds", "comment_text": "well this made my day", "comment_date": "2017-03-09T00:05:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ellen Baker", "comment_text": "Well, one imagines, the twelfth billion on Earth.

It is a necessary ingredient to fertilizer and humanity&#39;s primary sources of the mineral have only about 50-100 years worth of the rock left. After phosphorus reserves are gone, so will be 90% of our fertilizer production.

Just look at the fertility rate of some of the refugees we take into places like Germany, they will still have more and more kids than the typical German couple. Even in a more comfortable and stable environment these refugees have, they still pump out babies and don&#39;t turn their own presence into a producer; because such a high tech society doesn&#39;t need more people to sustain their labor... Also, western societies shouldn&#39;t actually strain themselves either and feel the need to drain their own ambitions just to fuel others. The industrialization that was really discovered by the west is left as a footprint that others can develop off of into a then modernized world; they don&#39;t need us to build it for them. <br><br>The problem is that poverty and the value of a human is based off population count, and the more we have the less valuable a human is. Another problem is that technology and autonomous machinery can render millions of humans unemployed, even if the population drops. This is just amplified when we have 10 billion people or so, because automation guarantees people are barred from an income that is marginal to comfortable living and even survival in some cases. The video was presented good, but it seems to imply that certain countries should &quot;pay their dues&quot; to the world under this seemingly globalist viewport of how we should tackle world problems. Yes, overpopulation can become our problem too, but it becomes more of our problem when we think &quot;taking them in&quot; actually will reduce the fertility rates worldwide. <br><br>The reason why refugees make it into countries so easily, is because the governments responsible for defining border entry regulations and developing policies to regulate such movement are incompetent and broken. The facts on the internet are also falsely skewered and cherry picked by establishment media to make it seem like the majority of people want refugees and uncontrolled immigration. People think making walls and having enforced borders is morally bankrupt; but it is inevitable to any rational system of government that determines it must control the people coming in to define its ability to govern effectively and maintain national solidarity.

This decline in population continues until the natural resources can replenish themselves that then triggers a population growth again.

We passed the apex point, more then a generation ago. our population is still growing when it should have noticeable receded.<br>This is bad, very bad.<br>Studies have shown with reindeer placed on an island during the war (for an alternative food resource they never needed and abandoned) the reindeer had so much food their population exploded, as migratory animals they didn&#39;t see a need to slow their reproduction, since they were trapped on the island and couldn&#39;t migrate, they literally exhausted their food supply instead of following the Bell-Curve effect and have fewer offspring. Because they defied this rule to establish a balance with their environment they starved to death.

Until it died itself.<br>There has been many studies, this was only one example. As a species we are dangerously following these poor creatures, to defy the Bell-Curve is to risk becoming extinct ourselves. In our case it will only take the depletion of one resource to make it happen. Electricity, gas, food, clean water, or a single disease to run ramped through our massive population. <br>Our population has never been so high, same with the crime rate by those trying to survive in our world.

Iran is modernizing and progressing, yet is currently led by a regime that will leave scars on the Persian people for decades to come.

But we are already 7 billion people, and this is going to be 10 billion very soon. We can stop the growth by making all those people live like occidentals, the good old \u201cAmerican way of life\u201d: Cars, big houses, energy, good food (including lot of meat), good healthcare, retirement plans, education\u2026 for the moment, 1 out of 7 billion people on earth are living this way.

Species are declining, peaks are coming (oil, phosphorus, coltan.. you name it), and we are actually using each year 1,5 time the resource the earth can renew. So my question is: how are we going to make 10 billion people live this way? This take the resources of 7,5 planets like Earth, and we only have one.

As things are right now, development nations burn through a disproportionate number of resources compared to the rest of the world. Even if the population in developed nations declines a little as developing nations slow their population growth, once they fully develop they will consume on par with developed nations which will further strain the Earth&#39;s resources.  That fact is there is plenty of space for all of humanity to live even within a single state, but there&#39;s not enough space for them to live comfortably nor is there enough resources for everyone to live the way Americans live on average. <br><br>The best home for humanity is to transition to a resource based economy based on robot labor and an emphasis on building to last and sustainable use of resources.  If nothing is taken out of nature that isn&#39;t put back in, and if everyone has the same standard of living by virtue of being alive, there would be no problem.  I don&#39;t expect this would happen thoigh. The people with power will not give it up. The nations consuming won&#39;t stop either, and would likely kill other nations long before they even begin to pose a threat to their ability to consume.  Then will promptly self destruct.

There is an increase in people receiving higher level learning but at a huge cost.

I know it is in other professions too but I am speaking from first hand experience in this career. My friend has been paying her loans for 5 years and her debt has increased by 100,000$ she started at 180k and after paying for 5 years she is now at 280k. I feel this would be a fun topic to discuss, not Chiropractors particularly but the American Student Loan Debt Crisis. After taxes and student loan are paid, I have 49% of my income left. In addition, because the median income is decreasing as time goes on the debt-income ratio that is factored whenever applying for a loan (car, house, etc), always destroys any chance or opportunity to get a loan without a co-signer.

What happens if our technological skills are not able to catch up? What will happen in 20 years when a huge middle class emerges, for example, in China? Well, they will demand more goods and services, which means they will need more electricity, plastic, beef, and what not. I see very little progress being done when it comes to climate change and environmental degradation, and now that Mr. Trump has been elected, it will be even worse. We cannot just talk numbers when we talk about demographic change. This matter is strictly tied to resource use and other variables, like that of technology, and environmental issues.

There is no automatism for the increasing living standards with increasing industrial production. The only reason the living standards became better is that the working class people fight for higher wages, less time of daily work, health care etc. This is what happened in the past. But why did this process didn&#39;t take place in so cold development countries? Imperialism of the developed capitalist countries holds down the development of third world countries, so there won&#39;t be increasing living standards in those countries.

Even 300 years ago, it had never been higher (02). Every new human on our planet further divides its finite resources and increases our waste output. Eminent geneticist, Professor Steve Jones, has described how \u201chumans are 10,000 times more common than we should be, according to the rules of the animal kingdom\u201d (03).<br><br><br><b>Disease Incidence</b><br>A large population drastically increases the rate of disease transmission for all communicable diseases (04). This holds true even for many non-communicable diseases, such as lung cancer (05). Furthermore, antibiotics represent one of our many finite resources and their over-use is progressively diminishing their effectiveness (06). A 2016 report commissioned by the UK Department of Health found that &quot;at least 700,000 people die every year already from drug-resistant infections... by 2050, 10 million lives a year and a cumulative 100 trillion USD of economic output are at risk due to the rise of drug resistant infections\u2026 Even if we manage to reduce the unnecessary use of anti-microbials over the next decade, with a growing world population\u2026 the world will need a functioning R&amp;D pipeline of new antimicrobials&quot; (07).<br><br>The agricultural requirements of feeding a growing population elevate the risk of zoonotic infections, as livestock populations must also increase. Dr. Lonnie King, a director at the CDC, cites population growth as a &quot;major consideration&quot; among the factors &quot;that are creating the conditions for a perfect microbial storm&quot; (08). Separately, population growth is noted by the CDC as a cause of the global decrease in water quality, another potential source of disease (09). Similarly, outdoor air pollution alone \u201cleads to 3.3 million premature deaths per year worldwide\u201d, a figure that is expected to double by 2050 (10).<br><br><br><b>Finite Resources</b><br>While the most widely recognised non-renewable resources are the fossil fuels, upon which most of our energy consumption depends, there are many others that we are rapidly exhausting. Current groundwater usage is \u201cunsustainable\u201d (11), while phosphate, a key ingredient in fertiliser, is expected to \u201crun out in 50 years\u201d, though our need for it will be even greater then as population growth &quot;will require food production to at least double by 2050&quot; (12).<br><br><br><b>Animal Extinctions</b><br>Zoologists warn that \u201cthe number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would [normally] have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear\u201d. The rate of extinctions closely mirrors human population growth (13). For example, \u201crapidly expanding human populations\u201d have caused gorillas and chimpanzees to be \u201cpushed to the brink of extinction\u201d (14).<br><br><br><b>Climate Change</b><br>A 2009 study in The Lancet notes that \u201cclimate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century\u201d (15). As with finite resource expenditure, climate change synergistically exacerbates disease transmission, particularly in the area of mosquito-borne pathogens. For example, by 2085, \u201cabout 5\u20136 billion people (50\u201360% of the projected global population) [will] be at risk of dengue transmission, compared with 3\u00b75 billion people, or 35% of the population, if climate change did not happen&quot; (16).<br><br>Anthropogenic climate change largely results from increased CO\u2082 emissions due to fossil fuel combustion (17). Procreation is a frequently overlooked contributor to CO\u2082 emissions; in the US for example, \u201ceach child adds about 9441 metric tons of carbon dioxide to the carbon legacy of an average female, which is 5.7 times her lifetime emissions\u201d (18). In fact, &quot;slowing population growth could provide 16\u201329% of the emissions reductions suggested to be necessary by 2050 to avoid dangerous climate change\u201d and the benefits would be cumulative, such that by the end of the century, there could be reductions in \u201ctotal emissions from fossil fuel use by 37\u201341%\u201d (19). Carbon emissions over the next few decades will have irreversible consequences \u201cfor the next ten millennia and beyond\u201d (20).<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br>Animal populations oscillate between peaks and troughs over time, with the transition from peak to trough characterised by considerable suffering, in the form of famine, disease and predation. All indications are that the unchecked growth of the human population will elicit a concomitant level of suffering for humans.<br><br>Leading journals describe how \u201cthe inexorable demographic momentum of the global human population is rapidly eroding Earth\u2019s life-support system\u201d (21). Finite, polluting fossil fuels account for &gt;85% of global energy consumption and 15-30% of this energy \u201cis used to simply supply food for 7.2 billion people&quot; (22). Waste production and resource consumption would occur at roughly one thousandth of the current rate, were our population a thousand times smaller. <br><br>A crowded journey on public transport is sufficient to enlighten us as to the inverse relationship between population size and quality of life. There is almost no benefit to increasing our population.<br><br><br><b>References</b><br>(01) Gerland et al., 2014, World population stabilization unlikely this century.

Later on Rural Families where allowed to have 2 children if the first was a Girl (yeah...i know..) that had the unintended consequence that lots of people where aborting children if they where girls. Then they banned Gender Detection to curb this. Still to this day many people however circumvent this which lead to a imbalance of women to man ratio. Earlier this year the one child policy has been made nationwide and without restrictions into a 2 child policy. The Impacts of this policy are many, society and life has changed because of it. Its not as black and white as many think since a majority of people i talked to and know are in favor of the one child policy. Today`s reality is that having children is enormously expensive. Baby clothes, Baby Formula, Kindergarten and many other things that a baby and child NEEDS are traded at a Superpremium. I am living in the Comfortable Middle Class, i can go shopping without ever having to look at the prices and do my yearly trip abroad to a Tourist trap of my choice, but in all honesty.

Most children if htey reached 5 years old would make it to adulthood.

Although I would hate to lose someone I care for because of a disease, the reality is that if we stopped treating these illnesses, humans would slowly develop immunity to them, many would die, however, long term humanity would benefit from this course of action. Take c sections for example, as has recently been reported, If we did not perform this procedure when deemed necessary to save the mother or child, the genetic faults that cause this would slowly eradicate themselves due to the fact that that these genetic lines would cease to exist. Because we perform this procedure the number of c sections has risen dramatically over the past century due to the fact that these genetic lines are allowed to continue. This is true of all genetic disorders and/or birth defects. Because of modern medicine we are facing issues with antibiotic resistance, higher rates of cancer, autism, Alzheimer&#39;s, Parkinson&#39;s, heart disease, and may others. Now I&#39;m not saying we should just give up and let everyone die, we won&#39;t have a choice, we&#39;ve already opened Pandora&#39;s box, nature will create new challenges that we will not be able to overcome, nor will we be as genetically fit to fight these new problems because we have been weakened by our own medicines. All we have done is delayed the inevitable and possibly overpopulated the earth in the process.

For example, antibiotics represent one of our many finite resources and their over-use is progressively diminishing their effectiveness (02). We wouldn&#39;t need to invent new ones if we didn&#39;t have so many people and so many farm animals being pumped with them.<br><br><br>3) We are already overpopulated. Eminent geneticist, Professor Steve Jones, has described how \u201chumans are 10,000 times more common than we should be, according to the rules of the animal kingdom\u201d (03). Continuing with the example of antibiotics, at the time of a report commissioned by the UK Dept. of Health, 700,000 people died each year from drug-resistant infections. &quot;by 2050, 10 million lives a year and a cumulative 100 <br>trillion USD of economic output are at risk due to the rise of drug resistant infections&quot; (04).<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br>A new study has just recently been released highlighting the fact that expanding human populations are causing the 6th mass extinction and it follows multiple other studies that make the same point. Put most succinctly, every new child on the planet further divides Earth&#39;s finite resources and increases our waste output. Every animal population oscillates between peaks and troughs. Humans are currently shooting up a massive peak. When population levels inevitably fall (down the other side of that peak) due to disease, famine, and in our case, anthropogenic climate change etc, this will be characterised by enormous suffering... all due to utterly needless and almost entirely unbeneficial population expansion.<br><br><br>(01) Gerland et al., 2014, World population stabilization unlikely this century.

It&#39;s very clear in America, for example, that people of other races growing up in the same environments behave differently. The evidence of geographic specialization is clear in both anatomy and psychology. Your model fails to account for the industrial revolution in the first place. We were on a eugenic trajectory and then took a turn into the dysgenic with the advent and proliferation of industry. It&#39;s circular reasoning to attribute our type K reproductive strategy to the industrial revolution (which is totally absurd, as industrialization has a strong r-selection effect) without even considering the causal origins of the forces which brought us from savagery to civility and primitive to industrial.<br><br>Btw, you really believe the &quot;dark ages&quot; mythos? Everything was shit before or lord and savior, science? That&#39;s scientism, or the psuedo-religious misapplication of science, not actual science. Let&#39;s contextualize your nature = doom and gloom account of history with some geography. The Pleistocene epoch was the impetus for the foray out of Africa, and along with it came the advent of fire. The environment of those who would become Europeans was a frigid tundra, not the humid jungle and sun-baked savannah that they left. The environment that spawned Europeans (with their longer, narrower nostrils and shorter limbs) was a much cooler one than that of other peoples, and their mere anatomy can tell us that. Their nostrils adapted to the icy hostility  of the North, and they were selected for stockier limbs which are more resistant to frostbite. They also developed more slow-twitch muscle fibers, which conserves energy for slow, long, deliberate work in the cold. <br><br>Adapting to random predation and disease, and a relative abundance of carbohydrates by comparison, Africans have more quick-twitch fibers, which help them dominate in running sports, and higher, peaked calves which help them to dominate in jumping sports. They don&#39;t fair so well with swimming sports, however, and this is because of their greater bone density. Whites, particularly  Nordic peoples, also dominate strongman competitions (not bodybuilding, it&#39;s extreme weightlifting). These geographical selection pressures acted over deep evolutionary time to shape the body and mind of our people. This is why whites have a more deliberate disposition while Africans trend toward impulsivity. This exemplifies k- vs r-selection, respectively. K-selection is the primary causal force for the development of industry. I&#39;m sitting on a lot more evidence than this, I&#39;m only giving you a taste.

As the crazy birth rates return, population explodes and becomes significant driver of world population growth once again.<br>(2) Simple math: a small population experiencing exponential growth will soon surpass an initially larger population experiencing sub-exponential growth. So the fact that growth in Western developed countries has stopped is irrelevant. There will always be places with high birth rates, and those will dominate the numbers. e.g. as the muslim population explodes, the contribution of the low-birth-rate Western cultures no longer matters and the global population growth is determined by the family size of average muslims. If growth eventually slows amongst muslims for some reason, a new seed of exponential growth will appear in a new group who will soon dominate the growth. The diversity and size of the global population ensures that such seeds of exponential growth will always exist.<br><br>Exponential growth will continue until resources are exhausted, i.e. the socialist western states collapse, or until stopped by lethal pandemic disease, which increases super-linearly in probability with size of interacting population.<br><br>Also, the claim that \u201cwe\u2019re not special\u201d and all countries will go thru the same 4 stages is total BS.

Even if the birth rates stabilize eventually... There will still be the issue where humans end up spreading their fingers everywhere, disrupting nature in the process to make products for humanity or simply to live there. For example, instead of leaving a lake alone. They will build a house next to it. Instead of leaving a region alone ,they will build a house or use another purpose for it. <br><br>Sure, there are so called national parks. But many people opt for houses and similar which leads to a more wide spread population but also much more surface area. As for the people declining subtly noted eventually in the well made video. I doubt that will occur. I think the people count will steadily rise. Maybe not in an explosive nature. <br><br>There is also the issue of Food. This issue can&#39;t be ignored when looking at Over population theory. With rising status of the people, it also results in more welfare in the food production. Taking the consumption of a normal younger individual who will become the later generation eventually. It will lead to a rise of food per day in consumption. This is not because they go obese but the healthier trend of exercise tied together with good food. By exercising, one spends more energy and need to consume more in the process. <br><br>This results in a healthier human but rising need for food production. We simply do not have the surface area or investments in battling this. <br><br>There is aquaponics which tends to work well, but there is a lack of available investments in this sector for now. We can build several store buildings on a slanted angle to create an optimal surface area for growing a certain crop on less square metre usage. But this would only work for the essentials like fruit/vegetables. <br><br>Some plants and trees would still require space for produce. Some simply wouldn&#39;t thrive in a controlled environment without certain &#39;pest&#39;. <br><br>So even if the population slow down in rise. There will still be the issue of the fact that we are conquering much of the nature and if we are to believe WHO and certain other action groups. They want us to preserve other species in their wild environments. Zoo animals are considered domesticated to certain extent.<br><br>This means, we still have over population issues in certain factors.

An easy way to do this is to grab people from populations that are still in the first/second stage of birth/death numbers (i.e. the need to produce many kids to have some survive) and import them to the places where the companies operate. Combine that with the natural urge of western people to help others, and you have the migrant crisis perfectly explained.<br><br>Additionally, this video doesn&#39;t at all account for transplanting many people from one tier to another, higher one.

Technology has always been invented to solve issues, yet it constantly creates more. And even if all current and future problems are solved, it is humanity&#39;s nature to want for more.

Population in stage 4 isn&#39;t stable. It&#39;s shrinking. There are also many countries where development isn&#39;t really happening. Sub-Saharan Africa is a good example. Another point, population growth and then decline are a historic process. This isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve reached a new population plateau. It would have been helpful to at least mention in the video that we&#39;re not here for the first time.

When people figure out that fiat money is never going to be paid back then watch out. All they have done is pulled forward demand for humans to exist now rather than in the future. That is why India is publicly admitting to an attempt to ban paper currency. Fiat can only go forward if it can remain unconstrained in digital 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s.

In places like Japan where medicine is very good and living standards are very high show a declining population which in all honesty would support the argument of this video. I&#39;m happy to admit that however places like China, the Middle East, and Central Asia are seeing a higher then average birth rate because of the urbanization. <br><br>People are more wealth so they can afford to have more children. On the other hand birth control has played a huge part in couples having less children. In the past there really wasn&#39;t many ways to prevent a unwanted birth you just had to deal with it. Not so today, you have the pill, condoms, and many other possibilities which where never touched on in this video.<br><br>Most of the developed world is seeing a lower standard of living. Jobs are not paying as much as they once where, competition has become far better (along the lines of automation, and cheap labor in developing countries), and the education requirements are rapidly increasing for jobs that pay less then they once have. <br><br>I could easily argue that the reason people are having less children is not because less are dying but because they simply can not afford the liability of having more children and the options available to prevent unwanted birth&#39;s have never been greater. You look at countries like China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and much of the Middle East have a different family model. It&#39;s expensive to have children there as well however in the long run it pays off to have many children as the family is much closer their and more hands working makes it cheaper for the family to survive. Teen&#39;s are expected to work in the rural fields and support the family as the older generation&#39;s watch over their children&#39;s and grand children&#39;s children.<br><br>That model supports itself while the model in the West is you raise them they then become independent and do not contribute a huge amount to the family afterwords which makes it much more expensive in those environments. <br><br>There is many reasons why people are having less children and no one answer is correct instead is a combination of many reasons that result in this out come.

Often, the response is that suffering is God\u2019s will and that he long ago determined everything that would ever happen, including tragic events. Many are told that God\u2019s ways are mysterious or that he brings death upon people\u2014even children\u2014so that he can have them in heaven with him. As you have learned, though, Jehovah God never causes what is bad. The Bible says: \u201cIt is unthinkable for the true God to act wickedly, for the Almighty to do wrong!\u201d\u2014Job <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348&amp;t=34m10s\">34:10</a>.<br><br> Why do many people make the mistake of blaming God for the suffering in the world?<br><br> Do you know why people make the mistake of blaming God for all the suffering in the world? In many cases, they blame Almighty God because they think that he is the real ruler of this world. They do not know a simple but important truth that the Bible teaches. You learned that truth in Chapter 3 of this book. The real ruler of this world is Satan the Devil.<br><br> How does the world reflect the personality of its ruler? (b) How have human imperfection and \u201ctime and unexpected events\u201d contributed to suffering?<br><br> The Bible clearly states: \u201cThe whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.\u201d (1 John <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348&amp;t=5m19s\">5:19</a>) When you think about it, does that not make sense? This world reflects the personality of the invisible spirit creature who is \u201cmisleading the entire inhabited earth.\u201d (Revelation 12:9) Satan is hateful, deceptive, and cruel. So the world, under his influence, is full of hatred, deceit, and cruelty. That is one reason why there is so much suffering.<br><br>A second reason why there is so much suffering is that, as discussed in Chapter 3, mankind has been imperfect and sinful ever since the rebellion in the garden of Eden. Sinful humans tend to struggle for dominance, and this results in wars, oppression, and suffering. (Ecclesiastes 4:1; 8:9) A third reason for suffering is \u201ctime and unexpected events.\u201d (Read Ecclesiastes <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348&amp;t=9m11s\">9:11</a>.) In a world without Jehovah as a protective Ruler, people may suffer because they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br><br>Why can we be sure that Jehovah has a good reason for allowing suffering to continue?<br> It is comforting for us to know that God does not cause suffering. He is not responsible for the wars, the crimes, the oppression, or even the natural disasters that cause people to suffer. Still, we need to know, Why does Jehovah allow all this suffering? If he is the Almighty, he has the power to stop it. Why, then, does he hold back? The loving God that we have come to know must have a good reason.\u20141 John 4:8.<br><br>A VITAL ISSUE IS RAISED<br><br> What did Satan call into question, and how?<br><br>To find out why God allows suffering, we need to think back to the time when suffering began. When Satan led Adam and Eve into disobeying Jehovah, an important question was raised. Satan did not call into question Jehovah\u2019s power. Even Satan knows that there is no limit to Jehovah\u2019s power. Rather, Satan questioned Jehovah\u2019s right to rule. By calling God a liar who withholds good from his subjects, Satan charged that Jehovah is a bad ruler. (Read Genesis 3:2-5.) Satan implied that mankind would be better off without God\u2019s rulership. This was an attack on Jehovah\u2019s sovereignty, his right to rule.<br><br> Why did Jehovah not just destroy the rebels in Eden?<br><br> Adam and Eve rebelled against Jehovah. In effect, they said: \u2018We do not need Jehovah as our Ruler. We can decide for ourselves what is right and what is wrong.\u2019 How could Jehovah settle that issue? How could he teach all intelligent creatures that the rebels were wrong and that his way truly is best? Someone might say that God should simply have destroyed the rebels and made a fresh start. But Jehovah had stated his purpose to fill the earth with the offspring of Adam and Eve, and he wanted them to live in an earthly paradise. (Genesis <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348&amp;t=1m28s\">1:28</a>) Jehovah always fulfills his purposes. (Isaiah <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348&amp;t=55m10s\">55:10</a>, 11) Besides that, getting rid of the rebels in Eden would not have answered the question that had been raised regarding Jehovah\u2019s right to rule.<br><br>llustrate why Jehovah has allowed Satan to become the ruler of this world and why God has permitted humans to govern themselves.<br><br> Let us consider an illustration. Imagine that a teacher is telling his students how to solve a difficult problem. A clever but rebellious student claims that the teacher\u2019s way of solving the problem is wrong. Implying that the teacher is not capable, this rebel insists that he knows a much better way to solve the problem. Some students think that he is right, and they also become rebellious. What should the teacher do? If he throws the rebels out of the class, what will be the effect on the other students? Will they not believe that their fellow student and those who joined him are right? All the other students in the class might lose respect for the teacher, thinking that he is afraid of being proved wrong. But suppose that the teacher allows the rebel to show the class how he would solve the problem.<br><br>A teacher allowing a rebel student to show the class a supposed solution to a difficult problem<br>Is the student more qualified than the teacher?<br><br> Jehovah has done something similar to what the teacher does. Remember that the rebels in Eden were not the only ones involved. Millions of angels were watching. (Job 38:7; Daniel <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348&amp;t=7m10s\">7:10</a>) How Jehovah handled the rebellion would greatly affect all those angels and eventually all intelligent creation. So, what has Jehovah done? He has allowed Satan to show how he would rule mankind. God has also allowed humans to govern themselves under Satan\u2019s guidance.<br><br> What benefit will come from Jehovah\u2019s decision to allow humans to govern themselves?<br><br> The teacher in our illustration knows that the rebel and the students on his side are wrong. But he also knows that allowing them the opportunity to try to prove their point will benefit the whole class. When the rebels fail, all honest students will see that the teacher is the only one qualified to lead the class. They will understand why the teacher thereafter removes any rebels from the class. Similarly, Jehovah knows that all honesthearted humans and angels will benefit from seeing that Satan and his fellow rebels have failed and that humans cannot govern themselves. Like Jeremiah of old, they will learn this vital truth: \u201cI well know, O Jehovah, that man\u2019s way does not belong to him. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.\u201d\u2014Jeremiah <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348&amp;t=10m23s\">10:23</a>.<br><br>WHY SO LONG?<br><br> Why has Jehovah allowed suffering to continue for so long? (b) Why has Jehovah not prevented such things as horrible crimes?<br><br> Why, though, has Jehovah allowed suffering to go on for so long? And why does he not prevent bad things from happening? Well, consider two things that the teacher in our illustration would not do. First, he would not stop the rebel student from presenting his case. Second, the teacher would not help the rebel to make his case. Similarly, consider two things that Jehovah has determined not to do. First, he has not stopped Satan and those who side with him from trying to prove that they are right. Allowing time to pass has thus been necessary. In the thousands of years of human history, mankind has been able to try every form of self-rule, or human government. Mankind has made some advances in science and other fields, but injustice, poverty, crime, and war have grown ever worse. Human rule has now been shown to be a failure.<br><br><br>Second, Jehovah has not helped Satan to rule this world. If God were to prevent horrible crimes, for instance, would he not, in effect, be supporting the case of the rebels? Would God not be making people think that perhaps humans can govern themselves without disastrous results? If Jehovah were to act in that way, he would become party to a lie. However, \u201cit is impossible for God to lie.\u201d\u2014Hebrews <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348&amp;t=6m18s\">6:18</a>.<br><br>What will Jehovah do about all the harm that has resulted from the rule of humans and the influence of Satan?<br><br> What, though, about all the harm that has been done during the long rebellion against God? We do well to remember that Jehovah is almighty. Therefore, he can and will undo the effects of mankind\u2019s suffering. As we have already learned, the ruining of our planet will be undone by the turning of the earth into Paradise. The effects of sin will be removed through faith in Jesus\u2019 ransom sacrifice, and the effects of death will be reversed by means of the resurrection. God will thus use Jesus \u201cto break up the works of the Devil.\u201d (1 John 3:8) Jehovah will bring all of this about at just the right time.

Then parents die, and so every 20 years humanity grows by a factor 1.2. If there are N peepo today, then in n20 years there will be N 1.2^n peeps on the planet. So what happens in 100 years? Take n=5, in n20=5*20=100 years, there&#39;ll be N 1.2^5=N 2,5 peepo on Earth. So more than double. For as long as peeps have more than 2 kids on the average, there&#39;ll be a population explosion. Even 2.2 kids doubles us in less than 100 years. In 200 years? Take n=10, then 1,2^10=6,2. 300 years from now? 1.2^15=15,4.
