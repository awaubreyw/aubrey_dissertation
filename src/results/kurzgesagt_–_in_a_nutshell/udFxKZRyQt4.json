It&#39;s a pretty standard process for gravity wells that gain this size.  Nothing has &#39;died&#39;<br><br>a Gravity well is a 3-dimensional hole in space time that matter falls into.  We have different names for the same phenomenon, usually based on size and what we see it doing from the outside.  Whether your size-based naming scheme calls it a moon or a black hole, they are the same phenomenon and the only thing separating them is mass, spin and composition.<br><br>you covered pretty well that the accelerative force of gravity and the mega explosions caused when gravity forces a collapse and subsequent supernovae explosion, fuse lighter elements into denser elements.<br><br>This is the purpose of gravity.  It collects the hydrogen, helium and trace amounts of lithium that were made in the big bang and it transforms them through intense heat and pressure in ever larger gravity wells and gravitational collapse/explosions all the way through the periodic table from least dense to most.  <br><br>Gravity, the weakest of the 4 fundamental forces is precisely the accelerative force that overcomes the other forces and creates the variation in the density of matter that we see on the periodic table.<br><br>Of course, by the time you get to a neutron star, the only thing holding that degenerate matter together is GRAVITY.  The acceleration at the surface of a neutron star is too great for it to decompress a little or express its mass over a larger area (becoming less dense). The gravitational acceleration is so intense that it holds the neutron star in a very tight circle in spite of a very rapid rotation that in smaller bodies would result in some level of oblateness.<br><br>the difference between a black hole and a neutron star is Mass density.  Two colliding neutron stars are a good example of two deep gravitational wells coming together to create one gravity well that is deep enough that the surface acceleration of the degenerate neutron matter is exceeding the speed of light.  The point in the gravity well where that acceleration speed limit is breached is called the event horizon or the Schwarzschild radius.<br><br>Now you have a very small black hole, they get truly massive before they get to the point where they again collapse in on themselves, this time into a singularity followed by a massive explosion creating Hydrogen, helium and trace amounts of lithium from all that degenerate matter that was held together inside.<br><br>If that sounds familiar, it should.  Gravity is the recycler of matter from its humble origin all the way through the periodic table and back into pure potential and another big bang<br><br>SPIN, CORE DYNAMICS AND MAGNETISM:  <br>For a gravity well in rotation, (like the earth or a neutron star) If you take 3 identical clocks, one in unaccelerated space, one on the surface and one at the core.  You&#39;ll note through general relativity that the clock in deep space runs faster than the clock on the surface, and that surface clock is running faster than the clock at the core.<br><br>this means that as the surface rotates around, the core will super rotate ahead of the crust.  this is gravitational acceleration in the spin direction.  time is slower at the core than at the surface.  So, in spite of immense friction and in the vacuum of space, we have a core that spins faster that the subsequent layers of strata.<br><br>It&#39;s this GR phenomenon that creates the intense magnetic field on neutron stars and also our own magnetic field here on earth.", "comment_date": "2022-04-26T12:30:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "skateboarding ducky", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udFxKZRyQt4&amp;t=0m43s\">0:43</a> cheese", "comment_date": "2022-04-26T04:38:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Infinity Plus 1", "comment_text": "The scientists who named neutron star layers must have been hungry", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T21:59:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spenster", "comment_text": "Can I call a spoon of neutron star massive?", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T15:05:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LingQ", "comment_text": "\u62cd\u500b\u975a\u624b\u4ffe\u9999\u6e2f\u5b57\u5e55\u2728\u611f\u8b1d\u4f60\ud83d\udc96", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T13:10:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GLNLPR", "comment_text": "High quality for when this was created lol", "comment_date": "2022-04-22T11:54:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "plunderer Dailylink", "comment_text": "why science, why do you name something that might very well be the strongest single thing in the universe...

In this way, we can see that neutron star collisions would be both necessary for life (especially complex life), but at the same time would be lethal to life, for a certain period of time.

Part of what makes the information you are giving us so digestible for anyone who gives it a listen. I believe even some middle schoolers could grasp a decent amount of these subjects, at least at the surface level because of how you guys relay the information. You guys are great science communicators, I know that I really appreciate it, and by looking at the comments you can really see how many people love your work. I know that Carl Sagan would be a big fan of this, because of how honest you guys are and how well you describe these difficult concepts. He was a great man that was taken too soon, but he was for the people, the pursuit of knowledge, and was only interested in the truth.

Such a brilliant mind, and honestly I could say all the same things about Richard Feynman. Although the two mem were quite different, with different tactics, styles, demeanors, and different fields. But both were an inspiration to many, geniuses in their own rights, both of them doing so much for their respective fields.

The house is the evidence of the builder. Same with this universe. It had a beginning, therefore it had to have a cause. And that cause, is God.

If He has given us morality so that we have set up a system of law with courts and judges, how much more would the supreme ruler of the universe demand justice?<br><br>Have  you ever lied, stolen the smallest thing or thought a rude thought? If these were the things God would judge us by, would He find us innocent or guilty? The answer? Guilty. Sinning against an infinite authority figure brings infinite punishment. Hell.<br><br>So how can we stop going to hell? Does doing good deeds take away our sins? If I get a speeding ticket in the morning, then do 5 good things, should the judge let me go free? No, the fine has to be paid.<br><br>What about asking for forgiveness? If a criminal stands before a judge and says, I&#39;m really sorry... Should the judge let him go free? No, because that would be a bad judge. If he forgave every criminal because he loved them, that would not be doing justice. Justice has to be paid. God is merciful, but not so at the expense of justice.<br><br>The only way we can go to heaven is if someone pays our hell punishment for us. Jesus lived a perfect sinless life and then took all of God&#39;s wrath for our sins upon Himself on the cross. Since Jesus paid 100% of our sins, there is none left for us to pay. Our punishment has been paid and we get off free. Justice has been paid and Gods mercy has been <br>upheld.<br><br>Our good deeds don&#39;t save us. Nor do they contribute anything to our salvation.

Gravity presses the material in on itself so tightly that protons and electrons combine to make neutrons, yielding the name &quot;neutron star&quot;. They are so dense that a sugar cube sized lump of material from a neutron star would have a weight of approximately 1 billion metric tons (equivalent to the weight of Everest mountain). If a sugar cubed sized matter could be scooped out from a neutron star, it would explode immediately due to the lack of gravitaion. Because the only thing which can hold the nuclei of atoms so close together is the gravitaional force of a neutron star. So neutron star matter wouldn&#39;t be able survive out of a neutron star. Inside a neutron star, there&#39;s a delicate balance between the tremendous gravity of the star, and the degeneracy pressure of the neutrons. The neutron star&#39;s density also gives it very high\u00a0surface gravity, more than 200 billion times that of\u00a0Earth. Neutron stars have an\u00a0escape velocity of 150,000 km/s which is half the\u00a0speed of light. The neutron star&#39;s gravity accelerates infalling matter to tremendous speed. The force of the impact would destroy the object&#39;s atoms, rendering all the matter identical, to the rest of the neutron star. If an object were to fall from a height of one meter on a neutron star, it would reach the ground at\u00a0 7.200.000 kilometers per hour.<br>\u2022 Starquake and Gama Rays Burst<br>The crust is composed of broken-up atoms of iron with a sea of\u00a0electrons\u00a0flowing through the gaps between them. This crust is extremely hard and very smooth (with maximum surface irregularities of ~5\u00a0mm), due to the extreme gravitational field. About a kilometer below the surface, neutrons and any surviving protons are squeezed together so close that they organize themselves into some really odd structures such as sheets, cylinders and others. This inner crust of neutron star, which was called nuclear pasta because of the resemblance to spaghetti and lasagna, could be 10 billion times stronger than steel and possibly the strongest material in the universe. Due to either its ultra-strong interior\u00a0magnetic fields or spindown, an unimaginably massive quake occurs by ripping the immensely strong crust only one centimeter in lenght in a tenth of a second. It realeses much more energy in a form of gama rays into the space through that one centimeter crack than the Sun emits in 150,000 years. But the inconceivably powerful gravitaional field of a neutron star reconstructs its surface and covers the crack in a blink of an eye. The largest recorded quake was equivalent to a magnitude 23. Had it occurred within a distance of 10 light years from Earth, the quake could have triggered a mass extinction on Earth.<br>\u2022 Surface Heat<br>Neutron stars are extremely hot and have\u00a0 surface temperature varying from 10.000.000 to 500.000 C degrees. Anything approaching a neutron star too close immidiately evaporates.<br>\u2022 Electromagnetic Field <br>Neutron stars are characterized by their extremely powerful magnetic fields. These magnetic fields are from hundred millions to quadrillions (magnetar) of times more powerful than\u00a0the field surrounding Earth. The magnetic field of a magnetar would be lethal even at a distance of 1000\u00a0km. The strong magnetic forces would start to squeeze the electron orbits in all the atoms in your body. The molecules that make up your body are only able to hold together when they are made from normal shaped atoms. So once the atomic orbitals got sufficiently distorted, their chemistry would change dramatically and these molecules would start to fall apart. And your body would be instantly reduced to a dusty, incoherent mess.<br>\u2022 Electromagnetic radiation<br>Most of the light generated by a neutron star is in the form of gama and X rays due to its extreme surface heat, high electromagnetic field and matter acceretion from a near companion. The strong magnetic fields combined with rapid rotation create an awesome generator that can produce electric potential differences of quadrillions of volts. Such voltages, which are 30 million times greater than those of lightning bolts, create deadly blizzards of high energy particles. These high-energy particles (protons and electrons) produce beams of radiation from radio through gamma-ray energies emanating from the poles of the magnetic field. Like a rotating lighthouse beam, the radiation can be observed as a pulsing source of radiation. The pulsar in the Crab Nebula has been observed to pulse in almost every wavelength\u2014radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray. <br>\u2022 Rotation<br>Neutron stars are the fastest rotating objects in the universe. The fastest-spinning neutron star known, which is 15 kilometres in diameter, is\u00a0rotating at a rate of 716 times a second or 43,000\u00a0revolutions per minute, giving nearly a quarter the\u00a0speed of light (75.000 km/s) on the surface of equator.<br>Even a neutron star wouldn&#39;t be able to hold itself together at such a high speed rotation if it weren&#39;t for its tremendous gravitational force.", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T23:19:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "bilal tausif", "comment_text": "Ah yes my favorite food <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Nuclear pasta", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T21:07:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Anand", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udFxKZRyQt4&amp;t=0m36s\">0:36</a> a slice of cheese...", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T17:56:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aes0p", "comment_text": "Cool as hell.", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T15:16:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tupcilian", "comment_text": "Ok but what if you use a Nuclear Pasta Pickaxe and mine nuclear pasta...?", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T14:03:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pinkii", "comment_text": "so extreme", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T07:24:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amosh Lopez", "comment_text": "Everyone else: that dudes facts are on point.<br>What I&#39;m thinking about: why hasn&#39;t nasa hired him?", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T00:52:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sharyl Florette", "comment_text": "The muddled employer qualitatively permit because cooking hopefully treat than a complex whorl.  five, upset port", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T23:01:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick van der horst", "comment_text": "I thought that a neutron star core was liquid metal", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T19:45:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sherd", "comment_text": "What an Animation, you guys are professional", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T17:04:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phil Sprint", "comment_text": "MMMMMMMM PASTA!", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T17:04:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "arno kosterman", "comment_text": "Not bi pushing\ud83d\ude4f but bi motion en pulling of it&#39;s beld<br>This metter you see pusing is schinking bi reseaving more so there inertias slows douwn\ud83d\ude4f.<br>We see meter as somting but meterstade is less than nothing en inertia\ud83c\udf00\u2660\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9c\ud83c\udf10", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T11:19:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Light_yao", "comment_text": "Actually a magnetars magnetic field is 1000 times stronger then a neutron stars Magnetic field", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T05:52:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "silk Alter", "comment_text": "Pretty stupid talking about how everything was made plan is pretty cool we&#39;re made in the image of God and God made everything for his glory alright scientist head do heart fart mouth I guess you&#39;re from Dartmouth", "comment_date": "2021-02-20T21:50:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kasterborous", "comment_text": "Anyone else think these animations are like a real-life version of the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy?", "comment_date": "2021-02-20T21:07:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zo ku", "comment_text": "The ruddy puppy physiologically pass because clutch sicily want until a curly jumper. delirious, jolly trumpet", "comment_date": "2021-02-20T20:55:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SCP-049 The Plague Doctor", "comment_text": "Wait a sec, so star + death = neutron star and neutron star + death = gas and gas + gravity = star.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

In beta decay, the neutrons have to emit W- bosons to turn into protons. You&#39;re saying, &quot;But how can W bosons play a part in this?&quot; Well, they can&#39;t, but they decay into electrons and electron antineutrinos. The electrons can&#39;t help, but surprisingly, the neutrinos can! We usually think they don&#39;t interact much, but the momentum gives the nuclei a boost. In fact, it&#39;s enough to push the nuclei out of the black hole&#39;s reach. Remember, the black hole&#39;s gravity gets weaker the further something is from it. And that&#39;s how the nuclei escape to land here on Earth, bond to each other, and give us a hint on this topic that I just explained.

For instance, the magnetic field strength of a typical neuron star (radio pulsar)  is around 1e12 G (100.000.000 Tesla). Magnetars are a special type among the neutron stars. Magnetars have magnetic field strengths around 1e13 - 1e15 G (so it is up to 100.000.000.000 Tesla) inferred from the period and period derivative of the neutron stars.\u00a0Beside that, starting from the conservation of angular momentum, it is possible to conclude that neutron stars have to rotate very fast, and it is measured for many of them. Their rotational periods vary from milliseconds to few seconds. You can compare that period with Sun&#39; s which is 24.5 days (2114208 s) and calculate how fast it has to rotate, if we shrink it to a size of a neutron star. Furthermore, period of neutron stars change very slowly (mostly varies from 1e-12 s/s to 1e-18 s/s). <br><br>We don&#39;t know everything about the inside of the neutron stars. On the other hand, we know one thing very well. The inside of the neutron stars are super conductors and super fluids, and the neutron stars are rotating which means that they have angular momentum. About the super fluids, their curls are zero, which means that they can not rotate. To sustain the conservation of the angular momentum, in somewhere inside the neutron star, angular momentum should be carried. That part is sustained by the vortex lines inside the super fluids which contains normal matter which can carry the angular momentum and rotate. Beside these, there are magnetic flux tubes which carry the magnetic fields.

Your remains wouldn&#39;t be sticking out much either, having been compacted and vaporized and fused into the crust.<br>- The neutron&#39;s star magnetic field is so strong that it can wipe out all the magnetic storage off the earth if it gets too close. The selfsame magnetic field would kill you too, but to be fair, this was demonstrated by one of Kurzgezagt&#39;s patron birds.<br>- Magnetars has a magnetic field so strong that it can even buckle its own crust.

This is perhaps a little nitpicky, but it&#39;s a common misconception, so I&#39;d like to elaborate a bit.<br>Before nuclear fusion begins and is able to produce the energy to counteract gravity, the star is upheld by the heat of its compressed plasma. This produces enough photon pressure to prevent the star from collapsing before it is able to start fusion. It is however a much smaller reservoir of energy than fusion, so the star will shrink slowly during this time, until it reaches the critical density where hydrogen can start to fuse into helium.\r In the case that the star is not heavy enough, it will never fuse hydrogen and it is called a brown dwarf.<br><br>So while stars are often described as having nuclear fusion as the mechanism to prevent it from collapsing, it is not a necessary ingredient to be called a star. Also neutron stars, as so nicely explained in the video, do not actively fuse elements. Still they are very worthy of the name star! :-)<br><br>Thanks for the amazing content Kurtzgesagt!

Why it stops there, is if i understand it correctly the gravity of a star is not strong enough to fuse iron into heavier elements such as gold, correct ? However, the energy is strong enough when thees stars dies thus making heavier elements. So the question i got while watching this video was, if planets such as earth have some off the heavier elements like gold, could stars not also have heavier elements in them gained from previous dying stars?

The answer is the uncertainty principle. You can either know where a particle is or where it is going.

Yes it will kill you but many things will and neutron stars are not among those that needs to be feared of. <br><br>And word choices. You still talk about dying stars, dying neutron stars. There is no dying here there is only change in structure and eventually leaving the places we now understand (changing into black hole).

The amount of superheavies just under the surface is unreal. All this is hidden from view just under the surface. Imagine in the ocean you get 1/2 psi per foot of depth. There the gradation is one billion times higher gradation. All these effects make this object almost unimaginable. Richard Feynman&#39;s highest order of thinking (for him), was imagining using a bucket of this stuff and spinning it around to produce a magnetic field in the fluid and picturing what is happening in this superfluid. It has both superfluidity and superconductivity.
