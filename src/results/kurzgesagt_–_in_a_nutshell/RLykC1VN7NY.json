Others have thrown around conspiracies involving DoD DEW equipment, but the array of locations wouldn&#39;t make sense unless it was natural, but also not make sense unless it was massive, due to their preciseness and exact timing across several states. No witnesses inside it would survive, and external viewers would not see the light of the rays, as they would be outside visible spectrum. Due to the speed of neutron stars, and the rotation of and revolution of Earth as it deviates the angle, it would only last mere seconds. Because of this, satellite footage would be hard to recover of the event. Also, it is worth noting that satellite footage of that night was edited and had a large strait artifact cloven over the pacific. Not saying we got hit by any gamma ray bursts but, maybe nature is more perfect with all its little imperfections than we once realized. Perhaps the sun itself protects us from the nasty ones, and every now and then its solar cycles slip up and let a nasty one through, thus creating the mass extinction event 450 million years ago. But, we don&#39;t even have to go back that far in history to observe existing hints at extra solar activity devastating life on Earth. We don&#39;t even have to go past human time. On the bright side, we&#39;re way more likely to suddenly die out from overtoxification from PFOAs within 2 generations, or get wiped out by an overly friendly comet that came in from outside our solar system, where it is not yet visible to us while cold, or an out of control flu virus, or nuclear war. My bet is on a rogue blackhole warping the solar system slowly into a compact space, redshifting everything until spaghettification intensifies. It would look a lot like the bible actually. The stars would fall out of the sky, the sun would go out and the moon would turn red and go out too. Everything would get so uncomfortable, and then all at once, after seeming eons of time. bvvvttt.

And this is my saying or phrase of my inspiration, and it goes like this: Since the Internet became known for the domain or public use between the sky, the earth and the bottom of the ocean there is nothing hidden nor the aliens. All my scientific technical information is sustainable and easily verifiable over the Internet or online.

And finished the 2nd. World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA nicolas maduro moros who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including nicolas maduro moros-Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden. And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God since our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 2) That the dinosaurs were extinguished by a huge meteorite or asteroid that collided with the earth and the Oil came or is a product of that extinction. What DOES really happen is that the aliens were modifying the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs so that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem. And scientifically or technically oil exists before the dinosaurs or since the planet earth was formed since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Oil in Rock or Crack and buried at high depths the oil is liquid or molten since the rock Oil crack due to the high temperature and pressure under the earth or at the bottom of the sea this becomes liquid or molten also as is the case of iron at the level of the earth&#39;s surface or in mountains and far from the core of the earth is in solid form iron, on the other hand, in the center of the iron-nickel earth is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that exist there creating the famous magnetic field that protects us from the gamma radiation and neutrons that come of space especially the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of the dinosaurs, then I ask, is it that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or purebred dinosaurs lived only in the North Sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also petroleum in the form of rock or crack linked with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of oil in rock or crack are in the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it was transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have huge amounts of crack or oil in rock and this oil reserves in rock or crack of the USA surpass the liquid oil reserves that VENEZUELA and OPEC countries have. 3) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 4) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 5) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 6) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 7) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska-Siberia-RUSSIA airspace on 06/30/1908; What if it really happened is that the 10,000-year-old black knight extraterrestrial artifact that orbits between the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired a beam of energy to prevent further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellites, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile approach or orbit close to it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies.

Energy and matter can&#39;t interchange one another according to Einstein&#39;s famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. All forms of EMWs are dynamic photons per volume per time in different saturations. I do agree that long gamma burst is due to supernova explosion as a result of the nascent formation of a neutron star or a black hole where all atoms of dying dense star will be eventually reduced to quarks or preons respectively under its own tremendous weight. It will be quite awhile for entire dying star to eventually turning into a lump of quarks or preons respectively. Thus, the gamma burst will last for awhile.. On the other hand, short gamma burst is likely due to mergence of two neutron stars into a black holes. Quarks still contain some sizeable remnant of photons. When quarks reduce to preons, there are still sizeable amount of photons to be dissipated out before neutron stars turned into a black\u00a0 hole. When two black holes merge to become a larger black hole, there wont be even a short gamma burst taken place because superstructures of black holes don&#39;t contain any photons at all. But sucking all celestial bodies within the accretion disk of black holes before merging them (by reducing them from atoms to preons) into a part of a larger black hole will dissipate out tremendous dynamic photons in the form of short gamma burst. Some supernova explosions had already taken place within Milky Way in the past since NASA discovered there are presence of some gigantic black holes within the center of Milky Way. Glad that we (our ancestors) still managed to survive despite of long gamma\u00a0bursts\u00a0near our vicinity in the past.If you are interested in real discoveries, I would recommend you to read my book, The Unification Theory- Volume One and you will be amazed with lots of new, interesting discoveries.

Now these two supermassive stars have absorbed so much matter yet still defy the black hole collapse and they have began to draw all particle matter towards them stopping the very flow of time itself because their gravity has grown so strong that even black holes are pulled in and absorbed by them and those two stars eventually swallow up everything until the day they meet. The explosion from these two hypernova is so massive that it endangers the very fabric of time and space by it force unraveling the very fabric of matter and causing a complete destabilization of particle formation send existence back into nonexistence and it&#39;s effect not only threatens to destroy that universe but all the bubble universes ricocheting it&#39;s blast effect beyond the end if one universes singularity big bang moment and cascading into the next universes causing all of time itself to end in an event that will effect all that is.

So look for God and then he will start to look for you (2nd Chronicles 15:2-7 + 1st Samuel 16:7* God looks upon the heart, not at what people look at [ also Jeremiah 4:4, 17:9-10* &amp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLykC1VN7NY&amp;t=29m11s\">29:11</a>-13* ]. SHALOM (to those nearby and also to those<br>far away, Isaiah 57:9-21*). <br>Oh--- and remember what I said: &quot;Praying is just like fishing&quot;. Your prayer is your &quot;lure&quot; and you are hoping to get that &quot;BIG ONE&quot; on the line. [ It&#39;s a private line, not a &quot;party line&quot; ].Try that tiny little &quot;faith lure&quot; --- they are available (!) and don&#39;t be like that dumb fisherman says &quot;oh, there&#39;s no :grand-daddy fish in that lake. His &quot;tackle box&quot; is full of dirt and junk lures with big treble hooks. No wonder he never had an success when praying to God. (One can lie to people, but not to God, who can see what&#39;s hiding there in your heart). I wish you lots of luck &quot;fishing for God&quot;!

Another question: the bigger the distance of a ray* to the center of the gamma ray , the slower it travels. So I would expect a tie-shaped ray to travel to Earth unlike at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLykC1VN7NY&amp;t=4m40s\">4:40</a> of this video.

So if a gamma ray kills us all, will a particular human being live a micro-microsecond longer than a being somewhere else on Earth?

Just ONE light-year has an angle of ONLY 0.017 degrees already! If u think Red Shift measures/accurately gauges distances 2 distant objects, u need 2 know that red shift is QUANTIZED (only at certain energy levels), absolutely ruling out the Dopper Effect explanation, may b caused by tired light, (Light may lose energy naturally as it travels and remember that since light has mass, it is affected by other objects with mass. A solar sail works because light has momentum and therefore mass. If you believe light has energy, and energy is mass according to Einstein, then you believe light has mass.) objects moving @ right angles to us, &amp; when gravity is acting on an object. There&#39;s this object moving TOWARDS us that is still red-shifted!!! There&#39;s this pair of objects connected with radically different redshifts that proves the big bang wrong. In addition, in the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, near the center, where the velocities are extremely high, the red-shift is somehow washed out. This strongly implies that strong motion DESTROYS the redshift, instead of creating it. A galaxy has even been measured to have a DECREASE of one quantization in redshift, which should be impossible if the universe is expanding and the redshift is due to the doppler effect. YouTube: Stretching the Heavens: A New Cosmology. Google Science vs Evolution Pathlights. We can barely make out PLUTO with our best telescopes and yet we are told astronomers have detected a planet 1,300 or so light-years away?! Think about it. The object MAY be thousands of light-years away but we cannot measure those distances. We are simply TOO TINY, to put it humbly. And yes, there may be no such thing as deep space. Perhaps the &quot;far away&quot; objects are just super-tiny. It&#39;s possible. How could we know the difference? The Cosmic Background Radiation is much too cold to have come from the supposed Big Bang. It actually comes from stars. The heavens shall pass away with a great noise... interesting how from a biblical perspective, the big bang is in the future, where the heavens will be passed AWAY, instead of in the past, where it supposedly created the universe.", "comment_date": "2017-06-29T16:14:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Svetozar Bukavac", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLykC1VN7NY&amp;t=5m27s\">5:27</a> Adventure time reference", "comment_date": "2017-06-29T07:38:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Connor Simon", "comment_text": "Achievement earned!

While it&#39;s mass will increase slightly from the mass of this light being added, it&#39;s not much by comparison to the mass from the matter in the plasma, and consequently the event horizon doesn&#39;t expand much. BUT The surface of the plasma ball does expand from the increase in temperature. Eventually the surface of the plasma will be equal in size to the event horizon and some will leak out. Now the mass inside is a bit lower, and the event horizon shrinks accordingly. Now ALOT of matter is no longer inside and the event horizon shrinks even more. See where this going? In a fraction of a second the super black hole explodes into  a very big ball of rapidly expanding plasma which cools and condenses into a galaxy. How long would this process take? Quite a while.

However, I have to disagree with your description of the interaction of gamma rays in the atmosphere and the related description of the mechanism of damage of the ozone layer. <br><br>It is true that a large part of the cosmic gamma ray flux is absorbed in the region of the atmosphere (20-45 km, stratosphere) that contains the so called ozone layer. Nonetheless, the ozone layer is a metaphorical term - the stratosphere contains over an altitude of tens of kilometers only a small concentration of ozone. If all the ozone from the stratosphere were to be compressed to surface air pressure, the gas layer would be only about 3 mm thick. It is not actually the ozone layer itself that absorbs the gamma rays, but mostly oxygen and nitrogen molecules that make up the bulk of the stratosphere. Very few ozone molecules are impacted. These also get ionized by the interactions with gamma rays, but in low fluxes of gamma rays this has no impact on the concentration ozone. However, during a catastrophic event - such as a near supernova explosion or an illumination of a gamma ray burst - the high radiation dose delivered to the upper atmosphere would excite and ionize a siginificant fraction of the bulk air in the stratosphere, which would lead to the creation of large quantities of different nitrogen oxides (NOx). These NOx molecules act as catalyzers for ozone breakup. Ozone is actually regenerated fairly quickly in the atmosphere (in days), because it is rapidly generated by UV-photolysis of molecular oxygen; however, the presence of NOx molecules in the stratosphere would decrease the steady-state concentration of ozone. The long-lasting damage to the ozone layer then would be caused by the long residence time (years) of NOx molecules in the stratosphere, similarly to our current issues with chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases.<br><br>Reading for more insight: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211361\">https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211361</a><br><br>With best regards,<br>Martin Precek, Ph.D.", "comment_date": "2016-08-02T13:27:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Umandap Evangeline", "comment_text": "when code keem is too much", "comment_date": "2016-08-02T13:24:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wesley Rosa", "comment_text": "kurzgesagt in a nutshell melhor canal do YouTube. :b", "comment_date": "2016-08-02T13:23:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "boxx", "comment_text": "I always see a tardis in every video", "comment_date": "2016-08-02T13:20:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ali Fayad", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLykC1VN7NY&amp;t=5m07s\">5:07</a> TARDIS can be seen in the bottom left corner.", "comment_date": "2016-08-02T13:11:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Louis Racicot", "comment_text": "That&#39;s why we need to colonize other solar systems.

I really admire you and I love the work that you do! I&#39;d like to share something rather personal with you. Something I&#39;ve been holding onto for about 2 years now and I have to tell you this now. So, please allow me to elaborate so by the time your done reading my comment, you&#39;ll know why.. Firstly, I am a deaf man but I haven&#39;t always been deaf! You see, I was born with a horrible disease called M\u00e9ni\u00e8re&#39;s and after me fighting and battling with it for 23 years of my life, it finally took my hearing from me.. I knew eventually I&#39;d lose my hearing before I was 30 years old, due to the aggressive progression of it but during my last year of hearing, I tried so much to listen to as much of the things I loved because the only way I would be able to hear again.. was.. to relive my memories.. My sister has helped me so much through my depression and what she started doing for me - and even still to this very day - she writes down videos for me in my notebook and then I&#39;ll try to read and watch the video the best I can because sadly, the YouTube Captions are worthless. That is how I found you. I especially fell in love with you&#39;re work because in that field, making a deaf person hear again is possible and I long so badly to hear again. It saddens me that if I ever meet a woman and have kids, I&#39;ll never hear their voices.. It saddens me even more deeply I can&#39;t here my mom&#39;s voice no more or even my dad&#39;s.. I never realized how ungrateful I really was with my life.. How I took things for granted and how I long to change my past because now I know, what it means to be appreciative!! You sadly don&#39;t appreciate something until you don&#39;t have it no more.. I sadly, learn&#39;t the hard way. So, for watching your videos for about 2 years now, it has really helped me so much through my depression.. in ways you probably wouldn&#39;t understand.. I&#39;m always so excited when you release a new video because, I love to LEARN! And one last thing before I end this, a few weeks ago, my Doctor diagnosed me with Endocrine Cancer but I am still waiting on the official results.These last few years, I was slowly getting out of my depression but getting that news, really.. really brought me down..i don&#39;t want to go blind too!! i don&#39;t want to die either.. So, I needed to get this off my chest because who knows, I might be dead in a few months, I don&#39;t know.

Gamma rays aren&#39;t absorbed by the Ozone Layer the way UV light is. <br><br>Gamma rays are absorbed by the atmosphere primarily via a process called pair production. The gamma ray photon spontaneously turns into an electron-positron pair (positron is an anti-electron). The electron and positron interact with electric fields from the surrounding air molecules, get decelerated and emit photons (hence losing energy). These new photons then pair produce in turn, and this process continues anew, the number of &#39;daughter particles&#39; doubling at each stage. From a single gamma-ray photon you get billions of high energy particles cascading down the atmosphere in an &#39;air shower&#39;. They increase in number until the particles reach an energy threshold where they lose all their energy by ionising the surrounding air, and the shower dissipates. <br><br>Astronomers actually observe the highest energy gamma rays by measuring the showers they cause in the atmosphere and trying to reconstruct the energy and direction of the original gamma-ray photon. Lowering energy gamma-rays are measured by satellites directly (i.e. the Fermi Space Telescope).<br><br>Basically the gamma-ray absorption (aka attenuation or extinction) is proportional to the amount of atmosphere it passes through, it&#39;s not dependent on any specific layer.  UV light is absorbed completely differently, the UV photons hit ozone molecules and their energy goes into breaking up the ozone (ozone is a molecule made of 3 oxygen molecules 03) into an oxygen molecule (O2) and a free oxygen ion (O+).You were correct through in saying that a gamma-ray burst could destroy the ozone layer and leave the Earth&#39;s surface exposed to life-killing UV radiation.", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T13:18:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Prole Patrol Music", "comment_text": "how the Death Star got its power", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T13:18:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Alvaro", "comment_text": "This v\u00eddeo was amazing, but... the end was pretty depressing :(", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T13:18:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luckytime", "comment_text": "This is the only channel whose videos I regularly watch twice in a row.", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T13:18:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niall Woods", "comment_text": "the hadron collider in sern", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T13:18:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stormraught", "comment_text": "That ending hahaha, another great vid!", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T13:17:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Krenske", "comment_text": "that 60fps tho...\ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T13:17:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pivotkid85", "comment_text": "Years ago i watched a documentary called &#39;Evacuate Earth&#39; that showed how humans would prepare for an incoming gamma ray burst.", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T13:17:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "helen le", "comment_text": "\u1e98\u210c\u0466\u2020 \u210a\u0491\u25ce\u028a\u2118 \u25ce\u1e1f \u00a2\u25ce\u043c\u2118\u2113\u212e\u03f0 \u25ce\u0491\u210a\u0466\u03b7\u029d\ufe69\u043c\ufe69 \u1e98\u25ce\u028a\u2113\u2202 \u266d\u212e \u2020\u210c\u212e \u03b7\u212e\u03f0\u2020 \u2020\u25ce \u2202\u25ce\u043c\u029d\u03b7\u0466\u2020\u212e \u2020\u210c\u212e \u212e\u0466\u0491\u2020\u210c \u0466\u1e1f\u2020\u212e\u0491 \u028a\ufe69 \u210c\u028a\u043c\u0466\u03b7\ufe69 \u0466\u0491\u212e \u210a\u25ce\u03b7\u212e?", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T13:17:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M Be", "comment_text": "That Pok\u00e9mon reference!", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T13:17:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Preston Orlando", "comment_text": "I&#39;m 9", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T13:17:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Timothy Honeycutt", "comment_text": "Could a gamma ray cause instant death of all life on earth?
