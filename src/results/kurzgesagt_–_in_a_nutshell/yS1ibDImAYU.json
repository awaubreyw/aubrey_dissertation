The lasers would need too much energy, and the harpoons would be hard to aim. The electromagnets would still probably be the best solution, though.<br><br>My solution is to have a large, flat, sheet of kevlar or some other hard to break material (It would have a large metal frame with kevlar in the middle) and with a weak magnet to hold it in place. This setup would catch all of the particles and then would rotate itself to fling the debris at a large object with gravity, preferably Venus (Venus&#39; atmosphere would dissolve the metal, and it&#39;s close). This works because since there&#39;s no atmosphere in space, the debris would travel continuously forever until it was stopped by a planet. The device would also not have to be too accurate, since Venus&#39; gravitational field would capture it if the debris went near it. And if not, there&#39;s plenty of space for it to spread out.<br><br>Obviously, this wastes all the material in space, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it economically to have to send something into space just to extract a relatively little amount of metal.

When a satellite is nearing its end of mission it is expected to lower to an orbit where it can reenter in less than 25 years (a graveyard orbit). 4) Our infrastructure satellites (i.e. GPS) are not in LEO.  i.e. the Starlink satellites are flying around 1,100km, GPS satellites are at about 20,200km, and some even geostationary at around 36,000km above the surface; For reference the ISS is around 420km. 5) Space has a lot of space.

A giant wall of Play-Doh.

Also you could easily maneuvered her regular satellites away from this massive wall. The wall itself would be over her two or three metres thick of solid Foundation and be very tall and wide to make a giant catcher&#39;s mitt. No matter what size piece is they will all get stuck inside this very solid very large wall approximately 100m potentially less. To be really effective in take out large amounts of random debris many of these would be stationed at different heights of Orbitz and the cleanup could happen in no time. When you want to travel the satellite dish past the wall it simply has to rotate itself to be perpendicular with the direction of the satellite and move out of the way one or two. This can be calculated far in advance. Space Play-Doh. It would also help if it was sticky. I&#39;m 32 years old. However the compounds for a space bearing sticky Play-Doh is obviously beyond my scope. But what about liquids with a lower than space freezing temperature. Such a liquid would do nicely.

A low earth orbit is huge, bigger then you would think. it would be like the chances of 2 bullets colliding in a war, sure it happens, but even with billions of rounds fired only about 2-3 confirmed incidents have been found. It&#39;s certainly important to keep the earths orbit clean, but it&#39;s not going to be a problem for a very long time. We can&#39;t even get the right kind of intercepts you get from debris when we want it to happen, so the chances of it happening by chance are stupidly low.

The ISS travels at a speed in witch its mass will make an equilibrium where gravity, mass, centrifugal force and  speed will allow the iss to cruise. The rocked being lighter, would have to continuously  push towards the earth while trying to catch the ISS so that it would not go further out because little mass, less gravity attraction.

Also your description of orbits in this video is highly peculiar and it omits certain details i&#39;m sure you know should have been included. Please go back to your earlier way of working, we need to see highly researched ideas, merged with your unique way of presenting, not basic concepts explained through animated birds. Videos like fermi, the vegan one, reasons for legalization of weed. More like those, less like this one.<br>DISCLAIMER: I have beem a fan for years and that&#39;s why i write this, in hope you&#39;ll return to former glories", "comment_date": "2018-11-28T07:49:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Julien", "comment_text": "Just have a space cleaning service.", "comment_date": "2018-11-28T07:44:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ERIC ESCOBEDO", "comment_text": "I already feel like a prisoner to myself", "comment_date": "2018-11-28T07:35:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mitchiemasha", "comment_text": "They might want to focus on the plastic in the sea first.

However, these hits would, even though the mylar is thin, a lot of energy would be generated, which means the orbital path of the debris would be altered, presumably slowed. And thus make them deorbit much faster than if left alone. The sheet could be deployed by one of those pizza box size satellites, then after a year or so, the same satellite, attached to the sheet say by a corner, fires and deorbits both itself and the sheet. The satellite does not have to do anything but drag itself back into the atmosphere, where it burns up (just like the debris it targets).<br><br><br>If you make the sheet circular, the satellite can be attached in the middle and deploy the sheet just by spinning and then release the sheet, which deploys from centrifugal force.

To name the most glaring, objects in low Earth orbit DO NOT STAY THERE FOREVER (or for centuries)!

Objects higher up would take longer, but lower sections should get clean within a few years. <br>Also, the geostationary orbit is where the key communication infrastructure is at and it remains largely unaffected by the space junk problem. GPS satellites orbit lower, but still well above low Earth orbit.<br>There is no doubt that space junk is a problem, but this scaremongering isn&#39;t the best way to raise alarm about this issue.

Now, because visual information can only travel at the speed of light for all purpose those objects no longer exist to us as material.

This isn\u2019t just a thought process or something, these objects physically no longer exist within our reference frame anymore. Now, to sum up what all this means. There is a horizon, beyond which nothing physically exists from our perspective. This is what we call the observable universe. This horizon is closing in on us, eliminating more and more from our observable universe. As a result, we see less and less of the things that exist everyday.

Granted there&#39;s a bunch of navigation satellites scattered through that region including GPS, but that&#39;s mostly upwards of 20 000km.<br><br>I mean, if we had a cloud of bullet sized metal whipping around in LEO, there&#39;d probably be some significant interference in any signals being transmitted through, and not being able to put new equipment up would be bad, but I doubt we&#39;d be quite as screwed on Earth as this video suggests.", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T17:53:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "geneticTechnician", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS1ibDImAYU&amp;t=7m47s\">7:47</a><br>so thats how you say it", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T17:52:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheNinthGeneration", "comment_text": "We should make force fields for the rockets", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T17:52:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gurisa Yudistira", "comment_text": "The animations is <i>entrapping</i>", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T17:52:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zaxor Von Skyler", "comment_text": "Anyone watch the anime Planetes?", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T17:52:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Krisna Sadeva", "comment_text": "Tooo looongggg forr mee to waiting u uploading a single video -,-", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T17:51:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lurts", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS1ibDImAYU&amp;t=7m41s\">7:41</a> Tardis<br>Btw: I vote for SpaceLazers\u2122", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T17:51:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zombiblitzen", "comment_text": "The magnet is a really cool idea.

If anyone wants to read it here you go. <br><br>     As the space industry grows each year, with launches every week, the space debris grows as well. In years to come, we will likely stop littering space using methods to prevent our spacecraft from becoming debris. In the meantime, there still needs to be a method in place to rid space of our junk. Many of the proposed methods to clearing debris requires lots of fuel or is limited to one time uses. An article written by NASA stated, \u201cMore than 500,000 pieces of debris are tracked as they orbit the Earth. They all travel at speeds up to 17,500 mph\u2026\u201d Only 4% of the debris is greater than the size of a softball, which makes deorbiting the wide range of sizes difficult. This is how we get into discussing theoretical options to removing debris.     <br>    Scientist are theorizing about a laser that shoots the debris to slow it down. The benefits of a laser, is that it is reusable, located on the ground for easy accessibility, and fast turnaround time. However, some fragments may not head towards Earth as planned. Instead their trajectory could be on course to collide with an operational spacecraft. This is why I propose we use a non-destructive laser.     <br>     The intent would be the same, but the debris would be in one piece until it burned in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The objective would be to push the debris towards Earth, which means the force has to come from a higher orbit than the debris. One way to accomplish this is to put a giant satellite in high orbit that can reflect the laser, enabling it to deorbit debris. Another option would be to put that same laser device in place of the reflector in space. Naturally, countries are not fond of having weapons in space. This would not be an issue since the laser can only \u201cpush\u201d objects and not destroy them. <br>     This laser technique alludes to the further uses of this technology. One allows spacecraft to sustain a low Earth orbit without having to waste energy, such as the ISS. I believe this is the future of deorbiting, and as every year passes we become closer to discovering that technology.

Any new launches will have to provide a prorata cost to recover the asset from orbit or be able to show there is a clear decommissioning plan in place which is approved by the UN dedicated dept before said assets are even launched. Furthermore, if recovered most materials can be recycled and the resulting value be put back into operations. The charter of this UN dept has to include the real enforcement of serious financial penalties for anyone launching anything in orbit without an effective deccomisioning plan. Maybe even prison sentences for the responsible individuals. If this is planned right and gets the buy in of the major governments with launch capabilities could actually provide a serious drive towards reusability of space assets.
