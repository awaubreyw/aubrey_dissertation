Lots of people use analogies but they get confusing. <br><br>A company can sell a part of itself called a share. The purpose of this is mainly for the company to raise money for itself. <br>If the company does well and it\u2019s worth doubles, now your $1 share is worth $2. Of the company does bad and it\u2019s worth halves, your $1 share is worth $0.50. Think of a share like in the show shark tank where the company owner offers to sell X% of his company for X amount of money. The company owner does it for to raise funds. <br><br>Everyone in the world is able to buy and sell shares, and anyone can use an app/brokerage to do so. People are <b>generally</b> able to buy and sell shares whenever they want in basically any volume as well. <br><br>There are other factors that influence share price as well, like how many people buy or sell their shares of that company. If a ton of people sell shares all of a sudden the shares value drops and vice versa. There\u2019s a ton of ant factors as well <br><br>All of these factors are combined in an algorithm which assigns a price to the shares in real time, and this algorithm is what creates those graphs of a companies stock. <br><br>When you sell a share it will be sold to anyone in the world who is willing to buy it for that price. Or it can go to the brokerage who keeps a stockpile of shares for itself to sell to its other customers (I believe). <br><br>So a regular \u201cretail\u201d trader (non-professional) will do a ton research to find companies that have a likely upwards or downwards trend in price. They will then buy shares of a company they think will do well. For example the trader bought 100 shares at $10 each. They spent $1000. The company grows (or some other event happens) and then the price of the stock goes up to $50 a share. The trader can now sell his 100 shares for $5000 and they just made $4000. <br><br>Traders can also use something called a put-option to actually make money if the stock price goes down, but that\u2019s a little more complicated.", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T01:10:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alieu", "comment_text": "First bird appearance <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3QpgXBtDeo&amp;t=1m33s\">1:33</a>", "comment_date": "2021-03-03T16:29:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Walter Bowers", "comment_text": "The jumpy friction cytologically rock because philippines curiosly shelter qua a cloistered nic. tangy, grubby gruesome target", "comment_date": "2021-03-02T00:05:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert George", "comment_text": "Crypto currency is the future, investing in it will be the wisest thing to do especially with the current rise.", "comment_date": "2021-03-01T23:39:05Z", "likes_count": 39}, {"comment_by": "Fuzz Zeballs", "comment_text": "they forgot to mention how the markets sell the stats forking and short positions to banksandhedge funds", "comment_date": "2021-03-01T12:32:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Esther Donald", "comment_text": "It is estimated that over 40,000 to 300,000 people have made a massive one million dollars on Forex pending on the type of broker involved.For every investment to yield earnings a professional broker should be involved.Mrs Bonita Mollet is a professional broker who manages,handles and gives guidance on investments to get good profits", "comment_date": "2021-03-01T07:40:35Z", "likes_count": 25}, {"comment_by": "H O N E Y[] S E N P A I", "comment_text": "Thanks for the vid learned new things\u2764", "comment_date": "2021-03-01T07:07:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R P", "comment_text": "Nice", "comment_date": "2021-02-28T08:08:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "PAPI", "comment_text": "Ohh for dummies oops not for me... \ud83d\udc40", "comment_date": "2021-02-26T12:13:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daxton Heath", "comment_text": "dax is my name lol", "comment_date": "2021-02-26T01:20:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Houston Calls", "comment_text": "i make huge profits on my investment since i started trading with Mrs Prisca elvis,her trading strategies are<br>top notch", "comment_date": "2021-02-26T01:08:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NightwishTarja", "comment_text": "i gained 3 PHDs only watching  Kurzgesagt. superb as always", "comment_date": "2021-02-24T17:46:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bro Oj", "comment_text": "I make huge profits on my investment since i started \rtrading with Mrs Stephanie Williams, her trading strategies are top notch", "comment_date": "2021-02-24T15:58:12Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "Arturo Styles", "comment_text": "I enjoy making money online,there is this good feelings it gives me", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T18:53:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "valenpresh", "comment_text": "I am very confident trading with Mr Wilson&#39;s strategy because of the steady income he makes for me.

That&#39;s the reason why stocks where created in the first place. Why would I as the owner of a company would want to issue shares and therefore spread my earnings amongst a broad group of people? because what shares do is spread the risk around. If my bussiness is doing good, everybody wins and yes, i wouldn&#39;t win 100% of those earnings since there are other people who own portions fo the company, but even then i can just go to the stock exchange and re buy my own shares. But what happens if things go south? well i would lose only a fraction of what i&#39;d lose if i didin&#39;t issue the shares in the first place, if i kept it all for myslef, i would have lost it all! Also, current enterprises require massive ammounts of money to be set up and to operate. I can\u00b4t wait until i start getting revenue to raise the capital, it&#39;s the other way around, and issuing shares is a way to accrue that capital AND spread the risk both at once. If you want to thank ( or blame) anyone for this creation, that would be the dutch. One of the first publicly traded companies in history was the dutch east india company which was, by many accounts, the most prosperous and wealthy corporation in history. They lasted for hundreds of years (and yes they engaged in A LOT of nasty practices) but during those prosperous times, anybody in Holland could be a partial owner of that money making machine. In the end they lasted for over 218 years and their net worth at it&#39;s peak is around 8 TRILLION dollars in today\u00b4s money, that&#39;s roughly 50% of the GDP of the USA!", "comment_date": "2020-03-13T04:54:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Guan", "comment_text": "America doesn\u2019t use euros", "comment_date": "2020-03-13T04:28:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zhou Pact", "comment_text": "So I guess youtube is going down the drain soon then.", "comment_date": "2020-03-12T18:17:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moo Moo", "comment_text": "Here on black monday 2020", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T21:47:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rajveer Parrish", "comment_text": "The Stock Market is a liquidated market that has been on for ages, its only beneficial to those who follow through the right procedure.

about cryptos, hodling, and trading. So many views and you can&#39;t help but laugh when you look at how erroneous and misleading many of these are. The biggest of them all that really cracks me is the naivety with which a more significant percentage of crypto enthusiast use in screaming HODL without realizing the reasons to hodl and in what kind of market to implement this strategy with the hopes that BTC is going to be $1,000,000 or xrp $250,000 in the next couple of years. This fallacy is further fueled by greed which would see so many lose all their savings to hypes. Cryptocurrency today sadly is mostly speculative, unpredictable and risky to hold onto for anybody who is technical enough to look critically at the long-term trend, read the charts and understand the markets. Why should I invest long term in the most uncertain market in the world? I\u2019d tell you why I can and how I do it and also how you can if you so wish. With proven strategies and signals, I have made quite a lot of profit (over $80,000) even in this currently bearish market through actively trading my coins, and this was until I took time to research and find a better method of making a profit instead of holding and having sleepless nights. First of all, I can make gains on movements that would bring loses to hodlers. This simple idea was giving me by <b>Mr. Mark Hall (markhall279@gmail com) when I started using his strategies and trade signals which has made me so much money already. My advice would take advantage of the affordability of bitcoin presently and buy some more but don&#39;t just buy, trade them to make a good profit and increase your portfolio in preparation for the approaching bull run.</b> I\u2019d suggest you reach Mark by the mail address provided and ask him for any assistance you may need as regards cryptocurrency and how to profit as a trader. He is someone that has given me invaluable help with his trade patterns and signals that are so accurate I win at least 95% of all my trades.", "comment_date": "2018-12-06T18:43:47Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "vlad crisan", "comment_text": "im a dummie", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T17:38:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Funny Memes", "comment_text": "What about the DOW Jones industrial average?", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T01:56:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Funny Memes", "comment_text": "Did anyone see taco inc. turn into D\u00f6ner inc. at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3QpgXBtDeo&amp;t=2m17s\">2:17</a>?", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T01:55:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Coolguyx14", "comment_text": "Ok I\u2019m worse than a dummy", "comment_date": "2018-12-03T07:41:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u2584OnceThereWasAPersonWithALongUsername.ItWasSoLongThatItWentAcrossTheScreenAndStopped.", "comment_text": "I see.", "comment_date": "2018-12-02T11:10:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alper yolo Yilmaz", "comment_text": "D\u00f6ner inc", "comment_date": "2018-11-29T16:48:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gheith Yan", "comment_text": "i graduated  4 years in bachelor of business and administration in finance and i was dumb ... this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3QpgXBtDeo&amp;t=3m33s\">3:33</a> sec with nice presentation taught me more :D", "comment_date": "2018-11-28T17:26:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Unimornnbr1", "comment_text": "Oh well, guess im a dummy", "comment_date": "2018-11-27T15:32:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sohom Chatterjee", "comment_text": "Yes...we are dummies", "comment_date": "2018-11-24T20:01:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FortNikitaBullion", "comment_text": "The shorter story:\u00a0 It&#39;s a ponzi scheme.", "comment_date": "2018-11-24T15:28:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Co Co", "comment_text": "So I watched this to understand the basics. The basics are described, explained, and yes, they make sense. I&#39;m slowly realizing that my confusion has little to do with how it works, but why people do it. I guess with an excess of money, investing is almost equivalent to a hobby. You win, you lose, no big deal. If, though, you invest a small amount of your fortune. Being someone who is more focused on the question of &quot;why?&quot; as opposed to &quot;how?&quot;, it still makes little to zero sense to me. The world is so nasty, ponzi schemes have existed since to 20&#39;s, yet people are so obsessed with the concept of making more and more. Its scary how much people worship the concept of money. Yes, I need money, my family needs money, but when are people just content with life? Its hard for me to understand the concepts, as well as goals, of the incredibly wealthy. Yes, all it is is gambling, so, if some phony investor screws you out of your money, in all reality, its your own fault. So having money to burn, I can see someone saying &quot;why not?&quot;. Otherwise, the average man is just gambling his livelihood and sacrificing his family&#39;s well-being by being involved in this. THAT is incredibly frustrating to me. Its 2018, and you are an idiot if you can be a middle class citizen and invest your money with an investment company who can very well, VERY WELL, ruin your life. The stock market is a gambling platform for the ultra rich. I see all these shmucks invest life savings or inheritances and come out in the end with nothing.

They can go to the bank and ask for a loan that they eventually have to pay back, or they can issue stock in their company.  Each stock represents a small piece of ownership in the company.  So when a company issues stock, they are essentially selling a piece of their company to investors, and in turn use the money from the sale to expand their business.  Companies often issue many millions of shares of stock.<br><br>When you want to buy stock in a company, you will buy it from a stock exchange, which is a centralized place where people go to buy and sell shares of a company.  Now, what determines how much a stock will cost?  In short, its supply and demand based on what you and other investors believe that piece of the company to be worth.  If you look at the financials and determine that a share of Company A is worth $10, and you can find someone that will sell you their share in Company A for $10, then that share is worth $10 on the stock exchange.  When you buy the share, you hope that the company will continue to do well, both financially and socially, and other people that are buying and selling shares in the company on the stock exchange will value them even higher, and that the share price will grow even higher.<br><br>Once you determine that you are ready to sell your shares (for any number of reasons), you go back to the exchange to sell your shares.  When selling your shares, it works the exact same as when you purchased it.  If you believe that the price of shares of Company A that you have been holding are now worth $20, and you can find someone that also believes they are worth $20, then you can sell your share through the exchange.  Now that you have sold the share for $20, you have made a profit of $10 on Company A stock ($20 you sold it for - $10 you paid for it = $10 profit)!<br><br>In regards to dividends, they are separate of stock price. When a company does particularly well in a given quarter and after funding their business operations they have extra profits left over, they can choose to share those profits with their share holders.  So they will give a set amount per share held to their share holders, which is a dividend.  Not all companies do this, they are not required to, however many that do often have their share price go up because investors take this as good news that the company is doing better than expected.

I couldn&#39;t reply because I couldn&#39;t see the reply link, strangely on only your comment. There is technically no minimum. You can buy 1 share if you have the funds and hopefully start earning returns on that. The problem with this is, you aren&#39;t diversified and you can incur large commission charges. Depending on the broker, some brokers charge per trade, regardless of the number of shares. Common advise, is to first invest in a mutual fund which usually have a minimum of $500. There are usually is no upfront, back end fees, but there are usually trailer fees of 0.5%-3% that incur yearly. The best benefits are, your $500 would be highly diversified and there is trained active management. Once you saved up to a recommended amount of $10,000, and are a somewhat knowledgeable investor, then it&#39;s recommended to diversify into stocks and/or bonds. This way the commissions on buying shares yourself are usually lower than the trailer fees of a mutual fund, as long as you&#39;re not actively trading.

Who could possibly think of such things when you&#39;re rushing trillions of dollars from company to company in minutes?

Then let&#39;s say my company is successful and I make $200. (Now the company is worth $200?)<br>Here&#39;s where I get confused. From my understanding their are 2 outcomes. <br>1. The share prices double from $10 a share to $20 a share. Thus anyone who sells the stock makes a profit. But if all of my shareholders sell there stock, and I lose my $200, thus no profit and I&#39;m broke???<br><br>2. The share prices stay at $10 and I make a profit and possibly the shareholders if I add a dividend (which can&#39;t be anything too substantial).
