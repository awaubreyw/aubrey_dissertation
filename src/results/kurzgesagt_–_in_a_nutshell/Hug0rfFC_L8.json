Supposedly the government wants to control the populace. <br>- So why does the government want to control the populace?<br>- So that the people can be under their dominion? Why? <br>- How does this benefit them? <br>- Control is meant to give a person power. So why would need more power than they already have now? The amount of power they have now is pretty good. <br>- No other country would be ok with this.<br><br>Next, the government wants to control the populace by causing a coronavirus pandemic. <br>- Why would they use a disease to control the populace?<br>- Spreading a disease would cause great harm to themselves.<br>- Why would they use a more mild virus that is similar to the flu? People arent scared of the flu anymore. <br>- If they wanted  to use a disease to control people, they could at least create a very dangerous one, like a contageous prion disease or a lethal virus similar to rabies or ebola. These would scare people into complying.<br><br>Once they create a pandemic, they use lockdowns, quarantines, mandate masks, and regulations to initiate their control. <br>- These things are not about controlling. They are putting a halt to things, which is dissapointing but not life threatening for the populace, and greatly harmful for themselves. <br>- These means to &quot;control&quot; the populace are not benefitting them, but are in fact harming them. They are negatively impacting their trade of goods, hurting their economy, and putting themselves at risk of contracting the virus. <br>- They are losing control by doing this. This pandemic is putting a lot of stress on them, as they are losing control over the virus, the economy, and the people.<br><br>Now for the end result. Their plan is &quot;successful&quot; and now they will have world domination. <br>- They already have world dominaton.<br>- Their plan is a failure and they intentionally made it fail. They managed to cause chaos, and now are trying desperately to NOT &quot;control&quot; the populace.<br>- The world has been left changed yet unfazed by the virus. People arent scared of it anymore. People are learning how to take care of themselves. People are feeling better prepared for another pandemic in the future. People dont care about the regulations.

Its fishy because its been so many years and didn&#39;t even tried to go back, I guess its not profitable yet because there is no technology to exploit resources, anyway personally I think its true because moon could have been a great strategic military point for nukes given the context, but in reality its hard to have nuclear silos on the moon.<br><br>2020 corona virus for example, no 5g, nobody gonna get exterminated, vaccines don&#39;t have nanochips, its simply buying a product and building a monopolist brand while whole countries are outsmarted and crippled because of their internal corruption and incompetence.

The politicians and mass media claim that there is no pattern for the turn of events. The idea that there is a hidden connection between various destructive phenomena is usually ridiculed as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, which does not fit in with the official world-view. To create order out of this apparent chaos, a few is necessary. You are holding such a few in your hands. Juri Lina&#39;s revealing book provides an insight into the concealed network behind past and present events. This political system has been built up by forces working behind the scenes - an all-encompassing deception by the Krights Templar, the Illuminati and today the Freemasons, clearly evident in our present lives. Juri Lina has collected information and rare documents from many sources to create a record of the devastating activities of the secret societies. He reveals the connection between the concealed organisations and shows how these have affected history with the air of puppets like Napoleon, Lenin, Trotsky, Hitler, Mao Zedong, Roosevelt and Truman (all high-ranking freemasons). He examines the magic rites of freemasonry and traces their origins. The reader is shown the real reasons behind several major wars and revolutions, from the French Revolution in 1789 through the Gulf War in 1990 and the bombing of Serbia in 1999. Finally the author reveals how these evil forces manifest themselves today and what plans they have for the future of mankind. This book exposes many dangerous myths and paints a different picture of the world, a picture, which may be less fair to behold, but which undoubtedly describes the real conditions we are faced with.", "comment_date": "2021-06-23T21:44:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manyord", "comment_text": "17k dislikes, u can tell how sad those Cnth people are", "comment_date": "2021-06-23T19:44:17Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "TumTuned", "comment_text": "Obama in 2015: &quot;The polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate!

The reason rich people often get the brunt of them is because of the influence their money grants them. Two average joes are pretty limited in how they can conspire, they might be able to conspire to rob a 7/11, or perhaps cheat a casino, or other such things. People worth billions have the resources and connections needed to do much more however.

Dismissing <i>everything</i> is just as harmful as schizo flat-earth reptilian overlord claims, perhaps even more so, as you are letting people get away with political and/or financial corruption.

See, conspiracy theories are not simply believed out of a lack of better explanations - but usually because people feel abandoned, exploited, disoriented, disempowered and meaningless. If you take a closer look, the theory does not just explain the world - it also describes the person agreeing to the description. You will find that conspiracy theories not only tell you something about all mighty, malevolent antagonists - but also about what it means for a human to &quot;recognize this truth&quot;, that is the conspiracy theory. The person who awakens to the reality of a conspiracy theory has suddenly regained some of the power they lost: they are no longer &quot;trapped in the matrix&quot;, they have overcome the &quot;brainwashing by the media&quot;, they see finally clear, where others are still trapped. In spreading the truth, they are the heroes in a war against the malevolent elite. The theory further tells you precisely who is to blame for your bad situation - without any ambiguity. In short: to accept a conspiracy theory can mean to regain power, orientation and meaning. Vice versa, to abandon the theory means to give up orientation, meaning and power. So when you&#39;re trying to talk someone out of it, it&#39;s not a matter presenting a reasonable argumentation - it&#39;s a matter of untethering their persona, killing their inner hero and having them face the ambiguous void that is reality.

Second, there could be an antidote pill that all rich people take, that makes the chemicals not work on them.<br><br>Again, in the case of cancer cure, you mention one example of ONE rich person dying to the most aggressive form of cancer. I am not claiming there is a cure for cancer, but rich people have access to health treatments completely unavailable even to wealthy people. Additionally, even though there is no conspiracy into hiding a cure for cancer, the market driven medical industry operates driven by one factor alone and that is profit. So they may not be hiding a cure for cancer, but they may not be looking (or looking hard enough) for one either.

Yet, not only they didn&#39;t take any steps to prevent it, but also used their political, economic, and communication means to present it as a fringe theory.<br><br>So instead of your criterion, I would propose an alternative. Can this theory be used as an allegory for something that is already happening? For instance, chem-trails would be a viable theory if they didn&#39;t have a better way to make us stupid and complicit. A mechanism that we even pay to install in our homes to tell us what to think and how we should react.

It doesn&#39;t prove such a  conspiracy theory but it does explain why it will endure and is to some extent rational, or at least not completely irrational. <br><br>The other reason they sometimes cannot be  dismissed offhand is that evidence to both prove or disprove it is suspiciously absent.

About as bad as trying to compare Pluto&#39;s stability with all planets against our moon in order to prove it&#39;s not a planet. An absolute waste of time.<br> As a disclaimer, I don&#39;t believe or even subscribe to these theories and would only argue them for the sake of arguing, as I am right now. Are all conspiracies wrong? Probably not.<br><br>Rich people die of cancer, yes. The issue with this theory is that the companies would lose money on the current treatment that would easily exploit rich people. Steve Jobs doesn&#39;t work in the medical field, so he only has so much control over it. There are many who would argue that even a truly healthy lifestyle with a fully balanced diet can help the body fight off cancers.<br><br>But that claim holds about as much water as the claim of rich people dying of cancer proving against your first issue.<br><br>Again, the idea that rich people breathing in the air is just as terrible of an argument as plenty of others. Rich people tend to support businesses that provide an asinine amount of pollution in the air and water. How often do we actually see them give a damn, even when said pollution isn&#39;t all that far from them, relatively speaking? A wind from a city nearby can bring a level of pollution to them at levels that can&#39;t be detected by our basic senses? <br><br>Not to mention, we see the &#39;trails&#39; aircraft leave behind sometimes. Much less than earlier on. How can we say there is none when these trails are what are being referred to?<br><br>The last one being an issues I&#39;ve had to repeat myself on over and over again, including on issues like planet X. Why do we still believe these things when they pretty much never happen? I guess people want to keep starting things!<br><br>But the fact is that we see these things as true because we (often times stretch to find these as truths by claiming something like Nostradamus predicted these) sometimes have no other explanation. Even if it can be argued, Mayan calanders seemingly perfectly mapped out many, many years in advance and just suddenly ended?<br><br>Several books and the Simpsons predicted covid 19, so it&#39;s gotta be true!<br><br>Christian bible predicts...<br><br>But anyways on to the argument of the rich! Yeah, their ignoring it doesn&#39;t mean a thing. As the song goes, ask a rich person any question and they will know their answers will be accepted as truth. We see plenty of business owners, CEOs, scientists, politicians, and the list can go on,  who often tend to step in an area they know far too little about because they have moments they think they understand more than they truly do. I will listen to those who know more, or even enough, but would never 100% trust what they say as truths. Nobody should. <br><br>After all, anything can happen and humans can have absolutely no control over it, because humans are what we are.

Every single one of your suggestions is so completely an example of a raw man argument that it almost feels insulting. Steve Jobs had a neuroendocrine tumor on his pancreas. This is highly treatable and the treatment could even be considered a cure. However, it wasn&#39;t the lack of treatment availability that prevented him from recovering, it was his own ego and his decision NOT to take the cure--he thought he could fix it himself. Hopefully, you see how irrelevant and foolish this makes item 1. There is no way of knowing how many rich/influential people have been cured of cancer with cures unavailable to the general public so your characterization is both false and ironic. The ideas behind chem-trails are largely misrepresented by your claims. Sure, the strange belief that chemtrails are doing population control is foolish, but the idea that chem-trails provide a realistic and useful means of reflecting sunlight that could have direct positive results for the outer layer of our magnetosphere is not unreasonable and would affect everyone. So you were foolish to pick a false argument for the second support of your theory. This leads us to number 3 which was your actual goal: an admirable attempt to ease fear. But the point of the matter is that the end of the world could be right around the corner and it would affect everyone. But lots of natural disasters that could occur from Global Climate Change have &quot;emergency&quot; plans accessible to the richest people. Entire bunkers stacked with food exist for the ultra-rich just in case. Again, your characterization of the conspiracy theory falls flat. You can do better than this.<br><br>Perhaps what you should attack is the notion of conspiracies with harmful intent. If you can explain how there is not as much malice in the world as some people (the one&#39;s with malice in them) think, the need for conspiratorial malice fails. Or perhaps you could attack the idea that no secret is safe if more than 1 person knows the truth. Surely if it is a real conspiracy, someone will expose it. There are lots of ways of attacking conspiracy theories, especially the foolish ones.

I think the fact that raw power was able to pull this off was most astounding to me: with the apparent thousands of people either participating or in the know- all benefiting in some way from the murder and destruction for which they all were culpable for. For the skeptics and ostriches- the evidence is out there, it just takes some diligence to find it to see  the 911 Commission deliberately covered up or outright omitted evidence, events and testimony that indicated government betrayal.

If Europe and America tells you that they love you, be careful. They love the wealth of your land. The oil and not the people.

GADDAFI WAS KILLED:\r<br>1. There is no electricity bill in Libya, electricity is free for all its citizens.\r<br>2. There is no interest on loans, banks in Libya are state-owned and loans given to all its citizens are at a 0% interest by law.\r<br>3. Home is considered a human right in Libya. Gaddafi vowed that his parents would not get a house until everyone in Libya had a\r<br>home.\r<br>4. All newlyweds in Libya receive $60,000 Dinars (US$50,000) from the government to buy their first apartment.\r<br>5. Education and medical treatments are free in Libya. Before Gaddafi, only 25% of Libyans were literates. Today, the figure stands at 83%.\r<br>6. Libyans taking up farming as a career, they received farm land, a farming house, equipment, seeds and livestock to kick- start their farms \u2013 all for free.\r<br>7. If Libyans cannot find the education or medical facilities they needed in Libya, the government funded them to go abroad for it.\r<br>8. In Gaddafi&#39;s Libya, if a Libyan buys a car, the government subsidized 50% of the price.\r<br>9. The price of petrol in Libya is $0. 14 per liter.\r<br>10. Libya has no external debt and its reserves amount to $150 billion \u2013 now frozen globally.\r<br>11. If a Libyan is unable to get employment after graduation, the state would pay the average salary of the profession as if he or she is employed until employment is found.\r<br>12. A portion of Libyan oil sale is credited directly to the bank accounts of all Libyan citizens.\r<br>13. A mother who gave birth to a child under Gaddafi, received US $5,000 as child benefit upfront.\r<br>14. 40 loaves of bread in Libya costs $ 0.15\r<br>15. 25% of Libyans have a university degree\r<br>16. Gaddafi carried out the world\u2019s largest irrigation project, known as the Great Man- Made River Project, to make water readily available throughout the desert country.\r<br>If this is called &quot;Dictatorship&quot;, I wonder what type of Leadership Democrats have!!\r<br>```", "comment_date": "2019-08-20T20:42:41Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Hi There", "comment_text": "The agenda on the table right now is the aggressive and oppressive Goverment pushed LGBT, furiously pumping out homosexual cartoons to preschoolers on TV, forcing mandatory LGBT &#39;lessons&#39; in public schools, (Oregon just banned all schoolbooks that don&#39;t have LGBT in them) Drag Queens invited by State Governers to Public Libraries to read to children, sponsored by the NFL and NBA...<br><br>Why is the Goverment pushing so hard to make this all look normal?

Cancer is a very devious decease, and science has really no clue as to why some people get cancer, more than it&#39;s in their DNA. Almost all living creatures on Earth can develop cancer tumors. It would undermine their whole business to disregard new methods of fighting this monster.  Rather so they are hunting for a cure in all corners of science to patent it and make more money, as they would do if they succeeded. <br>No, &quot;chemtrails&quot; are not a thing. Any hobby scientist can test the air themselves and check for particles in the air. Curiously thou, nature has done this for us - making chemtrails that is. It has been found that viruses and bacteria constantly travels around the world with the wind, in the upper layers of our own atmosphere, and rains down on us at all time.<br> <br>But yes, end might be near. Even NASA has confirmed that. And geologists. Historians.

One of the examples you came up with &quot;Adolphin&quot; doesn&#39;t even meet your criteria.  Does that mean you believe Adolphin is real?  Or, do you lack belief because it is illogical, has no evidence to support it, is highly improbable, and there is no historical precedent that lends credibility to the idea? <br><br><br><br>Second, the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is used as an ad hominem attack (specifically guilt by association) which only serves to reinforce the confirmation bias at the stage of gathering information.  This is every bit as ignorant as simply believing any wild an improbable claim you hear.  If we really want to combat outlandish conspiracy theories, why not educate people on how we can use reason to determine what is true?  Third, there is nothing wrong with speculation, as long as you accept it is speculation.  This is how we form hypotheses which can then be tested using the scientific method.  The problem is belief, especially zealous conviction, without any supporting evidence.  Again, not being willing to consider ideas is every bit as harmful as blindly accepting them. <br><br><br><br>Last, we act as if conspiracy is some absurd notion, even though there are plenty of evidence of actual conspiracies, and in other contexts we don&#39;t have the same level of skepticism (which would be special pleading).  If it is so absurd, why can one be charged with conspiracy to commit murder or conspiracy to defraud the government?  Isn&#39;t it logically inconsistent not to consider the possibility of one, but not the question the other? <br><br><br><br>As for conspiracies themselves, the official government&#39;s narrative of 9/11 meets the criteria of a conspiracy.  The definition of conspiracy is &quot;The act of two or more persons, called conspirators, working secretly to obtain some goal, usually understood with negative connotations.&quot;  Note that the negative connotation is not always necessary, or if present could depend on one&#39;s perspective.  This would mean the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is a known conspiracy, with nine co-conspirators being hung.  So would Watergate.  So would the entire scope of intelligence agencies such as the CIA or MI6.  Due to the obvious need for secrecy, the writing and signing of our declaration of independence meets the criteria of a conspiracy.  You can go back in history as far as you&#39;d like.... the assassination of Julius Caesar is a confirmed conspiracy. <br><br><br><br>Here are a few more conspiracies which have been proven: Operation GLADIO, Operation Mockingbird, COINTELPRO, Operation Northwoods, the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, the Bay of Pigs invasion, US Black sites and torture of detainees, the Bologna massacre, Operation Ocean Spray, the Iran Contra scandal, Operation Mongoose, the price fixing of diamonds by De Beers, the Dryfus affair, the Downing Street memo, ECHELON, the Enron scandal, Fast and Furious scandal, the creation of the Federal Reserve Act which passed in 1913, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, human trafficking, large pedophile networks which have been exposed, the Franklin scandal, widespread abuse of children from Catholic priests and the resulting coverup, Operation Ajax, Operation Cyclone, Operation Chaos, Operation Himmler, Operation Midnight Climax, Operation Paperclip, MKULTRA, Operation PBSUCCESS, the Pentagon papers, Operation Show White, the Phoebus cartel, the Pheonix program, Project FUBELT..... and on and on and on. <br><br><br><br>None of this is speculation; all of it is proven with evidence.  Considering the large amount of conspiracies which have been confirmed throughout history, it is idiotic to dismiss something on the basis of it being a conspiracy.  This is by far the least thought out and worst video you have ever made.  The aversion to the notion of conspiracy is anti-intellectual at best, and limits the range of acceptable thought at worst.

Now I&#39;ve grown up, a bit, I can see most of them for what they are, and it is quite apparent to me now, why they appeal to certain groups of people. <br>1. People who feel downtrodden or supressed, perhaps by domineering parents or other authority figures, develop a distrust of authority, and the &#39;status quo&#39;, and will often latch onto anything that might prove these figures wrong, and somehow elevate themselves, as being &#39;someone in the know&#39;.<br>2. People who have a strong emotional bias (prejudice) against a certain group, be they &#39;rich people&#39;, other races, people with certain sexual preferences, or, sometimes even the disabled, will, sometimes try to justify separation from these groups, by , somehow blaming them for any number of things, and will often embellish the truth, or even, make up, and propagate a story, or set of ideas specifically designed to justify their prejudice.<br>3. Mentally insecure or paranoid people can quite readily accept many conspiracy theories, because they will often seem to align with some of their own paranoid assumptions.<br>I have noticed, over many years, that someone who believes one conspiracy theory will generally entertain the lot, which really underlines the idea that belief in these theories is more an act of &#39;rebellion&#39; than the result of open minded analytical thought.

Yes, the holocaust happened - BUT was grossly misrepresented in comparison to the holocaust by Mao Zedong and was tightly linked to Catholicism (not reformed Christianity). Yes, the earth is round - BUT NASA has very many strange agendas one can assume is linked to the Freemason influence within the organization. 9/11 COULD HAVE BEEN an inside job, as there is a ton of evidence to support it with evidence also pointing to the idea that 9/11 was exactly what  Bush and his leaders would have wanted to have happen. What one needs to understand is the AGENDA of the ruling class, and more specifically, their value system or religion. The heaviest amount of evidence indicates that our leaders are certainly being influenced by corrupt bankers, politicians, and organizational leaders desperate for absolute power - who find it, ultimately, in the philosphy of Luciferianism, which is tightly linked to Hinduism. I&#39;ve been in the corporate world for years, and have seen the Hindu religion overtake MANY corporate leaders as their value system. How much more so for politicians. Once one accepts these truths, it opens up the door of assumption, because one can tie events back to the agenda that was proven with facts. These assumptions are then not ill-founded, but based in reality - but they should not be preached unapologetically unless proven with ACTUAL evidence. Look throughout history and understand that authority in every government eventually becomes corrupt.

These aren&#39;t shotgun barrel questions that prove someone is a nutter. It&#39;s just a few of the normal questions I ask myself. Ultimately the most foolproof ways of telling that people are full of shit are quite easy.<br><br>The truth is so easy to remember that it&#39;s forgettable and it <b>NEVER</b> results in emotional tirades if someone doesn&#39;t believe you aside from the annoyance that comes with trying to make people understand the <b>ACTUAL</b> truth when their &quot;truth&quot; is bark raving irrational nonsense. Even then think about it. Have any of you ever gotten angry whenever someone questioned something true that you believe? Nope. Never. Nor would you need to? If it&#39;s true then your opinion on the matter is irrelevant so there&#39;s no need to throw a hissy fit when you can&#39;t demonstrate your claim. For example, evolutionists may get annoyed trying to explain to creationists how creationism is garbage, we can even act smug but we don&#39;t care at the end of the day if the person we&#39;re talking to wakes up and smells the roses. There&#39;s a natural confidence that comes with being right.

It totally does by the way. People who don&#39;t care that people think they&#39;re nuts in my experience are usually doing so to protect their precious beliefs. People who care about truth <b>CARE</b> about whether or not people think they&#39;re crazy. People who are crazy need to act like it&#39;s everyone else who&#39;s nuts to make themselves feel good about chasing &quot;da troof!&quot; because if they realised what a ridiculous waste of time their &quot;investigations&quot; are then they&#39;d have to face those uncomfortable feels you get when you realise you&#39;re not actually smart, and you are in fact a buffoon who bought into utter nonsense getting conned by shiesters. So it&#39;s easier to just keep on keeping on as you keep the logic out.<br><br>People who care about the truth care about people thinking that they&#39;re nuts not for &quot;conformity&quot; but because we don&#39;t want to wind up insane! People who are full of shit care about only listening to those who tickle their ears because their claims can&#39;t stand up to everyone else&#39;s criticisms.

Now of course due to scientific study, we know climate change is very real and has very real, long-lasting effects. I&#39;m sure you would agree to this.

Usually, nobody has bad intentions but instead just selfish ones. So, if you consider the reality that people might be guided by selfish interests and possibly not even by more enlightened self interested values, you might see how easily people in such positions could do some terrible stuff.

Do not try to disclaim the absolute fact that governments, over time, become corrupt and do shady things. It has been this way throughout history and it didn&#39;t suddenly stop. Look a well versed psychiatrist in the face and tell them a psychopath couldn&#39;t make their way high into the ranks of the government. You know what they would do? Laugh in your face and say that psychopaths are in fact MORE LIKELY to succeed in moving up the ranks. They are very manipulative. Rethink your idea of conspiracy theories. They are not all without validity. Look up CEO&#39;s and psychopaths, you&#39;ll find some interesting things. They get their way, and they are phenomenal at bullshitting through life to get everything they want.", "comment_date": "2017-03-11T01:11:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "The Heavy Hearts Show", "comment_text": "Chemtrails may not be a thing, but fluoride is.

Did 3 steel and concrete buildings fall only slightly slower than free fall speed when only 2 of them were hit by planes and all were designed to withstand the impact of planes? Was NORAD which had 100% accuracy of interception prior to 9/11 practicing for a drill of the exact event that was happening?

Many independent studies has proven the THC in marijuana is a really effective killer of cancer cells, there was even a dude who had some cannabis oil and created his own treatment, couple weeks later, cancer was gone.

This isn&#39;t apparent yet, though I&#39;ll put my tinfoil hat on and speculate that is we assume it is true they wanted him dead, they wanted Apple to collapse, as every time he left Apple in the past, it started to fail, and almost went bankrupt in the late 90&#39;s btw, every time it was Steve jobs return that saved the company. With him unable to return, the company will then be doomed to fail, and it&#39;s already observable by their profit margins not growing for the first time since 2001 (that&#39;s 15 years of profit always being higher than the previous years, and they acquired some companies in this time I think) so Apple is indeed starting to collapse", "comment_date": "2016-12-10T06:37:20Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "Chrstphre Campbell", "comment_text": "This makes the entirely false assumption that the &#39;rich&#39; people are in control of world affairs.

Most of the topics are hugely important and deserve to be thought about and analyzed thoroughly. Neglecting to look at some topics, just because it is not confirmed by mass media yet and labeling it as conspiracy theory, is not really helpful and doesn\u2019t do much more than building a barrier between healthy curiosity and the daring of seeking information though not confirmed from institutions yet. <br>On the other hand, breaking these complex topics down on to a scenario of a few puppet masters, who control the whole world, is just as unthoughtful as the conspiracy-theory-phobia. Believing in a few bad guys who stamp on the na\u00efve world habitants, is dangerous as it doesn\u2019t allow the mind to go to the core of a problem and to analyze it through. Also it causes a state of fear and helplessness in the viewer\u2019s mind, which doesn\u2019t help with the process of resolving problematic topics at all, but just causes powerlessness. <br>I see, some addressed topics in the conspiracy theory debate, more as actual problems deriving from complex dynamics. A French sociologist and philosopher Michel Foucault has an interesting theory about discourses. I really would engage both parties- Conspiracy theory spreaders and conspiracy theory phobics- to look up his literature and get a feeling of how twisted this stuff really can be.

This only makes sense though if only a few rich and famous people die of cancer, and not if the amount of rich people who die is proportional to less rich people who die.<br><br><br>\u00a0Also, it&#39;s possible that a very select few hold the secret to a cancer cure, and so no-one really notices that they don&#39;t die, but it would be extremely difficult to keep a cure for cancer known to a select few. Also, there&#39;s probably no one cure for cancer.<br><br>Finally, with the doomsday thing, the argument assumes rational agents. There are plenty of people in the world who would think that causing the apocalypse would be the right thing, either through mental illness, delusion, being deceived or a very different world view. For example, some Christians think that they have a role in fulfilling Biblical prophecy and bringing about the end times, and it&#39;s not a stretch to think that eco-terrorists or a dictator could also want to bring about an apocalypse/extinction of humans/destruction of enemies.<br><br><br>\u00a0Obviously the video does say their rebuttal only works for some theories, but I just thought I&#39;d mention a few things that I thought of while watching the video.", "comment_date": "2016-06-24T06:03:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Doe", "comment_text": "It should be does it affect powerful people negatively.

Cannabinoids found in marijuana are more effective, less destructive, and far cheaper, than radiation and chemotherapy. Of course, surgically removing the cancer first, when possible is the best course of action. You cannot patent a plant, but you could synthesize and patent its compounds, if cost effective. Cancer is caused by chromosomal damage by toxins, disease, and/or radiation. When the right gene of DNA is damaged, it triggers cells to reproduce wildly causing tumors, and the cancerous cells get spread through the body via the bloodstream.  CBD and THC used in conjunction, triggers the &quot;off switch&quot; of the epigenome for that particular gene, and effectively prevents and reverses cancer. Radiation and chemo are used in the hopes that more radiation will destroy that gene in all the cancerous cells. The problem is that it damages the rest of your DNA along with it, ages your tissues drastically, and makes cancer more likely to occur in other parts of the body. But hey, that just promotes job security for oncologists. Healthcare in the US is more about creating dependent customers than curing disease. Like radiation and chemotherapy, cannabis oil treatment is no guarantee. Unlike radiation, it can&#39;t be targeted at a specific area and localized. What is challenging is making sure it works on all the cancerous cells faster than the tumors spread, but the same applies to chemo. There&#39;s a limit to how saturated with THC and CBD your blood can get, but there&#39;s no limit to radiation exposure. At a certain point, the radiation will kill you faster than the cancer though. If it doesn&#39;t cure you, you just made your final days miserably excruciating. If you beat the cancer, you still destroyed your health and shortened the life of your organs. There is no money in cannabis oil for big pharma, because you can grow and make it yourself. This isn&#39;t myth at all, but thoroughly proven science. Instead, pharmaceutical companies are investing R&amp;D into immunotherapy treatments to get your body&#39;s immune system to target and attack tumorous cells.

I&#39;ve been watching the videos on this channel for a couple weeks now and I&#39;ve noticed some traits of said videos that I really enjoy: 1) A humanitarian approach: I find most if not all of your videos contain a positive, uplifting message 2) Proof, proof, proof: the professionals your team refers to always pass my (albeit brief and unprofessional) investigation into their credibility 3) A focus on enlightening and bringing together both the audience and humanity as a whole. <br>Great traits to have in your videos and the main reason I keep coming back. With that being said I was EXTREMELY disappointed by the utter lack of these 3 things and the dismissive attitude towards the message contained behind it. Although I do agree that the internet is a breeding ground for ignorance, and that almost everything on it should be taken with a large dose of skepticism, it is clearly not always the case. Would it be true to say your channel is proliferating ignorance? No, quite the opposite right?. Remember that the internet is also a source for otherwise overlooked or unavailable but incredibly useful information. Also please note the amount of legislature and government policy trying to control the internet.<br>Next, I was not fan of the: &quot;Does it affect the rich/powerful&quot; approach. How is that a reasonable starting platform for this kind of discussion? Those are EXACTLY the type of people who could easily hide, scapegoat or otherwise assume plausible deniability. Example: How do you know that the president/world leaders are aware of something such as chemtrails? There are plenty of doctors, scientists, aviation experts, chemists etc who work for wealthy but not humanitarian concerned companies. It&#39;s just as likely that Obama is in same boat as we are in terms of enforced ignorance. I mean, lets be honest, money rules the world, not the people we call our leaders. How much more likely is someone to kill someone else quietly for money rather than most other reasons? And how many times in our past have we had world leaders come to us preaching about their ignorance to mass genocide, drug abuse in their political parties etc? Now I&#39;m not saying I know the answers or that the crew at Kurzgesagt is wrong, in fact there&#39;s a great chance that you&#39;re right but COME ON.

Literally everyone has cancer cells in their body. The disease we call cancer occurs when those cancer cells that already exist experience a malfunction in their division mechanisms that causes them to divide uncontrollably. Although it is true that there is no profit in curing cancer, and in our society if you cant make money from it, it simply won&#39;t happen. It&#39;s just a product of the system we live in.<br>2 - The chemtrails thing is hard to gather data for because the atmosphere is too big, so it&#39;s impossible to determine where harmful chemicals in the air come from with our current technology. Until there is some way to gather reliable data on the subject, we should just withhold judgment.<br>3 - Various people have been claiming the world was going to end for literally all of humanity&#39;s history. If the world as we know it were to end, it wouldn&#39;t be because of some evil secret cabal. It would likely be due to a computer glitch that causes an accidental nuclear exchange, or maybe we&#39;re just too stupid to change our energy generation methods and allow the Earth to continue to heat until the ocean currents shut down (Thus shutting down delivery of oxygenated water from the surface to the bottom of the ocean), causing anaerobic bacteria at the seafloor to bloom and release poisonous gases that would wipe out probably 99% of life on Earth. This has happened once before. Even if a nuclear exchange occurs where every nuclear weapon on Earth was triggered, humanity would still survive, though just barely. The second scenario is the only real end of the world scenario with a considerable likelihood of happening that we know of right now.<br><br>One thing I will say is that it&#39;s not a stretch of the mind to think that powerful people might come together and make a plan, but that plan doesn&#39;t include ending the world. One cannot make money off of a dead world. Instead, those with power tend to act to maintain and expand that power. The difference between now and the empires of the past is that powerful people no longer attempt to win the world by conquest, instead choosing to take the world through financial means. It&#39;s much easier, cheaper, better for public relations, and easier to hide because the system itself is always there as a scapegoat. Is this really going on right now? Hard to say.

It is just economical, it doesn&#39;t make sense for the company that provides a service to cure you of needing that service.  Let alone put millions into research, to simply loose money.  So investing in cure&#39;s isn&#39;t beneficial, there are cures invented by people or small company, but needing millions to go though testing is impossible.  My family actually owns a patient on a cure that has cured 99% of brain cancer in dogs, and we can market it for animals.  In order to give it to a person although requires, not just millions, but years of testing.  So Steve Jobs finds out he has cancer, it&#39;s already too late. Any cure he would want to use is not authorized and tested, and most human tests last at least years, which he would be long died. Just google cure cancer in animals, it isn&#39;t very difficult.  Not just my family, there are many cures out there in animal stage, but getting into the human stage of testing is normally too expensive. So that isn&#39;t really a conspiracy, the drug company&#39;s aren&#39;t destroying cures or making sure they don&#39;t come up, they just aren&#39;t funding them.

All of these crackpot theories about chemtrails, global warming, water fluoridation, and so on are getting in the way of having an actual discussion about real, concerning issues. &quot;Conspiracy Theories&quot; have become such a polarizing subject that NOBODY will set aside their discomfort with the matter to get to the bottom of it. Conspiracy Theories range from the outright ridiculous to the superficially compelling. Some are elaborate hoaxes, and others are obviously just satirical. The ones people are most concerned with have some fractional value of truth to it. There&#39;s bound to be a level of baseless speculation and intellectual dishonesty mixed into them, but the important question is why they attract so many people. I see this a lot, and no matter how intellectual or scientific, people will simply assume some personal element about their world view, or construct a terrifying image of toxic stupidity to collectively alienate them. There is no effort to understand anything here. In fact, just bringing up the lapse in understanding makes people uncomfortable. Here&#39;s my take. Most people will buy into something that sounds good. They&#39;ll eventually realize it was stupid and move on. Some people, however, develop an ideology that&#39;s validated by some aspect of the conspiracy theories. This ideology gives the person emotional and moral support, and if you&#39;ve heard of the YouTuber Sargon of Akkad, he recently made a video named The Ideological Lens explaining this phenomena. I think this is part of it. At least a significant part of the conspiracy theory culture. What people refuse to consider is that the shear volume of conspiracy theorist drivel is drowning out whatever legitimate facts or concerns lay just outside of them. People will build a mental wall whenever they hear a certain meme, and they paint everything on the other side of that wall with the same brush. The vice here is in a lack of discussion. So, at the end of the day, &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; was a term developed by the CIA to obscure and desaturate the discussion of controversial subjects.", "comment_date": "2016-03-18T16:32:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ergo Gray", "comment_text": "This is completely flawed use of logic. Using the first example for instance, a cure for cancer I shall show why. It is stated since Jobs died of cancer and he was rich therefore a conspiracy cannot exist. But what is the scale of wealth in the world, in the scheme of the world Jobs may have been rich but not wealthy. Did he own half a country like the queen of england does and lease it out? Can he trace his wealth back hundreds of years and manipulate countries like the rothschilds have. The answer is NO! Just because a basketball player is a millionaire and rich, he gets his paycheck signed by the owner of the team who is wealthy. Therefore Jobs was expendable having fulfilled his purpose; and since most of the world is poor by relative standards they lack perspective to know the difference of what rich and wealthy is. Therefore a cure may exist for only a few. And this is a good thing too since the world is dangerously overpopulated and can barely support life now, doubling the amount of v-idiots like the ones who made this video would be a true catastrophe.

But, let&#39;s try this one out:<br><br>Conspiracy theory:  The rich in the United States are manipulating their government to provide themselves with greater loopholes in tax code, and prolong correction of these issues.<br><br>Proof: The general sales tax has spiked from nothing in 1920 to 13.5% on all goods in some locations.  It is now deemed acceptable to tax infrastructure maintenance through the construction of toll roads.  Certain sections of the police force are graded on performance by the number of tickets they hand out on a daily/weekly basis.  Thees are all examples of taxation after the government has already taken its designated share of an individual&#39;s paycheck, and each more severely affects the middle class/poor than it does those with a larger disposable income.  The reason the government has been doing this is because over the last ~50 years, the richest 1% (those that have a household income of 500,000 annually or higher) have reduced their effective tax rate from 60% to nearly ~20%, if loopholes such as &quot;tax credits&quot; are factored into their funds.  <br><br>According to this video, since it involves the rich, it is false.  I understand that the rich and powerful are popular targets for conspiracy theories, but there&#39;s a reason for that.  The average and the poor don&#39;t exactly have the economic power necessary to orchestrate what many of these theories claim.  However, instead of making foolish assumptions like this video encourages, why not teach people about Occam&#39;s Razor and its potential applications to theories, since it was designed for theoretical discussion in the first place?", "comment_date": "2016-02-24T08:13:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dragon gundam", "comment_text": "the imperiale star destroyer", "comment_date": "2016-02-24T00:17:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elijah Budd", "comment_text": "But there&#39;s a conspiracy that Steve Jobs is still alive.

Of course you would ask, how could this conspiracy be true? I say it is because members of Big Pharma are the elite part not the whole elite part of the society. Pig pharma are milking money from people with medication that have only partial effect against certain ailments.

I&#39;ll correct you on all 3 of these conspiracies that were deemed untrue. First, steve jobs yes, he might have been rich but that doesnt mean that all rich people automatically have the information on the cure for cancer, and just because they have money doesnt mean they can go bribe a doctor or something. First of all, these secrets are held by the elite secret societies and bloodlines of the world and even though co-founder of Apple, Steve Wozniak was part of the Free Masons, Steve Jobs was not...And this &quot;cure&quot; doesnt just completely rid the cancer if your body is already being taken by the disease, but there are remedies known as &quot;cell salts&quot; and if you cleanse your body regularly with these salts, it is one definite way to prevent your body from contracting cancer. The second one mentioned is chemtrails and this one you obviously had no idea in what you were talking about. Chemtrails arent about people breathing in anything, Different chemicals and metals are laid in criss-cross patterns in the sky in different parts of the world to help aid HAARP in manipulating the weather. Chemtrails are basically creating the use of weaponized weather. And lastly, the whole apocalyptic thing, of course there are many ways we can completely destroy all of humanity, its actually quite a known thing, and if you look at the &quot;doomsday clock&quot; right now we are running a very high risk in catastrophic disaster. From nanotechnology viruses, to nulclear warfare, and much more, a lot of which can be set off by the powers the control the world in order to wipe out billions for population control.

How the fuck do you think you can keep a conspiracy that would involve thousands of very different people, from very different cultures, in very different institutions and in very nations nations, from not leaking a single devastating memo? And these are types of conspiracies that would be rather easy to prove too, if they were real.

No, corporations does not work that irrationally.<br>Also, what about all the personal incentives of key people.

When you see it for what it is, politicians, kings, etc. rules the application of the tools devised by scientists, especially things like nukes. For scientists to describe politics and conspiracy purely on a logical basis is foolish since it is a system mainly designed on human morality and a desire fueled largely by culture and emotion. Things of which formulas tend to entirely fail to describe yet they govern so much of our existence and science itself. As much as science pretends to have the answers, in regards to things like war, it is nothing but the tool in which creates all the nifty ways to kill people. A true political question for the scientist should be why do you continue to produce for politicians after so much evidence that it is used for wrong? Therein lies the truth, scientist are nothing but humans with passions and desires and conspiracies are nothing more than corruption and lies, human attributes seen since childhood in all people. To pretend as if these characteristics are some how vanquished once adulthood is reached and suits are worn is comedic. When you truly understand the lack of love and heartlessness a human being is capable of you realize the reality of the world around you. The world is not simply the universe around us but the evil that also resides in us and the way in which it expresses itself. TO ignore the human condition is to fear it and avoid the truth about it, thus the reason most scientist discredit conspiracies and look out the window instead of in their own house.", "comment_date": "2015-11-03T01:53:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Albert Flasher", "comment_text": "this video is ignorant and false", "comment_date": "2015-11-03T01:04:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Metford Frost", "comment_text": "theory:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 suburban areas are breeding grounds for the illuminati.

People can accomplish more, with less difficulty working together, pooling resources, than each individual can separately.<br>2.  Any large project initiative that stands to change anything will inevitably be met with opposition by those who currently have a vested interest in that something not changing - if they know about it.  Therefore, the less the general public knows about any given endeavor, the less opposition it will be met with, and, consequently, the easier it will be to accomplish.<br><br>3. Therefore, there will inevitably be groups of people working together to further common interests, as secretively as they can manage.  And that is the definition of conspiracy.<br>4.  Therefore, the world is rife with conspiracies, inevitably.  Simple logical extrapolation from self-evident premises tells us this.  We don&#39;t need to know any &quot;secret facts.&quot;<br><br>5.  Why anyone should consider &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; to be a derogatory term is beyond me.  I can think of no good reason why humans should not theorize about the conspiracies.  We theorize about everything else, as well we should.  These &quot;theories&quot; are actually more often hypotheses, at least at first, and are the foundations of investigation.  And investigation is the foundation of progress, the bedrock of science, without which we have little more than baseless imaginative belief.<br>6.  So, if you come across in your life a set of data that seems like counter-evidence to what you have been told, something that raises the proverbial &quot;red flags&quot; in your mind, try to figure out what&#39;s going on.  You will be made to feel stupid for doing so, call names like &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; and &quot;tinfoil hat wearer.&quot;  But that is because the people doing so ARE stupid.  Too stupid to grasp that to question and hypothesize is a virtue, not a vice.<br><br>So, here&#39;s a &#39;kurzgesagt&#39; little conspiracy hypothesis for you:  It is nearly always in the interest of those who hold power to hinder the disempowered form understanding the nature - the structures and mechanisms - of the power, lest they should seek to take it unto themselves.  Therefore, they do what they can to stigmatize efforts to understand the aspects of reality that too closely relate to human power.  Economics and politics, for example.<br>    Humans, as social creatures, are very sensitive to ostracism, so the vast majority are eager to adopt the mindset they perceive to be the majority mind-set, whatever it may be, in order to better fit in.  They jostle together in groups of self-confirming ideologues, and scoff at the endeavors of the intellectually more courageous.  The mediocrity of normalcy is their high ideal.<br>   So, in my opinion, even the proponents of the theories that are flat out mistaken - as many of them are - are(as long as they are earnest) far more intellectually courageous and morally virtuous than the cowards who scoff - bankrupt of any virtue of their own - nudge each other in the ribs, and try to pretend that scoffing makes them superior.", "comment_date": "2015-10-31T13:34:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harald Segebrecht", "comment_text": "Does the NSA spy on rich people?

There are plenty of examples of WARRANTED conspiracy theories, but my favorite is the Reichstag fire. I&#39;ll compare this to a less plausible one, say, faking the moon landing.<br><br>First, let&#39;s look at the logistics. The Reichstag fire only needed a handful of people and a shoestring budget to pull off. Faking the moon landing would need at least tens of thousands of people, and the costs would be astronomical. NASA and the Feds would go bankrupt trying. The lunar rock samples would take decades to falsify, and filming would need a soundstage orders of magnitude bigger than any known vacuum chamber.<br><br>Second, is this the easiest way? If not, why was this chosen over an easier way? Also, WHO BENEFITS AND AT WHAT PRICE? The Nazis had the incentive of scapegoating the German communists and it&#39;s hard to imagine an easier way to do it. As for the moon landing, faking it could have given the Feds something to show for NASA&#39;s work, but the simpler option was to JUST LAND ON THE GODDAMN MOON! Also, Richard Nixon has been dead for decades, so it&#39;s hard to imagine someone currently in power benefiting from fooling Americans into thinking we really landed on the moon once.<br><br>Third of all, does belief in this conspiracy theory require the conspirators to be highly intelligent, impeccably competent, well-funded, grossly wasteful, horrifically incompetent, and bone stupid all at the same time? Case in point: Chemtrails. This would need a government that fits all these conditions all at once. High-altitude spraying of chemicals to drug people would have no effect--the concentrations might as well be homeopathic.

Just because a famous rich person dies from cancer doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that there aren&#39;t potentially viable, yet unorthodox, cancer treatments out there that don&#39;t see the light of day due to the difficult nature of powerful pharmaceutical corporations and highly-collusive government personnel (especially within the FDA).<br><br>Now I&#39;m all for debunking conspiracy theories that don&#39;t have any grounding, but the cancer thing was handled terribly. There are definitely a few treatments out there that are swept under the rug by the actions of pharmaceutical corporations. A really interesting documentary called &quot;Burzynski&quot; surfaced a few years ago which attested to this, as well as various medical marijuana documentaries that touch on this.<br><br>While this debunking method is ostensibly solid, it only works for the most inane of conspiracy theories. The short video doesn&#39;t take into account the nature of bureaucracy and the role of money, powerful people, and the media in protecting profit. Actual conspiracies do occur in this way. A now famous example (thanks to the documentary &#39;Cosmos&#39;), was the leaded gasoline industry back in the day. Claire Patterson had strong evidence that leaded gasoline was simply awful for people, but instead of acknowledging this and reworking gasoline for the public good, the gas giants destroyed his reputation, pulled his funding, and fought him tooth and nail to obscure the truth. Again, there are numerous examples of real conspiracies throughout history. Am I saying there&#39;s a magic pill locked up somewhere? No, that would be jumping to conclusions. Not smart...<br><br>...I&#39;m saying, powerful corporations have the ability and incentive (obviously) to protect their own interest, and this video overlooks this entirely in its oversimplification of the conspiracy debunking process. It takes much more information than a simple &quot;does it affect rich and powerful people?&quot; to put conspiracies to rest. I mean Hitler&#39;s own men attempted to assassinate him, JFK&#39;s initial death explanation made zero sense, and the U.S. government has been proven to be responsible for the death of MLK. These examples, among many others should tell people how non-credible the &quot;rich and powerful&quot; argument really is. The &quot;rich and powerful&quot; simply can&#39;t be viewed as a single cohesive group in this context, because some conspiracies are corporation/agency-specific, and then beyond that, corporations and government agencies have heavy chain of command, as well, and things that are on a need-to-know basis.

What about simply withholding information, all leaders of all cultures and all time withhold information from the people they govern with out a doubt, so why is this not a conspiracy? It depends on what you define a conspiracy. If you define witholding information a conspiracy than there are and have always been conspiracies. If anyone does any\u00a0research about chem trails the reason they are spraying is to attempt to fix the detrimental effects of global warming and if the government institutions told people about the actual state of our world&#39;s bad health there would undoubtably be a mass panic, so this information is withheld, is that a conspiracy? Not really, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that until 2001 or 2002, the condensation trails are dramatically different from the 90s, adults over 25 notice this contrast more because people under 25 were not\u00a0conscious in the 90s to remember the way normal condensation trails looked.

But it&#39;s not some new world order, or triangles in a music video (artists put those in their videos simply because it makes more people want to watch them). The conspiracy I&#39;m talking about is big compaines controlling government. It only makes sense. Political parties and politicians need money for their campaigns, which cost a lot of money. So compaines and wealthy people will donate money to the politicians. In turn the parties and politicians will do what the people who donated the money to them, ask them to. That&#39;s how you get situations like the U.S spending completely ridiculous amounts of money on the Military. We&#39;re not defending our country, I mean seriously, how is a group called the &quot;Islamic State in Iraq and Syria&quot; a threat to America? It&#39;s &quot;IRAQ AND SYRIA&quot; not &quot;Iraq, Syria and America&quot;.  And it&#39;s not that we can&#39;t &quot;turn a blind eye&quot; to the whole ISIS thing. Why can we &quot;not turn a blind eye&quot; to that, but we can turn a blind eye to hunger, killing 21,000 people EVERY DAY, when it would be both cheaper and save Millions more lives to &quot;not turn a blind eye&quot; to hunger? It&#39;s because big companies and rich people can&#39;t benefit from feeding starving people, but companies can benefit from the U.S spending billillions of dollars buying their guns, tanks, knives, cars, medical supplies, helicopters, planes, missiles, the list goes on and on.  So what happens, is these companies pay off the right people, (mostly congressmen) and the U.S will spend millions and billions of dollars buying their products. To the companies it&#39;s a great investment, spend some money bribing the right people, and get millions if not billions of dollars back on your investment, from the money the government is now spending buying your products. Also, I would like to say, that not all conspiracy theriosts are people who think the moon is a quantum alien mind control illuminati space lizard, and I hate those people because they give conspiracy theorists a bad name.

Yes, there are some people who are incredibly wealthy and also have a great deal of power and seem to get their way with what ever they want all around the planet.
