We can increase Mars&#39; magnetosphere by adding more satellites to it, or somehow increasing the gravitational pull of its current satellites. Here&#39;s a simple equation to show how it works. We currently see this relationship with Juptier&#39;s satellites, although it&#39;s the other way around because Jupiter&#39;s gravity is warming the cores of its satellites and in Mars&#39; case we need to warm Mars by adding more gravitational pull to it. In layman&#39;s terms, satellites = gravitational pull = tectonic plate pull = friction = heat = liquid core = magnetosphere = protection from solar wind and an atmosphere will not get blown away.
