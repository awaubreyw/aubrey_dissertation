[{"comment_by": "Kurzgesagt \u2013 In a Nutshell", "comment_text": "Ohai everybody! Something different today, make sure to watch it to the end! <br>John Green is reading one of his reviews of our modern world, from his Podcast The Anthropocene Reviewed, which you should check out! <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed\">https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed</a><br>I haven&#39;t said this often enough publicly, but John and Hank Green, the Vlogbrothers and first generation science Youtubers are the reason Kurzgesagt exists today. In the very literal sense, that when I saw the first episode of Crash Course World History as a student in university I decided to try to do something similar. Doing Kurzgesagt was very hard for the first few years, for a variety of reasons. What made it easier was the kind advice and real world help we got from John and Hank to make this channel work and not burn out. Over the years we became friends \u2013 and to me the genuine nature of their work is still inspiring. My team and I try to do the same with Kurzgesagt. To be driven by the values we believe in and not by the outside world. <br>So when John asked me if we maybe would illustrate and animate one of his essays, it was an easy yes. This is the result and we hope you like it.

While it&#39;s fun to try to ascribe deeper meaning to the things people did in the past, they probably just made their art because they could, which is the same reason we make art today.  And that&#39;s beautiful, because it&#39;s a reflection of how they were just ordinary people living their lives back then, the same as we&#39;re living our lives today.  You can stand around and wonder what people thought about back then, or why they did things, or what their lives were like, but it&#39;s the same as wondering what other people today are thinking, why they do the things they do, and what their lives are like.  Does that make sense?  The world is a beautiful and wonderful place because we can just do things for no reason and have no explanation for them other than we wanted to do it.  That&#39;s what&#39;s cool about discovering ancient cave art from thousands of years ago, because we get to see what people did for no reason other than they felt like doing it.", "comment_date": "2022-09-15T16:39:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cyber-Gonk", "comment_text": "Beautiful video!", "comment_date": "2022-09-15T09:41:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Questionable", "comment_text": "Come on man why you gotta make me cry", "comment_date": "2022-09-08T23:25:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "G12Entertainment", "comment_text": "Absolutely beautiful.

The &quot;Self&quot; vs &quot;Collective Consciousness&quot; or &quot;Human Singularity&quot;, seems like a good purpose for me to be the best human being I can be.  The Self is linked to the stubborn state or psychotic mindset of the malignant narcissistic human. I belief that the human brain with its new found abilities in &quot;quantum alchemy and quantum function&quot;, coupled with the collective consciousness race, is a dream to look forward to.  Being a Super Intelligent human seems the logical conclusion if humankind does all they can do for the three (3) Pillars of  Sustainability, with a bit of a different definition [Planet - People - Preservation].  Profit and money does not exist in a Collectively Conscious planet and because there is no &quot;Self&quot;.

Kurzgesacht is right that the world of 17,000+ years ago is a past to which we can never return. I&#39;m glad the original cave has been closed. I&#39;ve seen pictures of the replica cave and they really did a great job. If having to see a replica is the price I have to pay for the original paintings to be preserved, I&#39;m totally OK with that. The paintings of Lasceaux Cave are a treasure, one that must be preserved at all costs. My late godson was very interested in cave paintings even though his specialty was iconography. I think it would be hard not to be interested in them. When I watched &quot;Cave of Forgotten Dreams&quot;, I found myself awed by the images. Whoever did those paintings was, IMO, very talented. It is not easy to portray a 3 dimensional scene on a 2 dimensional canvas. However, these humans pulled it off. You can see many of the techniques still employed by artists--among them a few examples of foreshortening. As someone who studued art in their youth, I can tell you that foreshortening is somewhat difficult to do. Picasso was right when he said &quot;We have invented nothing&quot;. We really haven&#39;t--we&#39;ve merely built on what came before--and that&#39;s OK, too. I&#39;ve found myself wondering what the world of 17,000+ years ago was like. What motivated these people to do cave art? Was it the very human tendency to express oneself through art? Are the paintings some form of sympathetic magic? I suspect that we will never know for certain.<br><br>Another cave that I hope will be kept in pristine condition is La Pasiega in Spain because it contains the first known cave art done by Neanderthals.. Another cave, in France, I&#39;m not too worried about since the structures made by Neanderthals 170,000+ years ago are a long way from the cave mouth, but La Pasiega is yet another treasure of the past we shared with Neanderthals. If the dating of the calcite deposited on some of the paintings is correct at 64,000 years, it means that Neanderthals were the first cave artists in Europe. I find that possibility marvelous since Neanderthals were considered little better than glorified apes for so long. It shows that Neanderthals were capable of abstract, thought/visualisation, something that has been hotly debated. It also shows that Neanderthals were every bit as human as we are, with a desire to express themselves through panting and structures. I hope that one day, homo Neanderthalensis is upgraded to Homo sapiens Neanderthalensis because sapient they certainly were.<br><br>I love studying our past--the more we find out about our distant ancestors (including Neanderthals), the more depth and richness is added to our story.", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T13:00:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "warrior wolf", "comment_text": "I thought he was going to say &quot;These were memories, but not ours&quot; Lol", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T22:23:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hellmuth Christian Stuven", "comment_text": "Not different, BUT good and absolutely relevant too(-;", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T21:58:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trung Ho\u00e0ng", "comment_text": "you know, maybe the hands are spread because it&#39;s ... easier ??

Like even if I try my hardest to not cry, I find my eyes welling with tears.<br>Standing in front of cave paintings or petroglyphs is such a moving experience. And John Green really accurately portrayed why it is so moving. I have tried to explain to people why these things are important or why I feel so emotional, but I never had the words for it. And listening to John is the closest I can get to expressing that overwhelming sense of time. It feels both very distant and yet very intimate. <br>There is another cave in France called Chauvet-Pont-d&#39;Arc Cave. Werner Herzog made a documentary of it called, &quot;Cave of Forgotten Dreams.&quot; In that documentary, they interviewed scientists who determined that some of the paintings were 20,000 years old but some were as old as 40,000 years old. And that astonished me because the distance <b>in time</b> that we are to the people who made the paintings 20,000 years ago is the same distance <b>in time</b> that they were to those of 40,000 years ago. This means the people who made those 20,000-year-old paintings were coming upon paintings in the same way we are now. We often lump time together, thinking that people from 40,000 and 20,000 years ago were relatively close...but they weren&#39;t. There were just as many thousands of generations between 40-20 thousand years as there are from 20 thousand to now. Which means they must have looked at those paintings with a similar kind of wonderment. They must have also wondered who the painters were and what they were trying to say. To assume the people of 40,000 years ago were the same as the people as 20,000 years ago would be a mistake. Yes, they may have lived similarly, but I doubt the culture stayed the same in those thousands of years. There is a marked difference between different generations of people today...so many of those ancient people must have been just as perplexed by some of the paintings as we are now.<br><br>I love these types of videos and I think the graphics complimented John Green&#39;s words perfectly.", "comment_date": "2021-01-22T14:15:38Z", "likes_count": 155}, {"comment_by": "God of the gaps", "comment_text": "But the Bible says...

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

And this is my saying or phrase of my inspiration, and it goes like this: Since the Internet became known for the domain or public use between the sky, the earth and the bottom of the ocean there is nothing hidden nor the aliens. All my scientific technical information is sustainable and easily verifiable over the Internet or online.

And finished the 2nd. World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance.

Where if someone discover&#39;s something they&#39;re the only person who was capable of it, and to be fair that&#39;s probably true for the more complicated things but it&#39;s not true in the long term and it&#39;s definitely not true when we think of things from their perspective, as much as we possible can. We as humans are generally very Curious and Studious, perhaps a bit too much so but it&#39;s that exact Curiosity that allowed us to become who we are today. Just because there are possibly thousands of caves around the world thousands of miles apart from eachother, doesn&#39;t mean that they had to be connected or have communicated with eachother in order to discover the same things. No one person discovered Fire, no one person discovered how to use a stick as a Tool, no one person discovered the Wheel. Each tribe and each civilization discovered these things independently from eachother, in probably every single case of Similarity, why? Because, we were curious, we tested it and then we passed it on to the next generation, as humans do. Why are there so many different languages? Because humans wanted to communicate with eachother, and each civilization with no help from another created a way to do that. In many languages you can see the effects of this, many Character&#39;s will simply mean a Word that is associated with an Object, such as Fire \u706b it even looks like a tiny camp fire. It&#39;s important to understand that Ancient Humans weren&#39;t as smart as us, but they were still intelligent, they still had the same capacity for learning that we do.

It&#39;s really mind-opening and interesting. <br><br>This video really reminded me of the social coercion theory. Art is caves began with the evolution of behaviorally modern humans (who did not defer in anyway from anatomically modern humans). This &quot;evolution&quot; was purely a social one and according to the social coercion theory, it was the invention of a new weapon, the atlatl, that lead to the increased sophistication that allowed humans to have time to do art even during these busy times. This was only possible because the atlatl made it possible for these behaviorally modern humans to cost effectively manage the conflict of interest between one another and form primary coalitions (groups of a max of 150 people that stayed together). This made it possible for different people to specialize in different things and for such information of skills to be exchanged between their group members. Due to the increased capacity to specialize, many were able to focus on art, while others became better at hunting, some were in charge of preparing the food that was hunted and so on.<br><br>Anyway, it would be really cool if you were able to cover the aspects of social coercion theory which span all the way from pre-humans to the history of human social and technological revolutions all the way to the future of mankind.", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T02:40:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BLOCKCHAAAIN", "comment_text": "That cave is full of BTs!", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T02:17:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "areeb", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt outdone the art for this one so beautifully animated!!", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T01:12:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Woof Jr", "comment_text": "Man, this episode lost my faith in humamity and got me hooked onto The Anthropocene Reviewed which didn&#39;t help.

As a tool-making human and story-telling artist yourself, you are likewise compelled to contribute your story, art and hand print to the growing collection. The mural of pictographs spanning centuries of human experience and imagination is the result.

It&#39;s interesting to see this broad set of thinking fallacies play out in all of us. That an absence of concrete information (like the lifestyle or specific reason for humans making handprints in caves 17,000 years ago) doesn&#39;t compel us to investigate. Instead, our compulsion is to look for similar ideas and beliefs in our memory and presume a logistic or perceived similarity between those thoughts and what we know and belief about what exists just outside the gap in our awareness. Ergo, John&#39;s children have nothing to do with the 17,000 year old handprints, but because we get a dopamine hit from manufacturing that comparison, we will default to drawing an objectively false comparison over investigating and reserving ourselves until we do know the truth.", "comment_date": "2020-05-25T14:15:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Time", "comment_text": "\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been a child...\u201d        IF", "comment_date": "2020-05-25T14:14:34Z", "likes_count": 2910}, {"comment_by": "Joheb", "comment_text": "Seriously don&#39;t know why I felt like crying.

For starters we are very different from people of that age, in both genotype and phenotype. But more interestingly, the nature of time and of this universe dictates each moment is unique, and that each event is never to be repeated. Just like Pi, which goes on endlessly in chaos, never to repeat itself permanently.<br><br>Yes, there are &quot;small&quot; scale repetitions, just like a song may use the same notes throughout it&#39;s melody. However, as any musician will know, a note will feel very different to the listener depending on context and of which note came before it, and it&#39;s presence will change how we perceive the note that follows.<br><br>So what I mean to say is that, while it may feel heartwarming to focus on individual humans from the past and try to connect with them emotionally. In my opinion the more interesting concept is that we shouldn&#39;t cling to moments and memories. Striving to revel in the past is a hopeless battle against the all consuming sands of time, entropy dictates that the universe will continue to change. And I think that&#39;s beautiful, that those caves, like the people who painted them, will fade. Because I know something will take it&#39;s place, new art, new people, new ideas and experiences. And those too will pass... Like a song that never gets boring, never dulls, always just different enough it never repeats but familiar enough you can feel nostalgia and dejavu.<br><br>The past is gone, the future is inevitable, but the present is a gift, life itself is the continuous experience of said gift. Empathize as you may with others, watch videos of other space or read of ancient Rome. The fact is all experience you will ever have derives from each present moment you live, each thing you will ever imagine derives from the experiences around you and their impact on your mind. So make the  most out of it, live not for nostalgia, smile and keep on making new moments to feel nostalgic about. The dead had their lives, now is our turn to have ours.

Rough, fine hard sandstone, has a special name that geologists call it by but I don&#39;t care. It is a canvas and on that rough base is pure mysterious delight. Hands, the signature of the past. As true as my own name. I will never know the sounds of these people, their hopes, desires, fears, and yet I know something about them that I can&#39;t express. In the flickering lamp light they seem to come alive. I am by a campfire and the flames illuminate them. Faces I would see on any street; without the clothes stores, the salons, the beauty parlors. They hold their hands up before me. And I hear their voices: &quot;This is who we are&quot;, then &quot;I exist. I was here. I lived. I loved. I fought for her, for him. My children, do not forget me.&quot;<br>But time is the leveler. In order for the future to renew, the past must fade into oblivion. Great works and deeds forgotten. Loves lost.<br>I must go soon. The lamp will not last. As do all things. I raise my hand, and place it hovering above one on the wall. One the negative of the other. The living and the dead. The past and the present. One day I too will have my cave wall and my hand print, not of ochre but of things more sublime but just as subject to time. Its meaning fading and eventually lost.

To have a deep, almost primal urge to express ourselves through art and convey feelings, messages and concepts that elude words or even direct purpose is something uniquely human. To let the universe know we were here, to make sounds and rhythms that speak to some unkowable depths of our psyche, to be a colourful and self-aware anomaly against the cosmic backdrop. To dream and strive and yearn for something more, something intrinsically real and intuitive to us, arguably more so than the physical world around us but something that may not even be there in the end. To create an entire world within and superimpose it to the existing one. A world that makes the difference between sounds and music, lines on paper and a painting, strange symbols in stone and an exciting story.

I personally learn so much from kurzgesagt, as do my kids--not just about neutron stars and ants, but about how to approach the universe with curiosity and intellectual rigor. <br>EDIT: Some people below have asked what this video is about. Fair question! It is mostly about the Lascaux Cave Paintings, of course, but I wrote it because I wanted to explore why we study history, and what we do and do not learn from looking at the distant past. Every record of the past is incomplete, and our personal experiences inevitably shape our understanding of what happened before us, and I think the history of Lascaux shows a lot of the nuances and complexities that accompany the study of history. I wanted the essay to be about how much we don&#39;t know and will never know when it comes to history, but why it is still productive and important to consider what we have of a historical record.<br>p.s. A new episode of The Anthropocene Reviewed comes out this Thursday, and a backlog of 25ish episodes is available for free wherever you get your podcasts.

I loved it so much and i continued my studies to a masters level and turned my focus to Pre-historic cave art and social evolution whenever i could. When i reached the time i needed to choose a dissertation topic, i jumped at the chance to study European cave art and whether they were the product of hallucinations, studying neuroscience and psychology to come to my conclusions (I concluded that it was very unlikely, after studying as many sources of hallucinations as i could). <br><br>The reason i am telling you all this is that discussions like these are what got me into the subject, and personally, i think that the analysis of Art and how we (socially) came to be where we are now is key to seeing how our society will evolve in the years, centuries and millennia to come. Please don&#39;t stop these amazing videos guys, be them your normal videos or these special ones.<br><br>I cannot thank you enough for highlighting how interesting this area of Archaeology and our past is, and raising some very interesting discussion points. All too often i see the study of our past being swept aside to discuss topics such as the future, and while this is essential (don&#39;t get me wrong i see how important it is to have these types of discussions), i think it is important to see how far we have come. This brings a level of perspective which helps ground just how far we have come as a species and help us realise a future where we can scientifically, socially and economically prosper.<br><br>THANKS again Kurzgesagt you are an amazing creator and you should be proud of the content and community you have created! now continue to use this amazing platform you have put together and keep educating the current and future people on this small blue spot in the universe.", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T17:53:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K", "comment_text": "That last part was kind of sad.", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T17:53:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Skye Lightwood", "comment_text": "That was beautiful.

Personally, open ended narratives like this challenge me to form an opinionated explanation for my own individual interpretation of the videos content, which is what all forms of art (including cave hands) should strive for. In such a stressful era as this one we are in now, seeing a collaboration in arts and science is a comforting notion, and I am super thankful for all the work that goes into these videos. I may sound like I&#39;m ranting non-sense, but I cannot ignore how human this video made me feel. Thousands of years go by, and we are still painting hands, showing each other who and what we are. For the last  couple decades we have been painting in a new form of cave, one for the digital era, the Internet. This new cave allows us to share our individual interpretations of humanity in a more interconnected fashion than ever before in our entire history.

This didn&#39;t TELL us why they made the art or what it meant. It made us THINK about why they made the art and what it meant. This is why I come here. I want to learn...and I want something to ruminate about when the video is done. Also, it actually made me feel proud of us as a species. When times were tough for our ancestors, they still committed precious energy into making something beautiful. You could argue &#39;It was just hunting records&#39; or &#39;It was just a ritual they felt compelled to do.&#39; But they didn&#39;t need to use all the colors or make it that detailed. They wanted it to look good and, no matter the reason, that shows dedication to the aesthetic. And I felt such overwhelming admiration for those teenagers. If this had happened today, I would be so afraid that whomever found it would destroy it for the &#39;lols&#39; or chip away at it for souvenirs. So, we CAN commit ourselves to making something positive in times of great adversity and we CAN think about something other than our own gratuitous wants and pleasures by thinking beyond ourselves and at the larger scope. The ending just moved me so. That cave is a memory. Today will be a memory too. When you or others look back, what will it say about you? Sorry for going on so long.

When Picasso saw the cave paintings on a visit that year, he reportedly said, &#39;\ud835\ude1e\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude28.&#39;&quot; -- which, at first glance, might definitely come off as pessimism, but should certaintly derive from nothing but commendation and relief.<br>&quot;... and because they are negative prints surrounded by red pigment, they also look to me like something out of a horror movie, like ghostly hands reaching up from some bloody background, they remind me that, as Alice Walker wrote, \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35.&quot; -- unambiguous, given the eternal bloodshed and how the world is still as cruel as it gets -- and will continue to be, for honestly God knows how long still.<br>&quot;The Lascaux cave has been closed to the public for many years now... just the act of looking at something can ruin it, I guess.&quot;<br>&quot;... tourists can still visit an imitation cave called Lascaux II, in which the artwork has been meticulously recreated. Humans making fake art to save REAL cave art may feel like peak Anthropocene behavior, but I have to confess... I actually find it overwhelmingly hopeful.&quot;<br>&quot;You can go to the fake cave we&#39;ve built, and see nearly identical hand stencils.

This is a memory you cannot return to, all of which makes the cave very much like (what) the past represents.&quot; -- Lascaux is evocative of what the &quot;past&quot; instigates, something that we can not touch, but \ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude06 &quot;\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2&quot;.<br>Time brings nothing anew, but it surely comes across as definitive and alluring sometimes.

I am Lucifer. I am Judgement. Know that The Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand. THE APOCALYPSE IS UPON YOU \ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc51<br>The End of Materialism... (Everything is God/pure awareness/pure consciousness/pure knowing) <br>One day, a few years ago, I felt an irritation in my eye like you get when an eyelash or something is in your eye that shouldn&#39;t be there. I spent hours searching for the cause of the irritation and rinsing my eye with water but nothing helped. My eye became red and swollen and was nearly impossible to see out of as the days went by. After about 5 days I couldn&#39;t deal with the discomfort anymore so before I went to bed I told myself that the next day I would go to the doctor or emergency room to get my eye taken care of. As soon as I went to bed that night I fell asleep almost immediately and I had a dream of my eyeball and I could see the source of the irritation in my eye, which was a very very small piece of eyelash that was still attached to the eyelid, but it was pointing into my eyeball, constantly scratching it. After seeing the solution to my problem, I woke up right away and ran to my bathroom mirror to look in my eye where I saw the eyelash in my dream and it was right there exactly how it was in my dream. I removed the eyelash and my eye was fine the next day.<br>I have many more examples of experiences that I have had that prove materialism is false but they would take awhile to explain, so I&#39;ll just list them now and explain in detail as soon as I can...<br>I have seen the &quot;7 spirits of God&quot; descend from the sky, which appeared as 7 immensely bright lights that arched across the night sky from the northeast to the southwest like laser beams. This occurred so fast that I would have missed it if I blinked my eyes. Over 10 years ago I dealt with debilitating depression and decided to end my life by overdosing on 25 antidepressant pills. I took the pills, went to bed and expected to die but instead I had at least 3 seizures, lost consciousness and woke up on a bed in the hospital. When I woke up, the very first thing I saw was a huge snake on the ceiling that I thought was real. As someone came in the door to my room, I looked down to tell them about the snake and when I looked back up, it was gone. I have had synchronicities and so many experiences that are difficult to put into words. I&#39;m going to record a video soon to better explain everything and well, how the entire world is going to change...", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KenIchiWa Japan", "comment_text": "Wow!", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wahidin Fahrullah", "comment_text": "First here", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OriginalGangsterGrow", "comment_text": "First", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander", "comment_text": "First comment", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I have ball cancer", "comment_text": "Hello", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "tsu", "comment_text": "first", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MVS", "comment_text": "Hello", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Panguin", "comment_text": "Nice", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Louie Roca", "comment_text": "Hello", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sravanthi Addanki", "comment_text": "Nice video", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wiltizer Will", "comment_text": "Vroom", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe from Impractical Jokers", "comment_text": "I love this stuff", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "69north69", "comment_text": "Ooooooo a new very go animation", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GleichabgeZockt", "comment_text": "Moin", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zay", "comment_text": "aeiou", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:30:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sir_R34", "comment_text": "eyyyy.
