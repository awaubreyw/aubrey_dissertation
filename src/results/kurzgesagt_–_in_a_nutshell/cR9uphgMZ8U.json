Triton refused to get out of Neptune&#39;s way, and Triton&#39;s brother said &quot;Triton, he&#39;s WAY bigger than us, maybe we should move.&quot; &quot;NO BROTHER, THIS WILL BE ONE OF OUR GREATEST ADVENTURES, TAKING ON A PLANET!&quot; Triton replied. It was too late. Neptune&#39;s gravity had affected the connection between Triton and his brother. &quot;BROTHER! NO! Please Neptune! I beg you to release me!&quot; &quot;NOPE, YOU WILL ORBIT ME UNTIL YOU BECOME A RING SYSTEM AS BIG AS SATURN&#39;S, OR UNTIL YOU CRASH INTO ME!&quot; Neptune shouted at Triton.
