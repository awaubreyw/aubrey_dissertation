The light is focused through the eyes and provides vision. Stars flicker occasionally by the same electricity that the body does. The earth itself is the contact point for our body&#39;s positive side charge. The air is our negative contact point. The air and earth come into constant contact with each other daily, causing a complete circuit and earth heart beat. Bioluminescence is in the living inhabitants and the atmosphere. Density as well as, electrical conductivity changes in the body causes heart and sight problems. Remember at the universal level; voltages are high enough in human hairs to cause baldness, so bone density stability is how electricity passes through the heart. The medical world can keep a heart pumping artificially when bone density flops: Though the voltages of Jesus are rare.

He said the body produces your full bodyweight in ATP every day, and for a lot of people I feel like their brains will reject this information because they don&#39;t understand it and can&#39;t believe it, now, I have no former schooling on the topic so lets get that out in front as a disclaimer, but based on what I know about the world as a whole and the laws of physics as they are, this must mean the ATP particle is extremely recyclable, meaning your body is just moving these pieces around very rapidly to perform the tasks needed, this probably also means that the particle doesn&#39;t have a strong bond so it&#39;s easy to break it apart or fuse it up together, the chemical bonds require very little energy to make, I don&#39;t know why they are so easy to build though. But they are, they have to be or we couldn&#39;t make so many of them every day, all the time.<br><br>So in conclusion your body isn&#39;t just spontaneously generating new matter to make ATP with, it&#39;s just prodigiously good at recycling.", "comment_date": "2021-02-08T08:49:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Hotel Val Sinestra", "comment_text": "last words \u201cnani?\u201d \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d may he rest in peace", "comment_date": "2021-02-08T06:32:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ExplosivPotato", "comment_text": "&quot;Why are you alive&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>BECAUSE I WAS BORN", "comment_date": "2021-02-08T03:51:22Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "R3Ked", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t mind me, just saving <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QImCld9YubE&amp;t=5m10s\">5:10</a> for later", "comment_date": "2021-02-08T03:49:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IB_M1", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QImCld9YubE&amp;t=07m00s\">07:00</a> firebending!", "comment_date": "2021-02-08T00:51:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RandomGuyOnTheWeb", "comment_text": "waht if i reach the bottom o", "comment_date": "2021-02-08T00:50:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blaze404", "comment_text": "What would happen if I walked to the bottom of the escalator", "comment_date": "2021-02-07T17:32:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Numero7 Mojeangering", "comment_text": "With the current technologies, is it possible to create a molecular contraption that replicates it self ?", "comment_date": "2021-02-07T16:21:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fault3k", "comment_text": "ah yes, calling it a dead universe really reveals your inner optimism", "comment_date": "2021-02-07T15:41:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fault3k", "comment_text": "&quot;the universe wants you to die&quot;<br><br>okay, good video", "comment_date": "2021-02-07T15:32:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "charanomdeekshi", "comment_text": "While many are talking about anime betrayal at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QImCld9YubE&amp;t=7m42s\">7:42</a> we get a sentence from Avengers Infinity war and the subtitles saying as &quot; Teaser of kurzgesagt: Science war, coming in 2021", "comment_date": "2021-02-07T08:53:41Z", "likes_count": 48}, {"comment_by": "Pork", "comment_text": "Yooo that escalator imagery was a lot like the movie \u201cSoul\u201d", "comment_date": "2021-02-07T06:04:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N4tefish", "comment_text": "What happens if you reach the bottom of the escalator are you cancer?", "comment_date": "2021-02-07T03:51:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Blue Phoenix: Captain Gamer", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QImCld9YubE&amp;t=2m32s\">2:32</a><br>If you look closely, a bird just got hit by a pendulum he threw.

But chemicals don\u2019t have emotions or consciousness like we do. Oxygen that we breathe in don\u2019t have emotion, the food (veg and non veg) we eat don\u2019t have emotion ( I am talking about the dead flesh of animals not the animals when they were alive here) but once we take it in it becomes us and it gains emotion and consciousness. Here in India we have many practices that helps one to experience life as it is and appreciate it. In west it\u2019s called spirituality. Unfortunately now a days people only depends on one part of their intelligence which is intellect or their survival instinct, we are same as animal basically we born, grow reproduce and die it\u2019s just happened to be that because of our sharp intellect we manage to smoother this process with various levels of comfort but that\u2019s what we do at the end of the day. And the person who thinks that that\u2019s all one should do then sorry mate u are no better than an animal. For a human it\u2019s more than the materialistic goals. One more thing universe isn\u2019t dead that\u2019s completely wrong, if universe were to be dead living would have never came into existence, u weren\u2019t delivered by a stroke or born out of thin air, u were born out of human a living being.

Also, I wasn&#39;t satisfied with their description of the mitochondria or ATP.<br><br>I would have preferred Kurzgesagt to elaborate on the inside-out origin for the eukaryotic cell. Basically the acquisition of the mitochondria occurred along side two other traits common to all eukaryotic cells; the nuclear membrane and the golgi apparatus/endoplasmic reticulum. Bacteria don&#39;t have any of these 3. The model suggests that the nuclear membrane was the original bacterial/archaeal membrane and that the outer cellular membrane came after. Which is evidenced by the continuous bi lipid membrane between the nuclear membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum, which are connected at the nuclear pore of the nuclear membrane. Basically, the first eukaryotes would have begun extending their cell membrane from the nuclear pore to form a number of other superfluous structures, likely growing around the first alphaproteobacteria that would become the mitochondria, rather than &quot;eating&quot; it, and the cellular membrane would have come after neatly tidying it all up. The evidence implies however that all three of these may have occurred in a single event. <br><br>Also, they could have elaborated on how ATP or adenosine triphosphate is really just an adenosine nucleoside with 3 phosphates popped on. And that there are 2 forms of phosphorylation that occur within the cell. ATP -&gt; ADP, and ADP -&gt; AMP. Almost like a redundant power system built into the cell. <br><br>Also, mitochondria don&#39;t just produce CO2, water and energy. They produce a number of reactive oxygen species and free radicals too, like carbon monoxide or nitrogen dioxide, albeit in very small amounts, but that these byproducts contribute to aging and mitochondrial disease. They really are like little car engines that operate at 50 degrees celcius and spewing out fumes, and unlike most organelles which are fixed in place by the cellular cytoskeleton, mitochondria constantly wriggle around the cell in between the cytoskeletal mesh holding everything together. <br><br>Finally, this would probably require a second video, but they mentioned the first cells coming together and I would really love a video on the nuclear geyser model for abiogenesis, which is the most likely model for the origins of life. It combines the best parts of the hydrothermal vent model and the shallow pool model and suggests that the ambient radiation of a freshly accreting Earth provided the ambient energy required for the light sensitive reactions required for the synthesis of lipids, amino acids and nucleosides (which really are just different arrangements of the same stuff, hence ATP being just one of those nucleotides except with phosphates popped onto it) as heavier materials settled in the Earth&#39;s mantle pushing up water, hydroden cyanide and hydrogen sulfide. All volatile materials found in meteor rock and that occur alongside water in space. Along with phosphates which is where the hydrothermal vents come in. But ATP actually occurs naturally in hydrothermal vents, and evolved in a many step process that started with the NADH+ metabolism present in most bacteria, but how mitochondria basically added 4 extra steps onto this 6 step process, totaling 10 in order to triple the efficiency of converting sugar into ATP. The video lumps all of these steps together, but in reality they likely occurred billions of years apart from each other. There has been more time between the evolution of the first cell and the evolution of the mitochondria, then there has been between the first amoeba and the first human. <br><br>Technically hydrocarbons are just improperly combusted amine and carboxyl groups. Its not just any amino acids that occur in living systems. Its the simplest ones. And once you can see the chemistry of it, its actually not that surprising at all that self assembling systems were able to form on their own. Cell membranes are basically liquid crystals, and proteins are basically polymer crystals after all. Lipids form micelles without external intervention. A lot like oil. And pure amino acids actually crystallize into dipolar structures with really interesting electrical properties. Not at all what most people would expect for the building blocks of life. <br><br>Even a video on the codon language would be interesting, and the properties of each amino acid. Amino acids generally fall into one of 4 groups; basic, acidic, polar and non polar. Basically the main properties that determine the function of an amino acid are what hydrogen/hydroxide groups are present and where. With all of this put into context it becomes a lot easier to visualize a cell as a random product of evolution rather than something that&#39;s meticulously designed. In reality the earliest proteins were probably just random residues and natural selection refined the rest from there. But a protein consisting of hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of amino acids may only have 2 or 3 amino acids serving as a functional site for catalyzing chemical reactions while the rest of them are there for structure.

At the end he says \u201cthe dead universe.\u201d I truly do not believe that 19th century dogma that was invented to rationalize a world without a creator. This universe grew us like a tree grows a fruit. We are a hyper concentrated point of conscious experience, this gives rise to the idea that the self is something separate from the rest of the universe. But it isn\u2019t. At all. We can not exist as living beings without an external environment to support that living being. Death is considered horrible to the individual; but as we are living proof lol...death hasn\u2019t occurred in billions of years. Form has changed. Perspective has changed. But life has never been dead. And the same \u201cdead\u201d universe gave rise to the emergent complexity of living beings. To me this indicates that the universe that grows things such as mind and rationality and love and everything else in between...must at its ground state, be all those things itself. Because we ARE the entirety of the universe experiencing a very small and concentrated temporal event. We call them lives. But they are not separate from anything whatsoever. And they could not occur in a universe that\u2019s \u201cdead.\u201d Quite the contrary; this universe is absolutely a living one. You are the proof of that. We don\u2019t need to disparage ourselves or victimize ourselves for the sake of denying the probable truth...YOU are all that exists.

Mentioning before it that &quot;&#39;some cells made sugar, some cells ate those cells&#39;... and some cells ate the cells that ate the sugar making cells&quot; or something similar... because as far as my understanding of this event goes, the idea is that the cells that eventually became mitochondria were cells that made ATP from sugar but did not make sugar via photosynthesis themselves. The endocytosis of the cells that could make sure via photosynthesis is what gave the universe chloroplasts and plants. The animation tries to show that it is not one of the sugar making cells itself that gets eaten, but I feel like another sentence or two in there could have helped clarify it. <br><br>This is an extraordinarily complicated subject that is challenging to study from a research perspective, let alone distill down to a cute and colorful video.

You should be aware that there are certain phrases which are commonly used and imply unbelief. The believers also use them, but without realizing their implications. We shall explain three of the most important of them.<br>   The First: <br>   &quot;Causes create this.&quot;<br>   The Second: <br>   &quot;It forms itself; it comes into existence and later ceases to exist.&quot;<br>   The Third: <br>   &quot;It is natural; Nature necessitates and creates it.&quot;<br>   Indeed, since beings exist and this cannot be denied, and since each being comes into existence in a wise and artistic fashion, and since each is not outside time but is being continuously renewed, then, O falsifier of the truth, you are bound to say either that the causes in the world create beings, for example, this animal; that is to say, it comes into existence through the coming together of causes, or that it forms itself, or that its coming into existence is a requirement and necessary effect of Nature, or that it is created through the power of One All-Powerful and All-Glorious. Since reason can find no way apart from these four, if the first three are definitely proved to be impossible, invalid and absurd, the way of Divine Unity, which is the fourth way, will necessarily and self-evidently and without doubt or suspicion, be proved true.<br>   THE FIRST WAY <br>   This to imagine that the formation and existence of things, creatures, occurs through the coming together of the causes in the universe. We shall mention only three of its numerous impossibilities.<br>   First Impossibility <br>   Imagine there is a pharmacy in which there are hundreds of jars and phials filled with quite different substances. A living potion and a living remedy are required from those medicaments. So we go to the pharmacy and see that they are to be found there in abundance, yet in great variety. We examine each of the potions and see that the ingredients have been taken in varying but precise amounts from each of the jars and phials, one ounce from this, three from that, seven from the next, and so on. If one ounce too much or too little had been taken, the potion would not have been living and would not have displayed its special quality. Next, we study the living remedy. Again, the ingredients have been taken from the jars in a particular measure so that if even the most minute amount too much or too little had been taken, the remedy would have lost its special property.<br>   Now, although the jars number more than fifty, the ingredients have been taken from each according to measures and amounts that are all different. Is it in any way possible or probable that the phials and jars should have been knocked over by a strange coincidence or sudden gust of wind and that only the precise, though different, amounts that had been taken from each of them should have been spilt, and then arranged themselves and come together to form the remedy? Is there anything more superstitious, impossible and absurd than this? If an ass could speak, it would say: &quot;I cannot accept this idea!&quot;, and would gallop off!<br>   Similarly, each living being may be likened to the living potion in the comparison, and each plant to a living remedy. For they are composed of matter that has been taken in most precise measure from truly numerous and truly various substances. If these are attributed to causes and the elements and it is claimed, &quot;Causes created these,&quot; it is unreasonable, impossible and absurd a hundred times over, just as it was to claim that the potion in the pharmacy came into existence through the phials being knocked over; by accident.<br>   In Short: <br>   The vital substances in this vast pharmacy of the universe, which are measured on the scales of Divine Determining and Decree of the All-Wise and Pre-Eternal One, can only come into existence through a boundless wisdom, infinite knowledge and all-encompassing will. The unfortunate person who declares that they are the work of blind, deaf and innumerable elements and causes and natures, which stream like floods; and the foolish, delirious person who claims that that wondrous remedy poured itself out when the phials were knocked over and formed itself, are certainly unreasonable and nonsensical. Indeed, such denial and unbelief is a senseless absurdity.<br>   THE SECOND WAY <br>   This is expressed by the phrase &quot;It forms itself.&quot; It too involves many impossibilities and is absurd and impossible in many aspects. We shall explain three examples of these impossibilities.<br>   First Impossibility <br>   O you obstinate denier! Your egotism has made you so stupid that somehow you decide to accept a hundred impossibilities all at once. For you yourself are a being and not some simple substance that is inanimate and unchanging. You are like an extremely well-ordered machine that is constantly being renewed and a wonderful palace that is undergoing continuous change. Particles are working unceasingly in your body. Your body has a connection and mutual relations with the universe, in particular with regard to sustenance and the perpetuation of the species, and the particles that work within it are careful not to spoil that relationship nor to break the connection. In this cautious manner they set about their work, as though taking the whole universe into account. Seeing your relationships within it, they take up their positions accordingly. And you benefit with your external and inner senses in accordance with the wonderful positions that they take.    If you do not accept that the particles in your body are tiny officials in motion in accordance with the law of the Pre-Eternal and All-Powerful One, or that they are an army, or the nibs of the pen of Divine Determining, with each particle as the nib of a pen, or that they are points inscribed by the pen of Power with each particle being a point, then in every particle working in your eye there would have to be an eye such as could see every limb and part of your body as well as the entire universe, with which you are connected. In addition to this, you would have to ascribe to each particle an intelligence equivalent to that of a hundred geniuses, sufficient to know and recognize all your past and your future, and your forbears and descendants, the origins of all the elements of your being, and the sources of all your sustenance.<br>   To attribute the knowledge and consciousness of a thousand Plato&#39;s to a single particle of one such as you who does not possess even a particle&#39;s worth of intelligence in matters of this kind is a crazy superstition a thousand times over!<br>   THE THIRD WAY <br>   &quot;Nature necessitates it; Nature makes it.&quot; This statement contains many impossibilities. We shall mention three of them by way of examples.<br>   First Impossibility <br>   If the art and creativity, which are discerning and wise, to be seen in beings and particularly in animate beings are not attributed to the pen of Divine Determining and Power of the Pre-Eternal Sun, and instead are attributed to Nature and force, which are blind, deaf and unthinking, it becomes necessary that Nature either should have present in everything machines and printing-presses for their creation, or should include in everything power and wisdom enough to create and administer the universe. The reason for this is as follows:<br>   The sun&#39;s manifestations and reflections appear in all small fragments of glass and droplets on the face of the earth. If those miniature, reflected imaginary suns are not ascribed to the sun in the sky, it is necessary to accept the external existence of an actual sun in every tiny fragment of glass smaller than a match-head, which possesses the sun&#39;s qualities and which, though small in size, bears profound meaning; and therefore to accept actual suns to the number of pieces of glass.<br>   In exactly the same way, if beings and animate creatures are not attributed directly to the manifestation of the Pre-Eternal Sun&#39;s Names, it becomes neciessary to accept that in each being, and especially animate beings, there lies a nature, a force, or quite simply a god that will sustain an infinite power and will, and knowledge and wisdom. Such an idea is the most absurd and superstitious of all the impossibilities in the universe. It demonstrates that a man who attributes the art of the Creator of the universe to imaginary, insignificant, unconscious Nature is without a doubt less conscious of the truth than an animal.<br>Risale-i Nur Collection 174 -<br>Author :Bedi\u00fczzaman Said Nurs\u00ee", "comment_date": "2020-05-16T16:10:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Medrese", "comment_text": "SEVENTH FLASH <br>   Look! With little difficulty you can see the seals of the Single, Eternally Besought One on the page of the earth, so raise your head, open your eyes, and look too at the great book of the universe. You will see that on it as a whole a stamp of unity is read out which is as clear as it is big. For like the components of a factory or members of a palace or town, these beings support one another, stretch out their hands to assist one another, and answer the needs and requests of one another, saying: &quot;Here I am, at your service!&quot; Assisting one another, they work together in order. Joining efforts, they serve animate beings. Co-operating and turned a single goal, they obey an All-Wise Disposer. They conform to a rule of mutual assistance which is in force from the sun and moon, night and day, and winter and summer, to plants coming to the assistance of hungry and needy animals, and animals hastening to the assistance of weak, noble men, and even nutritious substances flying to assist delicate, weak infants and fruits, and particles of food passing to the assistance of the cells of the body. They show to anyone who is not altogether blind that they are acting through the strength of a single, most generous Nurturer, and at the command of a single most wise Disposer.<br>   Thus, on the one hand this mutual support and assistance, this answering one another&#39;s needs, this mutual embracing, this subjugation, this order, testify decisively that beings are administered and organized by a single Disposer and are being impelled and directed by a single Nurturer. And on the other hand, this perfect grace within the universal wisdom to be seen plainly in the art of things; and the all-embracing mercy which shines within the providence; and the sustenance spread over that mercy and scattered so as to answer the needs of all living beings needy for sustenance; -these form a stamp of Divine unity so brilliant that anyone whose mind is not altogether extinguished will understand it and anyone who is not altogether blind will see it.<br>   Yes, a veil of wisdom demonstrating intention, consciousness, and will, has covered the whole universe, and upon that veil of wisdom has been spread a veil of grace and favour exhibiting beneficence, adornment, embellishment, and benevolence; and over that adorned veil of favour a garment of mercy displaying flashes of making known and loved, of bestowal and the granting of gifts has enveloped the universe; and spread over that illuminated veil of universal mercy is a table of general provisions showing kindness and bestowal and benevolence and perfect compassion and fine nurturing and dominical favour.<br>   Yes, all beings from particles to suns, whether individuals or species, or large or small, have been clothed in a magnificent shirt of wisdom embroidered with fruits and aims, benefits and purposes. And over the wisdom-displaying shirt, a garment of favour embroidered with flowers of grace and beneficence has been cut out in accordance with the stature of things; and over that ornamented garment of favour, a general table of sustenance has been set up, lit up with flashes of love, bestowal, affection, and the granting of gifts, to which the decorations of mercy have been attached, and which, together with bestowing those illuminated and jewel-encrusted decorations, is sufficient for all the groups of living beings on the face of the earth, and meets all their needs. Thus, this matter points to an All-Glorious Provider Who is All-Wise, All-Generous, and All-Compassionate, and shows Him as clearly as the sun.<br>   Is that so? Is everything in need of sustenance?<br>   Yes, like individual beings are in need of sustenance and all the necessities to continue their lives, we see that all the beings in the world, and especially living beings, whether universal or particular, wholes or parts, have many desires and needs, material and otherwise, for their existence, their lives, and the continuation of their lives. But their wants and needs are for such things that their hands cannot reach the least of them and their power is insufficient for the smallest of them. Yet, we see that all their wishes and material and immaterial sustenance is given to them From where he could not imagine, {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 65:3.} from unhoped for places, with perfect order, at the appropriate time, in a suitable fashion, with perfect wisdom. And so, does this want and need of creatures and this manner of unseen help and assistance not show an All-Wise and Glorious Nurturer, an All-Compassionate Beauteous Disposer?<br>Risale-i Nur Collection Words - 309 Bedi\u00fczzaman Said Nursi (R. A)", "comment_date": "2020-05-16T16:10:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Medrese", "comment_text": "In every particle there are two truthful evidences to the existence and unity of the Necessarily Existent One. Indeed, by carrying out its important duties consciously and by raising mighty loads despite being powerless and lifeless, a particle bear decisive witness to the existence of the Necessarily Existent One. And by conforming to the universal order peculiar to each place it enters, and by settling anywhere as though it was its homeland, it testifies to the unity of the Necessarily Existent One and to the oneness of that Being Who is the Owner of all things, with their apparent faces and their inner aspects which look to Him. That is to say, whoever owns the particles must also own all the places it enters.<br>   Thus, since its loads are extremely heavy and its duties endless, the particle demonstrates that it is mobile and acting at the command of One Possessing Absolute Power, and in His name. And, the fact that it conforms as though knowingly to the universal order of the cosmos and enters each place without obstacle shows that it acts through the power and wisdom of a single Being Possessing Absolute Knowledge.<br>   A private soldier has relations with his squad, his company, his battalion, his regiment, and his division, and so on, and has duties in connection with each. Since he knows all those relations and duties, he will act in conformity with them. For, having received training and instruction under military discipline, he complies with the rules and regulations of a single supreme commander who commands all those sections.<br>   In the same way, all particles are suitably placed within compounds, and with every facet of the compounds have different beneficial relations and different well-regulated duties that yield wise results that are all different. It is therefore surely only One in the grasp of whose power is the whole universe who can place the particles in such a way as to preserve all their relations with and duties in all the facets of the compounds, and not spoil the wise results.<br>   For example, a particle located in Tevfik&#39;s {(*): The first scribe of the Risale-i Nur.} eye is suitably placed with regard to the blood-vessels like the arteries and veins, and the motor and sensory nerves, and has a wise and purposeful relationship with the face, and then with the head, the trunk, and with the entire human body, and has beneficial duties in relation to each. This demonstrates that only one who creates all the members of the body will be able to place the particle in that position.<br>   Particles entering the body as sustenance in the caravan of food in particular make their journey with astonishing order and wisdom. On their way, they pass through modes and stages in an orderly manner, and progressing consciously without confusion carry on till they are strained through the four filters in the bodies of animate beings. They are then loaded onto the red blood-corpuscles in order to come to the assistance of the members and cells which are in need of sustenance, rendering this assistance according to a law of generosity. It may be clearly understood from this that the One Who drives these particles and causes them to pass through thousands of different states must of necessity be a Generous Sustainer, a Compassionate Creator, in relation to Whose power particles and stars are equal.<br>   Moreover, all particles act within embroideries of the greatest art and have relations with all the other particles therein. Since each is in a position of both dominance and subjection to all the rest, both to each individually and to all of them generally, it either knows and creates that wonderfully skilful embroidery and wisdom-displaying ornamented art, which is a thousand times impossible, or each of them is a point assigned to that motion, which proceeds from the law of Divine Determining and pen of power of the All-Wise Maker.<br>   For example, if the stones of the dome of Aya Sophia are not dependent on the command and skill of its architect, all the stones must have skill in the art of building like that of the architect Sinan, and must be either subject to, or dominant over, the rest of the stones. That is, they must have the power to say: &quot;Come, we shall stand shoulder to shoulder in order not to fall and collapse.&quot;<br>   In the same way, if the particles in creatures, which are thousands of times more skilfully fashioned, wonderful, and full of wisdom than the dome of Aya Sophia, are not dependent on the command of the master builder of the universe, to each of them must the ascribed as many attributes of perfection as those of the universe&#39;s Maker.<br>   Glory be to God! Since the unbelievers do not accept a Necessarily Existent One, they are compelled according to their beliefs to accept as many false gods as there are particles. Thus, no matter how illustrious a philosopher or scholar an unbeliever may be, he is in profound ignorance to the utmost degree.<br>Risale-i Nur Collection Words  576- Bedi\u00fczzaman Said Nursi", "comment_date": "2020-05-16T16:09:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omana Varghess", "comment_text": "When they take time to make a video we can be sure it&#39;s gonna be good.And great new intro", "comment_date": "2020-05-16T15:59:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vilver II", "comment_text": "Why must you guys always start the video by making me depressed?", "comment_date": "2020-05-16T15:53:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bunto 48", "comment_text": "I see a man of culture  made the script", "comment_date": "2020-05-16T15:53:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ace of Spades", "comment_text": "What happens when you get to the bottom tho <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QImCld9YubE&amp;t=0m43s\">0:43</a>", "comment_date": "2020-05-16T15:49:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EVIL_EXE", "comment_text": "Are you from the Emma mattress ad?

In the Bible, in Genesis 1:6,7,  it states that before humans existed there was a canopy of water which surrounded the earth; a bubble of water above our atmosphere which surrounded the entire planet. This situation existed until the flood of Noah&#39;s day at which time God allowed the earth to be flooded with those waters above and the floodgates underneath the surface of the ground as well. (Genesis <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QImCld9YubE&amp;t=6m11s\">6:11</a>) During the time the &quot;bubble/layer of water existed, the lifespan of humans regularly reached into the 900th year. But, after this canopy/shield of water was taken away, human lifespan dropped significantly; 279 years after the canopy of water was taken away.<br>If you were to model this phenomena mathematically, I wonder what would be the effect on gravity on the earth&#39;s surface. This canopy/water shield atmosphere was the atmosphere humans were made to live in and may the optimal conditions for true human gene expression. Many human genetic functions may not even &#39;turn on&#39; without this atmosphere. And the thickness of this canopy, from inches to potentially feet thick may vary the possible solutions.<br>I know you are a smart guy and find solutions to difficult problems; this is one which may have exponential benefits if delved into and solved.

Rather, one of the molecule&#39;s three inorganic phosphates is removed to release energy, converting ATP to ADP (adenosine diphosphate).

All I was hoping for was a broad presentation of Schrodinger&#39;s ideas, but it came short. Also, I don&#39;t understand why so much emphasis on ATP, what am I missing? To me, ATP had always been a convenient way of converting and transporting energy, making it available for use by the cell (think exergy). Thus, the concept of availability is much more important in my mind, and this point didn&#39;t become clear in the video. And finally, the coil toy metaphor just doesn&#39;t seem right... The logic seem lopsided. Maybe the stairs should be going down, and you need a constant source of available energy to keep climbing it up and avoiding death...

There&#39;s this thing called Noether&#39;s theorem that says for any symmetry of a physical system, there is a conserved quantity. Most physical theories have time translation symmetry, which basically says that if you do an experiment at different times, you should get the same result. Pretty much every theory has to be time translation invariant, because if your theory changes with time, there&#39;s not much you can predict with it. Energy is the conserved quantity associated with time translation.

What really happened is a mystical space being snapped his mystical fingers and POOF everything appeared. Well it took 6 days but it was still basically a POOF.

But most importantly this God as we call it made the first man out of dirt, or clay, one of those, but he forgot to make a woman so he ripped one of the guy&#39;s ribs out of his chest and then threw some clay around it to make the chick. This is a true story unlike this video btw. That&#39;s how it all began. Everything on Earth was made just for those two but the female was unworthy and weak,  unlike the man of course, and she made her boo eat the one thing God told them not to. So they were punished... severely... they were given knowledge. True story. Anyway, long story short, they had two sons, one brother killed the other and was then banished with a mark on his forehead so that everyone would know what he&#39;d done. Where everyone else magically came from is a good question but don&#39;t ask. Maybe God made some super advanced cells that produced full grown humans in like a week.. the point is this video is hogwash and you should all know the truth! That we were made by a magical space entity that we call God and he made two white people in Africa named Adam and Eve and they populated the entire world because Eve had some bomb shut yo mouth that Adam couldn&#39;t get enough of and THAT was the true BIG BANG!", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T10:04:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aulia Garnish", "comment_text": "<b>JOJO REFERENCE EVERYWHERE</b>", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T10:04:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Louhym Labe", "comment_text": "Kurz I love you.", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T10:04:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Planettime", "comment_text": "Everyone: One day you will die <br>Kurzgesagt: no, no &quot; At some point you will merge with the dead universe again.&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T10:03:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DEMON XD", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QImCld9YubE&amp;t=7m44s\">7:44</a> OWO what\u2019s dis? <b>*notices teaser for 2021 science war*</b>", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T10:03:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jean-Philippe Haufroid", "comment_text": "&quot;Why are you alive ?&quot;<br><br>Well... that kind of a mean question...", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T10:03:35Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "AngeKerr", "comment_text": "Quick answer cuz I\u2019m not dead", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T10:02:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darshan S M", "comment_text": "who all missed the pokemon reference at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QImCld9YubE&amp;t=6m17s\">6:17</a>", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T10:02:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "awsm unicorn", "comment_text": "kurz embrases the meme, just like vsause", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T10:02:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OMI WANKHEDE", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QImCld9YubE&amp;t=5m47s\">5:47</a><br>Atheists be like : GRANDPA", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T10:02:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hypermega", "comment_text": "Misread the title as &quot;Life Energy &amp; ATP&quot;<br>The missed comma between life and energy was huge<br>Was expecting some pseudoscience BS haha", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T10:01:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nikki Nguyen", "comment_text": "Okay, I am loving that anime reference lol!

Evolution of new information in DNA is impossible no matter how long you say it must have taken. You say energy cannot be created or destroyed and we are all just recycled into the dead universe, but I tell you that people are not meant to die. There is a living God that created everything and He has morals. He has an absolute moral law called the 10 Commandments that are written in every persons conscience. When you break any one of them, you should know that you now owe a blood covenant to the Most High. He loves us all and simply wants to be with us walking with us like He did before with Adam and Eve. Since people love sin and selfish pleasures more than Him, He has to give justice. That&#39;s the reality and that&#39;s why we all die. However, you can live eternally and be redeemed by being born again. By understanding what truly happened when Yeshua conquered death. He is God the creator who spoke because He is the Word. He realized from the moment that Adam and Eve sinned that no carnally natured person would ever be able to resist temptation now that we all know good and evil, so He has so much mercy on us that he became flesh and lived to become our deserved punishment, so that He can extend his grace to us. You have to believe Him and be sorry and truly repent with the rest of your life and turn away from the evil that you have learned to love in this life. Evolution is a lie for which there is no proof yet it is being stuffed down children&#39;s throats and treated like its yesterday&#39;s news and an established fact based on looking at the evidence, therefore I challenge you to look at the fossil record with a mind and heart open to the possibilities that God could exist. Then the fossil record will tell you the story of the worldwide flood instead. Then look at recent geological processes and tell me that the fossils and petrified forests could form in any other circumstances that would form those strata that blanket the Earth so uniformly. You are being deceived by the Deceiver and his army. Anyway, you can trust Yeshua when He says He will come back for you and make you incorruptible and destroy all the evil.

(Colossians 1:1) Before I came to faith in Jesus, I\u2019d heard the gospel preached but wrestled with His identity. How could He offer forgiveness for my sins when the Bible says only God can forgive sins? I discovered I wasn\u2019t alone in my struggles after reading J. I. Packer\u2019s Knowing God. Packer suggests that for many unbelievers the \u201creally staggering Christian claim is that Jesus of Nazareth was God made man . . . as truly and fully divine as He was human.\u201d Yet this is the truth that makes salvation possible.              <br><br>When the apostle Paul refers to Christ as \u201cthe image of the invisible God,\u201d he\u2019s saying Jesus is completely and perfectly God\u2014Creator and Sustainer of all things in heaven and earth\u2012but also fully human (Colossians 1 : 15\u201317). Because of this truth, we can be confident that through Christ\u2019s death and resurrection, He\u2019s not only carried the consequences for our sins but has also redeemed human nature, so that we\u2014and all of creation\u2014can be reconciled to God (vv. 20\u201322).                <br><br>In an amazing, initiating act of love, God the Father reveals Himself in and through Scripture by the power of God the Holy Spirit and through the life of God the Son.

Which raises the question, if animals evolved from plants why are there no animal/plant hybrids around today? Surely a creature that can sustain itself from solar energy AND consume other plants or animals would have a significant evolutionary advantage compared to something limited to those with more restricted sources of food.

Well this process has a direct impact on our food supply. When you eat a piece of chicken, 90% of that chickens energy is lost and we only utilize 10% of that energy to biomass. That chicken had to eat plants, and it was only about to use 10% of the plants energy for its biomass. This means that if humans ate the plants directly, it would be a 90% more energy efficient process!<br><br>This is called the Ten Percent Law in ecology.

Philosophical or biological? You are introducing ATP but you never talk about how it was used, where is it from. For a video introducing ATP, it is terrible.<br><br>ATP gives energy from breaking down. ATP turns into ADP (Adenosine diphosphate)+ Pi (phosphate group) and gives out energy. Energy is stored vice versa. This would be a very simple and good information yet you used the time to talk about empty universe and lively cell.<br><br>ADP is synthesized from your gene along with AMP (Another molecule that can turn into ATP), that is why you can make more even though it is unknown where the first ATP came from. You didn&#39;t talk about this for slinkies on an escalator.<br><br>The thing that disappoints me in this video is you mixed a philosophical topic with an introductory video. Yes, life exists because of energy and cells, but what does that have to do with entropy and wanting to be lively. When you are talking about the importance of ATP, why do you not talk about the basics of ATP and say: yay mitochondria, yay energy.<br><br>This should have been two topics. Why life is here, and the other is ATP. Yet you mix them together and created a confusing video. When am I getting informative videos like you made in the past, instead of low effort research and teaching information that is widely available online? Then continue to preach how long you have researched when you can just type that in online and make a passage in less than an hour. That infuriates me.<br><br>I am already not requesting you to mention Kreb&#39;s cycle or Calvin cycle. But the basics of the use of ATP was never mentioned other than &#39;it gives energy&#39;, I would say this whole video, eleven and a half minute long only told me: ATP exists and gives energy to let you live.

But ATP is not the main energy source of any cell. Cell gain energy by moving electrons and generating proton gradients. Glucose isn&#39;t an alternative to ATP, any molecule containing a good number of carbon atoms (in reduced form) is a  candidate for energy reservoir.<br>ATP It&#39;s just the main energy sink of a cell. Its chemistry isn&#39;t all that mysterious either. Energy is stored in the TP(tri-phosphate) part of ATP. Chemically -PO4, the phosphate is what called a good leaving group. Which means anything containing a -PO4 will naturally want to break down. But three phosphate groups together make a resonance stabilized structure which makes it kinetically stable. This means breaking a TP will yield lots of energy but u need a pretty big hammer to break it. U may then ask why just tri-phosphate, why not tetra, Penta, etc phosphate? The answer is the resonance stabilization from di-phosphate to tri-phosphate is huge, but from tri to tetra and Penta is proportionally not that much.

In other words, it\u2019s the essence of all existence and non-existence \u2013 the ultimate creative force behind planets, stars, nebulae, people, animals, trees, fish, birds, and all phenomena, manifest or latent. All matter and intelligence are simply waves or ripples manifesting to and from this core source. Consciousness (enlightenment) is itself the actual creator of everything that exists now, ever existed in the past, or will exist in the future \u2013 right down to the minutest particles of dust \u2013 each being an individual ripple or wave. The big difference between chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and most other conventional prayers is that instead of depending on a \u2018middleman\u2019 to connect us to our state of inner enlightenment, we\u2019re able to do it ourselves. That\u2019s because chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo allows us to tap directly into our enlightened state by way of this self-produced sound vibration.\r<br>\u2018Who or What Is God?\u2019 If we compare the concept of God being a separate entity that is forever watching down on us, to the teachings of Nichiren, it makes more sense to me that the true omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence of what most people perceive to be God, is the fantastic state of enlightenment that exists within each of us. Some say that God is an entity that\u2019s beyond physical matter \u2013 I think that the vast amount of information continuously being conveyed via electromagnetic waves in today\u2019s world gives us proof of how an invisible state of God could indeed exist. For example, it\u2019s now widely known that specific data relayed by way of electromagnetic waves has the potential to help bring about extraordinary and powerful effects \u2013 including an instant global awareness of something or a mass emotional reaction. It\u2019s also common knowledge that these invisible waves can easily be used to detonate a bomb or to enable NASA to control the movements of a robot as far away as the Moon or Mars \u2013 none of which is possible without a receiver to decode the information that\u2019s being transmitted. Without the receiver, the data would remain impotent. In a very similar way, we need to have our own \u2018receiver\u2019 switched on so that we can activate a clear and precise understanding of our own life, all other life and what everything else in existence is. Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day helps us to achieve this because it allows us to reach into the core of our enlightenment and keep it switched on. That\u2019s because Myoho-Renge-Kyo represents the identity of what scientists now refer to as the unified field of consciousnesses.\r<br>To break it down \u2013 Myoho represents the Law of manifestation and latency (Nature) and consists of two alternating states. For example, the state of Myo is where everything in life that\u2019s not obvious to us exists \u2013 including our stored memories when we\u2019re not thinking about them \u2013 our hidden potential and inner emotions whenever they\u2019re dormant \u2013 our desires, our fears, our wisdom, happiness, karma \u2013 and more importantly, our enlightenment. The other state, ho, is where everything in Life exists whenever it becomes evident to us, such as when a thought pops up from within our memory \u2013 whenever we experience or express our emotions \u2013 or whenever a good or bad cause manifests as an effect from our karma. When anything becomes apparent, it merely means that it\u2019s come out of the state of Myo (dormancy/latency) and into a state of ho (manifestation). It\u2019s the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness, being awake or asleep, or knowing and not knowing. \r<br>The second law \u2013 Renge \u2013 Ren meaning cause and ge meaning effect, governs and controls the functions of Myoho \u2013 these two laws of Myoho and Renge, not only function together simultaneously but also underlie all spiritual and physical existence.\r<br>The final and third part of the tri-combination \u2013 Kyo, is the Law which allows Myoho to integrate with Renge \u2013 or vice verse. It\u2019s the great, invisible thread of energy that fuses and connects all Life and matter \u2013 as well as the past, present and future. It\u2019s also sometimes termed the Universal Law of Communication \u2013 perhaps it could even be compared with the string theory that many scientists now suspect exists.\r<br>Just as the cells in our body, our thoughts, feelings and everything else is continually fluctuating within us \u2013 all that exists in the world around us and beyond is also in a constant state of flux \u2013 constantly controlled by these three fundamental laws. In fact, more things are going back and forth between the two states of Myo and ho in a single moment of time than it would ever be possible to calculate or describe. And it doesn\u2019t matter how big or small, famous or trivial anything or anyone may appear to be, everything that\u2019s ever existed in the past, exists now or will exist in the future, exists only because of the workings of the Laws \u2018Myoho-Renge-Kyo\u2019 \u2013 the basis of the four fundamental forces, and if they didn\u2019t function, neither we nor anything else could go on existing. That\u2019s because all forms of existence, including the seasons, day, night, birth, death and so on, are moving forward in an ongoing flow of continuation \u2013 rhythmically reverting back and forth between the two fundamental states of Myo and ho in absolute accordance with Renge \u2013 and by way of Kyo. Even stars are dying and being reborn under the workings of what the combination \u2018Myoho-Renge-Kyo\u2019 represents.\r<br>Nam, or Namu \u2013 which mean the same thing, are vibrational passwords or keys that allow us to reach deep into our life and fuse with or become one with \u2018Myoho-Renge-Kyo\u2019. On a more personal level, nothing ever happens by chance or coincidence, it\u2019s the causes that we\u2019ve made in our past, or are presently making, that determine how these laws function uniquely in each of our lives \u2013 as well as the environment from moment to moment. By facing east, in harmony with the direction that the Earth is spinning, and chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo for a minimum of, let\u2019s say, ten minutes daily to start with, any of us can experience actual proof of its positive effects in our lives \u2013 even if it only makes us feel good on the inside, there will be a definite positive effect. That\u2019s because we\u2019re able to pierce through the thickest layers of our karma and activate our inherent Buddha Nature (our enlightened state). By so doing, we\u2019re then able to bring forth the wisdom and good fortune that we need to challenge, overcome and change our adverse circumstances \u2013 turn them into positive ones \u2013 or manifest and gain even greater fulfilment in our daily lives from our accumulated good karma. This also allows us to bring forth the wisdom that can free us from the ignorance and stupidity that\u2019s preventing us from accepting and being proud of the person that we indeed are \u2013 regardless of our race, colour, gender or sexuality. We\u2019re also able to see and understand our circumstances and the environment far more clearly, as well as attract and connect with any needed external beneficial forces and situations. As I\u2019ve already mentioned, everything is subject to the law of Cause and Effect \u2013 the \u2018actual-proof-strength\u2019 resulting from chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo always depends on our determination, sincerity and dedication. For example, the levels of difference could be compared to between making a sound on a piano, creating a melody, or producing a great song, and so on. Something else that\u2019s very important to always to respect and acknowledge is that the Law (or if you prefer God) is in everyone and everything.\r<br>\r<br>NB: There are frightening and disturbing sounds, and there are tranquil and relaxing sounds. It\u2019s the emotional result from any noise or sound that can trigger off a mood or even instantly change one. When chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day, we are producing a sound vibration that\u2019s the password to our true inner-self \u2013 this soon becomes apparent when you start reassessing your views on various things \u2013 such as your fears and desires etc. The best way to get the desired result when chanting is not to view things in a conventional way \u2013 rather than reaching out to an external source, we need to reach into our own lives and bring our needs and desires to fruition from within \u2013 including the good fortune and strength to achieve any help that we may need.\r<br>Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo also reaches out externally and draws us towards, or draws towards us, what we need to make us happy from our environment. For example, it helps us to be in the right place at the right time \u2013 to make better choices and decisions and so forth.

You did a great job depicting the bizarre adventure of life, and how fragile and complex it is from a physical standpoint.

And also, perhaps, to make your animations more appealing. But I think it would be good to try and avoid some depictions that might result in misconceptions, for example the channel proteins that are depicted as grapplers, picking molecules up and shoving them through a hole in the membrane. <br>I am aware that you must be facing thousands of design decisions for every video and that it is a ton of work. It&#39;s just that your videos, in my opinion, are by far the best and most inspiring ones, and misconceptions, as insignificant as they might seem, may make learning harder when a student has to learn that stuff later on.
