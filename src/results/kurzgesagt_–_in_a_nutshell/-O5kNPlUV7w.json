I understand that to an atheist this sounds like hogwash, but I think that we can at least agree that there is a huge mystery in how humanity has developed to actually be conscious of the universe that surrounds it, and that it appreciates beauty to a degree that no other creature does. <br><br>I&#39;m currently what I&#39;d call a personal agnostic, in so far as I&#39;ve never experienced something that makes me think that God is definitely real, but at the same time am a practicing Catholic. This actually isn&#39;t contradictory, because the experience of multiple people has shown that God (supposedly) doesn&#39;t make himself known to all people from the moment they are conscious. It is a process of discovery, in some cases more sudden than others. The Catholic Faith doesn&#39;t actually teach that you can&#39;t have your doubts, it teaches only that those doubts shouldn&#39;t be driven by rebellion and pride, and that they should be motivated by a genuine desire to find truth. That is what it teaches. Whether it&#39;s what its followers have done in the past is a different issue.<br><br>My point, though, is that to understand the &quot;why&quot; of beauty, and to trully appreciate beauty to a much higher degree, you would need to also take into account the possibility that beauty might actually be an expression of God&#39;s love for his people. It is a gift, as well as a reflection of Himself. When nature is seen as a gift out of love for you, whenever you experience beauty, you will also feel loved.<br><br>So if, like me, you haven&#39;t felt God&#39;s presence; you could always ask. There is no harm in asking for that faith.

In my neighbor just like in most of my state (except the wealthier ones where houses were made by actual contractors that used a model by an architect, for example; and usually foreigners) the houses were painted by their owners without regard of harmony or color palette. Awful mismatched houses. Most of them without finished walls, bare concrete block, just a totally utilitarian view of life because we have a culture were if you are living in poverty then you cannot worry about aesthetic, urbanism, balance. <br><br>So lots of road because it had two of the biggest refineries you can get in the world, but that made my already desertic hot state even more hotter. Lots of building and roads trapping heat in the ground, very few plants and trees = a living hell. Then there was zero education in disposing trash, so the parts where nature was unconquered it was filled with cactus that trapped every plastic bag throwed away by inconsiderate pricks, which were the majority of the people living there. So when one had the chance to see a natural wild panoramic view it was filled with ugly plastic that reminded you why you hated your own people. It doesn&#39;t cost money to just store the plastic bags and throw it away in any fucking trash can. No excuses there, just trashy people with trashy culture.<br><br>God I hated that place. Felt miserable everyday. Everybody happy to used every penny buying cheap imitations of designer brands, customizing cars (making them even uglier and trashy), buying loud sound speakers to put reggaeton all fucking day and not having even a slight consideration for their neighbors but never worrying about their surroundings. You are born in a place like that, and have an ounce of aesthetic sense and you feel as an outsider very quickly. You want to get out before that society swallows you. <br><br>On top of that there was this insidious culture of everybody wanting to be more &quot;cunning&quot; and &quot;astute&quot; than their the guy next to them, always trying to one-up every sentence, always mocking other people and each other, always trying to swindle and gain something out of every interaction. Viveza criolla is what we call it. And it&#39;s endemic of Spanish conquered cultures. So combining a celebration of ignorance and anti-intelectuallism, mocking book-readers and embracing pure short-sighted goals and you get people more worried about vacuous things than the real actual problems. Of course sleazy politicians, leaders, pseudo-doctors, simoniacs and televangelist are very popular there. A breeding ground of stupid motherfuckers that sociophats with good oratory skills can scam. <br><br>As a country we let populist and demagoges dictate our fates because MONEYMONEY easy money, oil-rentism, and lazyness to research and make those scammers accountable. And a long history of military strong-men dictating the fate of our lives and getting presidential seats. And lots of military coups too. So a (on the paper) richer countries of the region, now is one of the poorest and high violent criminal rates of the world, with zero freedom and a high proportion of journalist imprisoned, and opposition political prisoners. We are fucked. All done by stupid ignorant idiots wanting that easy money and revanchism.<br><br>...<br><br>Now I live in a capital in another third-world country after escaping that hellhole.<br><br>Where I live is basically a suburb surrounding the central historic area. In the actual historic central capital the buildings have a colonial beautiful (but decadent) Spanish aesthetic and it&#39;s really eye-pleasing. Althought still sad that many of those historical architecture is being abandoned and not enought effort is put to recover them. I get that there are many problems in the country, but if you are not a stupid imbecile you know there is always enough money for that kind of reconstruction. I&#39;ts just that corruption in the lawmakers, governors and contractors always impedes that. So those 400-500 hundred years old building are falling appart.<br><br>But here where I actually live in a more residential area every homeowner is worried about making money (can&#39;t blame them) and making their usually boring blocky houses into 3,4 or more story buildings apartments to rent and make a living out of that. Not gonna get into he safety issues (this country is very active in earthquakes) because that sole reason should be enough to detract any intelligent living soul on the enterprises this middle class homeowners are doing. <br><br>So they build on top of the houses, multiplying the uglyness.<br><br>It means quality of living is shitty: constant noise contamination (machinery, hammering, drillings.... it&#39;s maddening), ugly surroundings because a stupid law taxes owners extra if the non-frontal walls are finished and extremely crammed houses all together. Feels like an overcrowed rat maze. In my area are some green parks, which is nice, but doesn&#39;t compensate for the &quot;concrete jungle&quot; feeling I get here, specially when there is not a single building with a nice architecture design. It&#39;s way better than the place were I come from, because most houses are &quot;nice&quot; althought uninspired which is compared to my old home town, but still...<br><br>Cannot wait enough to GTFO of here, go to a more wealthy area where the whole Pacific is in the horizon, parks and plazas are more beautiful and well designed, with sculptures made by artists, with calm people contemplating the sunset while walking their dogs. Other people doing yoga, other dancing, etc. It&#39;s a dream!<br><br>And it&#39;s not a matter of being poor or wealthy. I always thought about this, and Asians among other cultures understand very well this: you can live in abject fucking poverty, but every human DESERVES beauty. And it&#39;s not a matter of money. Ugly things can be modified and rearranged to be more pleasant to our senses. It&#39;s not about money. But short-sightness and lack of education (not prioritized by the state) or a pure utilitarian industrialist curriculum is what has made us this hollow unhappy conformist zombies. You can transform your surroundings with zero money! But it requires having another mentality, and thats difficult for trash tacky people. <br><br>And I think us the low income, blue collar or customer service workers, the grinders, need more beauty than anyone in his planet.

Our productivity as a society constitutes of 3 general areas; a person&#39;s Vision of their self, Knowledge they utilise, and the place and people they Network with.<br><br>2. It&#39;s the evolution of our own biological self preservation mechanism shaped by the reaction to the lifestyle we choose to live in, like how our ancestors have done in the past (can sustain one&#39;s self, can survive).<br><br>3. Our conscious (perception) and subconscious (attention) habits of our lifestyle to the environment we live in shapes the circumstances that we are in; ie. how satisfied we are.<br><br>4. That satisfaction, expectation, risk-to-reward, etc that we continue to adjust and prepare for is a natural (personal circumstances) and nurtured (parent and cultural influence) decision, depending on how competent we are as an individual.<br><br>5. Skill, understanding, awareness, adaptability to our surroundings is a mix of what we desire to be and where our influences are from, with better influences often preparing and raising better results.<br><br><br>This is just a fraction of many aspects I have been picking bits and pieces of, thanks in part to videos like these that are made and events that have unfolded over the years.

Beauty is the process of creating a discernable pattern and then breaking that pattern but only far enough to create tension between opposites.

In the end no matter what kind of art it is the final product has to interact with itself in such a way that nothing can be added or taken away without ruining the harmony inside the work. The harmony is the dynamic effect of opposites creating tensions in ways that go round and round. Music exists in time. Painting in a space. Literature in patterns of meaning. They all depend on composition. It has to do with how our brains work, probably because of the kind of patterns we find in nature which are similar to this in effect.

It&#39;s actually pretty obvious. With beauty, safety and cleanliness come almost automatically since something needs to be clean before it can be called beautiful. In this case I refer with &#39;clean&#39; to the literal meaning of it with junk not all over the place, and being removed instead of piling up somewhere in a corner where it&#39;s not in the way, but still visible.<br><br>To explain beauty being more important than clean or safe more properly I&#39;ll start with the cleanliness of a city. People often start throwing their waste on the street, because it isn&#39;t clean anyway which naturally lowers the limit for people to do so as well. This is easy to verify on a very small scale which will apply on a large scale as well: your own bedroom. If it&#39;s a mess you won&#39;t hold back to stuff something away on a shelve or somewhere on the floor as much as you would do in a clean room. A large scale example of this &#39;keeping a clean place clean&#39; instinct like thing is one I&#39;ve read about some years ago (which I still remember for some reason) is used to keep slums in a bit better shape, and to make it easier to improve the situation there. Which is done by painting the houses a bit, so everything would have a tidier appearance to it. Thanks to this the people living there are more likely to keep it cleaner for an extended amount of time, and maybe even start cleaning up whatever garbage is lying around eventually. This also makes it easier for charity organizations to travel around, and get to certain locations a bit faster.<br><br>Now for the safety part which holds a strong connection to cleanliness. When your surroundings are beautiful with being clean playing a big part in it the area feels and likely is more orderly. With everything being more clean and orderly you feel safer being there, and with the residents feeling safer they&#39;re less prone to perform illegal actions since the area won&#39;t feel as dangerous as a messier version of the same area. Therefore they&#39;re less likely to act in terms of survival with danger not occupying one&#39;s thoughts.", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T14:29:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pompom Yourkey", "comment_text": ": }", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T00:17:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Everything is a Mind game", "comment_text": "Beauty is what makes us feel good in our heads I dont know what&#39;s wrong with this sentence but it seems funny lol", "comment_date": "2020-02-19T15:14:19Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "OUTSIDER40", "comment_text": "Interesting \ud83e\uddd0", "comment_date": "2020-02-18T14:27:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sibelon", "comment_text": "Your animation is delightful", "comment_date": "2020-02-18T02:49:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jerry Brice", "comment_text": "Laying in a dark room viewing this marvelous video.

Beauty and art are amazing and indeed makes us very very happy.<br><br><br>but I don&#39;t find the reasoning for how we adopted these feelings convincing because:<br>Firstly,<br>- Identifying Fractal patterns to identify certain objects faster doesn&#39;t explain why we like them. Our feelings should be neutral since there are dangerous things with Fractal patterns as much as there are safe things with Fractal patterns.<br>- If identifying things in of itself is rewarding then we should be rewarded all the time but in reality we don&#39;t find everything beautiful - it doesn&#39;t explain why we sometimes dislike certain colors, shapes, forms, proportions or patterns and sometimes we don&#39;t. Like disliking black wall and liking black shirt.<br><br><br>Secondly,<br>- Asymmetry which means change or different doesn&#39;t really always mean bad or danger. It could also mean food or a new object which could be food or useful, that&#39;s why humans actually approach asymmetrical things. And we generally like change in our environment.<br>- If symmetry means safe and asymmetry means danger then we humans are supposed to fear or dislike asymmetrical things which isn&#39;t true. We like a lot both symmetrical and asymmetrical shapes.<br>- Our fears and motivations are usually based on personal experiences and ideas not instinct. for example, no one will consider a deer with impressive antlers to be a nutritious source of food unless he already knows this fact or contemplated it.<br>-  Almost everything in nature is symmetrical. So again, dangerous things could be as symmetrical as safe things. So our feelings should be neutral.<br>- If asymmetry means danger and is identified quickly for that reason and we get rewarded for symmetry because it means safe and that things are as they should be then an environment with the most symmetry, stable, bland characteristics (like the buildings we dislike) should be considered beautiful <br>- And if identifying change is what&#39;s rewarding then we shouldn&#39;t be rewarded for seeing the same things over and over again but we still like beautiful things even if it&#39;s repetitive with no change such as a tree in front of your window.<br><br><br>I honestly don&#39;t think evolution has anything to do with human perception of beauty at all.<br><br>\r<br>- If it&#39;s due to evolutionary history (like for example, since our ancestors across millions of years identified that black water is dangerous, so we dislike black water and consider it ugly. And since they identified that clear water is safe and important, so we like and consider it beautiful.) then we should share this sense of beauty with other animals who needed to survive as much as humans and in fact has survived much longer but has not adopted an interest in symmetrical things rather naturally and logically they appear to respond to stimulus, preservation, instinct, utility and habit which truly give them an advantage and actually makes them survive. \r<br>- Seeing something safe and useful or dangerous is important, but beautiful or ugly doesn&#39;t help survival. We can find something extremely ugly but we know that it&#39;s safe and useful, and we can fear something and find it beautiful, like a colorful snake for example. We also find useless things &quot;beautiful&quot; like a desert or birds or rocks. Plus &quot;ugly&quot; environment causes depression as you said. It&#39;s actually a disadvantage than an advantage. \r<br>- We also can&#39;t say we like certain things because they resemble good things. Many shapes we make that we like or dislike aren&#39;t really rooted in nature and are significantly different and don&#39;t resemble nature at all.<br>- There isn&#39;t any survival reason to adopt this identification skill into our life by spending seriously significant, huge amounts of time making everything around us symmetrical beautiful, such humans won&#39;t have any specific advantage that makes them survive better. \r<br><br><br>- Why does a group of mindless atoms &quot;want&quot; to &quot;survive&quot; and &quot;like&quot; things in the first place :P", "comment_date": "2019-06-21T06:17:20Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Hetzer Hasser", "comment_text": "This video was Beautiful", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T21:51:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jason Allcreator", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O5kNPlUV7w&amp;t=5m53s\">5:53</a> this research is pretty messed up when you think about it.", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T16:45:56Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "\u6c11\u773e", "comment_text": "\u559c\u6b61\u7f8e \u9019\u4e00\u96c6", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T16:44:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr Bones", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O5kNPlUV7w&amp;t=5m30s\">5:30</a> i learned this in rimworld lol. bad hospital can lead to catatonic states and tantrums xD", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T22:10:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zalidia", "comment_text": "These videos are beautiful.", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T13:18:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "RonaSZN", "comment_text": "Same goes with people .

The source of beauty being in fractals and symmetry is pretty far off the mark. Fractals and symmetry may be part of beautiful objects, in limited cases, but they don&#39;t define it. Even the example in the video has symmetrical brutalist architecture as an example of soul-deadening ugliness, not beauty. And beyond the shared feature of a trunk, trees are by nature asymmetrical, even  pines and redwoods are very asymmetrical in their features. Sunsets and starfields are almost the very definition of asymmetry. Roiling storm clouds and a wave tossed ocean have fractals at a level of imperceptible detail, there appears to be more seduction in chaotic systems. Masterpieces of art by definition avoid symmetry - Leonardo&#39;s works approach the subjects from angles and poses with an explicit rejection of symmetry - the Renaissance was born out of a rejection of Medieval rules of symmetrical composition. Applying fractals to Jackson Pollock just shows a lack of attention to his work - or an attempt to force a point that has no support. I think the compulsion by theorists to align beauty with utility is missing the whole point. The mystery of beauty is based on the fact that non-utilitarian experiences have a powerful impact on the human psyche. Which undermines any sort of darwinian approach to understanding beauty. It is the contradiction that states the problem, and simplistic examples of primitive art ignore the examples that invalidate that entire approach - Lascaux and Chauvet Cave paintings anyone?  <br><br><br> &quot;There is no exquisite beauty, without some strangeness in the proportion.&quot; -Edgar Allen Poe", "comment_date": "2019-05-08T19:25:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "no u", "comment_text": "harry styles\u2019 face makes me happy", "comment_date": "2019-05-08T13:35:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "THEO", "comment_text": "And they say fat people are beautiful...

We are driven to solve mysteries.  We constantly ask ourselves:  \u201eWhat is over the next hill?\u201c, \u201eWhat is inside that box?\u201c \u2014Be that \u201ehill\u201c the other side of a mountain, the moon, or another galaxy, and that \u201ebox\u201c a cave,  our own minds, or the inside of an atom.<br>A painting of a placid lake may bring about a feeling of calmness and peace, a welcome therapeutic repass from a hectic world, but a painting of a turbulent storm at sea awakens in us feelings of passion and romance that can inspire us unto new adventure.<br>I think that all this is derived from a primary success strategy that we inherited long ago from our primate ancestors and deeper down into the animal kingdom. It is our deeply rooted propensity to be curious, to push the boarders of our experience, despite the inherent dangers, in the unknown.  Boredom, status, stagnation are agonizing for our souls and can be experienced as being worse to us than physical pain.  Our brains actually begin to die when deprived of novel stimulation.   We are natural born explorers and it is this unrelenting pursuit of the novel against caution and fear that has reaped the benefits from all our discoveries.  It is the monkey who climbs farther up the tree, risking falling, who reaches untapped fruit.  It is the explorer who crosses dangerous seas who discovers new territories, cultures, methods, ideas and resources.  It is the scientist asking: \u201eWhy do apples fall?\u201c, \u201eWhy do we get sick?\u201c, \u201eHow do birds fly?\u201c, that has given us physics, medicine, and aviation.

Or maybe moving patients from one room to another with progressively beautiful art work on the walls would, more or less, &quot;enjoy&quot; the time they have to spend there.   In this video i find a lot of things interesting.  First and foremost is the possibility of monetizing the beauty in older people&#39;s lives.  The amount of older people in the world is increasing at an amazing rate due to better healthcare and medicine.  Thus inevitably leading to better and proper care of our elders.  Meaning there is a HUGE market for helping the elderly.  Maintaining beauty in the world of the elderly might lend itself to happier patients and possibly patients with lots of money helping you.<br><br>Edit1: Think of it like reorganizing your room or completely changing the furniture.  This has a positive effect on the homeowner,, they like the space (space being the &quot;new&quot; room) more than the old layout and furniture that they had grown used to.  I don&#39;t know about you but the cleaner or fresher my room is the more happy I am (slightly) .  However I do understand that an elderly person with constantly changing surroundings might be unsettling and unfamiliar, which is not really a good thing.

On the other hand Germany has beautiful streets and buildings that are new or better treated or restorated and make me feel happier. Nowadays or surroundings are our cities.  Bought countries have beautiful nature but it doesn&#39;t effect my happiness as much as the city structure. And I was thinking that students are happier too when they found themselves in beautiful, colorful classes. Again taking the example of Greece and Germany the classes in Germany made me feel more comfortable than that in Greece. And I know from studies I have read that the kids in Greece are of the most unhappiest students in the world. Maybe a solution can be found in making the schools more appealing to the students. So..

This isn&#39;t a &quot;special snowflake&quot; statement -- though it might be depending on whether you classify mutative deviations from the norm as such or not -- but rather an observation that this might be most applicable to extroverted brains, and least applicable to autistic brains.<br><br>I can find asymmetry appealing. I&#39;m drawn to horror aesthetics like what people would think of as especially &quot;ugly&quot; werewolves, monstrous vampire bats, et cetera. I like certain kinds of gothic architecture which is unappealing to the norm, and I&#39;m not too bothered by brutalist architecture beyond the observation that there isn&#39;t much visual variety. I absolutely enjoy variety, often more than my peers, though my feelings on brutalist architecture are more informed by my tolerance for repetition than anything else. It still doesn&#39;t depress me, as such, but it does make one long for more chaotic design.<br><br>The presented argument seems to be that brutalist architecture isn&#39;t appealing due to some standards of beauty. I mean, yes, it&#39;s not the most appealing to me but it really is purely down to a repetitive factor. I find interest in much more than most do -- I&#39;ve found -- when it comes to aesthetics. There&#39;s usually some herdthink going on with beauty and aesthetics, as the video has observed. However, I think as much of this is cultural due to extroverted herd behaviour as it is anything else.<br><br>An example of this is the changing beauty standards foisted upon women ranging from the stick body with boobs, to the hourglass figure, to finally the &quot;thicc&quot; look. This shows a decreasing emphasis on breasts and an increasing one on hips. This is more informed by social norms which happen in waves; once a social norm wave has begun it spreads across all extroverted herds ensuring conformity. Extroverts don&#39;t wish to speak out against affiliated herds in case that causes them to lose social status.<br><br>As such, often, I believe that beauty is defined by Dark Triad groups who excel at modifying the behaviour of extroverted herds. They&#39;re good at pushing their view through enough and to enough extroverts that it becomes a new social norm wave, spreading across all extroverted herds until that becomes the new &quot;Normal.&quot; As we see with the changing body standards foisted upon women, Q.E.D.<br><br>Therefore I don&#39;t think that beauty is as complex, layered, or mystical as it&#39;s laid out to be, here. I think it really is as simple as a certain manifestation of geometry appealing to members of a Dark Triad group, which then spreads throughout the herds.<br><br>There are parts of the world where the wave regarding female human beauty standards haven&#39;t hit, and they&#39;re still operating on hourglass as the superior body model. Eventually this will be eradicated and will stand until whatever comes next. This is why people agree on beauty, it&#39;s conformism and people doing what they&#39;re told to do, and thinking what they&#39;re told to think.<br><br>On a similar note, you have the Apple logo. Aesthetic, or simply manipulation of extroverted herd behaviour? I&#39;d say the latter, because a study comparing the response of religious individuals to religious imagery activated the same areas of the brain as when Apple fans looked at an Apple logo. I don&#39;t see the beauty in it, myself, because it&#39;s a simplistic abstraction of an Apple and thus not particularly special to me.<br><br>However, this is clearly not true for Apple fans who see the logo as a testament to something, and thus an evident beauty -- to them.<br><br>I&#39;ve long doubted the idea of Universal beauty as I often find that what I may find aesthetically pleasing at any given time will generally be repugnant to extroverted herds. I&#39;m more fascinated by older skin, for example. I enjoy the sensory stimulus of wrinkles, bumps, and whatnot. That&#39;s contrary to what any extroverted herd would hold as their standard.<br><br>Beauty, simply put, is in the eye of the beholder. It&#39;s what pleases the person individually as a stimulus they enjoy based upon their own personal biases. There&#39;s no Universal beauty at work, that&#39;s simply human culture doing what human culture does -- homogenising to the point of global recognisability.<br><br>Therefore, yes, if you were to ask ten extroverted people about beauty you&#39;d likely get hte same result. If you were to ask ten autistic or introverted people, you&#39;d get very different results. We know from recent studies that autistic people, introverts, LGBT folks, along with women, minority ethnicities, and those with disabilities are grossly underrepresented in any endeavour involving a study of people. The vast majority of those inducted will be straight, white, extroverted, not disabled, and male. If there are any women present, the statistically chance of them being white, extroverted, not disabled, and straight is almost 100 per cent.<br><br>Which makes you think, really, about many of the conclusions past studies have drawn.", "comment_date": "2018-10-25T20:49:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "PLAYGOOD VallMine", "comment_text": "Thats why i want become an architect :3", "comment_date": "2018-10-25T20:40:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oficado", "comment_text": "As an artist, this makes me so happy (:<br>I&#39;ve always wanted to help people, and to come to find that aesthetically pleasing visuals can actually provide health benefits makes my job that much more worth it.", "comment_date": "2018-10-25T20:36:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omar Mu\u00f1oz", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O5kNPlUV7w&amp;t=7m26s\">7:26</a> you can hear a duck quack", "comment_date": "2018-10-25T20:24:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NomzGirl", "comment_text": "You&#39;re channel is always such a pleasure to watch.

Stay with me, it&#39;s simple.<br><br>The idea is that plants can &quot;hear&quot;, meaning pick up vibrations in the air around them, when they are surrounded by other plants. A plant that is surrounded by other plants is likely in a fertile land were it is safe to grow and expand, whereas a plant that isn&#39;t surrounded by others is likely to be one of few survivors of bad times and is better of conserving energy instead of growing needlessly. They don&#39;t do this consciously, of course. It&#39;s simply the result of an adaptation over millions of years were those plants that followed a primitive pattern of this (even by chance) would reproduce their genome more successfully until we reach the current day complexity of the system. <br><br>Let&#39;s go back to people now. Given that we have an evolved sense of disgust towards things that are unhealthy to us, such as puke, poop or rotten food, it stands to reason that a similar selection has happened with us. When surrounded by things that disgust or bores us, we go into a survival mode, rather than bloom. That&#39;s more effective, hard times are to be endured after all. If on the other hand we are surrounded by strong symmetrical growth, bright fruits and a varied environment with plenty to look at (because there&#39;s plenty of things growing and living there!), we can assume that times are good and it&#39;s the right time to blossom.

(For the non archaeological - the deeper stuff is buried, the older it is, and if stuff is found at similar depth (and the soil above it is the same as the pattern elsewhere, as a disturbance indicates burial of something from more recent times) then it&#39;s roughly the same age.)  At the time I was taking this archaeology class (which granted is now over a decade ago, rendering at least some of the theories I learned obsolete), one of the possible explanations for this oversized collection was that they were used ritually - for example, that one would make one as an engagement gift or the like.

Unfortunately, the fundamental principals of neurochemistry make it impossible. The emotions are essentially chemical messengers, and every feeling is merely a specific combination of these chemicals.

It has two type of functional chemicals, excitatory and inhibitory which are released in order of homeostatic plasticity. Which means it will always release neurotransmitters to maintain synaptic stability. For every excitatory chemical, it must release the equal number of inhibitory to sustain perceptional balance. <br>You know every beautiful emotion has its ugly counterpart, and this is for a reason. Because for every pleasant feeling, your brain will make you feel equally unpleasant, to maintain the balance.<br>If you have never been sad, how would you even know what happy feels?   <br>If you have never suffered, you wouldn&#39;t be able to experience pleasure. <br> <br>The beauty cannot exist without ugliness!

So I will quote and highlight some key ideas of the relevant chapter.<br><br>&quot;&#39;Displace one note and there would be diminishment. Displace one phrase and the structure would fall.&#39; That is how Mozart&#39;s music is described in Peter Shaffer&#39;s 1979 play Amadeus. This is reminiscent of the remark by John Archibald Wheeler with which this book begins, speaking of a hoped-for unified theory of fundamental physics: &#39;an idea so simple, so beautiful, that when we grasp it . . . how could it have been otherwise?&#39; Shaffer and Wheeler were describing the same attribute: being hard to vary while still doing the job. In the first case it is an attribute of aesthetically good music, and in the second of good scientific explanations. And Wheeler speaks of the scientific theory as being beautiful in the same breath as describing it as hard to vary. Scientific theories are hard to vary because the correspond closely with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our personal preferences and our biological make-up. But what made Peter Shaffer think Mozart&#39;s music is hard to vary?&quot; - p. 353<br>Let&#39;s take this to be our best understanding of beauty for the moment.<br><br>He goes on to give an example. Why are flowers beautiful? He asserts that they are beautiful because they had to solve a difficult problem. They needed to signal to bees, a far removed organizm on the tree of life. In order bridge a communication gap that far apart, flowers needed very effective encoding. One that would be hard to vary, namely beauty. Thinking about evolutions tendency to reward organisms that waste energy with a quick extinctions, why would flowers put so much effort into being beautiful?

Art that haunts, gives new perspective. Artworks that make you shiver and feel human. I understand choosing this framework in context of the S&amp;W beauty project. But in my eyes it educates a very narrow and simplistic view of art. Especially in a time where our personal believes get challenged less and less due to social pillarization, and boredom (which is not a bad thing!) is rare when the world is in the palm of your hand. Even though I was surprised by the beauty/health experiments, it feels like Kurzgesagt is saying: because we did it 10.000 years ago and it appears to be part of our instinct, it must be good for us. Which is a dangerous fallacy I think. And I hope Kurtzgesagt agrees on the latter. Lets not become lazy art-consumers, who just demand to be entertained by artworks.

Here &quot;geometric&quot; includes everything from the geometry of ratios and waves that you find in harmonies and rhythms for music (and even storytelling, I&#39;d wager); to the geometry of fractals, euclidean primitives and ratios in paintings and movie sequences; to the fractal harmonies of a great, complex meal; to the multiple reference game of a clever pun, acting on the &quot;ecosystems&quot; that our words actually are in our brains (analogy as the core of cognition, Hofstadter)); to the beauty of Euler formula and Euler&#39;s identity, in how they seem to encode the entirety of trigonometry and all its complexity in 2 lines that make everything so much simpler... It is an understanding of the word geometry as &quot;the interplay of shapes in ANY form of mathematical space, in which an opposition between simplicity and complexity; consonance and dissonance; order and chaos; can take place&quot;. This definition applies well to every type of beauty I have felt personally. Beauty is what most naturally satisfies the human need for order, even (and especially) within a chaotic system.<br><br>*In a nutshell*, &quot;feeling beauty&quot;, or rather, &quot;taste&quot;, is using abstraction to manage complexity in sensory inputs with ease.<br><br>PS: Mathematics, being the ultimate quest for abstraction, is also the ultimate quest for beauty. But mathematics in school (limited to calculations and equations) are certainly not where you&#39;d learn that; you&#39;d learn to be convinced of the opposite in fact.", "comment_date": "2018-10-23T14:44:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sheng Shu", "comment_text": "Where are the birds?", "comment_date": "2018-10-23T14:43:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "harshit munot", "comment_text": "the animations were too smooth af<br>and that was the <b>BEAUTY</b> of this video!!!!", "comment_date": "2018-10-23T14:43:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shivam Soni", "comment_text": "Your Channel is a Beauty", "comment_date": "2018-10-23T14:43:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MorrodertheFreakyGuy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O5kNPlUV7w&amp;t=7m27s\">7:27</a> Quack", "comment_date": "2018-10-23T14:43:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kids Syed", "comment_text": "Cute.", "comment_date": "2018-10-23T14:43:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1293ST", "comment_text": "Am I the only one who heard that Waluigi Wah at the end?", "comment_date": "2018-10-23T14:43:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FlatHead", "comment_text": "The universe in its entirety is an ethereal self contained eternal machine which LITERALLY &quot;outputs&quot; beauty and meaning.

Fantasy weapons are often large, stylized, with complex silhouettes, dramatic reliefs built into their structure, lots of extrusions and spikes, wide, often very thick blades. This is what a lot of people think looks the best when it comes to weapons.<br>However, people who are interested in medieval history, and who may even practice the use of such weapons often find that the authentic weapons are far more beautiful, because they make sense, they find elegance in the straightforwardness and practical minimalism.

Man\u2019s profound need of art lies in the fact that his cognitive faculty is conceptual, i.e., that he acquires knowledge by means of abstractions, and needs the power to bring his widest metaphysical abstractions into his immediate, perceptual awareness. Art fulfills this need: by means of a selective re-creation, it concretizes man\u2019s fundamental view of himself and of existence. It tells man, in effect, which aspects of his experience are to be regarded as essential, significant, important. In this sense, art teaches man how to use his consciousness.
