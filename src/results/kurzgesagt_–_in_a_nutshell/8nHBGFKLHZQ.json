You see we, humans, have sinned against God and broken His Ten Commandments. Romans 6:23 says  \u201cFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d. Sin leads to death and hell. Death is a disease, but there\u2019s a cure. God, the Creator of the universe, in His rich mercy and love, sent His Son Jesus into the world \ud83c\udf0e . Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life. Then God, rich in grace, was willing to sacrifice His Son whom He loved for the sins of the world \u271d\ufe0f. Jesus says in John 3:16 \u201cFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.\u201d \u2764\ufe0f When Jesus died on that cross, death lost its grip and got a cure, because three days after Jesus died, He rose from the dead! Friend, it\u2019s up to you whether you will receive the cure of death by putting your faith in Jesus Christ. When you put your faith in Jesus Christ, you have a spot reserved for you in heaven, everlasting joy and peace! God did this because He loves you so much.

Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed.[9]\u00a0In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal\u00a0black body, as it reflects no light.[10][11]\u00a0Moreover,\u00a0quantum field theory in curved spacetime\u00a0predicts that event horizons emit\u00a0Hawking radiation, with\u00a0the same spectrum\u00a0as a\u00a0black body\u00a0of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for\u00a0black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.<br><br>Objects whose\u00a0gravitational fields\u00a0are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by\u00a0John Michell\u00a0and\u00a0Pierre-Simon Laplace.[12]\u00a0The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by\u00a0Karl Schwarzschild\u00a0in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by\u00a0David Finkelstein\u00a0in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of\u00a0neutron stars\u00a0by\u00a0Jocelyn Bell Burnell\u00a0in 1967 sparked interest in\u00a0gravitationally collapsed\u00a0compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality.<br><br>Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes,\u00a0supermassive black holes\u00a0of millions of\u00a0solar masses\u00a0(M\u2609) may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most\u00a0galaxies.<br><br>Despite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other\u00a0matter\u00a0and with\u00a0electromagnetic radiation\u00a0such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external\u00a0accretion disk\u00a0heated by friction, forming some of the\u00a0brightest objects in the universe. If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole&#39;s mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in\u00a0binary systems, and established that the radio source known as\u00a0Sagittarius A*, at the core of the\u00a0Milky Way\u00a0galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million\u00a0solar masses.<br><br>On 11 February 2016, the\u00a0LIGO\u00a0collaboration\u00a0announced the first direct detection\u00a0of\u00a0gravitational waves, which also represented the first observation of a black hole merger.[13]As of December\u00a02018, eleven\u00a0gravitational wave events\u00a0have been observed that originated from ten merging black holes (along with one binary\u00a0neutron star merger).[14][15]\u00a0On 10 April 2019, the first ever direct image of a black hole and its vicinity was published, following observations made by the\u00a0Event Horizon Telescope\u00a0in 2017 of the\u00a0supermassive\u00a0black hole in\u00a0Messier 87&#39;s\u00a0galactic centre.", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T14:13:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "The Comment", "comment_text": "But do you have any...PROOF?", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T13:51:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "3m3rz0n", "comment_text": "guess ill die", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T13:32:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ishi is Busy", "comment_text": "DO NOT TRY TO STAND ON A BLACK HOLE<br><br><b>Don&#39;t tell me what to do.</b>", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T12:45:01Z", "likes_count": 882}, {"comment_by": "duramax", "comment_text": "I guess id just die", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T12:05:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Thunder Stone", "comment_text": "why does the black jole have a shadow amd a glow to it?", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T10:36:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Comend", "comment_text": "xD <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nHBGFKLHZQ&amp;t=2m49s\">2:49</a>", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T09:53:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chief Leef", "comment_text": "Short story-&quot;We&#39;ll die&quot;<br>Long story-<b>ok lets get some views</b>", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T08:57:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manuel RVS", "comment_text": "Could a black hole that size be pushed away?", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T08:54:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kLmao!", "comment_text": "i just noticed this<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>kame...hame...HA=<br>kamehameHA", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T08:42:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ranu Mehra", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nHBGFKLHZQ&amp;t=0m43s\">0:43</a> notice that Dragon ballz kame hame ha ?", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T08:41:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mack", "comment_text": "I saw that doctor who tardis haha", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T08:06:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "simplified pinoy", "comment_text": "why do you use birdes??", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T05:36:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blue Falcons Suck", "comment_text": "What does this guy have against my coin?...

Hawking said that that sub-atomic black holes would very quickly radiate away it&#39;s mass and evaporate away. There was also the concept that the LHC might also be able to create a sub-atomic black hole if the universe has more than the 4 dimensions that we know of. Let&#39;s say that&#39;s true for a moment, and the LHC is fine tuned to create a sub-atomic black hole in one of it&#39;s collisions. Would the sub-atomic black hole then evaporate and release enough radiation to triple the power of the first atomic weapons?

There are 2 possibilities, neither of which are what you think. The first possibility is that it would initiate false vacuum decay, which would destroy the entire universe. Look &quot;false vacuum decay&quot; on wikipedia, if you want. The second possibility is that it would explode, but it wouldn&#39;t be like you&#39;re expecting. You see, its explosion would be primarily in the form of photons, and those photons would individually have more energy than anything we have any experience with. They would be FAR, FAR more energetic than gamma rays. And they would not interact with ordinary matter very frequently. They wouldn&#39;t be quite as penetrating as neutrinos, but they would probably pass straight through all the nearby matter, possibly through the entire Earth, without being absorbed. That which was pointed up would probably go straight through the atmosphere and out into space, and that which was pointed down would probably be absorbed miles down or go all the way through the Earth and out the other side. Remember, the planck mass is 22 micrograms. So the typical energy per photon at the beginning of the decay process of the black hole would be approximately that squared divided by the mass of the black hole at the beginning (5 grams). So we&#39;re talking about a burst of just a few million photons, each one having an energy of 5 kilojoules up to the Planck Mass or about 1.8 gigajoules. We&#39;re talking single photons with the energy of maybe a stick of dynamite, which can travel miles through solid rock before being absorbed. The &quot;explosion&quot; would be like nothing humans have any experience with. The energy in forms that could actually be absorbed more easily would be much smaller. It still would be devastating to be RIGHT next to, but it wouldn&#39;t be nearly as strong as a nuclear bomb for all intents and purposes. It&#39;s either that or it destoys the entire universe as we know it.
