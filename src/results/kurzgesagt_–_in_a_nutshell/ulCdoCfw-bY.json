And that seems key to me; we&#39;re always trailing in the wake of the sun.  How do you get in front of the sun?  And then, if you do manage to like, use a slingshot maneuver to get ahead of the sun, how do you slow it down to match the sun&#39;s velocity as it circles the galaxy&#39;s center?  Once you pass the sun, you need your Dyson Sphere bits to match speed so that they can stay positioned in front instead of speeding off where you can&#39;t attach them to the rest of the sphere.  Same thing applies to a black hole, which would also be moving at absurd rates of speed  Setting up this giant mirror outside the ergosphere would involve assembling pieces around an object that&#39;s hurtling through space at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour and pissing out lethal radiation and oh, by the way, you need to get this all assembled before the pieces spiral into the event horizon, so the clock is ticking.  Not to mention, a 10cm thick sphere around a galactic supermassive black hole... I don&#39;t even know how much matter that would take (suppose it depends entirely on the radius of the sphere), but that has to be like whole ass star systems worth of mass, and not in abundant elements like H or He, but in metals, and I have to imagine that it&#39;s important that your reflectivity is pretty consistent throughout, so you can&#39;t just use whatever metals you can find laying about.  And then if that mirrored sphere is impacted by large space debris, or shot through by a primordial black hole (which seems far more likely than the low probability of one passing through the Earth, given that the mirror would be many, many times larger than our little green-and-blue speck).  I realize that I am as layman as layman gets, but the technological challenges that would need to be overcome seem unsurmountable to me.", "comment_date": "2021-09-08T10:06:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shardmode 999", "comment_text": "zeno will destroy it with one snap of his finger its no match for zeno", "comment_date": "2021-09-08T06:16:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Giggle & Jack Show", "comment_text": "Omg", "comment_date": "2021-09-08T04:02:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Giggle & Jack Show", "comment_text": "BIG BIG POO!", "comment_date": "2021-09-08T04:02:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "reg ryan", "comment_text": "The", "comment_date": "2021-09-08T03:00:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LAURA HERNANDEZ", "comment_text": "No", "comment_date": "2021-09-08T01:49:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TALAL baddawi", "comment_text": "like the intro like your vidois(:", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T15:04:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "E7leopard", "comment_text": "Kurzsegazt has simpsons in it<br><br>He predicts this will happen", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T01:38:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ChillProduction", "comment_text": "why drop asteroids into black hole when we can just drop garbage produced by humans", "comment_date": "2021-09-06T20:31:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yexel", "comment_text": "Am i the only person who understands this?

Wouldn&#39;t it be too dangerous to try and use such high kinetic force to power Earth? Isn&#39;t just one beam of the speedy energy enough to power the whole planet?

It&#39;s actually impossible! I&#39;m an engineer. Let me explain. <br><br>If the dyson sphere stood still it would be an unstable configuration and fall into the black hole on the side where it was closest to the black hole. You can&#39;t change the position of the black hole since it&#39;s so much larger, so you will need to constantly move the dyson sphere in order to keep it from falling into the black hole on one side. The amount of energy required to push the dyson sphere away from the black hole is ludicrous and probably more than you will receive from the power generation. <br><br>If you want the dyson sphere somewhat stable and keep it from falling into the black hole, you can try to make the dyson sphere spin with an rotational velocity high enough to make it orbit the black hole. Once it&#39;s in orbit, you won&#39;t need to constantly keep it up. However, if you want keep the dyson sphere close to the black hole, then it will be so close that the orbital velocity becomes close to the speed of light, so you will need an ludicrous amount of energy to spin it that fast in the first place. <br><br>Even worse, the dyson sphere would still be unstable at its poles since the parts one poles aren&#39;t spinning around a legal orbit. This means that they would have a natural tendency to fall into the black hole. To keep the poles from falling down, you will need to keep them upright by structurally supporting them by letting the orbital equator of the dyson sphere take the load &quot;sideways&quot;; like a bridge, only around and over the pole. However, this bridge will need to be strong enough to support 16 million tons of downwards pull on each square centimeter (given that you orbit close to a small black hole). There is no material which is strong enough to support it! So, every part of the dyson sphere which is not perfectly aligned with the equator will be spagettified and fall down into the black hole. <br><br>The only way to combat this spaghettification is to build a large dyson sphere reaching far away outside of the black hole. However, the net pull on the entire structure would still be the same, so it would still require a ludicrous amount of structural material to support it - as well as already being big in the first place. In that case you will need even more material, and even more energy to spin it, and so on.<br><br>Furthermore, when the sphere becomes this big, it will lose its purpose! When a light photon hits a mirror, some of its energy gets absorbed, say 5% or so.

Will the sun never ever change its polarity, after the 48th (final) cycle?<br>8.

Earth still sits on its chunk of space, but instead of it having a pull, its mass distorts space, resulting in a bend in space and space around it rotating, of course this would be the orbiting of the moon, due to the distortion, it parallels to the absorption of light, light take roughly 8 minutes to travel to earth, this is because of how earth affects space, for light, it is constantly time traveling, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 8 minutes or 8 billion years for it to travel to a mass, it feels the same to light because it can\u2019t accelerate or slow its self down due to the weightlessness of its photons. When the distortion happens, the perception we call time is most definitely affected, \u201ctime\u201d is much slower the further away from the center of the distortion you go, look into the twin theory for proof. The way I see it, the only way we can divide pass present and future is the measurement of light, and the perception of change to realize what happened yesterday and last year.

that being a gass planet not realy a planet but not realy a start. this way it is relatively smal but stil has the mass to make some light. to my smal amount of knolage of you buidl a mirror reflecting as mutch of the energy as possible wil this gass planet/star heat up generating more energy as now less energy escapes and is instead reflected therby making it hotter and makign it simpler to make mroe energy. and mabye you dont need to completly vcover it in reflectors rather starting by creating a structure orbiting it this way it only need the strength to keep itself together as the orbit keeps it wel in orbit. then expanding this ring until you reatch the desired amount of reflectors increasing the stars temperature and energy output to your needs then adding another direction to its orbit so the ring does not jsut spinn like a ring but in 2 directions. this way yo ucan slowly build a complete sphere around the start supported by orbiting the star and having energy colectors and mirrors cover the star and when you need mroe energy simply turn a energy colector into a reflector therby increasing the power output of the star and if you need less energy flip mroe reflectors to energy absorbers to lower the energy output of the star. using a star with the lowest energy output as possible mgiht be the best option for this.<br><br>or mabye you can potentialy create a star otue of jupiter. building the ocmplete structure. tho while building it you wil msot likely get no energy but you ony need to ignite jupiter while not a ismple task it might be in the far far future. mabye drop some nuclear bombs into the core of jupiter and start some fusion activety in there while this alone wil not ignite jhupiter as is it might be all it need to get it started with all the reflectors. or it jupiter is actualy emmiting energy as it is you might only need to build the sphere to ignite jupiter properly as if it is emiting any kind of energy that being mroe energy than it gets form outside it might be all you require to reflect back and create a energy loop to ignite jupiter and have a local pwoer sorce. and ifthis is true then potentialy every gass giant otue there might be a potential battery for the future and instead of blocking otue the sun simply capture the local gass giant build a spere around it and get all your energy needs form

The term was coined by Wolfgang Rindler.[1]\r<br>\r<br>In 1784, John Michell proposed that near compact massive objects, gravity can be strong enough that even light cannot escape. At that time, the Newtonian theory of gravitation and the so-called corpuscular theory of light were dominant. In these theories, if the escape speed of an object exceeds the speed of light, then light originating inside or from it can escape temporarily but will return. In 1958, David Finkelstein used General Relativity to introduce a stricter definition of a local black hole event horizon as a boundary beyond which events of any kind cannot affect an outside observer. This led to information and firewall paradoxes, which encouraged the re-examination of the concept of local event horizons and the notion of black holes. Several theories were subsequently developed, some with and some without event horizons. Stephen Hawking, who was one of the leading developers of theories to describe black holes, suggested that an apparent horizon should be used instead of an event horizon, saying &quot;gravitational collapse produces apparent horizons but no event horizons&quot;. He eventually concluded that &quot;the absence of event horizons mean that there are no black holes \u2013 in the sense of regimes from which light can&#39;t escape to infinity.&quot;[2][3] This does not mean denying the existence of black holes, it merely expresses the distrust towards the conventional strict definition of the event horizon.\r<br>Any object that approaches the horizon from the observer&#39;s side appears to slow down and never quite crosses the horizon.[4] Due to gravitational redshift, its image reddens over time as the object moves away from the observer.[5]\r<br>In an expanding universe the speed of expansion reaches and even exceeds the speed of light, which prevents signals from travelling to some regions. A cosmic event horizon is a real event horizon because it affects all kinds of signals, including gravitational waves which travel at the speed of light.\r<br><br>science hype. &gt;:3", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T06:39:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "calicth", "comment_text": "black hole bomb is &quot;unstable matter bomb&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T02:37:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NUKL3AR", "comment_text": "It\u2019s strange that the ducks are good to kurzgesat and the mice are devils", "comment_date": "2020-10-26T13:15:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheEquestrianHound", "comment_text": "S T O P   G I V I N G   2 0 2 0   I D E A S", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T03:56:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Game Casters", "comment_text": "Person in charge of releasing built up energy: &quot;falls asleep on shift&quot;<br><br><b>Accidently nukes the universe</b>", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T03:08:28Z", "likes_count": 895}, {"comment_by": "L Guaire", "comment_text": "I&#39;m convinced we&#39;re already in a black hole.", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T18:45:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Felixenhae Oof", "comment_text": "Nobody:<br><br>Me: <b>Feeling smart because binge this channel</b>", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T17:02:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ZenGames", "comment_text": "If the person in the future sees this video i might be dead", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T09:05:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IronBubba Studios", "comment_text": "I mean, after the universe dies, we can use the energy from black holes to make a new universe, so humanity will never die, and we\u2019ll live on forever", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T02:13:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Tate", "comment_text": "It\u2019s like astronomical necromancy", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T00:08:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Taha Mahwi", "comment_text": "This video puts you to sleep", "comment_date": "2020-10-23T21:15:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BBC OF MEMES", "comment_text": "What if black holes takes you to heaven \ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2020-10-23T16:34:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lalapopsy", "comment_text": "As if black holes weren&#39;t destructive enough by themselves.", "comment_date": "2020-10-22T22:33:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Origami Masters", "comment_text": "The only people capable of this power, Pinkie and the Brain.", "comment_date": "2020-10-22T21:21:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Yathish s", "comment_text": "First, we used gravity and then wood and then fossil fuels, then chemical energy, and then atomic energy, and then solar and wind energy .....in future we will only be left with angular momentum energy???", "comment_date": "2020-10-22T11:49:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ok", "comment_text": "Stop giving illogical comments", "comment_date": "2020-10-22T11:38:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KABALI 007", "comment_text": "Black hole is Pacman in real life?", "comment_date": "2020-10-22T06:51:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yri", "comment_text": "This video is outdated as it was scientifically proven that black holes evaporate.

You are talking about a KERR type black whole which is the most common in universe (actually the only one certain to be existing) but the Swarzchild type of black whole is still theorically possible. And in that type of black whole, the singularity is not a point in space it&#39;s a moment in time. When you enter a black whole you can imagine (although is not exactly like that) that the space-time has bended so much that space is now time and time is now space. That makes that the event horizon you just crossed is no longer behind you, instead is in your past and the  singularity is not in front of you, it&#39;s in your future. If you wanted to search for that singularity point in space, you wouldn&#39;t find it anywhere because it&#39;s nowhere, it&#39;s in your future. Similar things happen to the KERR type (the one you are talking about) it&#39;s true that there is a ringularity that is actually somewhere in space in this type of black whole, but that ringularity is surrounded by something called the &quot;Cauchy horizon&quot; that is a barrier in which classical physics just can&#39;t handle it anymore. But that Cauchy horizon is really really unstable, it&#39;s like trying to keep a pencil verticalin a table only by equilibrium of his top...any small interference will make it fall. Same applies to that Cauchy horizon, something interacting with the black whole will make it fall, you playing around in the ergosphere is more than enough to do that. Once that Cauchy horizon is fallen, the ringularity stops being a ring in a place and comes back to being a moment in time. So in practical situations, if you want to go find that ringularity, you won&#39;t, the simple act of you falling into the black whole will make that ringularity &quot;dissapear&quot; from where it is and it will become a moment in your future. <br><br>For the rest...good job!", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T23:12:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lord Zabuza", "comment_text": "How many  birds  does  one  have  to  killed.", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T21:06:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hemicat15 Gaming", "comment_text": "Pinky and the Brain", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T16:57:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BMGipe45", "comment_text": "&quot;... something very big becomes very, very tiny...&quot; The life of a grower", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T15:22:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Acharndael", "comment_text": "Stellaris : Megastructres", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T13:44:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Galactic Wolf", "comment_text": "PREDICTIONS;<br><br>1790:Quantum computing <br><br>1890:Flying cars<br><br>1990:Go to Moon<br><br>2018:Moon base<br><br>2019:Fusion energy<br><br>2020:Mars base<br><br>2035:Ring world <br><br>2048:Dyson sphere<br><br>2099:Stellar engine<br><br>5000:Black hole bomb<br><br>10000:Controlling  Neutron stars and making new world<br><br>TRUTH;<br><br>Modern:Try to use renewable energy and  war over countries and stay quarantined cuz of COVID-19 or coronavirus-2.", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T11:58:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheDuckyDuck", "comment_text": "i used to think kurzgesagt liked birds, but now i realise they actually hate birds considering how many they kill in every video", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T10:55:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bootleg Sans", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulCdoCfw-bY&amp;t=2m22s\">2:22</a> Time before \u201cZA WARUDO\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T10:21:09Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "goodguy", "comment_text": "This is all just speculation and nonsense .

Yes you could put something into its orbit, but it isnt actually the object that attains any momentum, it just stands still as the space around it moves around the black hole, any object trying to utilize this momentum would also move with the same momentum and there is no entropy gradient to use.<br><br>the most applicable way to use a black hole as energy source is to create one as a form of battery, by preventing as much energy loss due to hawking radiation as possible, while keeping it microscopic. Due to hawking radiation, small black holes emit enormous amounts of thermal radiation that can be harnessed, and it depends on the mass of the black hole.<br><br>by feeding the black hole &quot;stuff&quot; in some form or manner, you can convert anything you toss into it to thermal radiation with 100% efficiency. Its basically a matter-energy converter.<br>key issue here is containing the energy output of a microscopic black hole and somehow being able to also drop matter into it consistently to prevent the microscopic black hole from shrinking too fast and in essence turning into the largest bomb you could possible build.<br><br>once you leave the ergosphere your speed relative to the black hole would decrease as you leave the space that is whirling around it unless you remove part of your space ship to drop into the black hole, a process you cant do with photons for energy creation. Additionaly, the angular momentum decreases everytime you do this and will reduce the amount of energy you could potentially gain with the penrose trade, it will at some point cease, transforming it into a non rotating black hole and making it impossible to gain any energy this way. Worth noting for the idea of bouncing light in a mirror is that this too drains angular momentum (if it were possible) and light would follow an arced curve along spacetime. It is impossible to make light bounce in curved space without eventually falling into the black hole itself, losing all the &quot;potential&quot; energy gained.", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T17:15:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danilo Djurica", "comment_text": "I hope someone make game with these animations and humans trying to evolve", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T16:49:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian janssens", "comment_text": "Too late to explore the world...<br>Too early to explore the universe...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Alright, lets conquer the world then!", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:17:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian janssens", "comment_text": "Black hole bomb : <b>Exists</b><br>US Government: <b>ITS FREE REAL ESTATE</b>", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:13:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L2\ud83d\udc7e", "comment_text": "Black holes are hackers.", "comment_date": "2020-02-29T22:32:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Handsome Harold", "comment_text": "feel bad for the deaths", "comment_date": "2020-02-29T17:16:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Handsome Harold", "comment_text": "STOP!<br><br><br><br><br>no", "comment_date": "2020-02-29T17:15:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PatrickXp", "comment_text": "i have wachde all of the kurzgesagt!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2020-02-29T16:43:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Austin Blair", "comment_text": "Me and my friend being socialy awkward: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulCdoCfw-bY&amp;t=9m07s\">9:07</a>", "comment_date": "2020-02-28T21:53:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "iver", "comment_text": "How would you actually collect the energy from the rocket/asteroid?", "comment_date": "2020-02-28T21:47:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mayo And Ketchup", "comment_text": "No one:<br><br><br><br>Every astrology video of kurzgesagt:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>ENerGy</b>", "comment_date": "2020-02-28T20:27:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dutch Doggo", "comment_text": "black hole drive", "comment_date": "2020-02-28T13:14:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ASM Kalrizion", "comment_text": "Imagine if black holes were actually civilizations that reach an ultimate level of technology and just leave reality.", "comment_date": "2020-02-28T11:50:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ar Nett", "comment_text": "As if I am not terrified enough.

It is equally possible that galaxies and stars recycle themselves endlessly and that the actual age of the universe is a trillion trillion trillion trillion years rather than the paltry 13 billion years they estimate.  It does this through constantly recycling matter into light and light back into matter. Matter slowly leaks away as EM radiation, and at the same time EM radiation is recycled into matter and energizes it.  The end result is that the net total of energy neither increases nor decreases. <br><br>Photons released as matter decays don&#39;t just radiate away blindly in every direction, never to be seen again. Instead, it flows in magnetic channels, travelling along giant galactic magnetic field lines and entering into the magnetic poles of charged matter. So the light that is emitted out of stars and the light that matter decays into as it dies doesn&#39;t just go off into the distance in a straight line but rather loops back into the creation of new matter. <br><br>  Even if all the matter in the universe became pure photons, collisions between x-ray and gamma ray photons would once again create electrons and protons, which would be snapped together by photon charge channeling, and creating new magnetic fields which would draw in more photons to create more protons and electrons and eventually gravity would form new stars.   But there&#39;s no reason to assume that all matter will die at the same time because it wasn&#39;t created at the same time -- instead, the universe is dying, and being reformed and recycled as we speak.

Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed.[9]\u00a0In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal\u00a0black body, as it reflects no light.[10][11]\u00a0Moreover,\u00a0quantum field theory in curved spacetime\u00a0predicts that event horizons emit\u00a0Hawking radiation, with\u00a0the same spectrum\u00a0as a\u00a0black body\u00a0of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for\u00a0black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.<br><br>Objects whose\u00a0gravitational fields\u00a0are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by\u00a0John Michell\u00a0and\u00a0Pierre-Simon Laplace.[12]\u00a0The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by\u00a0Karl Schwarzschild\u00a0in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by\u00a0David Finkelstein\u00a0in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of\u00a0neutron stars\u00a0by\u00a0Jocelyn Bell Burnell\u00a0in 1967 sparked interest in\u00a0gravitationally collapsed\u00a0compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality.<br><br>Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes,\u00a0supermassive black holes\u00a0of millions of\u00a0solar masses\u00a0(M\u2609) may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most\u00a0galaxies.<br><br>Despite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other\u00a0matter\u00a0and with\u00a0electromagnetic radiation\u00a0such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external\u00a0accretion disk\u00a0heated by friction, forming some of the\u00a0brightest objects in the universe. If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole&#39;s mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in\u00a0binary systems, and established that the radio source known as\u00a0Sagittarius A*, at the core of the\u00a0Milky Way\u00a0galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million\u00a0solar masses.<br><br>On 11 February 2016, the\u00a0LIGO\u00a0collaboration\u00a0announced the first direct detection\u00a0of\u00a0gravitational waves, which also represented the first observation of a black hole merger.[13]As of December\u00a02018, eleven\u00a0gravitational wave events\u00a0have been observed that originated from ten merging black holes (along with one binary\u00a0neutron star merger).[14][15]\u00a0On 10 April 2019, the first ever direct image of a black hole and its vicinity was published, following observations made by the\u00a0Event Horizon Telescope\u00a0in 2017 of the\u00a0supermassive\u00a0black hole in\u00a0Messier 87&#39;s\u00a0galactic centre.", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T14:12:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Adkins", "comment_text": "We could get rid of so much trash by yeeting all our plastic into a black hole", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T13:07:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gk4thewin 04", "comment_text": "The universe still terrifies me to all hell", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T12:27:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JaySliZe", "comment_text": "It\u2019s interesting to come back to this video after we know what a black hole finally looks like", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T11:35:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Torterra Plays Mc", "comment_text": "This would be soo soooo far in the future though.

Whilst we are making enough food to survive by plants and other Technologies, we are also generating hydrogen for a important reason, but we are doing so very slow, so we need to filter urine, so we make another place to urine in residential living spaces to filter urine to make water to seperate into hydrogen and oxygen that will go into storage and uses, and the rest of the matter from filtering the uring will be used for other stuff, lets say we are now generating 1 ton of hydrogen per year . Since it has been a few 1,000,000,000 years, we have more humans, so, we need more oxygen thus we build more plant storing things to make more resourses thus increasing production. Now lets say that we are now producing 10 tons of hydrogen per year. We can use this hydrogen to make a artifical star to lighten up the universe when we need it, but this will cost 600 million tons of hydrogen to make a star the size of our sun,  fournately, we have about 5 billion tons of hydrogen in storage.

It seems to me that nothing can enter a black hole because everything is made out of the imagination of a conscious singularity represented by what we see as black holes or the nuclei of anything, from the proton of the atom to the RNA of a cell to Heart of man and all vortices that are above and below that exists within a single vortex whose nucleus is a point that contains all that exists. I used to ask, Why would there be anything but I now believe that there isn&#39;t anything but somehow nothing will inevitably become consciously aware. A wise man once noted, a point is a thing of which there are no parts. It seems that nothing can enter a black hole because there is no place to enter or any place to stay if it did enter. The mass of a black hole is determined by us by the measure of the gravitational effect caused by the mass that orbits it between the event horizon and the singularity, very much like the outer valence of an atom, or the boundary of the electron cloud. Nassim Haramein said, The entire mass of the Universe can be found within any proton. My thoughts are heavily influenced by the Flower of Life which I believe is the blue print for all that exists in this physical reality. I found the Flower of Life shortly after a profound experience in meditation when I asked the Universe, how can the Holy Spirit be everywhere at the same time. I had never heard of or remember seeing the Flower of Life anywhere, ever but I&#39;ve seen it in many places and here it mentioned everyday ever since.

Problems from this idea arises from these reasons: 1) Mirrors don&#39;t reflect all light, some portion is absorbed. 2) Mirrors don&#39;t reflect all wavelengths equally. The materials we use for mirrors reflect the wavelengths we can see, hence why we used them. 3) Mirrors aren&#39;t indestructible.<br><br>The problem is that when you amplify the EM waves, they blue-shift and their amplitude gets larger. This means more energy per photon. Because mirrors absorb part of the energy, and don&#39;t reflect all wavelengths equally, there comes a point that either a mirror would melt from the energy it&#39;s absorbing, and/or the wavelength is shifted to a point where they no longer reflect off the mirror surface. The mirror container would either melt long before the bomb goes off, or fail to cause any more reflection.", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T18:53:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "david loya", "comment_text": "this videos man, jesus fuck", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T18:20:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sa\u0161a Savi\u0107", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulCdoCfw-bY&amp;t=0m20s\">0:20</a> is this Starcraft 2 ? xD (Protos)", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T18:10:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roo PlayZ", "comment_text": "Ok soooo..... space whirlpools?<br><br><br><br><br><br>oh god", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T17:46:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Corrick", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulCdoCfw-bY&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a> is that an inception reference?

Black holes eventually disperse the mass and energy they took over the span of their existence, it just take&#39;s a very long time. Black holes have an epicenter of mass, that builds up over time the sheer gravity force of the epicenter pulls forward anything the draws near and absorbs it into the center, black holes don&#39;t lead anywhere, their just the result of a collapsing super cell, all planets and stars have gravity, and a black hole is like a concentrated blast of that gravity over an extremely long time, but eventually the energy dissipates and releases it back into the universe. I used to think that they existed forever and that worried me, but thankfully before mr hawkings passed he was able to prove that they in fact don&#39;t last forever, what&#39;s also surprising is that technically, even if a spacecraft got too close to a black hole, it&#39;s entirely possible that the people aboard the ship could infact live out their entire lives just rotating around the rim, because apparently most black holes take several hundred years to send debris from the rim to the center. Couple other facts, there are several 100 billion planets and stars in the milky way galaxy (our galaxy) and there are about 100 million black holes, which means that roughly 0.002-0.003% of our galaxy&#39;s planets and stars have died, meaning were fairly new even though our planet is roughly 4.5 billion years old, this goes beyond the black hole concept here, but if we take into consideration the age of our galaxy and our planet and the known galaxies outside of our own, there is a higher chance for more developed alien life, just saying. Back to topic. at the very centre of the milky way there is a black hole dubbed &#39;Sagittarius A&#39;, it will take several quadrillion years to disperse. The smaller the black hole the shorter it&#39;s life span. On the plus side earth is safe, at least for roughly 1600 light years. Also we can&#39;t actually see black holes but we can see their rims and detect their gravity anomaly. Really puts things into perspective, i like the theory that with some very advanced technology (advanced compared to ours) that aliens might be able to harness and thus shorten the lifespan of black holes. But i&#39;m more concerend with the fact that there is most likely just a huge empty void of space from the center of the big bang now, possibly followed by an outer shell filled with clusters of black holes, expanding outward&#39;s to the oldest dying planets and stars in the universe, it just means that eventually the milky way will become a field of black holes and emptiness too. They say space is infinite so really what were looking at is a race to stay within the recently created expanse of space. But who really knows, we don&#39;t have any scientific evidence of the event&#39;s that happen after a black hole dissolves, do they have miniature big bangs with huge releases of energy and mass that can create stars and super cells and planets all over again? If so, space is just like the immortal jellyfish infinitely dying and regenerating all over again.", "comment_date": "2018-05-01T17:43:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jorge C.

You&#39;d end up with local nuclear bomb-scale explosions at the joints, and not a supernova-scale failure of the entire mirror at once. 2. This ablation reaction force would also limit the useful life of the mirrors. 3. The backside of the mirrors would radiate like a black body.

The impact destroyed about 1/5 of earth&#39;s inhabitants and lightly damaged mirrors shape. What really caused the extinction of all majestic was the layer of inner earth&#39;s surface that cracked-off, caused by the meteorite impact from the outer surface of earth.

You getting the picture? Something is deeply wrong with our world.<br><br>None of what you see going on in the world is normal or good. In fact, much of what you see happening around the globe coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says many of these things would occur before Christ returns. You can investigate it for yourself. The Bible says in the last days there will be: wars and rumors of war; a one world economic/governmental/religious system; Kingdoms against kingdoms and the seas and people raging; Violence and perversion on a grand scale; Earthquakes in diverse places, etc.<br><br>... Sounds <b>exactly</b> like our world today, doesn&#39;t it? If that weren&#39;t enough to chew on, consider this: The Books of John and Acts combined total up to over 120+ historically verified facts. When you consider that, it gets a little difficult to write the Bible off as fairy tales when history and archaeology are on its side...<br><br><b>Are you paying attention yet?</b> God is <b>screaming</b> at us! He warned us thousands of years in advance that all of what you are seeing would happen- and it is! It&#39;s all coming together to the letter! In fact, if you doubt the validity of Bible Prophecy, I encourage you to consider this: the Bible warns that in the last days that Damascus will become &quot;a ruinous heap.&quot; It will become a no man&#39;s land inhabited by no one. Use that as a litmus test of sorts. Keep an eye on Damascus. If it never falls then feel free to throw out the Bible. But when Damascus does fall in the not too distant future... You&#39;ll see God is no liar. God also declares that the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus as your Savior. Good deeds won&#39;t get you there nor do good deeds erase a bad deed. If you murder somebody, that person is still dead even if you do nothing but good deeds after murdering them. You need a Savior who will forgive you of that murder because you can&#39;t save yourself.<br><br>Yet, many people will still discount God and His goodness even when shown evidence that the Bible is valid and coming true. A lot of people have difficulty believing in God because of all the evils in the world. However, this discounting of the only Person who can save you may be less of an inborn frustration or complaint and more of a hidden longing, placed there by the very One who planted His own image into the body and soul of every person He created. Where does this deep-seated intuition that suffering and pain are not right come from if we&#39;re just amalgamations of atoms, as the atheists say\u2026?<br><br>What if, perhaps, this intuition points to something deeper? Something built into ourselves that reflects our true nature and identity? What if this revulsion against suffering and pain is a reminder of paradise, on one hand, and an anticipation of New Jerusalem on the other?<br><br>Perhaps it&#39;s the cry of the human spirit for God. For our Creator. The only One who can, and will, fix this mess.<br><br>As I&#39;ve said, time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, &quot;You&#39;re just being paranoid like all the other fundamentalists. Haven&#39;t we always had these types of problems?&quot; Sure... But never at this magnitude or frequency! Check the news for yourselves. The amount of earthquakes, bloodshed, madness and horrific weather events are off the charts! Don&#39;t be deceived into thinking it&#39;s not as bad as it seems out there. The devil wants you to stay anemic and apathetic. Don&#39;t let that jerk deceive you. Or win your soul. Satan wants nothing more than for you to roll your eyes, scoff under your breath and put this whole &quot;God&quot; business under the rug. He wants you to continue believing that Hell and God and the afterlife is nonsense. That the Bible is all fairy tale nonsense of Jesus riding dinosaurs; that it&#39;s stuff only the weak-minded, brainwashed people believe. He&#39;ll gladly coax your pride, making you believe you&#39;re far too &quot;reasoned&quot; to believe in such things. However, Satan believes the Bible. Every jot and word of it. He doesn&#39;t see it as fairy-tale nonsense since it details his coming destruction. He just doesn&#39;t want YOU to believe it so he can drag your soul down with him when it&#39;s time for him to go!<br><br>Don&#39;t let him drag you down into the grave with him. Don&#39;t be played! Hell is a very real place-- a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. A-L-O-N-E. In the dark. Miserable for all eternity. If hell wasn&#39;t real, what on earth was Jesus willing to die for to protect us from...? Bill Nye thinks hell won&#39;t be so bad; he claims he&#39;s willing to hold onto his darwinian beliefs even if it means he&#39;s hellbound for it. I hope you won&#39;t share in that kind of disillusioned thinking...<br><br>Before you&#39;re sent to hell, you&#39;ll appear at the Great White Throne Judgment. Whether you believe in hell or not makes no difference--that giant throne you want to avoid seeing at all costs will be your destiny if Christ isn&#39;t your Savior. At the Great White Throne Judgment the books are thrown wide open and the past is recalled. Details and sins long forgotten or covered up are brought to light. Plenty of people will have a list of good deeds: acts of charity, love, and sacrifice. All their good deeds will be carefully considered... but none of them will be good enough to gain them admittance into heaven. The good deeds they did will have an impact on where they end up in the lake of fire, however. Hell will not be the same for everyone, but it will still be eternal misery... misery you could have easily avoided.<br><br>Sinners will wish they had done just a little less evil so their punishment could be a little more tolerable. Pornographers will wish they hadn&#39;t made so many videos. Control freaks will wish they hadn&#39;t been so angry and abusive. The internet troll will wish he hadn&#39;t cursed and slung so many demeaning insults toward a stranger online. And the abortionist will wish they hadn&#39;t killed any pre-born infants. All sins will be exposed. There&#39;s no way out... unless...<br><br>Unless you accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you&#39;re a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His free gift of salvation and grace. It&#39;s all yours... free for the taking! Jesus is the only way to get out of what&#39;s coming soon upon this world. I know you&#39;ve probably heard &quot;Jesus loves you&quot; a million times in your life, and it probably sounds like an empty mantra by now... but it really is the truth! Do you know why you exist? Have you ever stopped and pondered about that...? Nothing in this life comes to be without God&#39;s approval first. That means that God thought\u00a0 you were so worth the effort that He created you!<br><br>Or maybe you&#39;re wondering, &quot;How do I know that only Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or what about Hinduism or Buddhism? How do I know that the Bible isn&#39;t a book of fiction and myths? In fact, what about all the starving kids in Africa? If God is so &quot;just and loving,&quot; explain that one!&quot; These are incredibly valid questions that deserve real answers. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with?<br><br>If you have deep questions related to God, or if you&#39;re just remotely curious about Him... I encourage you to search out these authors. I&#39;ll even list some of their books that address just about any issue or question you could have about God:<br><br>Frank Turek- &quot;Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case&quot;<br><br>Andreas Kostenberger- &quot;Truth Matters&quot;<br><br>Louis Markos- &quot;Apologetics for the 21st Century&quot;<br><br>Norman L. Geisler- &quot;When Skeptics Ask,&quot; &quot;I Don&#39;t Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist&quot;<br><br>C.S. Lewis- &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;<br><br>Lee Strobel- &quot;The Case For Christ,&quot; &quot;The Case For A Creator,&quot; &quot;The Case For Grace&quot;<br><br>Ravi Zacharias- &quot;The End of Reason,&quot; &quot;Jesus Among Other Gods,&quot; &quot;Can Man Live Without God?&quot; &quot;Why Suffering?&quot;<br><br>Philip Yancey- &quot;Reaching For The Invisible God,&quot; &quot;Disappointment With God&quot;<br><br>Also, the &quot;One Minute Apologist&quot; right here on YouTube offers quick videos that tackle tough questions about God.<br><br>**<br><br>Why am I telling you all this? Especially when this has absolutely nothing to do with the video you&#39;re watching? Simple: to warn you. To offer you a life line. Deep down, if you have discernment and common sense, you can tell something is dreadfully wrong with this world and something in your heart is telling you to get right with God before it&#39;s too late. Don&#39;t ignore that voice! Listen to it, no matter how small it is. I&#39;m just a beggar telling other beggars where they can go to find the Bread of Life.<br><br>Don&#39;t let anything stop you from finding God. To quote Erwin Lutzer: &quot;Standing at the Great White Throne Judgment will be hordes from every country of the world, from every religion in the world, with the best intentions in the world. They will learn too late that God is serious about justice, and if Christ does not bear their punishment, they must bear their own.&quot;<br><br>Don&#39;t lose your life!

There are quite a few black holes that are very large. There are humungus black holes that we could not possibly build items around with the materials on earth, and it would take alot of materials from outside planets and asteroids to collect enough materials. 2. Black holes are very strong, and I know this is common knowledge, but black holes would have a strong pull on anything, even if it is outside of the point of no return. We would have to line up these mirrors very precisely, and very carefully, so that we do not end up smashing our giant mirrors together and having them sink into the blackhole, as well as the technology used to get these giant mirrors there, and many lives. 3.

I think this can really get people&#39;s brains going, and I really enjoyed this video. This video is a prime example of why the internet is not all bad.

Similar problems with charged black holes, though since they are likely to not exist it is less pressing.  Another question I had was about the possibility that a single photon or a small group of photons  could be given enough energy to collapse into a black hole, and the answer that arose was that the machine itself would collapse into a black hole, however this black hole bomb solution seems to fix that issue, since the mechanism is itself still a black hole.  I imagine the problem would become that the moment the photon collapsed it would immediately lose that extra energy to virtual particles. It may be possible with multiple groups of these hyper powered gamma rays. I am curious what you think of these ideas.

So, if you eat, say, Mercury and all of its delicious iron core and oxygen crust you can make enough reflective hematite to power huge mazers/lazers and focus +/- 10% of the Sun&#39;s output onto about an atometer, then you can feed mass into and harvest the hawking radiation from that tiny black hole.

First of all we know that the most massive thing in our solar system (hint hint) is Sol, or the sun to put it in terms people use everyday. This gives off more than enough energy to power whatever the hell is happening on our entire pebble of a planet, yet we are nowhere near being able to capture it any more than needed to send a few students in homemade cars across Australia. But let&#39;s forget about the sun, and all that gravity keeping the solar system together, and let&#39;s just focus our attention on a black hole. Without even considering that the gravity of a black hole is so massive (pun intended) not even light can escape it, the closest one we know of is about 3000 light years away. So whenever those students racing across Australia encapsulate the sun to power some space-station-mirror-factory capable of traveling at the speed of light it will STILL TAKE 3000 YEARS before they get there.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s easier to build a mirror around a black hole than to make a dyson sphere, because it&#39;s much smaller.&quot; EXCEPT for all the goshdarn gravity that would make the mirror ball how many times bigger than that dyson sphere, lest it become part of that same black hole we&#39;re trying to make our bitch...<br>&quot;This is not science fiction.&quot; Oh please...

That is unless you build a Dyson sphere around your &quot;black hole bomb&quot; in which case you would need to convert the IR  radiation into usable power", "comment_date": "2018-04-22T14:11:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BJ 0216", "comment_text": "I am now increadibly happy now that we can do that also i love science", "comment_date": "2018-04-22T14:11:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ERC", "comment_text": "Its kinda like a top, that spins and spins, until it collapses into a black hole that still spins forever, for quintillion years.", "comment_date": "2018-04-22T14:11:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SeanHodgins", "comment_text": "Encasing a black hole is the same idea as a nuclear bomb right?

If black holes are spinning, does it have momentum?  How is its intertia distributed on the &quot;ringularity&quot;?  Would it expand if it spins faster?<br>2. If we construct an infinitely strong ball around a black hole, would it be in equilibrium, since the black hole&#39;s gravitational pull propagates sphierically and is exerted equally on the inner surface of the sphere?  If one side of the sphere is pulled towards the singularity, wouldn&#39;t this mean the black hole is also pushing against the opposite side of the sphere?<br>3. If black holes have infinite density, I understand that the singularity can, effectively, hold an infinite quantity of matter and never become &quot;full&quot;; thus, if an object is moving towards a black hole, wouldn&#39;t this mean the black hole is doing work to the object, and that energy can be harvested in some way?
