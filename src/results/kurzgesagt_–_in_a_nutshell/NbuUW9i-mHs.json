that humanity is changing for the better somehow. The main problem here is the old axiom that correlation does not mean causation. While the video is well-intentioned, I think its logic is flawed for a couple of reasons:\r<br>1. The narrator puts forward several explanations for the reduction in warfare in the last hundred years or so. However, as far as I recall, all the reasons provided are related to economic or political advantages over engaging in direct warfare with another country. No evidence is provided that we humans have actually changed our mindset to see warfare as wrong, barbaric, immoral, unethical, etc. Rather, it seems that we learned it is generally more advantageous to achieve the same nefarious objectives by other means instead of bombing another country.\r<br>2. Another key reason for the drastic reduction in large-scale wars between countries has most likely been the possession of large stockpiles of thermonuclear weapons by the key players (e.g. USA, USSR/Russia, China, etc.). As the computer WOPR in the 80s movie &quot;War Games&quot; nicely illustrated, there won&#39;t be many of us left to profit if a large-scale thermonuclear war broke out\u2026\r<br>3. But I think one of the most misleading ideas in the video is the suggestion that, in the last decades, wars have almost always been within-country affairs rather than battles waged between countries. My view is that it becomes ever more challenging to hide atrocities, the destruction, or the loss of life within their own ranks when a country engages in a war somewhere else. History shows that wars are rarely &#39;quick&#39; and tend to drag on, during which time more and more body bags are sent home. So I think what tends to happen nowadays is certain nations get others to fight for their interests instead. They provide money, intelligence, and/or weapons to different militiamen, insurgents, leaders, regimes, etc., who will stab, shoot, murder, bomb each other on their behalf. So rather than getting their sons sent home in bag bags, these nations encourage and support opposite warring sides, and if their &#39;team&#39; wins, they can profit from the spoils of war afterwards. Between-country warfare has been going on for decades, but largely &#39;hidden&#39; within the context of civil wars.<br>Maybe I am way too pessimistic, but after a few decades living on this planet, I think we have shown over and over again that under the right (or wrong!) circumstances, we continue to be as primitive, barbaric, and vicious as ever, ready to bomb the hell out of whoever challenges our interests or beliefs. In fact, over the last couple of years we have seen shocking levels of division and aggression within &#39;peaceful&#39; and &#39;developed&#39; nations because of political differences or just because someone asked us to wear a freaking mask. So, sadly, I have little doubt we remain as close to the Neanderthals as we were 500 hundred years ago\u2026 \ud83d\ude1e", "comment_date": "2022-02-27T04:59:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the department of space force", "comment_text": "I felt like I had to come back to this video.

This means death for a modern nation. Electricity stops, and a production line stops and cannot prevent the aggression of other countries when a weapon equipped with an engine is not usable. Therefore I make the first move for self-defense, and Pearl Harbor is to have attacked it. The United States won against war and I made demonstration of the power of the atom bomb in the Soviet Union and did a hero side and controlled the world after the war. And I got colony, Japan of the best money tree. The United States hit the commission of the slave who made money in an article made in Japan produced in high technology and was able to become the King who could enjoy luxury. The Okinawa return of the United States still controls Japan effectively with the thing only for forms and will have the colony. The reason why the eirei that scuttled itself fought till the last is that I prevent the colonial rule. I believed that Japan revived as far as the Japanese spirit continued and closed my eyes forever.\r<br>\r<br>The founding of a country of the United States slaughters the native candy reperception and begins by having plundered the territory. Europe and America of the principle of cruel supremacy of white invaded Asia and had the colony. Roosevelt, Churchill with a sense of crisis, the Stalin and others stopped at Japan which won against Russo-Japanese War against it gaining power and gathered and provoked Japan and drained Propaganda which trained Japan to be an invader and were going to let Japan ruin. A wirepuller of Chiang Kai-shek was these free Mason and let you carry out an anti-Japan activity and repeated Japanese slaughter of tushu case\r<br>The retaliation becomes the Shanghai incidents. Japan built the Manchurian country and was going to build the utopia by the rule of virtue. Japan makes a Mongoloid Korean of the same kind a sex slave and cannot slaughter the Chinese very much in Nanjing. I will pass not only Europe and America but also Asia to the enemy if I do something like that and Japan stands alone and ruins myself. I cannot perform such a suicidal act.\r<br>\r<br>The United States was approximately 10 times in Japan when they compared the strength of a nation of the United States with Japan at the time of the Greater East Asia War (the strength of a nation of the United States comes from a colony and profit of the black ivory). In other words, it is the quarrel of a child and adult. Why does it invade it? Even if Japan was found to lose, I believed that it was a fight of the justice and fought. When it did Pearl Harbor attack, only sank a superannuation warship; misfired. You set the second attack, and why did you not blow up an airport base, a naval shipyard, an oil tank? You occupied Hawaii, and did you not do an aircraft carrier confrontation? In brief, this Pearl Harbor attack angered the American nation, and the fighting spirit was a stratagem to let you become exalted. Emperor Showa, cabinet minister, all the navy government bodies were Mason.\r<br>\r<br>American Mason performs a plot a lot. There is the self-writing, self-playing false flag strategy. There are the fight of the Alamo fort, a main issue case, Mayflower case, Gulf of Tonkin case, Pearl Harbor attack (I order a Japanese agent), 9,11 terrorist incident, Paris terrorist incident, J F Kennedy assassination case, Diana assassination case, a plane shooting down case (I order Ukraine) in Malaysia.\r<br>\r<br>The equality was the concept that Mason thought about, and a phase contradicted freedom each other. If a company raises profit freely, there is it, and a rich person and poorman do not become equal. Freedom is restricted if I have the frames saying that I do it equally. Freedom and the equality are Operation double eagle of Mason. Of the quarrel that is fixed all the same not antagonism with the thing which Mason produced in both the liberalism nation and the communist state only play it. As for being hidden in the depths as for the commander-in-chief (Israel) of the evil in Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD. The world is instructed with structure making \u30ef\u30e4 under the pretense of two generals (Russia) quarrelling with one general (the United States) very much. In other words, Russia is together with the United States and rigs. Roosevelt ordered three Soviet Union from Stalin by a secret agreement of Yalta. The United States let money pay to Japan and, at the time of the Soviet Union collapse, saved the Soviet Union. Where is antagonism?\r<br>The Democratic Party copulates, too, and the LDP only rigs in the same way, too. Therefore I am under the patronage of Mason even if whichever wins. The American Republican and Democratic parties is the same, too. In other words, cards are marionettes of Mason. North Korea and the United States only perform a fixed quarrel when I understand this thing, and it is revealed that the United States lets you shoot a missile for Japan.\r<br>\r<br>Cards and Putin advocate anti-Judea, but it is a downright lie. The Nazis advocated anti-Judea, too, but Germany of the defeated nation of World War I was made to assume a burden of the indemnification payment, and why did you manage to raise those war expenditures? I received support of the Judah iron. The Nazis had techniques such as a rocket, atom bomb development, the UFO production. Nazi cannot lose. In other words, I lost on purpose.\r<br>\r<br>I let you accept the Plaza Accord and guide it to the strong yen that the United States makes Japan a bubble burst as for the Japan Airlines airplane 123 flights accident and snatches Japanese financial power of a nation by financial products (dice game gambling to say that the stock prices of Japan fall) and a share price manipulation and a fraud to say and am a threat case to lead it to the stock prices sudden fall. Salomon Brothers which sold a stock at a profit before a sudden fall obtained a vast profit. A pilot at U.S. forces shot it down and burnt the person whom a Korean military unit survived to death by a flame thrower. I shot a member of Self-Defense Forces with the sense of justice that was going to help it dead. As for the conduct like this devil being possible, there is only Mason. Therefore Boeing accepted the repair error of the false charge. Boeing refuses the act of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces decidedly.\r<br>\r<br>Near future to read from Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD and illuminaty card, and to untie it in Japan\r<br>April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, Korea, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3 (Armageddon of the nuclear war). It is the last war with original God and the evil god. Japan is the country which original God protects in a land of the gods, and the evil god (Freemason) holds the Japanese people hostage and is made to have an experience cruel most because it is the stomach which is going to conquer original God.\r<br>x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021 (the black ship second coming).\r<br>World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day (Armageddon of the nuclear war).\r<br> Mount Fuji is a great eruption on xx day in October, 2023. The natural disasters such as major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. \r<br>An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023. The earth becomes muddy sea. \r<br>The world (Buddhists&#39; paradise) of the Maitreya is realized on xx moon xx day in 2024.\r<br>\r<br>Final note\r<br>The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. A fornication is an act of the beast profaning God. A thing of the world is a thing of God, and the devil is the thief who stole the world from God and is a fraud deceiving the people. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. Therefore a disaster, an epidemic, the war damage giving an evil to the people are the wrath of Heaven. Why was much human life robbed of it by the Great East Japan Earthquake? As for it, a human evil deed was judged Big God. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. I lead the world to the World War 3 that Freemason finally acts as order of the evil. I let a vindictive spirit does satanophany in the Freemason, and war cause. The World War 3 is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

Paradoxically, Nations growing more and more interdependent does not make them more peaceful with each other.

Modern agriculture at levelsneeded to feed current population is extremely dependent on it. Yet only three places in world have significant potassium deposits. Russia in Siberia Australia outback and number one for K and three four in n p is Saskatchewan Canada. We provide 97% of USA fertilizer for example. 48% of world overall. Needless to say being a resident and getting reports, there&#39;s only about forty years supply left at current usage levels. One can cry peace all they want but when food runs out it&#39;ll be an automatic war. We&#39;re actually in process of getting rid of most of the foreign companies allowed to mine here other than USA and AU. Can&#39;t eat gold uranium or wood aka paper aka money. In that case trade of inedible s will mean absolutely nothing and feet crops be easy to defend. Example all of ours are rigged to blow and to be salted with uranium.

From what I can predict, the U.S. would need to become allies with Russia in order for peace to happen and that would start with nuclear disarmament on a massive scale.  Nuclear deterrence is a huge part of why a war won&#39;t happen any time soon, but at the same time it&#39;ll result in a war that will kill almost all life and we&#39;ll have to restart evolution from the scraps that remain.<br><br>The other option is go to space and explore, focusing resources on space as opposed to vanity projects.

You can&#39;t draw conclusions from the last 80 years.  In the history of the world we know the periods called the Great Peace. Great peace occurs when a world superpower brings a geopolitical order to the world (all over the familiar world).  The longest lasting Great Peace was Pax Romana. It lasted 265 years. This was achieved by democratizing and uniting most peoples, while other peoples were drawn into mutual trade, services and migration. <br>Another great peace was the Pax Britannica, and since the end of World War II the Pax Americana has continued.  Unfortunately, the longer the sun shines, the more violent the storm comes, and this time it will be.  We already have many countries that deny the current status que, countries that feel wronged by the current order and countries that the current order threatens, or is contrary to their interests.  World War III is only a matter of time. We now have all the symptoms that existed before the Great War: regional conflicts in irrelevant countries, in which the powers engage to test their rivals, violations of established principles by various countries, territorial claims, invoking past wrongs and injustices, the economic domination and exploitation of weaker countries, growing claimant sentiments, the cult of sacrifice and a sense of injustice. The use of trade and economics as a tool of political pressure.  <br>The war will probably break out in the middle of this century.  It will probably be initiated by China. They&#39;re investing in the military, and the investment must pay off. China is also making territorial claims on all its neighbours, including Russia. China is independent in terms of raw materials and technology.  It also has a huge excess of male population, which it is willing to send to the front.  But China will need an ally and radical Muslims are the ideal candidate.  All you have to do is finance, train and arm them.

Sing to find out if someone were to add to the fight beyond what is Norm play just a response of action would there be finally a surrender? Unfortunately the logic that dictates the people who are attacking versus the ones who are taking measures against those attacking and what we would consider to be the business practices of those who are being attacked and perspectives.<br> Usually when someone wants to fight it&#39;s because they feel that they&#39;ve been mistreated. They fight for the idea of fairness. So wouldn&#39;t it be just easy to make the pulse he&#39;s and practices Fair to destroy the feeling of unfairness. But sadly some people also don&#39;t operate with viewpoint or goal that can be circumvented and exploited. For example if a bunch of people want being bananas not to go extinct where to go and harm the people who are protecting the bananas from the elements that would be contradictory to their goal. The problem could be also the idea of believing that one set of people deserve to be treated in a different way than other people because of where they grew up from. This could be seen by either the aggressors the ones policing the aggressors. On the internet it doesn&#39;t matter whose side you&#39;re on or what you believe in chances are someone will disagree with you for example flat-earthers however flat-earthers don&#39;t have a reason to go out and blow up a building or murder anybody for their claims to be noticed. Even if policies were 100% favorable for all considered War can still take place. Unless others believe in the cause it will likely be a small War. But does that make it any less right to fight. One major problem is that a superpower such as any country and we could talk about the so-called want for oil being the reason for people having Wars in places. Basic greed and standing up against it. Terrible Acts of Destruction and chaos for some reason or another can actually cause results that seem to benefit the one doing them otherwise they wouldn&#39;t do them. If 9/11 was strictly a business manoeuvre to Force certain conditions so that events don&#39;t take place as they might have. Such a business model as seen being illegal., however many things are illegal but necessary in certain situations. Some actions simply seem like the only course in order to avoid catastrophe. It&#39;s this limited mindset that might or might not consider the long game that causes these feeling of urgency. But it&#39;s always hard to consider a situation where such a strong reaction is actually required. It said they don&#39;t negotiate with terrorists or kidnappers. And that statement forces any action to be a direct harm on a strong scale or to be completely diplomatic. Of course if hostage negotiations will never take place again and violence won&#39;t open anyone&#39;s eyes aren&#39;t we just shutting our ears? and wouldn&#39;t that caused the small person to need to fight the big group of people and take over in order for anything positive to happen? Of course in the day and age of social media it&#39;s impossible to not get your opinion said. You can literally say anything that you want people to hear and people will listen. it might be a while before any action takes place if it&#39;s required. and until we have a system that can change the problems but still many problems are only in the eyes of those seeing them. as much as we don&#39;t want people to do marijuana when we prohibition it we caused criminal Acts to be the only way to obtain it. Same happened with prohibition of alcohol. A solution can be to control all possible seemed to be illegal vices so that we can enforce our own rules. but no matter what kids will still want an adult YouTube and to see what everyone else is seeing and maybe they should be included and not excluded and a system put in place to make what they can access and what we do with their information to be well defined and in accordance with other policies.<br> in short laws need to provide us with the means of going about doing the thing that we want the laws to achieve and business practices need to be on point. personally I think that sex change should not be a considerable thing until you are past 20 and should be ignored as a concept for anyone under that age because their minds are not developed until that point and they cannot make a sound decision about what they want to do until they have the opportunity to go ahead and make a relationship and a life for themselves which they cannot do until they have a job for themselves usually. that might be only my opinion but I won&#39;t go to war to enforce it. No matter how much I feel that it&#39;s wrong for anyone younger than 20 to be allowed to believe that it&#39;s okay to run away from the body form that you were born as. puberty has a means of making people feel awkward. people need to get past that point you know where do you even consider changing their gender and need to be told that they should accept who they are and be glad and feel powerful and capable and wantable. For some stupid reason kids want to be beautiful and feel that they are not but beauty is something that happens later or some may say that everyone is beautiful regardless of what you actually look like cuz you never know what you&#39;re going to become later. to love someone as they are is also to love the growing person they are. you&#39;re not expected to stay short stay dumb or stay fat or skinny you can gain muscle you can lose fat you can get healthy and you can for some reason or another choose to abuse your body and have a negative self-image. And people who take pride in their self-image to become what is they would like to become instead of worrying or being upset about what they aren&#39;t wanting to be usually are those successful at doing what they want as long as their body is capable and if it&#39;s not isn&#39;t it best to accept what you are? but change is always possible so acceptance is irrelevant.<br>There is literally with or without legislature no way to ensure a person who feels things are fair in all things. if it is one way one type of person will feel it is fair and if it&#39;s another way another type of person will feel that it is fair. And if everyone had a rock hit we would all have way more problems than we currently do. but go become the scientist go become the lawyer or go become a researcher and find ways to make the world into a better version of itself only in this progression of bettering the system can we hope for a future eventually where things are as Fair as we would ever hope them to be and for people to not end up with problems as much or solutions to those problems to be more available then they are at the moment. in the case of YouTube or Facebook it is commonly said we do not have the people it takes to make something function as nicely and smoothly as we would hope it would.<br> see a need fill a need<br> Concept_vipereon", "comment_date": "2020-03-21T10:37:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P G", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbuUW9i-mHs&amp;t=1m06s\">1:06</a> laugh in spanish.", "comment_date": "2020-03-21T03:59:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Huzaifa Yousaf", "comment_text": "MOOSIC SOURCE?", "comment_date": "2020-03-20T20:46:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Boba", "comment_text": "Statism is an unreliable philosophy", "comment_date": "2020-03-20T16:32:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lazar Petrovi\u0107", "comment_text": "Thats fine and dandy but i live in the balkans...", "comment_date": "2020-03-20T00:02:18Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "PetziPotato", "comment_text": "I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t mention the development of nuclear weapons.

Because our weapons are too powerful! Used to be, before the great war(WW1) war was something that wasn&#39;t anywhere near as deadly, so people, and empires, were willing to go to war more often as a matter of course. But then the cost of war went up with the invention of artillery(yes artillery, not the machine gun). The cost of war skyrocketed with this invention to the point where empires could no longer sustain it&#39;s cost. Leading to the collapse of the Russian government due to revolution, and to the deaths of whole empires. War became so horrible, that convincing normal people of it&#39;s necessity became almost impossible. Now, no-one wants to do it, and if YOU, as a leader, try to make them do it, there is a significantly higher chance then zero that your own people will kill your ENTIRE family for it.

The use of nuclear weapons against humans hasn\u2019t happened since they were first developed. In fact no war between major powers has occurred since the development of nuclear weapons. There have been proxy wars, but they have never devolved into full on conflicts. Anyone who looks at a timeline can see that nuclear weapons have been the greatest catalyst for peace the word has ever known. Of course the points in this episode are valid and significant, but none of them stopped the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc from get at each other\u2019s throats. It was the fear of retaliatory strike that prevented the Third World War. The doctrine of containment almost certainly would have fallen to public outcry had the societal conscious not been dissuaded due to the certainty of Mutually Assured Destruction. As the world becomes more democratic and the spread neoliberal philosophy accelerates, it may become more and more appealing to simply remove nuclear weapons from the world stage. The development of conflicts will always linger in the minds of opportunistic powers and without the fear of a retaliatory nuclear strike, a world without nuclear weapons could lead to the development of a far more unstable planet.", "comment_date": "2019-10-19T01:23:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fliteshare", "comment_text": "Economic warfare is still being waged.<br>It&#39;s victims die from lack of potable water, food, shelter and treatment against preventable illnesses.<br>And because nobody reports their deaths<br>We (the rich and powerful) get to deluded ourselves that peace is all abound.", "comment_date": "2019-10-19T00:52:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oh really Ya", "comment_text": "But still there\u2019s a lot of bad stuff happening like overpopulation and  global warming", "comment_date": "2019-10-18T21:24:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DatFriking Duck", "comment_text": "Peace and democracy = comunism", "comment_date": "2019-10-18T21:13:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amir Dashti", "comment_text": "Oil: &#39;Exists&#39;<br>USA: did someone order democracy?", "comment_date": "2019-10-18T12:05:45Z", "likes_count": 780}, {"comment_by": "Ari Slade", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbuUW9i-mHs&amp;t=4m58s\">4:58</a> I think you need to go back a century for all of those things for example <br>30 years war was in the 16th century not the 17th<br>am I just looking at the time line wrong or did Kurzgesagt just made a mistake", "comment_date": "2019-10-18T03:26:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "theblackbull55", "comment_text": "War will exist as long as there is more than one person on the planet", "comment_date": "2019-10-17T22:48:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "jayno", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t think of these matters in terms of peace or war.

They only ever \u201cconsider\u201d trying others. Their justification for not trying Tony Blair, Dick Cheney, and others for lying to the U.N. in order to mislead the Security Council into sanctioning the invasion of Iraq was that they\u2019re only concerned with the crimes committed during an invasion not with the invasion itself. Of course, that discounts the fact that there were war crimes beyond the invasion, such as helicopters attacking aid workers and journalists, drone strikes hitting civilians, and torture, on top of the real issue which is what is a bigger crime during war than starting the war under false pretenses in the first place. When confronted with these arguments the ICC states the distinction is that the African Union wants ICC intervention, where the EU and North America do not. But of course one can find a morally comparable analogy to the policing of demographically isolated neighborhoods. If the police only ever arrest people in the black neighborhood and never arrest people in a white neighborhood, it doesn\u2019t really matter whether some people in the black neighborhood want the police to do their job and no people in the white neighborhood want the police to do their job.

Q&amp;R made a deal with FDR that: If US bailed GB out of then war with Germany; all oil traded in the world would have to be done with US dollars\u2026 The way this started was\u2026 When rebuilding Germany, Hitler got rid of the Rothschild&#39;s bank (thus the fake news saying Hitler hated jews) The Q&amp;R then had Poland, who were in a good proximity and needed financial aid (as Hitler stopped the unbalanced trade with them) (sound familiar Trump \u2013 China) and were paid to attack Germany and teach them a lesson as they would have the backing of GB and France (History says Hitler invaded Poland and GB and France came to the rescue) (Jews already owned most of the news media)\u2026 Few at the time realized Hitler had an ass kicking army\u2026 (now go back to my opening statement) \r<br>\r<br>During the Vietnam War, it was becoming obvious that US was continuing be the Army for Q&amp;R\u2026  this to keeps the Petro Dollar going (announced in 1971) US dollar was so inflated as it was worthless.

"IMPORTANT: congo was established by leopold the douche, as the congo freestate, and  was suposed to be a free trade sort of deal, he got it because none of the major powers wanted another major power to have it, and because he had played an active role in driving arab slavers out of central africa (though let&#39;s be honest, slavery and forced labour is just a difference of branding)<br><br>his congo freestate was a dystopia in which abuse was common, but the narative was not so much one of white against black, white elites were cruel one particular captain had heads decorating his flowerbeds, but most of the cruelty was done by black force publique soldiers against the congolese, you see more than 90% of the force publique was locally recruited, and their main duty was in maintaining a constant supplie of raw materials to the corporations that were active in congo, which were owned by a small royalist elite and the royal family itsself<br><br>in fact i am flemish, our people were second class in Belgium up until 1968, 8 years after congo gained independence.<br><br>today to many feel the need to parrot ideas of white oppression and white privilege, that it was white peoples fault, in reallity the grand majority of white people gained nothing from colonisation and in fact this was during the period in which children died in factories on a dayly basis, a time  in which only French speakers could hold public positions including postman, a time in which trials and politics were only conducted in French, which caused several inocent people to not be able of defending themselves in cases and end up executed because they were not even aware of what charges were held against them\u2026\u2026<br><br>no the blame should be put on the families that did extort the congolese people, as well as all the force publique members, the royal family still enjoys the spoils of their reign of terror.<br><br><br>but there is another thing, in the late 19th or early 20th century  international anger and anger in Belgium caused Leopold to turn his colony over to the belgian government. from that moment on it was immediatly decided to seperate the treasuries, under the belgian governance congo became the jewel of africa, but this also caused a rise in african nationalism, especially since, despite the higher rate of comfort for the africans, europeans still lived in more luxury and owned most businesses, in the years leading up to 1960 there was debate about giving independence<br><br>reason did not win out, congo seemed to be so succesfull that it could take on anything, those calling for a gradual retreat out of congolese affairs, training a capable generation of administrators and politicians as they pulled out, were made out for being against the independance in general, so in 1960 it was declared, but Belgian interests did not die there<br><br>the cold war was raging, and congo was the supplier of uranium for the US, and Lumumba had been talking to the USSR, it is likely that being a socialist himself he was about to ally with the USSR, so Belgian secret service CIA and seperatists worked together, the pm was taken down and eventually killed, official reports state that it was due to seperatist rebels, in reality he was simply executed during transit,the seeds of the warzone were sown, combine lack of expertise with all of this, (also lumumba had openly insulted the royals, baldwin was not the saint he was made out to be I have no doubt about that) and congo fell into civil war, into authoritarian dystopian rule and so on, almost as soon as it gained independence<br><br>POINT, look at the ones doing the abuse, not the race of the abusers, and don&#39;t take public oppinion and public history for given fact, there was a

This new Radical america could wage war on the world and cause a third world war.<br><br>Or a Second american civil war could just not end, or end in a nuclear annihilation of the United states as American warheads get targeted against American cities. This could leave a huge global power vacuum or see an era of Chinese dominance or Russian resurgence.<br><br>Or maybe even just the US and China engaging in a second cold war that has the chance of going hot. China and the US have already engaged in trade wars, where they blocked eachother&#39;s goods in their countries and pressured countries under their influence to do the same.

And for another, the reason that there are fewer casualties is because the technology of warfare has evolved to focus less on un-telegenic civilian casualties, and more on inflicting lasting and much more sanitary damage to the other side&#39;s capacities.

Technology was one factor you missed. It if anything is the biggest factor. Hitler was able to commit his final solution under every foreign nations radar. It wasn&#39;t until the Russians started winning the war and pushing into Germany, did they even notice concentration camps. Try doing that today in any developed world Information travels uncontrollably and too fast. Nations can&#39;t operate secret war plans like they used to.<br><br>Next is the weaponry of today also being super powerful. Bioweapons to nukes leave a vicious destruction left behind that defeats the purpose of invading or occupying nations as colonies or empire expansions. The threat of nukes and bio/chemical weapons being used and retaliated with is a huge threat. Not to mention how much in arms and such can be globally available for cheap. Even without nukes, weapons, tanks, ships and fighter jets are far more accurate and powerful. All of our weapons and ammunition are far more dangerous and destructive. That just means hugely more collateral damage and more distant attacks. Distant forms of attacking means occupation is not practical. Back in older times, armies had to engage a lot closer in range, unless they were planning cripple morale or economies. But doing so today, open&#39;s Pandora&#39;s box and the MAD doctrine concept.<br><br>Hacking can really interrupt governments and reckless behavior. We now have global satellite systems, which nations are very interdependent on. War jeopardizes it a lot and comes at a heavy cost to all. Every country benefits from mutually intact GPS, and in order to make any advancements requires a full scale assault physically or by hacking them- again a waste-creating effort. Communist Russia nor China are democracies, we never fought them due to nukes. If not for nukes, war would&#39;ve been very likely.<br><br>Democracy didn&#39;t directly stop war. Germany elected Hitler via democracy and turned into a dictatorship. Democracies don&#39;t stop crap. It is the spread of information, globally tied/dependent markets, and the fact people can afford leisure and basic necessities much easier. Who the hell wants to go off and fight a war when they can just chill, have fun and already possess all the necessities they need? People already learned the consequence of conquest and genocidal ambitions from Germany. It cost the country dearly. If Hitler would&#39;ve left all foreign countries alone and just focused on his own country, they would&#39;ve been #1 superpower economically in Europe easily, and eventually controlled the west far more through economics and political non-violent strong arming. Hitler was literally just a moron.<br><br><br><br>Corporate power dwarfing nations. We have financial interests and independent interests that are of massive influence.

No, we didn&#39;t outgrow war, we are not more enlightened (how can anyone possibly be so arrogant?), we&#39;re living in the shadow of a global empire that rules through both hard and soft power whose hedgemonic rule is slowly, shakily, coming to an end. We won&#39;t have another globe spanning hedgemon like the United States, or the British Empire ever again and thank God for it. It will mean more wars in the future, but I would honestly rather that than soulless rule as vassal to someone else&#39;s empire, no matter how &#39;good&#39; it is.<br><br>Another point: Definition games are fun, but civil wars and &#39;regional conflicts&#39; are still wars. This is the no-true-scotsman fallacy applied to concepts rather than people, a bit like saying &#39;democracies don&#39;t declare wars on eachother&#39; and then stating that every cited example of democracies or democratically elected governments that declared war on eachother &#39;weren&#39;t real democracies&#39; either. Its insulting and condescending. Wars happen even today and will happen again in the future and always will, its a reality of Human Nature and the only thing that will stop it is a globe spanning empire that enforces peace through force. A bit like what the Globalist movement is attempting to create out of naive idealism that will inevitably end in disaster because it ignores human tribalism, both its good and bad aspects and will provoke rebellion and conflict at the base level never mind wider scale rebellions with ideological motivations.<br><br>Because Humans. Don&#39;t. Change. Not ever. And no amount of ideological quackery of philosophical handwaving is going to result in human nature itself being changed. It this upsets you, then I am sorry, you should really toughen up your mindset and see the beauty and goodness are worth fighting, dying, and yes, killing for. Evil exists, it exists in all of us to some extent, even the best of us and war is a consequence of the reality of evil. Its why you can get wars like WW1 where no side was truly the &#39;bad guy&#39; but all sides committed horrific atrocities, and why you get wars like WWII where one side is almost comedically evil, but the &#39;good guys&#39; still get the show started on mass firebombing and terrorbombing civilian targets and unleashing ungodly weapons like nukes. War doesn&#39;t make us evil, we make war because we&#39;re evil, and the sooner everyone starts to accept that, the sooner we can get back to reality based politics and actually start making real progress again rather than just coasting on the momentum of the last two centuries.<br><br>Note: Also, bold of you to assume Colonialism has ended.

We live in brutal times where the &quot;new&quot; kind of war is a terror war, in which not only invading armies keep the people at the boot, but also the polices and law enforcement organs. It&#39;s a low intensity war, and it&#39;s global, everywhere. The State doesn&#39;t need to murder whole packs of people to keep the people at bay, they just need to kill a few, brutally, and let it serve as a warning. It&#39;s not surprising that those who usually die at the hands of the State are the young, poor, working class, and black people. In 2016, in my country, there were over 3 thousand deaths directly caused by police action. An official study showed that over 500 thousand people were murdered in Brazil in the last 10 years, a death toll higher than Syria&#39;s Civil War, A &quot;REAL&quot; WAR that&#39;s been going for 7 years. And the same study showed that 71% of those deaths were of black people. And that most deaths occured in rural areas, where there is a lot of conflict over land reforms. Not coincidentally, the Brazilian State is funded majorly by the big landowners, who then get the aid of the State to fight off the poor peasantry: the massacres of peasants are a common thing in Brazil, and each one is more brutal then the other, and are usually commited by POLICE AGENTS acting as private agents for the landowners.<br>The tactic is clear, as clear as Israeli&#39;s illegal occupation of Palestinian land, USA&#39;s invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, and ISIS&#39;s occupied Syria and Iraq: Terror is the most powerful tactic ever divised to be used in warfare.", "comment_date": "2018-10-14T09:42:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leaked1400", "comment_text": "War, war never changes", "comment_date": "2018-10-13T22:09:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tomas Ourednik", "comment_text": "At first, I thought you did not..

It is always to obtain, or retain control of resources that maintain the standard of living.<br>Got massive poverty? Fire up the war machine, and your industry will rev up to support it.<br>Low on oil/water/ores/fertile land? Annex it if you are able.<br>Low on public opinion near an election year? Start a conflict to appeal to a sense of nationalism. (Yea, looking at you Bush Sr and Jr)<br><br>The reason the world is relatively stable is that most of the world is prosperous enough that people will not support a war. That will change within the next 20 years. Points of conflict:<br>- Africa: Nations are not along ethnic lines, and really, the borders of that entire continent should be redrawn now that it&#39;s all independent. But those currently in power would never support that. So you end up with nations that aren&#39;t really nations, just slabs of land that were originally divided by the colonial powers, and which the african people (as in the people on that entire continent) feel no loyalty to.<br>- Europe: A persistent and increasing refugee flow coupled with repeated &quot;incidents&quot; caused by said migrants is causing strong nationalist and xenophobic sentiments in many nations. In some parts of the EU these sentiments have  gained a majority (Poland is an example) and they are basically telling the EU that enough&#39;s enough. But the africans keep on coming in droves - uneducated, unskilled workers that have basically no chance in the western knowledge-based economy, and are thus condemned to lower class existances. This disparity will cause friction, and has the potential to trigger civil wars within the EU.<br>- US: As the US continues to isolate itself, it may face an economic slump. And whenever things go bad with the economy in the US, a proxy war is soon to follow. China and the EU are seeking closer ties. This may break the old alliances between the US and western Europe. <br>- Within the coming decade I see roughly 5 global powers emerge: The US, the EU, Russia and it&#39;s close allies, China and it&#39;s close allies, and the South American nations. Africa will need a few more generations to sort itself out. Australia is an odd one out, not really a major power but not tied to any specific one either. But it&#39;s own economic base is too small to be considered a power unto itself. These powers are already shoving and prodding at eachother.<br><br>Trigger points?<br>- Terrorist nuke. It&#39;s bound to happen at some point, given the amount of nuclear material. Wether a true thermonuclear device or just a dirty bomb, the detonation of a nuclear weapon in peace time sets a precedent that&#39;ll require an armed response against anyone even remotely responsible. It&#39;d dwarf 9/11 by several orders of magnitude, especially if it strikes a densely populated area (New York, Moscow, Bejing, Singapore, Berlin... just to name a few targets).<br>- Peak oil OR post oil. Peak oil is when the oil reserves are no longer able to meet demand. Post oil is when another renewable energy source (such as nuclear fusion) essentially makes oil obsolete as a fuel, causing it&#39;s price to plummet. Both scenarios mean the entire mideast loses it&#39;s source of income. And we&#39;ve seen what happens when nations under islamic rule have a population that have no hope of a decent existance. Not sure when peak oil will happen, but the first fusion plants that are expected to be economically viable are already being constructed.<br>- Overstrained social safety net causes economic crash. Especially dangerous for Europe, with both a migrant flow putting a drain on it&#39;s social support, and the babyboom generation retiring, meaning more elderly folk to care for then there are adults to do that care. There is, as far as I can tell, no plan for when this will inevitably come crashing down. It&#39;ll be bad for the old folks. I expect crimewaves the likes even the US would do a doubletake at...<br>- Next US elections. I mean, Trump will need to make some chance for himself to get reelected, right?<br><br>And no, I don&#39;t see North Korea as a potential sore spot. If that nation launches a nuke in any direction it&#39;d be bombed so far back to the stoneage by both the Chinese and the US that whichever Kim&#39;s at the helm at that point would literally have to crap bricks. I also don&#39;t really see Israel and Iran as a potential sore spot, for largely the same reasons. Mutually Assured Destruction is a lovely concept.

Why did people fight wars to begin with?  It has to do with gaining control and exercising policy as well as gaining resources (which is no longer best gained by war but by trade).  Like the video said, it is no longer feasible for traditional war, the public effect is too large (everyone is neighbor on the global scale and you don&#39;t want to be the shitty neighbor, but naturally the bigger the neighbor you are the shittier you can get away with being) and you would rather reap the benefits of trade to begin with.  Now how is war still being fought?  We live in the Information Age.  If you are at all familiar with the events surrounding the US election and Russia&#39;s involvement then you are familiar with modern warfare.  This is how war is fought now.  This is how large superpowers wrest for control and work to exercise their agendas and policies upon eachother.  This is how Russia aimed to destabilize the USA in order to shift the balance of power.  This is how every major superpower, China, Russia, and USA( which is more or less aligned with the rest of the Western World), all fight to sway the scales.  Instead of soldiers and guns you have social scientists, analysts, writers, and programmers with computers. Instead of fighting over positions they fight over the hearts and minds of the common man, to sway our attitudes and opinions.  Ideas are powerful, the thought contagion (an idea that spreads like a virus) is the most powerful weapon in human history. Maybe the day will come when astroturfing, this covert trolling is seen for the act of terror that it is, brainwashing humanity and turning us against eachother, our brothers and sisters arbitrarily born under different cultures, races, and flags.

Like any organism, of course, Gaia has an immune system trying to sterilize that &quot;Life&quot; infection.  Chief among its agents are the big three immune echelons: Roaches, Rats, Humans.  No one can kill off other species like Man does, and Rats and Roaches are merely converters of the corpses back into &quot;healthy&quot; material.  Between these three Gaia is fighting its infection . . . if we humans work a little harder, I believe, we can tip the balance and make Gaia healthy and happy again.

When war (Not this small time shit, I&#39;m talking big- nation to nation conflicts) start, a country is made active again. Culture is made, economy prospers, and while it may be horrible and devestating in the short-term, it can prove good in the long term after the war is over. Am I saying we should start wars on purpose? No. But I believe in a sort of chaos theory. It is good to follow the ambition, and from it, prosperity occurs as long as you are the winner. There will always be war, there will always be violence and chaos. It is best to accept it and let it happen then try to prevent it, and further rot your society out from the inside.<br><br>Hopefully, Nuclear Bombs are never utilized in wartime, for this would oppose everything I just said, and overall just fuck us over.

Another great war will come because of the automation paradox: Each automated profession yields a number of jobs that require good education and therefore high pay, for example in research, construction, and maintenance of these machines; which one might assume is desirable for first-world countries. However, the high wages of these professions slow the process down, as employers figure that it is at this point cheaper to pay an entire factory of low-skilled workers in third-world countries than machines in the first world.<br><br> As machines become cheaper with technological advances, the workforce of the third world has to earn even lower wages to remain employable, which will at one point in time go below what is biologically necessary to survive. The employer therefore <b>has</b> to switch to machinery in order to keep producing, which will leave more and more third-world workers unoccupied, with no insurance, little health care, not even a prospect of education, and entirely drained of the fruits of their labour. When this happens to large groups of people down there, they are going to rebel. <br><br> As for the first world, there is going to come a depression; because with the third world the companies will also lose a big consumption market. We will paradoxically have too many goods distributed among too few people, all the while we will receive even more economy refugees from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. This will lead to tensions between the rich westerners and the poor immigrants; a taste of what will come already happens in Germany and France.

Human nature is all but immutable and there will always be nations/dictators and other such looking to expand their holdings/fighting for resources as if it&#39;s not need that motivates conflict it&#39;s greed.<br><br>Limited resources, overpopulation, unhappy masses, envy of quality of life or desperation and of course the arms race and a perceived advantage over someone else, take your pick... There&#39;s plenty of motivators for conflict and not all warfare is physical in this day and age; we have nation spying on nation but it&#39;s not just the undercover agent anymore it&#39;s digital surveillance, tapping into communications, satellites and all the other associated technology and methodology employed by such parties.<br><br>Deterrence is a large part of it, enter the nuclear weapon and M.A.D (mutually assured destruction) and the picture becomes clearer.<br><br>The notion that any nation or combatant cares about rules is laughable, none of the major governments are going to pass up a major opportunity due to legal/mutually agreed upon restrictions or the like, such things are just another arena for warfare of another kind and the reason such things don&#39;t work is because there&#39;s no trust; it&#39;s understandable, when you&#39;re looking at nations dealing with one another, particularly when the topic is warfare there&#39;s simply no room for trust in that theater...<br><br>Russia isn&#39;t going to take any risks with the US based on trusting that the US will also change their ways etc.<br><br>We will NEVER see any nation dismantle and destroy their entire nuclear arsenal due to some UN agreement, the only way any of them are going to get rid of their nukes is if they&#39;re clearing them out to make room for the new and nastier thing that&#39;s going to be replace them, their new intimidation baton if you will. <br><br>Of course that won&#39;t stop them from lying about it and the unending political and militaristic games go on unabated.<br><br>Open warfare is only one facet of conflict these days, just part of a larger scheme. Before nation A attacks nation B they spend years attempting to break down ties between B and its allies, they try to undermine their global political image and attack their economy and infrastructure all the while spying on them and testing them; they want to make sure they have every conceivable/obtainable advantage over them before showing their hand; in the meantime they all smile and shake hands for the camera so everyone looks like the good guy.<br><br>Nations aside there&#39;s extremist groups and all sorts of other shit out there. At the end of the day the only true law in life is natures law and everything else is just a leash for those who are willing to weather its grip. As long as you have something that someone else wants you&#39;re going to have to oppose every action others take to alleviate you of your possessions.<br><br>Whether they&#39;re fighting for resources or over a dispute in ideology/religion or whatever the case may be people will always fall back onto violence to get their way, the only difference between a brute and a pacifist is for a pacifist violence is a last resort.<br><br>I should add as a final note that I am not stating that everything in this presentation was wrong and my views are correct; I am stating, whilst the factors presented in the presentation are more than likely contributors to why we have less conflict, they are likely not the largest contributors to that peace...

Overall amount of carnage is lower, but not exactly evidence that the human race is evolving. Second, violence among nations has decreased, but violence on a smaller scale-- person to person or violence by groups of terrorists, for example-- is alive and well. Having said that, my understanding is that this form of violence is decreasing, as well, worldwide. Finally, perhaps we should also consider if the part of our humanity that leads to wars is just finding a new outlet in the culture of greed and consumerism. Less carnage and destruction, thank God, but undercuts the statement that humans are growing/improving.

People like their war machines regardless of how much they use them, and while companies like Tesla have been making increasingly viable electric vehicles, nobody is trying to make electric tanks or planes that use something other than jet fuel. Oil is a temporary resource, so at some point somebody will likely try to seize it as the price goes up and military demand stays the same. Worse yet, there is still a huge quantity of desperately poor in the world, and everybody needs to eat. In first world countries, sustainable and efficient farming methods are being implemented. In Africa and much of Asia, methods are neither although the world population steadily increases. There are easy ways to distribute food to people in need, but nothing scares people more than the idea of even temporarily running out of food.

As long education is a joke and the majority of citizens can barely afford to own a part of their country (such as land for their home, business, whatever) much can&#39;t really change. And is my impression that this is intentional because history is proof that when the desire exist almost nothing is impossible. People stand together and bring their contribution to back a sound idea. But for that they need to comprehend, to be informed properly and to care. That&#39;s democracy, everyone wanting something different but at the same time everyone wants the same thing. Capitalism and free market is just difference without connection, kill or be killed, and precisely there is where democracy must be. A strong link, a guardian, that&#39;s why free market and any action under capitalistic dogma must be always tweaked, kept in check by the leading democratic organisms that serve a country&#39;s citizens. So when i&#39;ll see real reforms in the educational systems everywhere that are flexible with the times, that inspire curiosity and freedom of thought, maybe i will get some hope. But until then i really think that freedom is giving its last breath and we are simply trapped in our own creation that craps on you if you are unlucky and awards the random lucky. Problem is that with time less and less are lucky because it&#39;s easier to thrive if you were first and it seems that slow but steady we are heading towards a sort of democrato-capitalist-imperialism which can have some benefits, like easier and faster responses while controlling and leading a planet, but is certainly a definitive death to freedom and equal rights.", "comment_date": "2017-02-12T14:47:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "St0rmtr00p3r_ YouWontLearnHuh?", "comment_text": "hey so that the American government is sending troops to Islam to &quot;help&quot; does not count, and what they call help is to kill millions just because one man decided to stop the trade of oil between the two countries which might start a chain reaction that might destroy the corrupted oil system", "comment_date": "2017-02-12T13:52:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "igor ba", "comment_text": "FINALY SOME PEACE", "comment_date": "2017-02-12T13:51:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriele Gaggini", "comment_text": "There is another factor to be considered: fear of nuclear wars", "comment_date": "2017-02-12T13:34:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marrukurli Industries", "comment_text": "there is war happening right now...", "comment_date": "2017-02-12T12:28:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zeus", "comment_text": "Gold, oil, water.", "comment_date": "2017-02-12T11:32:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RAMKZ2020", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude22", "comment_date": "2017-02-12T03:56:49Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Chuck Norris", "comment_text": "Wie alle immer die Russen runtermachen m\u00fcssen, ja, das mit der Krim war nicht richtig, aber die USA begehen mindestens genauso schlimme Kriegsverbrechen und das seit Jahrzehnten immer wieder unter genauso l\u00e4cherlichen Vorw\u00e4nden aber wehe jemmand sagt ein b\u00f6ses Wort \u00fcber das Land der unbegrenzten Dummheit", "comment_date": "2017-02-11T23:17:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rovstam", "comment_text": "like si pensaste que era war robots :v", "comment_date": "2017-02-11T21:08:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jan White", "comment_text": "&quot;The Russians are invading Ukraine&quot;<br>Shit, and I had loved ur videos and thought that u are kinda clever till that moment ago.", "comment_date": "2017-02-11T20:29:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cameron Flint", "comment_text": "This has made my month.", "comment_date": "2017-02-11T20:11:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nefelibata", "comment_text": "hasn&#39;t even started yet bro.", "comment_date": "2017-02-11T16:52:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mamth", "comment_text": "War is not over, because war.......war never changes", "comment_date": "2017-02-11T16:45:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iluvgtasan", "comment_text": "War has just migrated to the internet.", "comment_date": "2017-02-11T15:15:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Outlaw", "comment_text": "War.... &quot;War has changed.

The first, which the video vaguely tiptoed around, is Pax Americana. Historically, the best route to peace was for there to be only 1 superpower whereas balanced power typically causes warfare. WWI, for example, happened largely due to Europe having several nations with some levels of military parity. With the collapse of the Soviet Empire, America now possesses the strongest military in the world. Furthermore, America shares some level of military allegiance with most other wealthy, industrialized nations bolstering it&#39;s already impressive military might. Any nation that picks a fight with America, NATO allies of America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea or a whole host of other countries we&#39;re aligned with would automatically be fighting the most powerful military in the world plus several of its allies.<br><br>The second reason war had declined is nuclear weapons. Most likely, were nuclear weapons never invented, the Cold War would&#39;ve been quite hot. The USA wanted to destroy the USSR and the USSR wanted to destroy the USA but neither side was willing to commit suicide in the process. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council all have extensive nuclear capabilities and all are aware that any hot war between any two of them would basically render the northern hemisphere of the planet nearly lifeless.", "comment_date": "2017-01-22T08:57:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diego Arguello", "comment_text": "the mitochondria is the power house of the cell", "comment_date": "2017-01-22T08:13:36Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "in4game", "comment_text": "Dislike for Russia invading Ukraine.

Even if one nation win, this what he try to reach AND what he already have will be so heavily damage, that at the end of war, he propably realised he just waste money and time.<br>Second - Art. In past, people really like to war. In songs, pictrues or books, they always see a powerfull humans, beatifull armies etc. who go fight agains EVILLL anemies, who they have to kill and become rich and glory. But after world war II we realise, a war isn&#39;t looks like this. Nobody want to kill each others and nobody want to die, and this is something, what we can see in modern films, music and books.

But this is just a temporary phenomenon. By the decline of the role of the nation-state, people will increasingly start feeling under-represented over time, (imposition of alien values, crumbling economy, crumbling social cohesion) and under-representation will cause them to rebel against what&#39;s left of their state (which is why civil wars already started surging). But they will have to find an alternative means of social organisation, which will better represent their needs/interests, and this will give rise to new smaller states. (like those in the middle ages) This will be the active phase of de-globalization. And then these smaller states will again merge into larger states. The cycle will repeat. It&#39;s just nature. As for nukes, the nuclear dilemma implies that for as long as nukes continue to exist, sooner or later they will be used, either accidentally or intentionally. It&#39;s a mathematical conclusion. And MAD is not eternal. An alternative to de-globalization is the idea of a global government. But even if we succeed in creating something as monstrous as a global government, it should be obvious to anyone that it won&#39;t be able to last, as the amount of red tape produced by the requirement to represent the interests of 7+ billion people by a single organisation, will be too heavy to carry through.

They are they only reason there was not a 3rd world war between the USSR and USA during the cold war. Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) has done more to deter conflict than any ideal or organization. Simply put, there is no way to win a war that guarantees the destruction of both sides and the rest of the world in every iteration. That is what has prevented major powers from declaring war on each other.<br><br>MAD is the biggest reason that a war has not broken out between China, Russia, and/or the United States. International law is a joke for any major power because all the major powers hold a permanent position in the UN security council. This means that the US, UK, France, China, and Russian can do whatever they want without fear of UN sanctions. All P5 members have nuclear arsenals which makes it necessary to negotiate with and accommodate them since force is off the table.<br><br>The ICC relies on P5 members capturing and turning over war criminals for trial. Try to name a situation in which one of the P5 members would commit a war crime and any of the other 4 would invade to arrest the offending party.  All the P5 members have nukes so to invade them to arrest someone would risk total global annihilation. This is why the nuclear powers get away with numerous violations of international law. The US uses chemical weapons (white phosphorous) and tortures people at gitmo and various black sites. China executes/tortures dissidents and violates the sovereignty of many Pacific nations; it also violates numerous agreements about international trade. Russia kills dissidents and oppresses minorities while invading its neighbors with flimsy justification. These 3 nations, along with England and France can do what they want because using force against them would mean mutually assured destruction.<br><br>Modern Economics is not a concrete reason to deter aggression. An economy is just a means to an end. That end is the ability to create a better military and keep the people happy. The real goal of a nation is to control as much of the world as possible. Profitable trade will not deter war if one nation thinks war can lead them to have compete control over a previously shared economic asset or even just some economic advantage. Look to the Empires of WWI fighting over colonies and control of Europe, Look to the Empires of WWII fighting over control of the World, Look to the Cold War where open conflict only took a back seat to proxy wars and negotiation because open warfare would mean the world ending inside of 20 minutes.<br><br>The bottom line is we are not more civilized or peaceful. Our lack of wars is a symptom of the stick that is nuclear weapons. We are simply coerced to avoid conflict because a modern world war would wipe out the entire planet. We still live in the Wild West and we are all still bandits, but we don&#39;t shoot because we are stuck in a Mexican stand off.", "comment_date": "2016-10-28T09:21:36Z", "likes_count": 56}, {"comment_by": "Andrea Fiordaliso", "comment_text": "It  is cheaper finance a civil war that invading a country, with the result that resources are sold to foreign powers rather than directly stolen.

Civil war is the worst kind of war and it is very imminent in many countries, large parts of Europe included, and that&#39;s a really bad thing, because when two states fought, you always knew who the foe was and often citizens weren&#39;t really involved (especially those outside the capital and far enough from borders). Of course due to the general lack of heavy artillery, bombing and other kinds of strike-heavy attacks, the number of casualties is smaller (then again it is nearly impossible to get accurate numbers during civil wars), but it often leaves the country more deprived of everything. If you look back at WWII it was, without a doubt, a terrible event in human history, but the nations were still able to recover from it fairly quickly, because the general society never stopped working (in the US women started to work in industries, effectively replacing the men fighting on the frontlines; Germany was in ruin, but the general society of productive age was still largely there and thanks to the financial support of the US (when it comes to West Germany), they were able to rebuild fairly quickly; same with Japan). Now compare it to a nation struck by civil war (for example the Balkans, who simply just continued WWII after the revolution - it&#39;s end was forced on them without a clear winner), those are usually left in ruin, because everyone tries to get as many of it&#39;s riches to themselves and more often than not they are (almost) completely deprived of people of productive age (especially men), hence having neither the resources nor capacity to effectively rebuild. That&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t take five or ten years to completely rebuild, but it takes easily twenty or more years, which again leaves the region vulnerable and unstable. And that&#39;s also why it sometimes would be better to leave the UN and other organisations out of internal conflicts, because again, if you look at their interventions for the past cca 10-12 years, they did more bad than good. To sum it up, rather than war becomming less or humanity becomming more peaceful, it seems the only thing happening is war becomming more business-like.", "comment_date": "2016-09-21T17:49:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hikori Yakami", "comment_text": "The Chilean flag is upside down.", "comment_date": "2016-09-21T17:47:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arthur Q", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbuUW9i-mHs&amp;t=4m24s\">4:24</a> Was it an attempt to compare US-backed bloodshed\u00a0in Iraq with pro-russian referenda in Ukraine!?

But I have to disagree with that one tho. So yes, its true there is kinda peace era nowadays, because wars dont affect 1rst world countries and most of the other, but that does sound only positive to us europeans for ex. or for unitated states citizens etc. For people in other countries like Syria, peace is still an absurd thing. and even in post colonial countries in Africa, brutality didnt much change that much. there are still gangs and children are killed commonly. ofc there are maybe less deaths, brutality than the colonial times, but its still a brutal place to live. So saying about world peace and comparing to other times in my opinion just drives us away from the problems. It is peace for us, normal pple in civilised countries, but in other regions its a whole other story. Also, civil wars are also really brutal and can be similar to regular war. I know im not being positive when i should be because the world really changed and there is less violence than before, but thats only because I dont want to forget about ongoing problems, that some countries are facing.", "comment_date": "2016-09-16T12:17:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "scruffyEA", "comment_text": "maybe whats going on now will be the last conflicts", "comment_date": "2016-09-16T06:31:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lazaro89", "comment_text": "I have only two words for this shit video.

Born in Brussels as the second (but eldest surviving) son of Leopold I and Louise of Orl\u00e9ans, he succeeded his father to the throne on 17 December 1865, reigning for exactly 44 years until his death. This was the longest reign of any Belgian monarch.<br><br>Leopold was the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State, a private project undertaken on his own behalf. He used explorer Henry Morton Stanley to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the Berlin Conference of 1884\u20131885, the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants. From the beginning, however, Leopold essentially ignored these conditions. He ran the Congo using the mercenary Force Publique for his personal enrichment. He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death, to preserve them for Belgium.<br><br>Leopold extracted a fortune from the Congo, initially by the collection of ivory, and after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s, by forced labour from the natives to harvest and process rubber. Under his regime millions of Congolese people died; modern estimates range from one to fifteen million, with the consensus figure climbing by around ten million. Human rights abuses under his regime contributed significantly to these deaths. Reports of deaths and abuse led to a major international scandal in the early 20th century, and Leopold was ultimately forced by the Belgian government to relinquish control of the colony to the civil administration in 1908.", "comment_date": "2016-08-01T02:24:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "cynradu", "comment_text": "I must show this video to the ISIS leader.", "comment_date": "2016-08-01T01:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Team Eisenbahn", "comment_text": "On number 2 there is a tardis", "comment_date": "2016-08-01T00:46:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muhammad", "comment_text": "But isreal can still take over palestine kick it&#39;s people? and wait that&#39;s not it. destory their history and change flag and everything and you say war is old? fk no it&#39;s not. it still happens but in a fancy fking way. they call democracy", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T22:09:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Warigon", "comment_text": "1 of these days scientist are gonna find life on other planets most like earth would start a war on them that&#39;s my theory", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T20:15:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "justQb", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbuUW9i-mHs&amp;t=3m51s\">3:51</a> Paulaner Spezi &lt;3", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T19:02:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mouse Man", "comment_text": "Such a nice day for invading Ukrania, folks!", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T15:25:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JulieLPS", "comment_text": "Now, think about how many wars were going on and are going on because of religion.", "comment_date": "2016-07-31T14:43:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jake", "comment_text": "Fact: 3 out of 5 alien supercivilizations are pacifists.

Holy hell has something so profoundly harmless ever been feared so much and for so long?).<br><br>Or, better yet, do a video on the biggest problem the human species as a whole faces:  Once danger is removed from the day-to-day life of human beings, and it is possible for a person to be safe and comfortable regardless of whether they make decisions based upon critical thinking or upon intuition, large numbers of human beings will naturally cease exerting the effort required to engage in critical thinking, eventually resulting in them advocating destruction of exactly the infrastructure which keeps them safe.  How is it possible to both remove danger from peoples lives, yet also give the majority of the population the visceral motivation to invest the effort in learning critical thinking and applying it in their life?  If we do not figure out how to do this, then the &#39;civilized&#39; world will fall apart as increasing numbers of people are unable to be convinced to continue the upkeep and expansion of the infrastructure necessary to keep their own lives safe.  <br><br>Witness what has happened with vaccines in the US.  Because the majority of people now raising children grew up healthy, without seeing their friends, siblings, and classmates dying and disfigured by terrible diseases, they are not willing to even permit their children to be protected from disease.  They can not be convinced that the diseases are as bad as people say they are, or that vaccines are an effective protection which does more good than harm, because they have no visceral motivation.  Instead of seeing the lady down the street cradling a dead child, they see her raising one with autism and she &quot;just knows&quot; vaccines caused it.  And that&#39;s enough for them.  Learning about vaccines and diseases and biology would be hard work.  <br><br>And they&#39;ll be safe and protected no matter what.  So why not just go with their gut?  We can&#39;t just turn our backs and let their children die because their parents are morons.  That would be to willingly abandon the exact safety and civilization we&#39;re trying to protect!  We can&#39;t force them to be rational and to exert the energy necessary to doubt their intuition and trust reason instead - you can not force someone to think.  As their numbers multiply, they will spread their ways of processing the world to others.  <br><br>Eventually, they will tear down the infrastructure that keeps us all safe.  And any time one of their bad choices hurts one of them, they will use the same means of dealing with those sorts of things that human beings used for thousands of years.  They won&#39;t conclude their whole way of life is wrong and turn to reason.  They&#39;ll blame gods or demons or superstitions or, most likely, they will blame whatever remains of the infrastructure they are fighting to dismantle.  And because they are harmed, other people will listen to them.  The people saying &quot;we told you this would happen&quot; or &quot;you brought this on yourself&quot; will be dismissed as arrogant or as blaming the victim.  And it will spread.  <br><br>This is the most dangerous issue facing the human species as a whole.  In order to civilize, you must build infrastructure which removes danger and risk from peoples lives.  Removing danger and risk from peoples lives also removes the visceral motivation to exert the effort necessary to overcome intuition and rely instead of reason.  Relying on intuition leads inevitably to a belief that all of the effort spent maintaining infrastructure only comprehensible with reason is unnecessary.  Public opposition to maintaining or expanding that infrastructure leads to its removal.  Which leads right back to where we started.  Can this be stopped?", "comment_date": "2016-05-27T22:39:07Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Unsal Gures", "comment_text": "This is just bullshit.", "comment_date": "2016-05-27T14:50:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luk\u00e1\u0161 Szab\u00f3", "comment_text": "Wait till fresh drinkable water becomes a much more rare resource.

India had just come out of a bloody partition with Pakistan, and three wars with same. Africa is constantly at war now with no shortage of people who know what war is like, and those are just a few examples.<br><br>Today though, many people who experienced war are starting to die off, and people who haven&#39;t experienced any suffering caused by war are taking up the population. Problems that were tolerable before are starting to rise as massive problems when they haven&#39;t really changed in scope or magnitude because people are more keen on violent solutions because they haven&#39;t been exposed to its consequences. All that is missing is a bogyman, and a &quot;savior&quot; that stands by an ideology, since most of the bloody wars in history are fought over economic ideology rather than resources (Religion counts as an ideology in this regard in a time when religion played a role in economics).<br><br>What is certain, though, is that the atom bomb has prevented the most war. Thanks to the atom bomb, all the major powers are too scared to invade each other. When a safe way to stop an atom bomb immediately before impact is developed, all cards are put back on the table, because we would have lost the element of MAD. It&#39;s just that war will look majorly different from what we imagine World War II to be fought like due to technology.

They pedal whatever can sell without getting sued (too badly, or fired) as opposed to GROUND TRUTH, which we are in very peaceful times. If we want our minds manipulated we can go to a hypnotist. The fact that these pitiable jackals masquerade as our &quot;trusted&quot; informers is the greatest contemporary ruse going. All these &quot;news&quot; programs are no more news than pro wrestling is wrestling. So, the WWF (World Wrestling Federation) was forced to change its name to WWE (World Wrestling ENTERTAINMENT). Yes, partly for infringement on the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), however, they had been &quot;infringing&quot; on that since 1979 (even though no one really gave a crap until the 1990s...) Anyhow, also playing behind the scene was that they were nothing but a show, scripted by charlatans, for however the audience might be sucked in to buying their marketing; hence making them richer. Wrestling is one thing, entertainment is another. News is one thing, whatever these propagandists pedal is something else. The &quot;something else&quot; is astoundingly similar to &quot;scripted by charlatans for however the audience might be sucked in to buying their marketing, making them richer.&quot; The only responsible thing to do is demand every one of them be renamed in the same spirit of the WWE. Case in point, the source of this article would be forced to rename itself to &quot;NBC Nightly Entertainment.&quot; And it&#39;s not partisan, which is why I say every one of them should be forced to rename. This is why they are all dying; nothing but cheap sensationalism trash.

Given our current path with the population increasing as much as it is and nearly 30 years of peace, its almost inevitable. Any number of shortages could cause a major war, food, water, fuel, and quite possibly land. Right now some area&#39;s are stressed but we can deal with it, and you are correct, it is currently cheaper to buy goods than take them by force, but what if the population was 10 billion? Water, food, and farmland for some of the big nations are becoming short. There&#39;s all this manpower just sitting around, hoping to ride out the storm and for governments to sort it out. Governments might decide at that point its cheaper to go to war, than it is to buy their way out of the issues, if they even could in the first place. there could even be global recession going on at the time when all the other issues break out. <br><br>What this means is that if things stay relatively the same as they are now, no we shouldn&#39;t have any more big wars, there&#39;s no motivation for such things to happen, and governments are usually uninterested in such things. However its rare that things stay the same for humanity and any number of things can change this fragile moment of peace. One only has to look to history to see this pattern before.<br><br>See after the Napoleonic wars, the nations of Europe created the Concert Of Europe to make sure such a large war never happened again, and for a long period of time it worked rather well, until a new large nation formed in the heart of Europe itself. Even then though, strong leaders with a commitment to never let the horrors of a European war happen again, it stayed together for a long time. But then newer leaders and new technologies entered the fray, and shortly after the great war was on. They too thought war would end. <br><br>take of this as you will, but I&#39;m almost certain we&#39;ve not seen an end to war.

There is no common ground within that conflict of interest so the natural outcome is a fight for dominance in order to dictate or see the losing side willing to concede aspects of their original demands or limitations.<br><br>For example take the difference between how a negotiated &quot;cease fire&quot; deal is differently seen within Civilian education and Military education. Within Civilian education a cease fire is seen as a good position towards lasting peace. However, within Military education a cease fire is seen as a good situation IF you can exploit it more than your opposition. Meaning the whole focus of a cease fire from a military point of view is to re-consolidate ones forces and be ready for new attacks etc and hopefully do it in such a way one out competes the opposition trying to do the the same. Leading to greater success on the battle field once the cease fire is over and fighting continues. Sort of like the break between Boxing rounds where the fighters are quickly patched up and given a few tips from their trainer rather than the end of fighting.<br><br>This is also why some cease fires just falls apart rather quickly...

It started using rhetoric as opposed to manpower in order to come up with more sensible solutions. Yet, democracy still isn&#39;t enough... Good as it is to see that violence has been replaced with reason, there are still way too many logical fallacies, appeals to emotional reasoning, and underhanded politics at work for such a system to effectively solve problems. Think about how many BS excuses are given for the passing of inane laws. Heck, think about how easily voting can be chalked up to a simple popularity contest.

But still this particular video made me anxious for many reasons. This video states that statistically speaking, compared to the whole world&#39;s population, war has diminished notably and we live in the most peaceful time in human history. And that might be true. But that thought doesn&#39;t really calm me down because there is actually more people being killed everyday as the earth&#39;s population grows. The amount of violent deaths is actually increasing! What I&#39;m trying to say (considering english is not my native language) is that you can tell that the people who made this video clearly they don&#39;t live in a violent country like mine, which by the way wasn&#39;t even mentioned. My country just lost about 24000 fellow citizens only last year (2014)  by the hands of violence and we&#39;re not in any civil war. It&#39;s just plain and pure violence. This means there are 68 homicides per day, 3 homicides per hour and 1 homicide every 20 minutes... But according to this video I should be happy about it because looking at the bigger picture it doesn&#39;t even represent a threat to world&#39;s peace. Though I might get killed tomorrow... So I have a proposition to make: this video should have a sequel explaining how we humans deal with our need of violence and death and how insensitive we can get about it sometimes.", "comment_date": "2015-11-14T07:35:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Martin", "comment_text": "i saw an estonian flag weeeeeeee", "comment_date": "2015-11-14T06:46:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hookilledtobymilder", "comment_text": "More Bob Marley = Less war", "comment_date": "2015-11-14T05:24:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Charles Lynn", "comment_text": "Wrong answer.

Over the past 1000 years, a general trend of liberalization has occurred reducing major conflict - with WWI and WWII being anomalies in a trend. The video fails to note perhaps the two most significant reasons why war will remain prevalent over the next century - the lack of sufficient oil supplies and water. What happens when oil begins to run out - a technological alternative? That is optimistic and the R&amp;D funds for these technologies are nowhere near where they need to be right now. Water... a signifiant portion of the world already lacks sufficient access to fresh water and agricultural outputs to meet growing global populations are straining fresh water sources in countries even with significant reserves. How about disease? pharmaceutical antibiotics will arguably be ineffective in 50 years especially with the lack of new patent drugs being researched and antibiotic resistance reaching biologically unprecedented levels. The reasons this video identifies as causations for war are embedded within 20th century politics, not future politics. War is not ending, it is not less, it is simply different. It is fought differently and will be fought differently - and most importantly, it will be fought over for reasons that predominantly were not reasons for war over the past century.", "comment_date": "2015-11-13T07:42:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Omega", "comment_text": "Im waiting on China to get provoked :3<br><br>WWIII yey", "comment_date": "2015-11-13T06:29:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oswald Rayleigh", "comment_text": "so if you sum it up, which major religion that enjoy killing people just for resources....? because nowadays people can only answer ISIS...", "comment_date": "2015-11-13T02:43:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Taylor Hayden", "comment_text": "Fantastic &lt;3", "comment_date": "2015-11-13T00:53:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Creative Ed", "comment_text": "Pft, war.... war never changes.<br><br>kidding, loved the video :)", "comment_date": "2015-11-13T00:26:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KurtxJanjii", "comment_text": "We actually talked about this in school yesterday, for Veterans Day.", "comment_date": "2015-11-12T21:59:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "real ELGurko", "comment_text": "war...war never changes", "comment_date": "2015-11-12T21:44:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "temjin93", "comment_text": "Russians are not invading Ukraine.

Man&#39;s need for violence, some inexorable drive to dominate, isn&#39;t stopped because war was made harder by democracy and politics. What&#39;s stopping people is the understanding that war in this age, with our technology, and on the scale of the inter-connectivity and globalization we&#39;ve already achieved, would mean the destruction of the Earth, and mutual death for all humankind. I&#39;m not talking just about nuclear warfare that you touched on in the comment section. I&#39;m talking about biochemical warfare such as weaponized diseases and toxins, dependency on technology and severing our access to said technology, even political strangulation can lead to the collapse of (in some sense) the fragile order of our governments.<br><br>As an example, simple actions can be complicated and contributory to mass discord due to our mass inter-connectivity. A white police man kills a black citizen, and thanks to media, facebook, and self-proclaimed authorities on criminal justice writing buzzfeed articles, general public revolt against the police force as a whole. Even if less than 1% of the force is involved in unethical behavior that&#39;s beamed into our houses by the internet. Same goes for Muslims, where xenophobic tendencies take root in average Americans because of extremists who likewise comprise of less than 1% of the Islamic people.<br><br>I think it&#39;s understood, then, by the people in power that not only is globalization cheaper than domination, but violence on the scale of even 50-60 years ago in any fashion would mean world-wide devastation, and that&#39;s in no one&#39;s best interests. Be that as it may, we should <b>never</b> let our guard down to the possibility of another full blown war. One conflict on the scale of WWII would mean the end of human life I believe. As you say, nuclear warfare treated as conventional warfare is such a scary prospect that we&#39;ve fallen into a stability-instability paradox, but we should never forget the methods of madness spelling a slower, less dramatic, yet no less certain extinction.

But, we still can&#39;t blame them solely for this, because it is a much bigger and global system that is responsible for this. It&#39;s called the monetary system. If we wish to change things in the world, make the lives better for every human being on earth, protect our environment and become more sustainable for the future, we must first change our current system in which we live in. An alternative already exists today. It is called a resource-based economy in which automation and technology work together harmoniously to create  higher standards of living for everyone by making resources (which are the real valuable things on earth, not money) like food, water, clothing and shelter available in abundance. And by abundance I mean enough where everyone has everything they need without scarcity being present.

The premice is, if the illuminati or something like it exists, it is trying to ruin our society. Why? That&#39;s a weak point in this conspiracy, I admit. But, our world is economically in a bad state, why? Because government. Take Greece and Spain. Riots are everywhere and wes, the first world, are next. Should we worry about this? Yes? No. We just need to keep an eye out and stop being regular old &quot;slaves&quot; of our government. And if anything happens and I somehow helped, which I doubt, no need to thank.

This might sound wierd today, but in the past, when population was mostly rural, transfering a portion of population from one suvereignity to another was simple, because people did not care who held sovereignity over them as long as they were allowed to carry on doing their buisness.<br>There were some exceptions like collateral damage to population during the War, which forced some population to become refugees, or Religious problems, but mostly - an agressor was actually expecting most of conqured people to become his new subjects. And more population meant more taxes which was good.<br>Closer to present day, when institutes of citizenship and democrasy was introduced, this transition to different souveregnity was less ikely to hapen as people could express disagreement.<br>Later on, civil right were introduced. And people were demanding not only to consider their will, but also to uphold a level of wellbeing for them, creating social guarantees.<br><br>So eventually a population became not a source of taxes, but a source of headache for it&#39;s government.<br>his is basically the reason why we see countries split into autonomies, as more and more governments see it is better to leave people to handle their problems by themselves.

It started right after ww2, america vs russia, capitalism vs communism, barely 5 years after ww2 there was the korean war, allies vs communists, north korea funded by russia/china, then there was vietnam, afghanistan (and americans are STILL fighting there) there was also yugoslavia where americans of course HAD to stick heir nose in. and don&#39;t forget that thanks to that moron putin, even europe might be invaded again. Plans are already underway to fight in romania, my country, and you sit here talking how there&#39;s a world peace? fuck you. Millions of people are dying thanks to ww3. What, millions is an ok number for you? BILLIONS of people have to die until you accept that things aren&#39;t so great? Maybe the number of war related deaths worldwide has shrunk, but things are FAR from world peace.<br><br>Back in medieval times, there were no atomic bombs to make people fear for their lives that at any second, their whole town could be blown away as well as most big towns. Back then, you could run away from your country and go to another country. You could sit far away with your farm and not be bothered much. But now in the informal age, you absolutely cannot hide no matter where you go. You can&#39;t have a farm because you need all sorts of permits. You can just run to another country because you need the proper documents. You do anything the government doesn&#39;t like, and you&#39;re hunted down. It could be as simple as making a joke. A 14 year old made a JOKE, where he said clearly it was a joke, how he would bomb a school, and he immediately got put in jail. In medieval times, the rulers didn&#39;t had such a tight grip on the peasants. Peasants could easily rise up against the rulers if they wanted. But now it&#39;s pretty much impossible, the government has so much technology, tanks, guns, bombs, all sorts. If the government wants to go to war, we have to comply. It&#39;s so much easier to get 100 peasants (people who you knew all your life) to help you take the ruler down rather than ask 1.000.000 random strangers.<br><br>You sit here and talk like a moron how now in the 21st century, wars are not so many and not so bad as it was in the 20th century. IT&#39;S ONLY BEEN 15 YEARS, FUCKTARD. And the ww2 situation was a big rare deal that happened, along with ww1.

Nukes are the single most important reason why wars are not happening these days. Your other reasons are not full fledged..<br><br>1- All the &quot;international organisations&quot; are just puppets in the hands of developed countries. Organisations like UNSC can&#39;t even take decisions without getting an assent from each of the \u00a0developed country there. Moreover have you forgotten about the League of nations? you know, the organisation established for world piece after WW1?? It was the same as UNSC, dominated by the developed countries. Guess what happened after that? yup, WW2.<br><br>2- Globalization?? are you even serious right now? Globalization is not a recent phenomenon, it started somewhere around 1850s with the advent of new transport technologies and on the backdrop of Industraial Revolution. That globalization was the main cause of the wars as companies needed market for their produce. Globalization mainly increases the wars not decreases. War was actually never as effective in achieveing economic goals as just negotiating. Many economic theorists have said that the countries knew wars would be harmful but they still attacked just because of prejudices and greed.<br>\u00a0 If you study history you will find that wars for resources mainly occured because of the ambition to take control of ALL the resources and not just share it. Countries were able to attack each other because the fighting style was not as devastating as it can be today, therefore today countries prefer to negotiate.<br><br>3- The &quot;rules of UNSC&quot; has to be the most illogical explanation on this list. As I have mentioned above, UNSC is just a rich nation&#39;s organisation. The Permanent court of arbitration \u00a0is also just a puppet. I am not saying this without any reason. Study the organisation structure and veto powers awarded to the rich nations in these organisations. Also just study how much % of their &quot;decisions&quot; have gone against the poor / developing nations and for the rich nations. You will be surprised.<br><br>4- International border point is the only somewhat logical one here. But it&#39;s not to say that all the countries who have \u00a0&quot;pledged&quot; to honour the &quot;territorial integrity&quot; of nations can&#39;t still break those &quot;pledges&quot;. Those kind of pledges have been going on since humanity existed. But you are right that relatively borders are well identified now.\u00a0<br><br>5- You can&#39;t be serious about other countries criticizing acts of aggression. You can be rest assured that as soon as some country attacks another, there will be alliances formed. It has happened when US decided to support pakistan on the liberalization of bangladesh issue. US actually supported pakistan in the liberalization war against India. U.S was driven by a capitalist interest and India was inclined to socialist ideas, therefore lacked US support in the issue. This statement of criticism is a very naive one. All that matters is interest of the countries, no one gives a shit about world piece to be honest. \u00a0Also, in that scenario, your &quot;international organisations&quot; were just spectators( as U.S is a rich nation)<br><br>Now come to nuclear weapons. Countries would have attacked other countries without any hesitation if it was not for the presence of nuclear deterrance. It&#39;s not that countries don&#39;t want to attack each other, but they are scared of each other now. This fear is the main binding force of all the nations. Nothing else has really changed that much if you really look into it. The interests are the same ( exampls Russian interest to control silk road, U.S interest of dollar imperialism etc).

Peace only lasted this long because WWII was quite exhausting and nobody had the energy to fight afterwards. This is a broad statement and I don&#39;t have time to explain it.<br>Also, the unjustified optimism really bugs me. World peace has been tried before after WWI and it failed miserably mainly because countries like Japan still wanted to have empires, and they didn&#39;t, they couldn&#39;t, give a fuck about what the peace loving hippies were advocating. So if you think that UNO prevents wars, think of how USA invaded Iraq. UNO did not agree for an invasion, USA justified it with non-existing WMD, and, let&#39;s face it, even if Iraq had had WMD, why is that America&#39;s problem? I&#39;m not saying the Iraq war was a bad thing. It was quite good, but it was unjustifiable in the technical world-peace-view sense. It brought democracy to those people, it killed Hussein, it brought American influence to the region, it did great things, but it was not a step towards world peace. And if you think about it, before WWII and after WWI, France&#39;s strategy was precisely world peace. They said it: &quot;if Germany rebuilds its military we will not fight&quot;. How did that work? Did it achieve world peace? It didn&#39;t. Even if France&#39;s strategy were to fight or not, the war would had still happened and it would had still fucked France.

Thus, it&#39;s not quite a pleasant sight to watch as these enlightened nations fall into this low-level, custom-made propaganda that would much better suit gentlemen from beyound the ocean. To put it short, Russia did not invade Ukraine. It&#39;s a kind of hilarious if you think about it, because Russia basically did not even lift her proverbial finger to intervene in what is going on there. If you study the most recent history, you would definitely find out that the Republic of Crimea declared independence and used its guerilla forces to secure its strategic objects. And then, as an independent state, it asked to be taken into Russian Federation (for those younger ones, Federation is a union of States, like USA). Russia consequently agreed. No military action was undertaken by Russia in this whole situation at all. What is happening in mainland Ukraine now is a pure civil war between two linguistically distinct parts of the population: the western ukrainians who mostly speak ukrainian and inhabit the less industrially developed region - and the eastern ukrainians, who mostly speak russian and inhabit (and, consequently, control) the rich industrial core of the state. Russia is not a fightier in this war. We can theoretize, of course, that this state is involved in some shadowy operations like selling weapons or providing information, but such accusations have no more ground than accusing USA of invading Ukraine. If we assume Russia is invading Ukraine, we have to assume on equal terms that any other country is invading Ukraine as well.", "comment_date": "2015-02-03T20:13:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silverino", "comment_text": "...and then we have the US of A.... starting conflicts for economic gain? huge check", "comment_date": "2015-02-03T06:12:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Valeriya Whem", "comment_text": "Stupid film, stupid conclusion especially during this war in east of Ukraine", "comment_date": "2015-02-02T21:08:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Foamtail Greenvelvet", "comment_text": "derude sandstorm just had to", "comment_date": "2015-02-02T04:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shane Moran", "comment_text": "why are their always hidden tardises? are you doctor who fans?", "comment_date": "2015-02-02T01:54:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "siprus", "comment_text": "What about Israel vs Pakistan and war between North and South korea.", "comment_date": "2015-02-01T20:20:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "dragon888193ftw", "comment_text": "Why has there not been any formal apologies and compensations to the Iraqi people from the United States?

Spreading democracy is like spreading an idea and i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s bad to spread ideas but some people might not like the idea of other people. They may think that their idea (in this case, of governing) is better than the idea of others. Same as countries. Some countries think democracy is not the best idea of governing. An efficient government is efficient when it is effective and an effective government makes the country better (locally). Democracy isn&#39;t always effective (most of the time, maybe. But not always) Spreading ideas is not bad but forcing it causes bad things to happen (I&#39;m not saying this vid is forcing us the concept of democracy, i&#39;m just pointing out my point).

This is how we brake the cycle: through care for one another (ex. speaking up for peace) and through alleviation of selfishness. Of course I know that alleviation of selfishness is ultimately an individual task but we can help each other. Speaking up for peace can persuade an individual. By thinking ideas that could lead for the betterment of not just for the self but also for one another and by actions of empathy and care, we can break the cycle. That&#39;s what I think and I think we can. Afterall, this is the most peaceful era right?

It asserts colonialism is worse than the multinational corporations&#39; actions by explaining what colonialism does and simply stating it&#39;s worse. It never even tries to get into the effects of economical dependency and abuse by corporations or even states. That&#39;s a very serious flaw imo!<br><br>3. Democracy is said to change everything, but the video never explains exactly how. And that 1900 year looks pretty much random to me! Also, wars between democracies and non-democracies don&#39;t always mean the &quot;guilt&quot; part of starting the conflict was the non-democratic part... That&#39;s just an assumption.<br><br>4. Buy resources? I&#39;m pretty sure you can get stuff without buying (or buying cheaper) with means different than war, like espionage, economic and political pressures/threats, even covert ops (Just look at how the USA fucked up Latin America with all the CIA approved coups during the cold war, effectively making their economies dependent through non-democratic governments allied to &#39;murican interests).<br><br>5. People are more valuable alive than dead. That only makes sense if you think violence is only violence if it results in killing. What about all the slaves or almost-slaves living in underdeveloped countries so that democratic developed countries can have cheaper products? Imposed poverty and underdevelopment is violence! Vulture capitalism is violence!<br><br>6. The video ends stating that the sample is not big enough. Well... Doesn&#39;t that make the whole thing pointless?

Or during the 50s when the elected Iranian leader suffered a coup backed by the CIA due to attempts of nationalization of oil fields, the dictatorship imposed by the west would create the background and the reasons for the Iranian revolution. This tactic is effective on the short term but on the long run it creates more problems to the west, like ISIS in Syria, the Taliban in Afghanistan, Kadaff in Libya, \u00a0Saddam in Iraq, and left wing governments in South America. All those examples are anti american groups that gained support due to regimes imposed by the west. The reasons for war (shortage of resources) are still present, so due to this new political polarization, and future shortages of oil and other nature resources our sons might fight a WW3. Most of these shortage could be avoided if we adopt ecological policies, like fighting soil`s erosion, protecting water supplies and fighting climate change.

During this period there were many people who also believed that war was becoming increasingly irrelevant as a political tool\u00a0<br><br>And finally it is completely absurd to assume that the human race is moving beyond large scale armed conflict. For those of you who are quoting Fukuyama&#39;s &quot;End of history&quot; thesis it is correct in stating that the war for ideology may be over but, he completely ignores the fact that conflict existed long before nation states fought over ideology and war will continue to exist so long as humanity exists \u00a0\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-10-19T04:03:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Analytical Ace", "comment_text": "democracy, not crony capitalism.", "comment_date": "2014-10-19T02:27:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Soliz", "comment_text": "Make a video on Quantum Foam, Quantum Physics, or simply any thing that can relate to Cosmology that you haven&#39;t already done.

WWII - blitzkrieg, massive waves upon waves of soldiers clashing, still bad medical care = again, millions of deaths. Korean and Vietnam, well I don&#39;t have to go into that but we started to get a little more bodily protection, not much, but fighting in the jungles and having a bit better field medicts = hundreds of thousands of deaths, still a lot but not that many considering how long the Vietnam war was.<br><br>The middle-east conflicts we are currently in and have been for a long time are much, much different. First, we use a lot more tactics, we don&#39;t have to send waves of expendable soldiers to overwhelm the enemy army, our soldiers are better protected with better bullet-proof vests and helmets, we have a lot better field medics (so many more soldiers now are coming home wounded than before. In early wars, you got wounded severely, you died. Now, limbs are being lost and still soldiers are saved). And, today its not like we&#39;re fighting army vs army. Fighting terrorists is a whole different ball game. You could save a group of people one day only to have them turn around the next day and shoot you in the back. We now have much better vehicles to travel around the ground with, protecting our soldiers from IED&#39;s and gunfire.<br><br>As long as there are major differences with people&#39;s views and some of those people want power by force, there will always be conflict.

A democratically elected president was ousted in Ukraine, and the EU fully supported it! Of course Russia was worried, and of course the EU were in the wrong. No matter how bad a leader is, you can&#39;t just kick him out whenever you want. The more you poke Russia, the more they&#39;ll retaliate. I think they were entirely justified in what they did regarding the Crimea, and whilst I don&#39;t think Putin is an amazingly benign leader on the whole, I think he was in the right on this occasion to take action (although the violence and the uprising of rebels were of course bad effects of the action he took). If the EU didn&#39;t meddle in everything, lots of crises would have been averted in the past decade or so. You cannot just put the blame on Russia for these recent incidents in and around Ukraine, you have to look and point out all guilty parties. As well as that, to outright lie about Russia and what they&#39;re doing is not only unfair, but it&#39;s non-factual and I thought you were better than that.

It&#39;s a bit of taking a shit on actual statistics. Lulling people into the evocative ease of seemingly objective rationals.<br><br>But definitions that reveal themselves as blurry, when considered. Then their whole logic of numbers dies with it. Pity. An example; they suggest there&#39;s far less wars between countries and empires. But when is a country or empire, a country or empire? Those lines are drawn in hindsight. If people occupy a new territory long enough with long enough time of societal structure and identity, it gets recognized externally, eventually. That&#39;s how nationalisation works. And empires are almost always merely historical labels, based on looking back. Then there&#39;s the idea of civil war. Officially a war can be classified as a civil war, while in reality it&#39;s a myriad of geopolitical forces behind the scenes, who play out their national cards under the radar of explicit confirmation. Again, historically, such boundaries might be reconsidered dramatically in later hindsight.<br><br>I guess Kurtsgezagt tries something complex in a short simplistic pleasing manner. But perhaps that&#39;s just almost impossible for making &#39;real&#39; arguments. Unless they do it a bit more postmodern, 2000&#39;s style, with a less authoritative and less self-unaware narrative. It&#39;s the inherent claim that provokes me into pointing out that it can&#39;t be taken on face value. Such narratives undo the attempts by nuanced social sciences that have tried to undue damages of that kind of narratives in the first place. We need contemporary analyses that take such reflexivity into account. The damages are real: assumptions via powerful short attention span media, spread quickly and deeply. Otherwise, we feed ourselves brain diarrhea. It&#39;s difficult. Vlogbrothers often pull it off due to their inherent vlogstyle of downplaying their authority. CGP Grey often picks saver topics that leave out contexts of such social structures and processes. \u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-10-09T18:45:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Yurii Gul", "comment_text": "You can get much further with a kind word and a gun than you can with a kind word alone.

My guess is that the current local wars will degrade into regional wars which will degrade into more global wars.
