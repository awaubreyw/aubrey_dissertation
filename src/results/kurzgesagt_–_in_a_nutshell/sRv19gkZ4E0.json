As I was shuffling your cards there\u2019s two sets of messages for your fire signs. A lot of you are working on a project this could be with a friend or cousin or family and you\u2019re going to be prompted to look at a situation in new perspective and there\u2019s a message here where you guys are going to be sending you messages to heal the past to look deeper within yourself however when it comes to dwelling in truth I do not see success here I see here where someone is going to be abusing their power just so that they can get their way and someone is going to be sneaking back to doing some thing that they\u2019re doing basically there\u2019s someone who\u2019s here who\u2019s not being honest, they keep sneaking back and doing the same thing and this person is abusing their power. I feel that this is someone who is not going to allow themselves to be free because they keep doing manipulative things and abusing someone and or many people, there is conflict that\u2019s coming in here however it looks like a lot of your goodies keeping a secret you\u2019re gonna be in a very bad mood a lot of you and you maybe finding out some sort of unwelcome knowledge. There is a rainbow waiting for you but as I\u2019m looking at these energies instead of you walking toward your ramble you\u2019re walking towards the ace of swords reversed which talks about conquest and we\u2019re trying to win something bye abusing your power on someone and I\u2019m seeing here where there\u2019s an ending coming in here for you in a lot of you\u2019re gonna be finding out some sort of unwelcome knowledge.<br><br>~There\u2019s a new beginning that is coming in however a lot of you\u2019re trying to control some sort of new beginning that doesn\u2019t really happen because of deception that keeps being done so instead of you dwelling in truth and flying free you\u2019re going away from it and there\u2019s a lot of worry that\u2019s coming in. Some of you are extremely nervous to talk to someone because of a lot of situations where you fire signs may have manipulated a lot of situations and it looks like you\u2019re going to continue doing the same thing you guys yup and with the king of pentacles being reversed year this is someone who is going to double cross people, so if some of your fire signs are dealing with other fire signs be careful with this energy. But the person doing the manipulating they\u2019re going to go through it because they\u2019re walking away from the rainbow. There\u2019s also energy here where they are asking you to use the sword of truth Archangel Michael for some of you they\u2019re staying here where if you listen and do the right thing you\u2019re gonna be rewarded with a surprise. Because I know these messages are for all of you.

Also, we need to find a way to get our macrophages and monocytes to not obey their commands when infected with Ebola.

The flu causes more death annually obviously since nearly everybody gets it sooner or later. Most of these casualties are the elderly, young, and people who have a poor immune system. Malaria is barely heard of nowadays since it&#39;s &#39;old news&#39; though I don&#39;t really agree with not keeping this in the news just because it&#39;s around for a long time. Besides that malaria only spreads from mosquito to human, and not from human-human interaction for as far as I know.

So, I tried to enter the hardware, but it has a password (cell membrane) which is in its which does password (allows or block thing in and out of the cell). Damn. I just need a trick. YES! I have added another program which trespasses the password (advanced virus). I go to the cell and boom the password works. Yes, I go and starts downloading my software into the hardware, then boom. I have made multiple copies. too much that it explodes because of the amount of program files I&#39;ve added. Well my other copies go and... WHAT! It gets blocked and also terminated by this hardware version of a firewall and other stuff (immunity system). What! Well, some of my others succeeds and high jacks other hardware. It does the same thing again and again and I have also met some other software also experiencing the same thing, but this damn annoying thing just stops me. Wait a minute. My software has a program than can attack hardware right, isn\u2019t the firewall a software installed on a hardware. Well, I shall now do a bit of adjustments (collects resources from other different types of viruses). Finally, a program which I can use to defeat the firewall. Now I feel a much more powerful software and I also feel smarter (Ebola virus). Yes it works, I have inserted my software on one of the firewall hardware yes my copies I am so proud.

Ebola also tends to incapacitate its victims physically by the time they are heavily infected enough to pose a high risk of transmission - resulting in the victims being unable to travel much or avoid detection.  <br><br>A person staggering through an airport bleeding from every orifice is going to be noticed and few people, if any, will be infected.  Meanwhile a single unvaccinated child with measles will have infected <b>every unvaccinated person in the concourse</b> without necessarily even showing symptoms.<br><br>Long story short, don&#39;t worry about ebola.

Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.<br>The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests, but the most recent outbreak in west Africa has involved major urban as well as rural areas.<br>Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Good outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, namely case management, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, safe burials and social mobilisation.<br>Early supportive care with rehydration, symptomatic treatment improves survival. There is as yet no licensed treatment proven to neutralise the virus but a range of blood, immunological and drug therapies are under development.<br>There are currently no licensed Ebola vaccines but 2 potential candidates are undergoing evaluation.<br>Background<br><br>The Ebola virus causes an acute, serious illness which is often fatal if untreated. Ebola virus disease (EVD) first appeared in 1976 in 2 simultaneous outbreaks, one in Nzara, Sudan, and the other in Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.<br><br>The current outbreak in west Africa, (first cases notified in March 2014), is the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976. There have been more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. It has also spread between countries starting in Guinea then spreading across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia, by air (1 traveller only) to Nigeria, and by land (1 traveller) to Senegal.<br><br>The most severely affected countries, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia have very weak health systems, lacking human and infrastructural resources, having only recently emerged from long periods of conflict and instability. On August 8, the WHO Director-General declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.<br><br>A separate, unrelated Ebola outbreak began in Boende, Equateur, an isolated part of the Democratic Republic of Congo.<br><br>The virus family Filoviridae includes 3 genera: Cuevavirus, Marburgvirus, and Ebolavirus. There are 5 species that have been identified: Zaire, Bundibugyo, Sudan, Reston and Ta\u00ef Forest. The first 3, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Zaire ebolavirus, and Sudan ebolavirus have been associated with large outbreaks in Africa. The virus causing the 2014 west African outbreak belongs to the Zaire species.<br><br>Transmission<br><br>It is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts. Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.<br><br>Ebola then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.<br><br>Health-care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed EVD. This has occurred through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced.<br><br>Burial ceremonies in which mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased person can also play a role in the transmission of Ebola.<br><br>People remain infectious as long as their blood and body fluids, including semen and breast milk, contain the virus. Men who have recovered from the disease can still transmit the virus through their semen for up to 7 weeks after recovery from illness.<br><br>Symptoms of Ebola virus disease<br><br>The incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms is 2 to 21 days. Humans are not infectious until they develop symptoms. First symptoms are the sudden onset of fever fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools). Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.<br><br>Diagnosis<br><br>It can be difficult to distinguish EVD from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Confirmation that symptoms are caused by Ebola virus infection are made using the following investigations:<br><br>antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)<br>antigen-capture detection tests<br>serum neutralization test<br>reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay<br>electron microscopy<br>virus isolation by cell culture.<br>Samples from patients are an extreme biohazard risk; laboratory testing on non-inactivated samples should be conducted under maximum biological containment conditions.<br><br>Treatment and vaccines<br><br>Supportive care-rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids- and treatment of specific symptoms, improves survival. There is as yet no proven treatment available for EVD. However, a range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated. No licensed vaccines are available yet, but 2 potential vaccines are undergoing human safety testing.<br><br>Prevention and control<br><br>Good outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, namely case management, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, safe burials and social mobilisation. Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Ebola infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. Risk reduction messaging should focus on several factors:<br><br>Reducing the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.<br>Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home.<br>Outbreak containment measures including prompt and safe burial of the dead, identifying people who may have been in contact with someone infected with Ebola, monitoring the health of contacts for 21 days, the importance of separating the healthy from the sick to prevent further spread, the importance of good hygiene and maintaining a clean environment.<br>Controlling infection in health-care settings:<br><br>Health-care workers should always take standard precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials), safe injection practices and safe burial practices.<br><br>Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient\u2019s blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 metre) of patients with EBV, health-care workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).<br><br>Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Ebola infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.<br><br>WHO response<br><br>WHO aims to prevent Ebola outbreaks by maintaining surveillance for Ebola virus disease and supporting at-risk countries to developed preparedness plans. The document provides overall guidance for control of Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks:<br><br>Ebola and Marburg virus disease epidemics: preparedness, alert, control, and evaluation<br>When an outbreak is detected WHO responds by supporting surveillance, community engagement, case management, laboratory services, contact tracing, infection control, logistical support and training and assistance with safe burial practices.<br><br>WHO has developed detailed advice on Ebola infection prevention and control:<br><br>Infection prevention and control guidance for care of patients with suspected or confirmed Filovirus haemorrhagic fever in health-care settings, with focus on Ebola.", "comment_date": "2015-01-23T18:35:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "One Of Purple Guy's Victims", "comment_text": "when is the virus immune system video released?<br>iv&#39;e been waiting ever since 25th December and im tired of watching the bacteria immune system video", "comment_date": "2015-01-23T08:10:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EX7RUD1CON", "comment_text": "So what this video has taught me is the best way to combat ebola is with education.

I thought I&#39;d try and answer this best I can. First without treatment the survival rate is much lower, closer to 8/10 - 9/10 die. The current treatment we have is rehydration therapy. This helps with the loss of fluids that the virus causes. Other therapies are being developed but rehydration is still the best we have and is still lacking in certain regions.  <br><br>Aside from treatment the remaining 1/10 or 2/10 probably survive due to a mixture of genetics and luck. <br><br>There are a few genetic reasons a person might be resistant to the infection, ranging from not having an optimum receptor on the cell for the virus to attach too. Downstream differences in cell to cell commutation that means their immune systems are slightly different. These differences might mean that the immune system gets a few extra hours/days it needs to overcome the infection (probably by producing antibodies to the virus). <br><br>The other way is luck, there are a whole bunch of things that could impact how the virus spreads, from the initial number of viral particles the person gets infected with too which cell they infect first. Let&#39;s say the virus infects a cell which is at the end of its natural life and commits apoptosis (cell death) just as viral replication is about to start. This again for give the immune system that little bit of extra time it needs to mount an attack. <br><br>Also a &#39;cool&#39; thing about Ebola is that is plays around with two separate systems of the immune system which normally regulate each other by feedback mechanisms. If the immune system manages to start the correct mechanisms and feed backs before the virus can really get a grip it could potentially fight off the virus. <br><br>Finally one of the effects of Ebola as shown in the video is a depletion of immune cells. If for any reason (such as the ones I given) enough immune cell survive then a person has a better chance of surviving. <br><br>I hope that helps and feel free to ask any follow up!
