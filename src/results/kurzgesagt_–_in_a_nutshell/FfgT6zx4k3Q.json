Colors are correlated to wave lengths which cannot penetrate through DNA or solid surfaces. If you stand close to a microwave it will not damage chromosomes or your DNA. Also the colour of visible light depends on its wavelength. These wavelengths range from 700 nm at the red end of the spectrum to 400 nm at the violet end. Visible light waves are the only electromagnetic waves we can see. And just to emphasize, Ionizing radiation mostly comes from radioactive sources. Several kinds of ionizing radiation will cause DNA damage. But for example: microwaves are not radioactive, and do not cause ionizing radiation.

That is a question everyone should ask, because it&#39;s subjective as hell.\r<br>Factors are:\r<br>What frequency does YOUR phone emit?\r<br>What is the natural resonance frequency of the casing that comes with it + any casing you buy and add to it? (Depending on the situation, it can work more or less, some ways you can be more so safe and others still dangerous enough, and for you know what that has a metal kind of piece in it, it can reflect the bad stuff from outside but also provide with it&#39;s natural resonance frequency, so it&#39;s kinda like in gambling where you could win twice as much but you could also lose twice as much. Not that it necessarily goes 100 this way or that way consistently, I&#39;m not even sure how you would do that in such varying conditions or at least for more than 5 seconds straight).\r<br>How heavy is it in your area? Are you shielded? If so, how much and how. Back to heavy: Wave riding is REAL, when you jam a signal that&#39;s called a CONSISTENT wave ride, wave ride can still happen even if the frequencies are different, think of it as sometimes in sync and sometimes not. Wave riding makes it louder and it can go back and forth in a way which is what I call Wavelength Dominance Shifting and you can demonstrate this with an Electric Keyboard (Musical) that has a reverb function that introduces two other frequencies for the stereo widening effect. If you pay attention, you can feel the Base (you have that, anyway) and two others introduced by widening taking turns in terms of what&#39;s dominant.\r<br>Your body depending on if you&#39;re a Man or Woman (different resonance frequencies, like 10 or 12 - I forget the exact number) will have different reactions depending on the tuning, there&#39;s also your diet (temporary items within the body) which also have their natural resonance frequencies, if you eat like crap - it&#39;s not gonna be fun, you can basically program your body by what you eat and are exposed to since you can activate different parts of the body depending on how much the waves resonate, for example: As a male: If I keep being exposed to the Venus vibe then my body will have whatever that resonates with that fully and partially be shook more and as a result - start packing things that way. I listen to music on shuffle so I can get my body somewhere so it&#39;s not fully predictable and it&#39;s one of the reasons why I don&#39;t like to blast the sound of a widely viewed live event on TV (I also customize the set to be Black and White so I don&#39;t have to dissociate as much in terms of neuro science stuff) since my body will become similar to others and you can probably tell who watched what live event based on their bodies&#39; state shortly and perhaps a little longer after.\r<br>Back to what YOUR phone puts out, yes. It could be bad and through programming and how you are (that is subjective) you can induce a crap ton of things, there is NO doubt in my mind about that. Some may resonate with a positive part of your body, such as 528 hz. Also, if you have something negative in your body and the device transmits a wavelength that matches and possibly ends up shattering it and getting it OUT of your body, that could be a thing, too.\r<br>Even if the output from YOUR phone (it can sure as hell also reflect what&#39;s transmitted to it, too, even not directly.) by itself is not harmful to you in your case, you have to remember that wave riding makes way for this example. Fi^: gee can make your WiFi louder and it works the other way around. The waves coming from AM and FM stations also play a huge role in this since they both fluctuate in their own ways like crazy (depends on the content), and we haven&#39;t even gotten started yet! Oh my! \r<br>Phone casing: Why this is important is because I know from experience that if I take my coffee mug that naturally resonates at 432hz tuning and put it next to an active wireless device, I will then be able to walk pretty much anywhere in the house and feel that 432hz because the device as it&#39;s putting out a carrier wave, can reflect the cups tuning via Amplitude Modulation that occurs from putting the cup next to the device which it&#39;s natural resonance frequency that it is emitting is surely reaching, oh yeah, and the sound of people TALKING, too. Your thoughts are waves too, buddy, so keep your head away from those things.\r<br>To anyone who says &quot;placebo&quot;: B!$th! I WISH PLACEBO WOULD WORK THAT WELL! THEN I WOULDN&#39;T HAVE TO DO THIS S*IT NOW WOULD I? -- However.. I noticed that my nervous system and whatever emotion I think of and shoot through it as a result can also ride the waves coming from the outside and amplify them as a result! If I think of &quot;Challengers&quot; from the first DBZ B game, even though it&#39;s tuning does NOT match the FM transmitter&#39;s (consistent wave ride), it still gets amplified (depends on the frequency which can be more or less in or out of sync)!<br>You also have to remember that Phase Modulation EXISTS. Polarization changes also matter, too!<br><br>Thanks for reading and take care!", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T06:58:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shubh Gupta", "comment_text": "Im getting more radiation from your video rather than from my phone XD", "comment_date": "2021-11-22T04:42:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "LaNoir", "comment_text": "Clicking on one of this eduactional videos made me feel the impact the missing dislike bar has.

It&#39;s pondering an already defunct idea. These &quot;long term studies&quot; are already complete, in that - we&#39;ve been blasting radio waves across the globe nonstop for 150 and there has literally never been a single case of someone being injured or damaged because of these said radio waves. Specific one off cases are too much just that - specific. You can&#39;t claim general adverse health effects if you have to specify the damage your looking for because at large you can already see that damage isn&#39;t widespread and therefore not a generalize heth effect. So those studies looking at time spend watching and electrical intensity and that, are quite pointless. I mean right now there&#39;s a huge experiment of this going on. Look at all the YouTubers, who spend 12+ hours a day surrounded by electronics. Literally just compare them to people who spend less than one hour. Are you going to find any general difference between them, that can be attributed not to the fact that they have spend 12+ hours on a computer, in front of a screen, all that jazz - but from them spending 12+ hours surrounded by flowing electrons. The answer - is no. There are no generalized health effects from just spending time in the vicinity of weakly flowing electrons. N.O.N.E.  As far as any actual data is concerned the only harmful effects that are even remotely considered is having your phone sit on your bear chest or breast may or may not increase risk of cancer. Your skull is even thick enough to where you can just leave your phone sitting on your head and it won&#39;t do anything to your brain. These waves are in no way harmful unless they are localized and directed. the perfect example is the microwave. I&#39;m almost certain there isnt a single documented case of someone getting cancer from their microwave. Because the waves are localized and directed specifically within the microwave, you can stand in front of it and not get cancer - because the waves that come into contact with you are radiated normally and are not directed and concentrated on you. But if you step in the microwave where it&#39;s all localized and concentrated and directed towards you, it&#39;s not gonna be a fun time. Same with radio waves. Absolutely harmless unless localized and concentrated directly at you. A good example is that military tool that&#39;s like a radio wave gun, that&#39;s shaped like a spot light and directs concentrated radio waves at a specific target. We KNOW this stuff. Pondering defunct shit like this is why there are people who actually do think 5G towers cause cancer. If there were, we would definitely see it by now.

if I&#39;m wrong and somebody can (politely) tell me why, I&#39;ll happily accept the explanation and move on.<br><br>The shorter the wavelength of the radiation, the more harmful it is to organisms.  I would guess this is because the shorter the wavelength, the greater the probability is that the radiation will bump into an organic molecule within a given space while passing through an organism and knock out an electron or split an atom.  Radio wavelengths are so long that they <i>rarely</i> (but not never) bump into an organic molecule, and because such a collision is so rare the organism can heal quick enough that it never develops into cancer, hence why radio waves are so safe.  (Living organisms experience nuclear fission &quot;all the time,&quot; but normally the frequency is so low that it&#39;s far too negligible to be endangering.)<br><br>Now consider a living space packed full of electrical devices, <i>each</i> broadcasting radio waves for wireless network communication in addition to the radiation generated by electric currents.  While these devices are each emitting long-wavelength radiation which is normally harmless, this space is <i>saturated</i> with long-wavelength radiation, such that waves are overlapping and crisscrossing, to the degree that some devices even experience <i>radio interference.</i>  Similar to how a single thread is weak enough to break by hand but several woven together into a rope are extremely strong, could an extreme saturation of normally harmless long-wavelength radiation be equivalent to exposure to a small dose of short-wavelength radiation?

I agree the idea here too what you say but there is an exception you haven&#39;t mentioned. 5G, the upper frequencies of 5G will be used in dense city areas like London,  Newyork etc and upper frequency is somewhere between 25-52 but it can even be upto 80Ghz. And higher the frequency smaller the wavelength and smaller wavelengths affected by objects so in chocoblock city centers once in 40-50 meters on lamp posts everywhere there will be planted cells,transievers. In certain areas people will be exposed to intersection of bounced signals and they will be in long term harming your body. Don&#39;t forget microwave ovens uses frequency around 300 Ghz and it heats up foods, so fast! Typical 39 Ghz operator 5g upper band frequency is not less! You say sun beams not harmful but if you collect them with a lens you can burn a paper. Its not direct ratio like 300ghz heats up 1 kg chicken in 10 mins so 50ghz 5g will take 60mins, but one thing obvious 50ghz will also heat up your cells. If you sunbath more than 20 mins you will be burnt etc.. We Have to consider it will be dangerous in long term.

Because even if they have no effect on humans, the same cannot be said for animals and plants. It is possible to have an effect, even if small, but it is an effect that is better to be limited or even removed because for me it is better if nature remains  as much as possible intact from human activity.

It may seem that these could be the results of day-to-day stress and busyness, but there may be another culprit. All of these are symptoms of electro-sensitivity, which is something more and more people are finding themselves affected by. Studies done in 1997 have found \u201cless than a few cases (of electro-sensitivity) per million\u201d, however now as much as 2.5% of the population find themselves affected by electro-sensitivity. Even by most moderate calculations, electro-sensitivity is 1,000 times more common now than it was 20 years ago. Why could this be?<br><br>Electro-sensitivity and its symptoms seem to be triggered by certain microwave frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. Microwaves are frequently used in electronics for the purposes of communication between devices. Due to their high frequency, microwaves allow for higher transmission rates and small antenna sizes, which is perfect for high-tech devices that are constantly getting smaller and faster.

It may seem that these could be the results of day-to-day stress and busyness, but there may be another culprit. All of these are symptoms of electro-sensitivity, which is something more and more people are finding themselves affected by. Studies done in 1997 have found \u201cless than a few cases (of electro-sensitivity) per million\u201d, however now as much as 2.5% of the population find themselves affected by electro-sensitivity. Even by most moderate calculations, electro-sensitivity is 1,000 times more common now than it was 20 years ago. Why could this be?<br><br>Electro-sensitivity and its symptoms seem to be triggered by certain microwave frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. Microwaves are frequently used in electronics for the purposes of communication between devices. Due to their high frequency, microwaves allow for higher transmission rates and small antenna sizes, which is perfect for high-tech devices that are constantly getting smaller and faster. These are devices such as cell phones, tablets, laptops, and any devices able to connect to Wi-Fi, which can now include TVs and refrigerators.

Cellphone reception was 1 bar outdoors on a good day, indoors was not functional.<br>Whenever I came around I had to leave my cellphone in the car (Once I got one anyways).<br><br>Work for him was brutal as he had REAL symptoms too that you could see, rashes, panic attacks, the hair on his arms and neck would stand on end, shivers, nausea etc.<br><br>He went pretty far too to combat the radiation that he would get exposed to.<br>He had the utility company hook up service to his garage, which was a decent way from his house, and ran his own illegal (he did it himself, didn&#39;t tell utility) line to his house and moved all his stuff (microwave, washer, fridge etc) to that side of the house in a great room. He then disconnected the service feed from the house without telling them and disconnected the electrical lines going to every other part of the house. (He showed me the electrical panel almost all the breakers were off, but he did disconnect some permanently)<br>This made him feel better, less symptoms, so this was totally a positive reinforcement for him that he was right.<br><br><br>Eventually went on disability. Turned into a real tin foil hatter (literally).<br>We kinda had a falling out one day after I had read some research that said this stuff doesn&#39;t affect people, he just kept pointing to his symptoms as proof that it was the radiation doing it to him.<br>I had really wanted to prove it to him so without telling him, I turned all his breakers back on in the panel. Well a few weeks later I visited him, and he was telling me he was feeling much better as he had saved up for this ridiculous metal mesh to block the radiation and had lined his bedroom and great room with it.

If any individual consistently identifies when the fields are turned on then their claim will have been verified.<br><br>At the St Louis City Museum there is a very interesting contraption that the public is permitted to use. It measures skin conductivity in milliamps. Fairly simple, right? Well, I made a game out of controlling that. I figured out how to consciously change what number the needle points at. I can&#39;t explain how I can do it, but I recorded myself doing it. My running hypothesis is that since anything from skin temperature to the e m fields of your body can change this number it&#39;s possible to learn to control these seemingly uncontrollable things with the right effort, but I do wonder if maybe people have a kind of Electro sense.  this could explain why some people are sensitive and others are not without it necessarily being a matter of harm.", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T08:59:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wandefter", "comment_text": "they just disproved the 5g conspiracy theories lol", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T08:22:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "exseque", "comment_text": "Show Sauls brother this video.", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T08:21:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "FlaMu", "comment_text": "Everyone using electricity to watch this: Hmm", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T03:07:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lute The Mage", "comment_text": "I love it how Kurzgesaqt is just the nicest guy and the way he puts things isn\u2019t ever patronising in the slightest!

Galileo created experiments that isolated the factor of mass from the many complicated factors of aerodynamics and turbulence, and disproved the wisdom of the ancient world.  He even arrived at a pretty accurate estimate of the gravitational constant.  Isolating factors is what lets science see things clearly.<br>However, I think in this case that science&#39;s very strength creates a weakness when trying to assess this risk.  Because we don&#39;t live in isolation, with just a cell phone, or just one device.  Though the cell phone may be the most proximate source of radiation, it is radiating away while we sit in a box veritably humming with different sources of radiation, with neighbors with their own sets of radiation, in towns with centralized higher frequency radiation providing our radio, tv and cell service,.  Each of these in isolation is not a problem.  Yet I cannot help but think that the superposition of so many electromagnetic waves, cannot help but interfere with one another.<br>This interference would not form any constant interference pattern, it would be irregular. And with so many sources, it is impossible to predict what might happen.  There are simply too many factors for the empirical aspect of science to ever find a satisfactory result.  Yet it seems to me that, in such a sea of overlapping waves, occasionally you&#39;re going to run into freak little spikes of constructive interference.  Sure, it would be incredibly rare, but at a great enough scale, even the exceptionally rare could be significant.  And, theoretically, enough superimposed electromagnetic waves could, potentially, cause a spike of a high enough energy to ionize.<br>And if, say, this random high energy electromagnetic spike happened proximate to a cell at the wrong moment in mitosis, and knocks an electron off an atom or two in one of those little nucleotides, the cell drops a G in the repair, and bam, you&#39;ve got a mutation, possibly a cancerous one.  Yes, this would be incredibly unlikely, but considering that electromagnetic waves are constantly superimposing all around us, the incredibly unlikely might happen more often than we&#39;d like to think.<br>That being said, I have my cell phone next to me, and I&#39;m not ready to give up electricity and wear a tinfoil hat.  Just saying, just because science can&#39;t sort it out, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t there, it just means it&#39;s really really complicated.

After watching your episodes about red dwarfs and their possible tens of trillions of years lifespan it led me to wonder what the lifespan of a neutron star would be and after doing some of my own research and checking things i couldnt find any really consensus other than that the oldest ones are ten billion +/- a few hundred million years or so and that they may in fact never die unless of course they collect enough mass to finally collapse into a black hole which if that is the case i would speculate that like the heat death of the universe that result would be the inevitable end for most neutron stars and the others would go out in spectacular very one in trillion events like merging with a black hole or another neutron star. That being said if they dont die or inevitably collapse into a black hole what does that mean for the theory of the heat death of the universe because unless im mistaken neutron stars still produce a fair amount of energy on their own. It would be really cool if you could discuss this topic in a future video or even just make a footnote of it in a video that is related to it if their isnt enough information to give a full accurate answer.

So in order to be sure that they&#39;re not approving something that could get them in trouble, they display an innate bias toward research proposals that are being funded by someone else. (Clearly, if something goes wrong, it&#39;s the funding source that would stand most immediately accountable, right?) So far so good. But unfortunately these days most of the funding sources, are corporate. So to say, as this video does, that we have &quot;mountains of data&quot; regarding whether exposure to certain types of electromagnetic field are harmful, is at least accidentally misleading.

Certain parts of your body are much more sensitive to it (like your eyes) but even still it takes a considerable amount of energy for waves below ultraviolet to be damaging to you. A tragic example I read about detailing exactly how quickly damaging microwave radiation can be to a human body actually sourced an article where a mother put her human baby in a microwave oven. It&#39;s terrible, but the autopsy of this atrocity very clearly indicated that microwaves, the same frequency that your cellphones, routers, and misc wireless devices operate at, do not penetrate deeply into your skin even with considerable amounts of power, because the infant didn&#39;t suffer deep burns even after several minutes in the appliance. Another example is microwave tethers which workers who would typically install them on poles would use as a source of warmth for their hands when installing them on cold days. These tethers operate at power levels up to hundreds of times more than that of a meager cellphone with it&#39;s couple mile 600MHz RF.  Bottom line is if it has a lot of power it&#39;ll probably have signs that say don&#39;t touch or get in the way of the device, I work in front of satellites that operate in the 7GHz range daily and despite my coworkers being absolutely petrified at the idea of me being in front of it while it&#39;s transmitting there&#39;s not really a substantial risk due to low exposure time and relatively meager amounts of power.", "comment_date": "2019-07-10T22:36:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T\u0336R\u0336I\u0336P\u0336P\u0336I\u0336", "comment_text": "\u201cCould you phone hurt you\u201d <br><br><b>watches on phone</b>", "comment_date": "2019-07-10T22:32:49Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Bamboozler", "comment_text": "Who else is watching this on their phone?", "comment_date": "2019-07-10T22:18:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sami Sarraj", "comment_text": "Do a video about 5g and possible danger.

I can&#39;t feel a Wi-Fi network, but I can feel when a CRT television turns on or when air conditioner turns on or off. I&#39;ve tested this with a detector and found that during such times the lines in the house actually give off significantly more EMFs, and in fact in some old houses the lights can flicker when an air conditioner kicks on or off.<br><br>Rather than testing whether these fields are harmful or not, it should be easier to establish whether or not a person can perceive such Fields consciously. If they can be perceived consciously that it would give us a starting point to establish whether or not they are safe. In all likelihood, safe levels might even vary by the individual.", "comment_date": "2019-07-08T14:34:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TrendinAndo", "comment_text": "I came to know if my phone is killing me<br>I ended buying a VPN", "comment_date": "2019-07-08T14:33:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Olivia xoxo bunny", "comment_text": "Light waves are more powerful than radio waves, so when someone claims WiFi is giving them headaches or whatever, it\u2019s bull", "comment_date": "2019-07-08T14:33:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Happy WALEK", "comment_text": "We  will  evolve  we will become stronger", "comment_date": "2019-07-08T14:32:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iWreck", "comment_text": "Porygon <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfgT6zx4k3Q&amp;t=5m35s\">5:35</a>", "comment_date": "2019-07-08T14:30:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stravo Lukos", "comment_text": "Remember, mainstream media runs on MONEY.

Also, even when using a password manager like Dashlane, a person can still accidentally store some passwords insecurely, reducing the effectiveness of the password protection. Also, a password manager doesn&#39;t protect a person from leaking personal data to the internet; that is up to them not to share it and the services not to disclose it, either accidentally or on purpose.

They were studying correlation, which isn&#39;t the same as causation, but it&#39;s also downright idiotic to take ignore. If people are getting brain cancer on the side of their head that they use cellphones with, then, I frankly don&#39;t give a fuck if their reporting on usage frequency was &quot;reliable&quot;.

And at this point, doing your own study isn&#39;t enough. Either you have a 15 million dollar study and are a career scientist, or you have no voice. This is why science is viewed as a cult, it has a long history of officially determining things are safe, like putting lead in gasoline, THEN fighting the people who oppose them, THEN, pretending science is still pure.<br><br>Obviously we&#39;re onto something in regards to actually studying and measuring things.

Use this code for this password service &quot;Because We Want You To Have Nice Things&quot;&#39;. And not because you make money off of us using your affiliate code? I realize this probably seems nitpicky but it&#39;s recurring; when it comes to how you guys keep trying to sell things, it tends to just shift abruptly into being shady, like a feigned covert effort, but it&#39;s not subtle and it&#39;s not honest or respectful. <br><br>In a gross kind of irony, it&#39;s actually the same type of information that I can see this channel making videos on wherein you call out lies and a manipulation using methods that prey upon a populace, proven to be influential. The dignity and high moral fiber that the channel tries to otherwise uphold just takes a back seat. It&#39;s been more frequently noticeable and obvious, I assume as the channel is growing and things are being handled by marketing teams or something that weren&#39;t initially there and are apathetic to the scruples this channel had exuded to uphold, or the ownership has just gotten greedier, who knows. It&#39;s apparent, whatever it is. <br><br>This video is at odds. When you make a vid that specifically calls attention to seeing past misinformation published and spread for personal motive, and then railroad that very same video into your advertising and do the exact same thing in trying to sell things to your viewers, it makes your whole channel look cheap, low quality, and more difficult to trust. The very basis of this series is the thing you most directly oppose by treating your viewers like nothing but dumb consumers and it&#39;s getting increasingly worse. There&#39;s nothing wrong with monetizing and profiting from these videos, but you have a choice in how you do so and how you market all this stuff.

Your body has learned to live with radiation it&#39;s whole life and comes from an ansetry that had to deal with it too. Historicly, heavy radiation has killed or harmed one&#39;s genetic ancestors leaving behind an instinctive anxiety that is easily triggered. Your body is always fighting off the effects of radiation and has even come to use radiation for it&#39;s benefit, just one can heal from an injury, regeneration is fixing the effects of radiation every day and if overwhelmed by the damage done, results in problems or death.", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:27:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G1478", "comment_text": "This is the premise of Better Call Saul :D :P", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:27:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "no way", "comment_text": "Some peoples immune system pick up certain frequencies like a protein and have reactions Ive heard", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:27:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FoXR", "comment_text": "But what about the g-diffuser system on the f-zero cars.

Heat is defined as a flow of energy between two bodies cause by a difference in their temperatures, this is what&#39;s know  as &quot;conduction heat transfer&quot;. Black body radiation is a different phenomenon entirely, it only involves one body and it gives off EM radiation (usually infrared light in our experiences) based on that one body&#39;s temperature, independant of its environment. BBR is not heat.<br>I know it&#39;s only tangential to the video but it&#39;s important to point out inaccuracies so your videos can become even better.<br><br><br>Edit:<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfgT6zx4k3Q&amp;t=2m20s\">2:20</a> Again, it&#39;s a misconception that heat is transfered as infrared radiation. It&#39;s actually the other way around: just because you have temperature you are radiating infrared light. Radiated light crosses into the visible spectrum at about 500\u00b0C, that&#39;s why molten metal glows, in fact everything is glowing all the time but our eyes only see a certain spectrum of wavelengths. There is nothing special about infrared or visible light, it&#39;s just the tuning evolution gave to our human eyes. Visible light can heat as much if not more than infrared, because higher frequency means more energy.", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:07:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simon Smith", "comment_text": "A quick note, rats are very prone to cancer.", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:06:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Za'ato the warrior", "comment_text": "Yep, electricity is tiny sonic the hedgehog!<br><br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfgT6zx4k3Q&amp;t=0m36s\">0:36</a>", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:06:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crimson Halo", "comment_text": "&quot;But what about people that say it is harming them?&quot;<br><b>Better call Saul.</b>", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:06:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Wang", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfgT6zx4k3Q&amp;t=5m32s\">5:32</a> back to the future reference", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:06:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jervin Sevilla", "comment_text": "What about blue light?", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:06:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Issey Mangion", "comment_text": "smoothest add ever", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:06:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dante Benitez-McGregor", "comment_text": "My life is now lighter knowing that Kurzgesagt wants me to have nice things", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:06:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vilog", "comment_text": "&gt;scientific channel<br>&gt;rainbow has 6 colors", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T15:05:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JD Tug", "comment_text": "One other thing this video doesn&#39;t mention that I feel is important is that heavy phone/computer/tv usage might also be linked to other bad habits that can be harmful to your health, like poor diet, poor sleep, poor exercise, poor posture and suchies.

But this DC current will make no EM radiation, as only changing current (in time) creates changing magnetic fields = electromagnetic radiation.<br><br>Also what you forget to mention, is that while in lower frequencies EM doesn&#39;t do ionising damage, EM energy is absorbed as heat. Until certain power level that is no problem, but with high enough intensity non-ionising will also do damge, though not directly from radiation, but from absorbec heat energy.<br>Good example is Lasers. They emmit same harmless EM that we get from the Sun, but with much hihger intensity, so sight that it can really burn your skin.<br>Same could apply in lower frequencies as well, that excess absobed heat in tissue causes damage (Because proteins break down in high enough heat) .
