He&#39;s postulated a theory and written a paper on the possibility of a Carrington Event combined with a micro-nova. It seems that there is a relationship between the build up of geomagnetic forces when stars move through the Galactic plane. This results in an accretion of matter on the surface of a star. This matter then gets ejected in one gigantic explosion, similar to a supernova at the end of a star&#39;s life, except it happens on a regular basis, every 12,000 years or so. <br><br>The effect of such an explosion would be catastrophic to Earth. It would cause the planet to flip the poles to new positions for a period and then return to their original position at the next cycle. The sudden change of the poles would not only cause tectonic activity, but massive tsunamis which would flood across entire continents. His paper suggests that there is evidence of these cyclical disasters all over the planet and it may even be the source of the story of Noah&#39;s Flood in the Bible.<br><br>He suggests that this event may not be far off as it appears that stars near to Earth have recently experienced luminosity changes corresponding with a micro-nova and then returned to their normal luminosity afterwards.

THESE UNIVERSES HAVE BIG BANGS IN THEM TOO AND SO ON....... . THESE PROCESS WAS STOPPED WHEN THE LAST UNIVERSE WAS TOO SMALL AND DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY AN SPACE FOR FORMING THE BIG BANG WAS IMPOSSIBLE. THE LAST UNIVERSE IS OUR UNIVERSE.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

Tesla&#39;s Tower in Colorado is meant to serve the same purpose but was left incomplete up in his death. Very recently, there was something spotted leaving the Sun that was 9 times as large as Earth but the actual image of what it was was removed leaving a giant square of missing pixels. The Statue of Liberty was not made out of copper and placed isolated in the ocean for no reason. I believe the mass ejection is already known about and will be used to lower the population if the Earth to a more eco-friendly number.

To make them stay in a box, (wich should be made of lead, since it covers up some of the radionation) we have to use radioactive lasers (they have an anti-gravitatonic field) so they push atoms towards the center of the box. Then the box should be taken to somewhere (For example: Missouri has a factory that works on pushing atoms together to get better elemets) where are factories pushing these atoms together.

What exactly is influenced by those solar storms? Metals? Conductors in general? Magnets? Do they have to be running (have electricity flowing through) to be affected?<br>2. In exactly what ways does the solar storms (directly) cause damage? Heat? Electric arcs/sparks? Explosions?<br>3. Does unplugging stuff protect against solar storms? What about battery-powered technology? What about batteries themselves (even when they are not powering anything, say when your phone is turned off)?<br>4.

And to get lot of likes, a comment shouldn&#39;t be longer than one line. The reason because this comment is not going to get your attention, is wrote in the comment itself... But anyway, let&#39;s find this out.<br>I think that a video about the smartphone and the damages it is doing to the brains of young people, is the way to go in this moment. I&#39;m not talking about electro-magnetic waves or things like that, I am talking about some real psychological problems that we will see becaming concrete in the next years. Lost of empathy for real persons, lost of desire, unability to recognize facial expressions, lost of focus, and so on. When we talk about our minds, humans have two very important stimuli:<br>The need of creating social relations, and the need of dispelling boredom. The magic rectangle we have in our pocket is capable of satisfying both these primary needs (do not be surprised if a child can spend his whole day on a social network that can both make him laugh and let him talk with his friends). The only limit that is protecting us from confusing the real world with the virtual world where we are so addicted to live is the technology. More then one bilion of children have acces to this virtual world from the youngest ages (sometimes their parents give them the smartphon at 3-4 years old to let them play, and they end up being completely addicted to the virtual world. They prefer the virtual world, to the real one). You don&#39;t see this as a problem because you, like me, are likely to have grown without nothing more than a taste of this virtual world from sci-fi tv-shows or film. Your brain is developed on the real model of the world, you can get inside the virtual world for five hours, shut down your phone and go out for a walk with your friends. But for those who are less aware of what is real or not, the risk is more than concrete. From my point of view, children should be educated to develop their real life skills (like comunication) and THEN develop their virtual life skills. If we don&#39;t start to raise awareness, in both the victims and the parents, the damage can be catastrophic. And if you look around yourself, you can see that it&#39;s already a huge mess. I got more than opinions and i can validate what i am saying with data and surveys. If you are interested in more than a textwall-comment under a video, I can share a lot of material on this topic and help you for free as best as I can. I don&#39;t want any mention, any special thanks, and i don&#39;t want to own this idea.

And keep in mind, it&#39;s people who are sitting at both ends of the chain who might make a mistake: the young PhD scientist on boring shift duty of the instrument that has to make the right decision, knowing that the repercussions are globally; and the engineers who have to cause a black-out, which is dangerous in itself.<br>There is no way we are prepared. Last I heard it wasn&#39;t even clear whether we HAVE a sun-monitoring instrument any longer, as an old one is about to reach its end of life. We also cannot put the start of the warning chain in the hands of scientists - science is much too slow. It would need to be a military/government-controlled instrument that has the authority to trigger a warning. And even if modern, mainly western electricity companies are training their engineers to be prepared, do you think that in regions where black-outs happen every so often the engineers are prepared as well to cause one?<br>Nah, if it hits, it&#39;s like with Corona, but worse.

[9] And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.<br><br><br>1 Thessalonians 5:1-6 KJV<br>But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. [2] For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. [3] For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. [4] But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. [5] Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

[6] Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: [7] Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. [8] For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.

As the outer planets magnetic poles and charge vertices align and disalign, and as the sun moves through more dense and less dense regions of charge in the galaxy, the the constant changing charge density determines the sun&#39;s charging up and charging down.  Maximums correspond mainly to Jupiter at a certain point of its orbit around the sun, but also other planets which orbit at different speeds can make some maximums weak while others are extremely full of activity.  When a lot of charge is returning TO the sun you get more solar flares, while when the planets are at 90 degree angles and are creating destructive phase alignment with the spin of the magnetic field of the sun you get minimums  like the last one we&#39;re just now exiting.

Apparently it&#39;s not enough to use the &quot;thumb&quot; system and share videos with others when I think they&#39;ll enjoy the content.

And she\u2019s bawling, and she\u2019s saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine.\u201d I mean, it\u2019s not fine but, you know, it\u2019s\u2026 fine. And I would like to order a Double Jack Meal, and I\u2019ve kinda got somewhere to be, so maybe less with the crying and more with the frying, huh? [inhales] And the girl apologizes again and she offers me a free churro with my meal. And as I\u2019m leaving, I think, \u201cI just got a free churro because my mom died.\u201d No one ever tells you that when your mom dies, you get a free churro.<br>[people murmuring]<br>[clears throat]<br>Anyway, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not part of the\u2026 [clears throat] All right. Okay, here we go. Let\u2019s do this. Here I am, BoJack Horseman, doing a eulogy, let\u2019s go. Hey, piano man, can I get a, like an organ flourish? [organ plays] Nicely done. You know, I was a little worried I wouldn\u2019t have the right accompaniment today. I guess it\u2019s a good thing my mom was an organ donor! [rimshot plays] What happened to the organ? [horn \u2018oogahs\u2019] Okay, why just leave the comedy to the professionals? Okay? This is a funeral, sir, for my mother. Can you show a little respect? [trumpet whines] I\u2019ll take it.<br>Beatrice Horseman, who was she? What was her deal? Well, she was a horse. Uh, she was born in 1938. She died in 2018. One time, she went to a parade, and one time, she smoked an entire cigarette in one long inhale. I watched her do it. Truly a remarkable woman.<br>[rustling]<br>Lived a full life, that lady. Just, all the way to the end, which is, uh, now I guess. Really makes you think, though, huh? Life, right? Goes by, stuff happens. Then you die. Okay, well that\u2019s my time, you\u2019ve been great! Tip your waitress! No, I\u2019m just kidding around, there\u2019s no waitress. But seriously, that\u2019s all I have to say about my mother. No point beating a dead horse, right? So\u2026<br>[inhales] Now what? I don\u2019t know. Mom, you got any ideas? Anything? Mom? No? Nothing to contribute? Knock once if you\u2019re proud of me.<br>Can I just say how amazing it is to be in a room with my mother, and I can just talk and talk without her telling me to shut up and make her a drink? Hey, Mom, knock once if you think I should shut up. No? You sure? I mean, I don\u2019t want to embarrass you by making this eulogy into a me-logy, so, seriously, if you wanted me to sit down and let someone else talk, just knock. I will not be offended. No? Your funeral.<br>Sorry about the closed casket, by the way. She wanted an open casket, but uh, you know, she\u2019s dead now, so who cares what she wanted? No, that sounds bad. I\u2019m sorry. I-I think that if she could\u2019ve seen what she looked like dead, she\u2019d agree it\u2019s better this way. She looked like this.", "comment_date": "2020-06-07T12:36:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sushrut Vartak", "comment_text": "I was just thinking why Kurzgesagt hasn&#39;t uploaded yet and BAM...
