Unfortunately it does not explain the mystery of emergent properties. Science deals with 3 nested Mysteries and this video really alludes to only the most basic mystery namely the emergence of the universe and the corresponding physical rules. Then there&#39;s the emergence of Life which while it does not violate physical rules appears to follow a new set of principles. Among the most basic of those new emergent properties is evolution reflecting a kind of metastability in the nuclear code for life. Then there is the third emergent property within the evolutionary trajectory of Life, the emergence of mind. This has yet additional rules and operations while of course not violating biological principles or their underpinning in physics. If you do not present the mystery of emergent properties - indeed why should life or mind exist even in a physical universe \u2013 you don&#39;t really quite communicate the Grandeur of the big picture. And you still have people, as you can see in the comments, buying into the old reductionist hope that all these Mysteries can be collapsed into a single set of principles or even a single equation. Sorry no can do. That kind of Sledgehammer reductionism died a long time as a realistic possibility but a lot of physicists never got the memo.

Keep that image in your head but also think about this; if you died or if you were never born then to you nothing exists, this world doesn&#39;t exist. So if you see something then that means there&#39;s a world around you. Observing something proves that it exists. Now what about the things you can&#39;t imagine? Let&#39;s go back to previous image. Nothing. Then quantum fields, the fabric of space, matter and energy. All this stuff is made of a lot of energy and quantum fluctuations that interact with each other and form the world around us. So doesn&#39;t that mean if you make some new fields, or deleted some fields or add some fields or change the interactions between energy and space than you can make a whole different looking cosmos?let&#39;s go back to the first picture. If everything is nothing and it stays that way forever than doesn&#39;t that mean eventually something happens. And since nothing is infinite than that means everything happens and also nothing happens. Everything and nothing are actually the same thing. The reason our universe is like this is because it can be like this and the reason how is that there are fields, energy and quantum laws that make everything look the way it is.

Then &quot;something&quot; was claimed to be only material substances, completely ignoring mental and philosophical properties (which the physicists were using to try to describe material substance, so obviously philosophical substances like ideas must exist if they are using them). The third jump I noticed was saying that all things are expressed in terms of subatomic particles and fields, but does not relate how things like philosophical substances can be material objects--the Standard Model of Particle Physics just assumes they are.

The Big Plan.<br><br><b>God&#39;s plan. He has a purpose for me. How do I know? The Bible tells me!</b><br><br>We know that in all things God works for good with those who love him, those whom he has called according to his purpose.

Let me take another in-depth stab at it (not my first): &#39;Something&#39; is that which a mind can classify and categorize. Right now it is limited to time, space, matter, energy, forces, processes, and concepts, from which all sub-classifications are derived (such as animate vs. inanimate matter and energy, though &#39;life&#39; is more properly described as a &#39;process&#39;, which is also a &#39;something&#39;).<br><br>Just to note, infinity and eternity (which do not exist in the physical world - they are mere mental concepts, which are &#39;somethings&#39; but only as concepts) are the great nothingnesses (remember, they do not exist in the physical world) in which everything exists. Take the Big Bang, for example. It is said that there is nothing beyond its expanding space, meaning there is no &#39;space&#39; for it to expand into, which seems like a contradiction; but then duh, what is my definition of infinity and eternity? There you go - that is what space is expanding into. Note that &#39;space&#39; external to an object needs at least one other object for external space to exist (space being a reference between objects). So if there is only one Big Bang that contains all matter and energy, then yes, its space is expanding into no space (which is infinite) (and which does not exist). Hooray.

What if something and nothing are the same except nothing has a value of 0 and something has a value of 1 when we put 0 for coins in a game we can&#39;t get anything because we don&#39;t have coins but we can buy stuff if the coins are more than 0 but even at 0 there coins but you can&#39;t use them because of there value 0 something and nothing are like names they contain nothing but if you add a value to the name it becomes something like 1 useable data....  Or like a black hole those particles of a sun Iike once was became unknown because you can&#39;t wipe something out of existence it becomes smaller but what if that was possible would nothing happen? Yes something would happen something and nothing would become corrupt there like if you make a price of a hot dog -1 in a game and there was no negative you wouldnt loss or gain anything the value of the hot dog would become 0 or 1 I&#39;ll become   ?   It doesn&#39;t know 1 or 0 so nothing is a value of 0 but planets are 1 it&#39;s pulls gravity which has a value of 0 or 1 so the corrupt black hole uses gravity as 1 and 0 and uses planets as 1 remember it doesn&#39;t know either 0 or 1 so it uses nothing as 0 and something as 1 and gravity as either 1 or 0 so it uses something and nothing to become either a something or a nothing thats how it fixes the something corrupted value to become 0 or 1 remember nothing makes something using forces like when gravity pulls lots of nothing together creating something......

Now its  time for  some metaphysics yoga.<br><br>excepts from a 1896 book.<br><br>Pr\u00e2n\u00e2y\u00e2ma is not, as many think, something about breath; breath indeed has very little to do with it, if anything. Breathing is only one of the many exercises through which we get to the real Pranayama. Pranayama means the control of Pr\u00e2na. According to the philosophers of India, the whole universe is composed of two materials, one of which they call \u00c2k\u00e2sha. It is the omnipresent, all-penetrating existence. Everything that has form, everything that is the result of combination, is evolved out of this Akasha. It is the Akasha that becomes the air, that becomes the liquids, that becomes the solids; it is the Akasha that becomes the sun, the earth, the moon, the stars, the comets; it is the Akasha that becomes the human body, the animal body, the plants, every form that we see, everything that can be sensed, everything that exists. It cannot be perceived; it is so subtle that it is beyond all ordinary perception; it can only be seen when it has become gross, has taken form. At the beginning of creation there is only this Akasha. At the end of the cycle the solids, the liquids, and the gases all melt into the Akasha again, and the next creation similarly proceeds out of this Akasha. By what power is this Akasha manufactured into this universe? By the power of Prana. Just as Akasha is the infinite, omnipresent material of this universe, so is this Prana the infinite, omnipresent manifesting power of this universe. At the beginning and at the end of a cycle everything becomes Akasha, and all the forces that are in the universe resolve back into the Prana; in the next cycle, out of this Prana is evolved everything that we call energy, everything that we call force. It is the Prana that is manifesting as motion; it is the Prana that is manifesting as gravitation, as magnetism. It is the Prana that is manifesting as the actions of the body, as the nerve currents, as thought force. From thought down to the lowest force, everything is but the manifestation of Prana. The sum total of all forces in the universe, mental or physical, when resolved back to their original state, is called Prana. &quot;When there was neither aught nor naught, when darkness was covering darkness, what existed then? That Akasha existed without motion.&quot; The physical motion of the Prana was stopped, but it existed all the same. At the end of a cycle the energies now displayed in the universe quiet down and become potential. At the beginning of the next cycle they start up, strike upon the Akasha, and out of the Akasha evolve these various forms, and as the Akasha changes, this Prana changes also into all these manifestations of energy. The knowledge and control of this Prana is really what is meant by Pranayama.", "comment_date": "2016-02-02T16:42:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Poisson", "comment_text": "But what about Jesus??

This will also involve subject matter with reference to The Creating Universal One And Whole, for this is consciousness. Think of your present belief systems, which greatly incorporate your scientific technology, and ask yourselves with your rational, logical intellect how you may arrive at conclusions of an impersonal universe and elements possessing consciousness extending from non-conscious matter. Within your present belief systems, you accept that a cosmic explosion occurred and created your universe; this being completely random and possessing no consciousness. Your world began as gasses, rock; elements not possessing life, to your estimation; and from this, through your belief systems of evolution, you believe that miraculously, somehow, consciousness was incorporated into matter accidentally. If you inquire to me, I will express to you, this possesses no logic. Matter did not appear \u2018cosmically\u2019 within this explosion, and then create consciousness. Consciousness was; is.<br><br>I will express to you that in your terms of viewing in time elements \u2013 for you are focused within time \u2013 we shall use terminology of \u2018before,\u2019 which is also now, (smiling) but we shall be indulging of terminology that you may relate to.<br><br>Therefore, before the organization and orchestration of your universe as you view it was consciousness. Before essence, as you interpret it, was the whole. You may use any term you are wishing for this action. I do not use the term \u2018being\u2019 purposely, for your term of God or All-That-Is (1) or The Creating Universal One And Whole, whatever you choose to call it, is not a being. It is all consciousness. It is an action. It incorporates all.<br><br>Within this experience of what you term to be god are many, many elements. Before the incorporation of essence, so to speak, there were elements of consciousness. You may also term these to be \u2018units,\u2019 which others have expressed previously. (2) These elements of consciousness know no limits of time or space. You may think of these as very tiny black holes. You may think of them, if you will, in physical terms as elements smaller than your smallest physical particles; but these elements are that which create all physical expression. Everything within every universe within every dimension is created by these elements of consciousness, and they are everything. They are not only the driving force behind matter and action, but are matter and action also; this being the basis of what you term to be god.<br><br>I will also express to you, as I have many times previously, you incorporate all the same as this action of god. You are the same; but it is more. It is more than the sum of all of the dimensions, of all of the universes, of all of the parts; but without you, it would not be either. Therefore, no separation; for you also are intimately a part. You incorporate your own individuality, your own intent, your own desires and focus; but you also incorporate all of it, and it possess, so to speak, all of you. No one element, to the most minute unit of consciousness, is any less than another. Therefore, there is no contradiction in expressing to you that you each, within your individuality, are the center of the universe; for this is true.<br><br>Essence is what we will term a portion of this encompassing whole, although not a portion! (Smiling) Within your limitations of language, it is impossible to express to you the lack of division and separation; this being why I express to you to conceptualize these concepts that I offer to you, for within your thought patterns within physical focus, it is not possible for you to completely eliminate all separation and be understanding of these concepts. When I express to you that essence incorporates all systems, that all systems are open and available to you, this is what is incorporated by consciousness. You possess this. Every element of consciousness possesses all elements of the whole.<br><br>Each element chooses to manifest according to its desire and function. A flower manifests to the fullest of its ability. The units of consciousness that make up this flower are the same as that which you possess also. The flower\u2019s intent and function is to be a flower. Your intent and function is to incorporate intellect and intuition, to be directing of your universe as you have created it. Therefore, make no mistake; you direct all of your physical manifestation in every area. We have discussed this many times within previous sessions. You create your individual reality, and collectively you create the reality en masse. Therefore, you are the creators of all that you perceive ... and far beyond.", "comment_date": "2016-01-25T06:14:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Y Lee", "comment_text": "I want to know about Vietnam immigrated to Canada or Cambodia refugee immigrated to Canada.

Consciousness is one of those bigger wholes. If we just connected neurons inside a box (the same number of neurons of an average human adult), that box wouldn&#39;t necessarily create a conscious mind. Going back to something simpler, if you connect the parts of a chair in a random fashion, chances are that the sum of the parts are not going to add up to a chair. So, I leave here a possible addendum to point out that if you build something out of fundamental particles, it might add up to something bigger than just a sum of particles.", "comment_date": "2015-12-26T18:04:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Callum van Heerden", "comment_text": "viewer number 1,000,886!", "comment_date": "2015-12-26T17:57:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VitorBootz", "comment_text": "Congratulations! awesome!", "comment_date": "2015-12-26T17:49:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "snake698", "comment_text": "I still feel so ignorant not knowing why are the rules written like that.

No time, and no space that fits with the time, Zero time.  <br>Lets say a little began through the Zeroness. With time also comes space. The 3 dimensions are mastered by the fourth dimension time, some guy called Minkowski figured that out. So if time hasn\u2019t started, then space hasn\u2019t started either. Little pops of time spring up. We started from the big bang which is generally agreed to be a singularity. One point. Then bam in a cloud of gas everything was hurtled outwards. eventually the bigger things attracted things then those bigger things attracted more things so on. and forth. <br>But that one big bang in nothingness started a time and space. <br>Lets say once time has been started it cannot stop. its the one constant of the universe. <br>A black hole sucks in everything around it to a single point. What happens after no one really knows. Imagine zero time to be everywhere. Without time you can not have space. So its neither big nor small just there. It is said once a black hole is started it will never stop even when run out of material. If a black hole can suck in everything to a nothingness, would that mean it can capture time? Trying to equal the forces back to zero. Time cannot be stopped. So it pauses on zero time then keeps going to a different time inside the blackhole.

But again, none of you atoms would be able to think on your own.<br><br>Most of you atoms were born during supernovas. Your organism might be thinking, &quot;wtf, is this group of atoms talking about?&quot;. So I or more correctly, we, have a question? What makes each person/group of atoms unique, what is personality and self awareness? They are basically the aggregate of all the interactions between you atoms. Where were you atoms 100 million years ago?", "comment_date": "2015-12-24T10:20:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wo 4da", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t sleep", "comment_date": "2015-12-24T10:18:41Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Aki Brickboy", "comment_text": "D", "comment_date": "2015-12-24T10:04:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Orbit", "comment_text": "Without this channel, my whole life would&#39;ve been a lie \ud83d\ude29", "comment_date": "2015-12-24T10:03:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ReduxLX", "comment_text": "Of course the answer is....

An electron has an associated magnetic field with it.<br>2. This magnetic field in an atom in essence generates a 360 degree magnetic field.<br>3. Like charged protons stick together inside this field while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electron across the inside portion of the electron&#39;s magnetic field portion.<br>4. There are no such things as &quot;gluons&quot;.  It&#39;s a magnetic field force.<br>5. There are not four laws of nature but only three.  Two of them, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are derivatives of the interactions of the magnetic fields of electrons and protons.<br>6. Since quarks also supposedly have a charge, they also probably have a magnetic field associated with them.  Possibly a different field for each of the six different quarks.<br>7. Protons and Neutrons are created due to these magnetic field interactions and is also why protons and neutrons stay together inside a nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.<br>8. There is probably a Magnetic Field Theory to the Atomic Structure.<br>9. Why also, while not all matter is considered magnetic, all matter can be affected by magnetism.<br><br>Note also:<br>&quot;Space&quot; is not bent.  It is the interaction of the electro-magnetic fields between the photons and electrons with their associated magnetic fields.<br><br>Also:<br>The wave particle duality is just an illusion.

All energy and matter exist everywhere at the same time. Entanglement proves this. Instead of everywhere, it might be easier to imagine instead all energy and matter existing at a single point - what we think as distance is really just a difference in interaction between energies. We have evolved to perceive light and energy interacting in the world around us as space, but it isn&#39;t real. Still, our interpretation of space does a great job of helping us learn and survive in the universe.
