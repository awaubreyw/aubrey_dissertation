Its the same thing with pirating music or movies and series. Me for example i watch anime series on streaming sites for free which is illegal and i know that. But i noticed that watching these kinds of series legally is just to expensive for me. E.g if i want to watch the old episodes of Pok\u00e9mon it would cost me around 40\u20ac just to watch 5 episodes. thats to much. Lets say 10\u20ac a month for a legal stream is in todays world not effordable for everyone. Since kurzgesagt is a german channel i have to mention that we in German actually have to pay 17\u20ac every month for shitty and prpagandistic Tv programms Sometimes. back in the days this call &quot;rundfunk&quot; was good. and we got something good to see. Ill just say pokito on rtl 2. that was the shit. <br>Anyways my point is that i may be watching Things for free that people are working for and also have to earn their money but i am also buying merch from things i like. For example anime Figures from series i liked. if i couldnt watch these series i may never have become a fan in the first place therefor the creators would never become suceccfull.", "comment_date": "2020-10-18T16:21:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SASA", "comment_text": "face book is a horrible social media platform anyway, it should be deleted.", "comment_date": "2020-10-18T12:51:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "doubled chin", "comment_text": "stoopid facebook", "comment_date": "2020-10-18T09:47:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cold Bacon", "comment_text": "Bruh this dude is furious and you can hear it.

This monetization trend is contrary to the principles and bases of what the Internet actually is. Just remember this: Hundreds of thousands of us create every day the software that runs the entirety of the internet, for free. From the Kernel that runs everything from the Youtube servers to your router to your Android phone, to the browser you&#39;re using, to the little libraries that make the modern web possible, like jQuery and it&#39;s thousands of useful plugins. And we do it entirely for free. The internet used to be expensive, very, very expensive. And most of the cost wasn&#39;t hardware, it was software. Say you choose to run a website to host your content, but you don&#39;t do it with a cheap GCloud server running a LAMP stack, you go the full proprietary way. Bare metal, a proprietary OS, and all the required software on top, all of it proprietary. I assure you you&#39;ll spend many times on software what you spent on hardware. But no need for that, you&#39;ve got plenty of software created with love, and it&#39;s the best quality soft out there. GNU/Linux dominates the internet not because it&#39;s cheaper, but rather because it&#39;s better. Content creators got greedy after they got a taste of ad money, and they&#39;ve tried to establish the idea that people have a fucking right to live off their youtube channel, or that we&#39;ll somehow get lesser quality content if they don&#39;t get paid for it. Guess what, it&#39;s the other way around. The Internet has been here for a very long time, and we had loads of quality content long before Youtube decided to share ad money with content creators, or, rather, long before Youtube itself. Still, content was plentiful, it was quality content, and we actually had a better SNR, mostly because there were no attentionwhores constantly clickbaiting us.", "comment_date": "2018-01-05T05:53:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elizabeth Kenoff", "comment_text": "My son said Facebook!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You must create your videos by cutting down &quot;Content bushes&quot; and &quot;video trees&quot;, which will supply video chunks. You must then put them together, smelt them and launch them into the air, where the will dissipate and you get views on different factors. There are special abilities that can give factors, but I&#39;ll get to that later. When a video is sent up, you get views. Views give popularity points (+1 PP for every 10 views), and money (+1 money for every 1000 views.). You can use these views to buy physical skills, such as &quot;content intelligence&quot;, where you have the ability to break down trees and bushes faster, &quot;Video engineering&quot;, where you can make videos faster and with better views, &quot;Channel building&quot;, which allows you to produce industrial grade video machinery, and many more. If you pass 100,00 viewers, then you start to count subscribers. A viewer now has a <del>69</del>\u00a082% chance to become a subscriber (2 subscribers = 1 dollar), however, when you reach this phase, you have to chose between 3 options. &quot;Animator&quot;, &quot;Lets player&quot;, or &quot;Music creator&quot;. These options, depending on what you pick, will determine what video scraps you can obtain from bushes and trees, limiting your content, but providing stability. When you reach 100,000 subscribers, make sure to keep those videos coming, or your factory enters &quot;The rust&quot;. The rust is an industrial setting under the volcano that scraps factories for videos and tosses the remains into the volcano crater. You have a chance to save the factory by creating a video that gets either 100 subscribers, or 1000 views. Beware though, for you only have 30 minutes to do so. If you reach 500,00 subscribers, larger channels start attacking you. You will need to create &quot;flame warriors&quot;, Where you sacrifice a viewer to be in your defenses. If that viewer dies, however, he is gone for good. You will never see that poor sap again. You also get the ability to raid other bases for content and resources (idduno what the resources are yet). You don&#39;t have to go all fight though, because you can collaborate with a content creator. If you manage to become friends, every viewer the channel has gets a 25% chance to become a viewer and subscriber to you, plus, the channel will not attack you (unless you do so first), and will give you military aid in the event of you attacking anyone but himself. Once you reach 100,000,000 viewers, then the top channel will start attacking. The top channel sits at the very to of the volcano, with incredible power. The only way he stops attacking is by you taking him down with viewers. &quot;How do I do that?&quot;. attack the six major support beams surrounding the base of his... er, base. once the 6 support beams are down, the channel will fall, and you can claim the top.<br><br>Now lets talk about money. Money can be used to buy stuff like &quot;better camcorders&quot;, which would give you a 25%+ if you are a letsplayer. if you buy an &quot;Animation tablet&quot;, then you will get a 25%+ in animation. Later on, they come with debuffs, such as &quot;clickbaiting&quot;, which gives you 10% more viewers, but -45% respect from said viewers, meaning they are more likely to leave. If you buy a content specific item that was not in your content range, then you lose 10% consistency with videos, meaning you are more likely to pick up incompatible scraps from bushes and trees.<br><br>I would go on, but it&#39;s fuckin&#39; 11 o&#39; clock.", "comment_date": "2017-05-26T04:25:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jensi Oquendo", "comment_text": "WHO THE FUCK IS TYRESE GIBSON?", "comment_date": "2017-05-25T16:50:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deadlifternoob", "comment_text": "I hate Facebook", "comment_date": "2017-05-25T11:56:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JavierCR25", "comment_text": "I&#39;ll always swing by your channel Kurz!

The people who view those pages are likely not the same people who would be on youtube and find your videos. Because usually those pages and the video don&#39;t share the same demographic and it&#39;s an entirely different media.<br>(People who already view your videos and are on that page don&#39;t count, as they already view your videos. Meaning, it has no affect on them)<br>-While on FB, it&#39;s easier to view a video on there, rather than to click a link to youtube. While on FB, I much rather view/share/like a video that&#39;s on there, than a link to a youtube video. If you want to fight them taking your content, upload the video onto FB rather than put a link to youtube (or maybe do both). It&#39;s obvious that a site would prefer users to remain there than go elsewhere, because easier for the user and better for the site.<br>-The only real problem is the people who take videos and don&#39;t credit the creator. Because this does nothing for the creator, and only benefits the user. If they do credit the creator and put a link or something of the sort, then that benefits you. Because, like point one stated, they aren&#39;t &quot;stealing&quot; views (just videos), so you don&#39;t get affected negatively, but rather positively as you get exposure.<br><br>Also, sorry to say, but Facebook can have more exposure than youtube. With the ability to share videos with friends, comment and mention people who&#39;d like the video, etc. It&#39;s the ideal place for users and creators (as long as everyone plays by the rules), there&#39;s no need to fight them, when you can join them and benefit from it (as with point 2).", "comment_date": "2016-11-30T19:45:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "CliffJumpingProd", "comment_text": "wait, people watch videos on facebook?

Not the most original idea -- it&#39;s something a lot of people do, and it was just something that I made in like five minutes with no production value whatsoever just to make a couple friends laugh,  but it went on to garner millions and millions of views... all of which are from people that ripped it and uploaded it to their Facebook pages. At first, I didn&#39;t think much of it. The video was getting attention, and what made me happy was seeing all the comments from people that really seemed to enjoy it -- sharing it with their friends, saying how it brightened up their day, etc... I was thrilled that a silly little thing like that could do that for people. I didn&#39;t mind that my official upload of it only had an extremely small fraction of those views. After a while, though, I started getting a little bitter. I don&#39;t make videos in hopes of &quot;getting rich&quot; off of them, I make them because I enjoy it and I love making people smile... but when I realized just how much I missed out on by having all those views go to uploads from other people who stole it, it felt like a huge slap to the face. I realized how much exposure I missed out on, and how much the ad revenue on a video like that could have really helped me out. Again, I can&#39;t stress this enough -- I&#39;m not in this for the money, but being able to earn a living off of this stuff is kind of the goal. I know that might sound contradictory, but the reason for that is so I can keep working on creating content full time and not have to rely on working shitty day jobs to pay my bills. With a video as big as this one turned out to be, it totally could have kickstarted all that and helped me get my foot in the door, so to speak. It would have helped me build a larger audience, draw more attention to my other work, and helped make it so that all my time and energy could be applied to doing what I love, and I felt like I was kind of robbed of that. <br><br>The biggest slap to the face is that people don&#39;t even bother crediting the original creators. I mean, you&#39;re stealing their fucking content. The LEAST you could do is throw them a bone, and not doing so just adds insult to injury. What stings the most is that if they truly felt compelled to share something, they could EASILY just share a link to the original upload; it only takes a couple clicks. Instead, they go out of their way to rip the video, be it with a YouTube video converter or screen capture software, and present that shit as if they had done it. Shit like this needs to stop, and it&#39;s pretty upsetting that it likely never will. I&#39;ve accepted the fact that I missed out on a great opportunity, but it&#39;s the principle of the thing that really drives me up the wall.

Your works are great, it&#39;s important to direct people to the right place to enjoy them.

The BBC do issue take down notices but appear to only have time or will to do so for their latest content, plenty of older science  and history content remains online - when official BBC content is placed on Youtube by the BBC it is usually only in the form of a taster with incomplete content - it is clear by the BBC&#39;s actions that they do not favour full scale release of their content on Youtube yet this is precisely what happens.<br><br>We are creating a new generation who think that because they have access to some free services like Google that any bit of media they can lay their hands on is effectively theirs to do with as they please. Someone writes above that educational content should be free - WHY it costs money to produce eductional content just like any other - if they feel this way they should go away and work for nothing whilst their family cope with a lost wage and post their own free content but they should not use infantile arguments of &quot;access to everything&quot; to argue that others should effectively work without full reward.

Only a huge US corporation could pull off - any small company being so cavalier with other people&#39;s copyright would have been nailed to the tree years ago.

Don&#39;t underestimate this bcuz the population under the regulation of GFW is large.<br> The reason I talked about this is bcuz facebook is not the only one who is being doing this.Personally speaking ,I really don&#39;t think original creator could get the credit and honor for original creating.I am not saying they shouldn&#39;t but it is just harder.Take all the examples in Science and technology, you will find that usually the one who get rich is usually the one who make the new technology well-known or commoditize  it.<br>I think under the current environment, there are only 2 ways of dealing this problem:<br>a,Accept the reality and try to coop with large advertising organization to make the videos well-known.Or even be the advertising organization instead of searching for one (which is extremely hard or impossible most cases).Anyway the idea is to spread out the name of yours instead of letting someone else do it before you.<br>b.Seeking for legislation help,such as appealing for new laws being set up for these kinds of piracy.<br>I think the world may come up with a better way of solving this. But in whatever ways to deal with this, it requires some kind of organization or protocol beyond everyone to generally organize these to make the profit flow back the original editor.(Just like what appstore did)", "comment_date": "2015-11-11T18:25:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Louis Pearson", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t click Read more<br>\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2588 <br>\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2588<br>\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2584<br>\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2592\u2588\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2588\u2592\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2592\u2588<br>\u2591\u2588\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2590\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u258c\u2592\u2588\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2588\u2592\u2590\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u258c\u2592\u2588<br>\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2588\u2592\u2591\u2584\u2592\u2584\u2592\u2588\u2592\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2588<br>\u2588\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2588\u2588<br>\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2580\u2588\u2591\u2580\u2588\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2588\u2588<br>\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2584\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2591<br>\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2584\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2591\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2591\u2591<br>\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591<br>\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2584\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2591<br>\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2591<br>\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591<br>\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2591<br>\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591<br><br>TEEHEE!

Facebook is NOT cheating. Plagiarists and content-pirates are the ones who are cheating. Give Facebook credit for having put in a system of reporting and accountability. I have had issues myself, I found the Facebook support team to be very helpful and the issues were resolved in a few hours, not four days as this video will have you believe. <br><br>Even if they take time, consider the fact that Facebook has literally BILLIONS of viewers. They are doing a very good job despite the overwhelming volume.<br><br>I agree, the system is not perfect, but the social media boom is only like a decade old. There is still a lot to learn. The system is imperfect and is evolving into a better beast everyday.<br><br>\u201cThey rig their algorithm so that videos uploaded into their player are preferred to YouTube links.\u201d<br>First of all, there is no way for us to verify this outlandish claim. Regardless, they prefer their own player, what&#39;s the harm in that? Most video-makers, including myself, bypass YouTube completely and upload videos directly to Facebook. Hey, and you know who else prefers their own player? Vimeo. Dailymotion. Metacafe. Vine. YouPorn. RedTube.<br><br>&quot;Users should be kept as long as possible on the site, so Facebook can show them as many ads as possible.\u201d<br>So? Isn&#39;t that how the Google works? In fact, isn&#39;t that how the internet works?<br><br>\u201cThis is after all their business model.\u201d <br>Well, duh! They are a multi-billion dollar corporation with salaries to pay and infrastructure to maintain. Why malign them for making money?<br><br>And regarding the auto-play, Facebook has an option to disable auto-play. YouTube does not.<br><br>\u201cA whole group of people have built their online presence around stealing other people&#39;s work.\u201d<br>The maker of the video contradicts his earlier accusation with this statement. &#39;People&#39; steal work, not Facebook. Facebook is not cheating.<br><br>\u201cThe thief doesn&#39;t have to fear any negative consequences at all.\u201d <br>Nonsense. The thief can be sued for copyright infringement if the original content creator bothers to do so. Again the video-maker contradicts himself at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7tA3NNKF0Q&amp;t=04m30s\">04:30</a> by saying, \u201cAlert the original creator, because only they can file a copyright report.\u201d Sounds like consequences to me.<br><br>Throughout the narrative, the maker of this video seems to malign &#39;big corporations&#39; like Facebook who make &#39;billions of dollars&#39;. Big corporations provide employment and run economies. Stop viewing them as villains.<br><br>Facebook, if utilized properly, can be very helpful to upcoming artistes and content creators. I personally have generated a lot of business and made a lot of money through Facebook marketing. Our generation is very blessed to have the boon of social media.

So nothing is STOLEN, but there was an illegal reproduction of protected intellectual property. That doesn&#39;t make it in anyway better or right, but if the affected person is not even able to correctly describe what happened to him, this becomes a somewhat questionable statement. Especially as stealing has a negative emotional connotation, one might get the impression, that the message is emotionally and rationally target, which would directly lead to the conclusion, that the emitter itself might think, that rational part of the message might not be strong enough to convince recipients nd therefore turns to an emotional targeting. By using proper wording, such ideas can be avoided.<br>So, I can perfectly understand, if you are pissed if others simply take your content and make money out of it (a side question you might think about is, why are they able to do so, and you are not ? Are there options to increase your distribution strategy ?) You have obviously every right to be very very unhappy about it. but you should stick with the right wording. Nobody STEALS from you, but makes money as a freerider by violating protected intellectual property via illegal reproduction.

These videos are copyrightable and it makes no sense how the users can dodge legal action. Anyways, why should Facebook care? They benefit off of all the ads.

However, from an ideological point of view,  it seems like a lot of the videos that get stolen &amp; receive massive views, are of kittens doing funny things, vines, or pranks being done etc, all &quot;low&quot; quality content. This type of content does almost nothing to advance human knowledge and inevitably contributes to the information overload on the internet drowning out the &quot;real&quot; high quality content, which lowers our expectation of what we can gain from the internet itself, leading a lot of people to sit in front of the screen for hours on end consuming this low quality content instead of being a productive or innovative member of society. Someone that records themselves reacting to video games, or of them saying or doing something rude to the public as a prank does not deserve as much payment as the scientists who make important discoveries every day. It seems like the internet has started rewarding low quality content more and more over the past two decades, which is why we&#39;re seeing more and more crap. The payment should be intrinsic in the number of views themselves without any expectation to monetize. Say a marketing company put a lot of creativity into an advertisement and made it extremely engaging. If it gets millions of views, (stolen or not), the creativity is translated into viewership. The monetization comes from how well the advertisement can funnel the viewers into customers, making the stealing of videos sound funny.

And If everyone can fuck facebook, and the rules are as easilly accessesed and assessed then the problem will never happen again anywhere just like murder is not rampant.

Why the heck are they organized as such: &quot;photos&lt;albums&lt;videos&quot;??? Wouldn&#39;t it make sense to create a stand-alone Video tab that has it&#39;s own &quot;albums&quot;??
