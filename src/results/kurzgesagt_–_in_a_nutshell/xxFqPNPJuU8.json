It saves trees and if we want to print it out, we can do so. Plus it allows you to offer it at a more affordable rate. You&#39;ll sell more calendars and make more money, bc it&#39;s accessible to everyone and it can&#39;t sell out. Right now, the cost just doesn&#39;t fit alot of people&#39;s budgets, especially during a pandemic. I mean, it&#39;s pretty, but it&#39;s not essential. Even looking inside of it, it&#39;s just a calendar with art. <br><br>There&#39;s a downloadable lunar calendar I was looking at last week that gives you the times of the Rise &amp; Set of the sun and moon, it notes when you can see other planets in the sky, it notes all the phases &amp; types of the moon, it notes all the eclipses and meteor showers, it notes all the equinoxes and retrogrades, etc. That&#39;s functional and fun. I would pay for that, plus you can download it as a weekly planner &amp; punch it into a 3-ring binder -- or take it to Office Max where they can bind it for you. Annnd laminate it to be shiny! <br><br>Like at least with this kind, I have options to choose how I want my calendar. Yours doesn&#39;t do any of that. I&#39;ll support you when your calendar&#39;s best feature (the cover) isn&#39;t hidden when hung up, bc it&#39;s facing the wall where I can&#39;t even see it. If the interior is where I&#39;m going to be seeing/using it the most -- and it&#39;s a bunch of boring blank boxes -- then it&#39;s not worth it.
