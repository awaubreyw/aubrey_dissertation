Every AI to date has broken their test environment in order to win. By any means necessary.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

These animals process the stimuli in the most basic sense of the word rather than think in the way you and I think (more on that in a second). It&#39;s like a coded machine, but this begs the question, &quot;at what point do we stop being machines?&quot; I don&#39;t really think there is a point, or there is no way to tell at least. The minutia of differences in our life experiences and genetics might be able to account for how different people react differently in the same situations. Does that mean we&#39;re not beholden to the fundamentally same if-thens that guide the machine-like processes of the cell, or the hard coded behavior of the ant? What if our behavior is just a flow chart of a multitude of conditions that, moment to moment, if met, solicit an automated response? Could we build a machine to do roughly the same thing? Would we consider that machine sentient? Would it be a facade of intelligence or are we no different besides being biological?<br><br>edit: as an aside, like it was briefly mentioned at the end of the video, I appreciate that life and behavior follow a unique organization compared to everything else in the universe. Stars, planets, etc. are not guided by self preservation. The phenomena of life is that it is guided by self preservation, and from that we can witness an entirely different formation of things that occurs nowhere else. Rocks don&#39;t form wings or colonies or brains or need to reproduce.", "comment_date": "2019-11-20T01:28:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cecilia Del Rosario", "comment_text": "animals-how a bunch of stupid things turn into smart things<br>humans:how a bunch of smart things turn into stupid things", "comment_date": "2019-11-19T14:06:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I Hate Roads", "comment_text": "177013", "comment_date": "2019-11-18T22:54:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Ruben Saragi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE&amp;t=3m20s\">3:20</a> Thanos approved", "comment_date": "2019-11-18T12:10:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noodle God", "comment_text": "I love how they keep calling people stupid aggzhgbshgsbjxbhhdvh<br>Especially those damn babies", "comment_date": "2019-11-18T04:16:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nepalmz", "comment_text": "U drew me <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE&amp;t=4m24s\">4:24</a> lol", "comment_date": "2019-11-17T19:11:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChromaBonk", "comment_text": "this seems like a really good argument against creationism", "comment_date": "2019-11-17T18:45:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "HomoChadicus", "comment_text": "This comment section be like:<br>60% normal everyday comments and replies<br>35% ah yes, the infamous &quot;177013&quot;<br>5% ppl asking what 177013 is in the replies (seriously, you don&#39;t want and need to know.)", "comment_date": "2019-11-17T13:59:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ants Singapore", "comment_text": "ant communism", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T23:32:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Urban Villager", "comment_text": "I just watch for for the awsome anomations", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T20:43:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Serina", "comment_text": "It\u2019s been 2 years since this video", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T14:56:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jb76489", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE&amp;t=3m53s\">3:53</a> anyone know the song?", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T12:37:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Skaya L\u00ea", "comment_text": "&quot;Ape together strong&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T12:04:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Orion", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE&amp;t=0m24s\">0:24</a> is literally humans", "comment_date": "2019-11-16T06:43:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "damag3plan", "comment_text": "So what&#39;s it called for humans?

You should be aware that there are certain phrases which are commonly used and imply unbelief. The believers also use them, but without realizing their implications. We shall explain three of the most important of them.<br>   The First: <br>   &quot;Causes create this.&quot;<br>   The Second: <br>   &quot;It forms itself; it comes into existence and later ceases to exist.&quot;<br>   The Third: <br>   &quot;It is natural; Nature necessitates and creates it.&quot;<br>   Indeed, since beings exist and this cannot be denied, and since each being comes into existence in a wise and artistic fashion, and since each is not outside time but is being continuously renewed, then, O falsifier of the truth, you are bound to say either that the causes in the world create beings, for example, this animal; that is to say, it comes into existence through the coming together of causes, or that it forms itself, or that its coming into existence is a requirement and necessary effect of Nature, or that it is created through the power of One All-Powerful and All-Glorious. Since reason can find no way apart from these four, if the first three are definitely proved to be impossible, invalid and absurd, the way of Divine Unity, which is the fourth way, will necessarily and self-evidently and without doubt or suspicion, be proved true.<br>   THE FIRST WAY <br>   This to imagine that the formation and existence of things, creatures, occurs through the coming together of the causes in the universe. We shall mention only three of its numerous impossibilities.<br>   First Impossibility <br>   Imagine there is a pharmacy in which there are hundreds of jars and phials filled with quite different substances. A living potion and a living remedy are required from those medicaments. So we go to the pharmacy and see that they are to be found there in abundance, yet in great variety. We examine each of the potions and see that the ingredients have been taken in varying but precise amounts from each of the jars and phials, one ounce from this, three from that, seven from the next, and so on. If one ounce too much or too little had been taken, the potion would not have been living and would not have displayed its special quality. Next, we study the living remedy. Again, the ingredients have been taken from the jars in a particular measure so that if even the most minute amount too much or too little had been taken, the remedy would have lost its special property.<br>   Now, although the jars number more than fifty, the ingredients have been taken from each according to measures and amounts that are all different. Is it in any way possible or probable that the phials and jars should have been knocked over by a strange coincidence or sudden gust of wind and that only the precise, though different, amounts that had been taken from each of them should have been spilt, and then arranged themselves and come together to form the remedy? Is there anything more superstitious, impossible and absurd than this? If an ass could speak, it would say: &quot;I cannot accept this idea!&quot;, and would gallop off!<br>   Similarly, each living being may be likened to the living potion in the comparison, and each plant to a living remedy. For they are composed of matter that has been taken in most precise measure from truly numerous and truly various substances. If these are attributed to causes and the elements and it is claimed, &quot;Causes created these,&quot; it is unreasonable, impossible and absurd a hundred times over, just as it was to claim that the potion in the pharmacy came into existence through the phials being knocked over; by accident.<br>   In Short: <br>   The vital substances in this vast pharmacy of the universe, which are measured on the scales of Divine Determining and Decree of the All-Wise and Pre-Eternal One, can only come into existence through a boundless wisdom, infinite knowledge and all-encompassing will. The unfortunate person who declares that they are the work of blind, deaf and innumerable elements and causes and natures, which stream like floods; and the foolish, delirious person who claims that that wondrous remedy poured itself out when the phials were knocked over and formed itself, are certainly unreasonable and nonsensical. Indeed, such denial and unbelief is a senseless absurdity.<br>   THE SECOND WAY <br>   This is expressed by the phrase &quot;It forms itself.&quot; It too involves many impossibilities and is absurd and impossible in many aspects. We shall explain three examples of these impossibilities.<br>   First Impossibility <br>   O you obstinate denier! Your egotism has made you so stupid that somehow you decide to accept a hundred impossibilities all at once. For you yourself are a being and not some simple substance that is inanimate and unchanging. You are like an extremely well-ordered machine that is constantly being renewed and a wonderful palace that is undergoing continuous change. Particles are working unceasingly in your body. Your body has a connection and mutual relations with the universe, in particular with regard to sustenance and the perpetuation of the species, and the particles that work within it are careful not to spoil that relationship nor to break the connection. In this cautious manner they set about their work, as though taking the whole universe into account. Seeing your relationships within it, they take up their positions accordingly. And you benefit with your external and inner senses in accordance with the wonderful positions that they take.    If you do not accept that the particles in your body are tiny officials in motion in accordance with the law of the Pre-Eternal and All-Powerful One, or that they are an army, or the nibs of the pen of Divine Determining, with each particle as the nib of a pen, or that they are points inscribed by the pen of Power with each particle being a point, then in every particle working in your eye there would have to be an eye such as could see every limb and part of your body as well as the entire universe, with which you are connected. In addition to this, you would have to ascribe to each particle an intelligence equivalent to that of a hundred geniuses, sufficient to know and recognize all your past and your future, and your forbears and descendants, the origins of all the elements of your being, and the sources of all your sustenance.<br>   To attribute the knowledge and consciousness of a thousand Plato&#39;s to a single particle of one such as you who does not possess even a particle&#39;s worth of intelligence in matters of this kind is a crazy superstition a thousand times over!<br>   THE THIRD WAY <br>   &quot;Nature necessitates it; Nature makes it.&quot; This statement contains many impossibilities. We shall mention three of them by way of examples.<br>   First Impossibility <br>   If the art and creativity, which are discerning and wise, to be seen in beings and particularly in animate beings are not attributed to the pen of Divine Determining and Power of the Pre-Eternal Sun, and instead are attributed to Nature and force, which are blind, deaf and unthinking, it becomes necessary that Nature either should have present in everything machines and printing-presses for their creation, or should include in everything power and wisdom enough to create and administer the universe. The reason for this is as follows:<br>   The sun&#39;s manifestations and reflections appear in all small fragments of glass and droplets on the face of the earth. If those miniature, reflected imaginary suns are not ascribed to the sun in the sky, it is necessary to accept the external existence of an actual sun in every tiny fragment of glass smaller than a match-head, which possesses the sun&#39;s qualities and which, though small in size, bears profound meaning; and therefore to accept actual suns to the number of pieces of glass.<br>   In exactly the same way, if beings and animate creatures are not attributed directly to the manifestation of the Pre-Eternal Sun&#39;s Names, it becomes neciessary to accept that in each being, and especially animate beings, there lies a nature, a force, or quite simply a god that will sustain an infinite power and will, and knowledge and wisdom. Such an idea is the most absurd and superstitious of all the impossibilities in the universe. It demonstrates that a man who attributes the art of the Creator of the universe to imaginary, insignificant, unconscious Nature is without a doubt less conscious of the truth than an animal.<br>Risale-i Nur Collection 174 - Bedi\u00fczzaman Said", "comment_date": "2019-09-02T14:26:38Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "MEHAZ", "comment_text": "FIRST MATTER: In every facet of the motion of all particles the light of Divine unity shines like the sun. For as is proved briefly in the First Indication of the Tenth Word and in detail in the Twenty-Second Word, if every particle is not an official of God acting with His permission and under His authority, and if it is not undergoing change within His knowledge and power, then every particle must have infinite knowledge and limitless power; it must have eyes that see everything, a face that looks to all things, and authority over all things. For every particle of the elements acts, or can act, in an orderly fashion in all animate beings. But the order within things and laws according to which they are formed differ from one thing to the next. If their order was not known to the particles, the particles could not act, or even if they could act, they could not act without error. In which case, the particles which are performing their duties in beings are either acting with the permission and at the command, and within the knowledge and at the will, of the owner of an all-encompassing knowledge, or they themselves must have such an all-encompassing knowledge and power. Yes, all particles of air can enter the bodies of all animate beings, the fruits of all flowers, and the structures of all leaves. They can act within them, although the way the beings are formed is all different and their order and systems quite distinct. As though the factory of a fig was a loom for weaving cloth and the factory of a pomegranate, a machine for producing sugar, and so on; the programmes of their structures and bodies all differ from each other. A particle of air, then, enters or can enter all of them. It takes up its position and acts in a wise and masterly fashion without error. And on completion of its duty it departs. A mobile particle of mobile air, therefore, either must know the forms, shapes, measures, and formations with which plants and animals, and even fruits and flowers, are clothed, or else it must be an official acting under the command and will of one who does know. Similarly with a stationary particle of stationary earth: since it has the ability to be the means and place of cultivation for all the seeds of all flowering plants and fruit-bearing trees, either there must be in the particle itself or in the handful of soil that is its little house immaterial machinery and factories in good working order to the number of the varieties of the trees and plants, and flowers and fruits in fact, it is in every single particle that there must be a factory peculiar to it and all the equipment and machinery necessary for the running of the factory or else it must have a miraculous knowledge that knows all things about all things and a miracle-working power that creates everything from nothing; or, those duties are performed at the command and with the permission of One Who is Knowing of All Things, and through the power and might of One Who is Absolutely Powerful over All Things. If an untrained and inexperienced, common, ordinary, and blind man was to go to Europe and in all the factories there to work at all the trades and crafts in perfect and masterly fashion, and if he was to display a wise and artistic skill to such a degree that it left everyone speechless with amazement, anyone with a grain of consciousness would know that the man was not acting on his own initiative, but that a master of all trades was teaching him and causing him to work. And if there was a blind and impotent man who lived in a simple little house and was unable even to rise from his place, and if small fragments of stone, and bits and pieces of material like bone and cotton were to enter his little house and then sacks of sugar, bales of cloth, crates of jewelry, finely-made clothes encrusted with jewels, and delicious foods were to emerge, would anyone with a grain of intelligence not say: &quot;That man is a wretched doorkeeper or merely a latch on the door of the factory of a wondrous miracle-working being, which is the source of his miracles&quot;? In exactly the same way, the motion and duties of particles of air in plants and trees, and blossom and fruit, all of which are missives of the Eternally Besought One, antique dominical works of art, miracles of power, and wonders of wisdom, indicate that the particles are acting under the command and at the will of an All-Wise and Glorious Maker, an All-Generous and Beauteous Creator. Particles of earth, also, since they are the source and means for the shoots and plants produced by seeds, each of which is a different factory and workbench, a different printing-press, treasury, and antique, a different manifesto proclaiming the Glorious Maker&#39;s Names and ode hymning His perfections, it is as definite as two plus two equalling four that the particles of earth are acting at the command, with the permission, and through the will and power of an All-Glorious Maker Who is Lord of the command of &quot;Be!&quot; and it is, {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 36:82, etc.} and to Whose command everything is subjugated. In this we believe.

Prosperity is not imposed from the top down, it emerges from the bottom up, out of the billions of localized interactions between individual people. When you try to dictate the behavior of the market  you undermine the normal rules of the game that allow those individual interactions to generate wealth. Using the worker ant analogy, if you start setting quotas and assigning different ants to their jobs, then they can&#39;t react efficiently to changes in their environment and switch jobs the moment they notice the need. <br><br>The more complex a system becomes, like a human national economy, the <b>more</b> important it is to have that decentralized property of markets, because a central authority by necessity can only act on a minuscule subset of the available information. Whereas if each of us act on the local information immediately available to us, we basically break that job down into manageable chunks where each person can solve their small part of the problem. It&#39;s basically distributing the load: each of the 330 million people only has to make decisions about the bite-sized chunk of the world that&#39;s in their circle of influence.

First off, the examples are pretty bad. &quot;Wetness&quot; is a poorly defined property, more explanation is needed to prove it&#39;s not a property water has on it&#39;s own aside from changing the frame of reference. Then comes the fact that for many of the examples, the emergent behavior is actually simpler than the parts, defeating the whole point of the idea. For example, maintaining a count is much easier than creating a chemical communication system. The reoccurring &quot;how do live things come from dead things&quot; BS comes up again, it&#39;s really not that hard to explain, but you just had to act like it&#39;s too mysterious to tackle instead of giving a real example. And you just had to throw in the consciousness BS as a result of not understanding the difference between weak and strong emergence. Finally, we can explain emergence, it&#39;s just math and metaphysics. Only people who have no clue what they are talking about think it&#39;s unexplainable.

That takes figuring out. <br><br>We humans are arrogant to assume that we possess the only type of knowing to figure out stuff to survive. The ant is inherently intelligent in its own right. The unification of these tiny guys&#39; inherent ant-level-intelligence produced the results we observe. Emergence of intelligence can be ONLY construed IF the basic unit (The Ant) <b>is totally devoid of all semblance of knowing and intelligence.</b> So the collection of ants did not suddenly switch on the individual intelligence in each ant which it contributes to the collective...that&#39;s laughably ludicrous.<br><br>(3) The cell is not a unit of life. <i>The Cell Is Merely The Unit Of Biological Matter.</i> <b>Matter Is Not Life,</b> biological or otherwise. Materialism has a conveniently flawed definition of Life to suit it&#39;s own bias or cognitive dissonance. What therefore is the unit of Life within a single cell? When a cell dies are any of its physical &quot;life giving&quot; components missing? What within a cell gives it life if a cell can die or &quot;lose its life&quot;? This kind of thinking is appealing to a Superstitious Magic, born out of the Philosophy Of Materialism which insists that Matter = Life...or conversely, that dead, inanimate Matter CREATES life. <br><br>Materialism has no clear definition of what living things are, (according to this video @ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE&amp;t=3m54s\">3:54</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE&amp;t=3m57s\">3:57</a>) but it can still simultaneously assert that &quot;whatever is alive&quot;, (which <b>by its own admission</b> it cannot properly define) somehow came from what is NOT alive. If you have no clear definition of what living things are ...how can you possibly be clear on what non-living things are? This Is Pure Madness. . Materialism needs to simply admit <i>That It Has No Proper Definition Of Life.</i><br><br>(4) If cells are &#39;stupid&#39; how can they perform protein folding? So it takes super human intelligence to figure out that 2+2=4 but miraculously, it takes nothing but total stupidity to figure out how to fold proteins(!!!) A simple calculator can &quot;figure out&quot; 2+2=4 in  nano-seconds. <b>It takes powerful COMPUTERS forever to simulate just one single act of Protein Folding</b> which  your &#39;dumb&#39; cells perform very quickly...So cells are &#39;stupid&#39; right???...go figure.

Yet please allow me to give my opinion.<br><br>I think this is only a piece of a theory. It works in many cases... How should I express myself... But in addition to that I do believe in hierarchy as a natural law.<br><br>Isn&#39;t the heart guided by a certain node? Isn&#39;t the rest of the body controlled by the brain? Or do we talk about different levels? Okay take the cells - Maybe there is kind of a master minded interface in every organ that corresponds between the brain and the cells? Know what I&#39;m saying - hierarchy I&#39;ve mentioned, not only emergence from chaos. Well, maybe there was just emergence in the beginning. But then everything started to build a higher complexity - and for that all units - in this case cells - should have a higher guidience/ purpose. Maybe the cells don&#39;t know that the body exist. But they should kinda know that their organ exists, which highest command is to live and survive, so all cells inherent to the organ live and work for that purpose. So all organs work for the purpose that the body lives and survives.<br>I think that every complex energetic structure with a superordinate task needs a superordinate mind. Plus, all cells benefit from healthy organs, as organs benefit from a healthy body. If the body lost its life, then all stuff inside would. (Or not?)<br><br>And what about the ants&#39; colony? Don&#39;t they have the queen? Isn&#39;t she responsible for controlling and guiding their loyal and royal fellows?<br><br>What about human societies? Don&#39;t we have kings and queens, emperors or popes, presidents and mayors? Aren&#39;t they there to oversee the whole?<br>Are we on top of everything? Or could there be a higher purpose? For example taking care of our earth together? For me for example this is the most important task for us. And I think that there should be someone to oversee and guide everything, because he has a much wider perception than all of us if we stay on the same level.<br><br>There are many more reasons why I believe in hierarchy, but I should quit it (for) now.<br><br>I hope I did match your topic, I hope you understood me (English isn&#39;t my mother language), and I hope we could discuss a lot about it! :)", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T21:41:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pah Body", "comment_text": "fucking stupid ant, what an absolute fucking moron", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T19:06:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Ellsworth", "comment_text": "YOU ARE WRONG<br><br><br><br>WATER ISN&#39;T WET!!!!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T18:40:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dyllan Arevalo", "comment_text": "ants working together and defending they life", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T17:04:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nubia Warren", "comment_text": "Are you telling me water isn\u2019t wet?", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T02:05:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "logan nevins", "comment_text": "Is water wet?", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T00:17:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Randall Petersen", "comment_text": "There are not &#39;billions&#39; of  pacemaker cells in the heart, only some few million.

As individuals, the way that we absorb information and spend our energy is influenced not only by our own bodies, but also by our relationships with other people and things in the world outside of ourselves. As such, we each have the ability to receive information/energy from others and also to impart information/energy to others. In this sense, we are like neurons, making connections with other neurons and then passing energy back and forth across those connections. From this realization, it&#39;s easy to see social structures as minds of their own which emerge from and are influenced by, but not limited to, the experiences of its single neurons (individual people).", "comment_date": "2018-01-11T15:47:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "meandmyfriends999", "comment_text": "Damn, I came to this conclusion a while ago, but didn&#39;t realize there was a term for it and everything", "comment_date": "2018-01-10T00:38:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "v a", "comment_text": "Is this the same concept as synergy?", "comment_date": "2018-01-09T22:02:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xaldor the Seer", "comment_text": "Can you create a video on the question you proposed in this video?

Is it possible that the idea that the Cell is made up of dumb things making the cell the smallest living organism is not necessarily the case? At the Quantum level I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar with the wave-icle idea - the idea of superposition. Could it be that when you break matter down small enough it stops becoming matter and becomes consciousness? We know that all matter in the universe is moving, and we know that when you break it small enough it starts acting different. We know basically nothing about how Consciousness rises and it seems to be clearly there in other species, I feel like it would be silly to say that homo-sapiens exclusives have consciousness - You could say that we maybe have reached the &quot;highest level&quot; of consciousness of any animal, but not the only conscious when you even briefly consider the inter-personal relationships and behaviors of practically anything. Chimps, whales, elephants and dolphins are great examples of clearly conscious animals but even looking at rats or ants and watching their behavior it seems clear to me that they are sentient. <br><br>That would seem to reason that just like matter is, you could say, fractal - that maybe consciousness is also fractal. To me that seems reasonable and makes sense of the idea of communities, businesses, nations and what-not acting like living entities - because they may very well be  consciousness. The idea of the collective conscious is definitely a thing. That&#39;s how we ended up with two candidates like Trump and Hilary. You could look at them like the manifestation of the collective conscious of the Republican and Democratic parties. Which would make sense of the idea of a &quot;subconscious&quot; or maybe we could call it a higher consciousness which communicates through intuition. We know the brain is a lot smarter than the conscious part, the brain keeps the body alive, the conscious part has no idea how to do that. So maybe the higher consciousness keeps the body alive... I don&#39;t know that&#39;s just an interesting thought. So the Idea would be that the whole universe stems from some sort of, maybe you could call it &quot;energy&quot;. I guess maybe the idea would be that fundamentally there is this, let&#39;s call it a field of energy - or maybe dimensions, and that when &quot;3&quot; of these dimensions hit you get what we know as reality. So then reality would be in constant interaction with that field of energy, because of the double slit experiment you could maybe even say that reality is being created by the field of energy and that the field is actually consciousness which is fractal and we are just experiencing one degree, or maybe you could call it perspective, of consciousness. <br><br>I&#39;m really interested to know what the team at Kurzgesagt thinks about these thoughts and concepts.

It neither attempts nor is able to seize hold of and define its objects in a series of discursive explanations, and reduce them to clarity by logical analysis. The way of the unconscious is different. Symbols gather round the thing to be explained, understood, interpreted. The act of becoming conscious consists in the concentric groupings of symbols around the object, all circumscribing and describing the unknown from many sides. Each symbol lays bare another essential side of the object to be grasped, points to another facet of meaning. Only the canon of these symbols congregating about the centre in question, the coherent symbol group, can lead to an understanding of what the symbols point to and of what they are trying to express.\u201d<br><br>Consciousness as the self awareness of emergence: yes.

Combining simple systems results in a more complex system with properties that arise from the INTERACTION of those simpler subsystems.

These are of course related in the sense that something can be identified as an entity based on the emergent functions of some system. However, these are also separate issues in the sense that persistence of identity through time has more to do with what emergent properties/functions of a system we chose to be the most relevant ones (based on our implicit and explicit aims). At the same time, the system might have other properties, which can be deemed emergent, but given that they are not relevant, regardless of them changing in any way we still see that entity as persisting in time as long as the relevant properties/functions of that system remain unchanged.", "comment_date": "2017-11-26T15:46:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karl Kastor", "comment_text": "I nice and simple example of emergence is also Conway&#39;s Game of Life.

Makes me wonder, though, have any readers experienced emergence themselves? Here is my example: I was working on a fish pond crew in Israel, where every person on the crew was cross-trained to handle multiple roles in trapping fish, handling nets, handling tractors (which helped drag the nets from the shore), the fish vacuum, fish sorting, etc. Add that the cross-training for many included leadership because every member of the leadership team under 50 had to be gone one month of the year for army reserves. Emergence was visible as the dozen of us approached the pond that would be harvested, people at the front of the group moved toward the feed that would be used as fish bait. Others seeing this moved toward the winches that would lower the nets used as a trap, yet others walked to the tractors, or to the fish nets or prepared the sorting tables. No assignments were given, people just knew what order tasks had to be done, and knew what was already covered by observing which directions their teammates were going. Simultaneous preparations were done by whoever happened to be closer to the untended task or equipment. The part that isn&#39;t scientific is how being part of such a team made me feel. It was intensely satisfying to play a part in the job done well, and feel like a part of something bigger than I was as an individual. The reward part of being an emergent team almost felt hardwired.

Because evrything can be predicted given the past and present knowledge ( even if this affermation obliviusly negate the existance of god or the idea of caos), from human Behavior to DNA , the only problem is that we don&#39;t have the power to know more than a shallow knowledge limited by our humanity.<br><br>i&#39;m so bad at enlgish, i&#39;m sorry :O.", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T19:41:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Dietz", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE&amp;t=5m37s\">5:37</a> &quot;Asgard is not a place, it\u00b4s a people&quot; \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T19:13:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Madoc", "comment_text": "Human society is the opposite", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T19:07:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TDplay", "comment_text": "Some humans don&#39;t follow the rule however.", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T19:01:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MaybeOnAStick", "comment_text": "Best outro ever &lt;3", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T18:56:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zefile", "comment_text": "that was BEAUTIFUL", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T18:53:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IgorD", "comment_text": "But, if you take the title a bit more literal, there&#39;s an opposite social phenomenon - a crowd, where a bunch of smart people becomes stupid.

The deepest construct of everything equating to a series of quantum equilibrium equations, that all try and and maintain balance creating behaviours to accomplish this while primarily gaining information. When you bring &#39;life&#39; into the idea that it as-well boils down to  these basic equations, it can invoke a feeling of inevitable doom or lack of meaning. But these flaws are what limit ourselves and prevent further evolution. Consider this. A group of individuals set to a specific task with an ultimate goal that would benefit themselves and the population, will complete that goal. If said group were to be seen as &#39;stupid&#39;, then their goal would be gaining intelligence. For this case, ants will work together in the hopes that they will grow as a combined unit to overall benefit themselves buy working as a collective. Emergence. Single units working together to overall benefit. Replace the &#39;group&#39; with highly intellectual people, you&#39;ll then see that as a collective, they achieve their goals with higher precision  due to their ability to understand and act on complex ideas. Now, combine a number of intellectual individuals into a population and give them no resulting goal, that leads to a group of people too focused on self benefiting rather than group benefiting. This can lead to a &#39;smart getting dumber&#39; idea, but all that is just a human construct created to understand and overall survive. With all these primitive biological tendencies restricting us as a collective, what the true meaning of evolution is, to adapt to the surroundings to benefit an individual, to maintain their biological/chemical systems and avoid system failure(death).

I appreciate you work. :) Actually this systems compares really well with how computers work since the computer is some set of 0s and 1s trying to communicate. (Yes, I am a CS guy :)) With an essential difference thoug. You see in computer there is me and other computer scentists trying to create this complex structure.<br>Yes, I understand that they work together to be &quot;smart&quot;. However, working together is an intelligence in itself and accepting atoms (I used atoms here since they are the bottom of the hierarchy suggested in this video and can ben replaced with any subelement constructring a complex one.) has such an intelligence is what I cannot feel comfortable with. No one can suggest cables and electrical signals created computers right? This maybe a dilemma caused by the trying to explain whys with answers of hows since we are trying to explain why the universe is the way it is with the facts of science. But in any case I think suggesting their is one intelligence being commending all is rather simpler and more logical than suggesting they are all communicating then creating the action. To support my point for instance, their is only one general commander in an army. How can armys of nature is just commanders (anything can be put in this category from atoms to stars) trying to communicate with each other?

I say this because, honestly, you didn&#39;t present any new, intriguing information to me.  I&#39;m a computer scientist, so I have to deal with this stuff all the time, and it&#39;s also pretty clearly important to mathematics and much anything involving science or engineering.  It&#39;s also a relevant (yet implicit) concept in subjects such as english (syntax -&gt; words -&gt; grammer -&gt; sentences), art (colored lines -&gt; shapes -&gt; textures and details), and music (notes -&gt; chords -&gt; passages -&gt; songs), among others.  Frankly, it feels like you guys are starting to discuss topics that I&#39;ve found for a long time resolved and uninteresting (ex. what living forever means instead of its potential implications), almost like claiming that Zeno&#39;s paradox is an actual paradox in a calculus class.  The recent video about extending healthspan instead of lifespan, for example, I found quite interesting, and I personally prefer to see your videos about how things work.  Finally, at least to me, it seems, there&#39;s a simple reason that emergence exists (at least biologically), and that is because of evolution.  It takes more resources to make things better at general tasks, so through natural selection a free-floating plant mass might evolve to have an anchor and photosensitive cells, but not make them maintain the tasks of the other due to said resource consumption (since anchor cells are generally out of the way of sunlight and photosensitive cells need to be distributed to acquire the most sunlight).  In essence, I&#39;m saying that biological emergence exists because it&#39;s the optimal way to manage resources giving varying local environments (though clearly it&#39;s going to be more complicated).  <br><br>TL;DR Not impressed - it happens all the time because I guess it&#39;s mathematically optimal.

I wouldn&#39;t say this is as fancy as &quot;emergence&quot;.  A lot of what this boils down to is a LOT of random happenstance, going on for VERY long periods of time, until the math works out.  What you see with eusocial animals is a form of specialized inbreeding that turned out right, whether it&#39;s ants or naked mole rats or honeybees.  The last common ancestors of all these species tried this sort of thing over and over again across many niches, dying a LOT along the way, until the maths of second-hand reproductive success (gaining reproductive success thanks to the fertility of your immediate kin and extended siblings) switched from all-subtraction (all dying all the time) to mostly addition (something worked!).<br><br>Lots of swarm logic works like this within a same species: it&#39;s all extended kinship ties allowing individuals to share in each other&#39;s reproductive success in ways that reward sociality far more than brute selfishness.  It&#39;s also one reason why civilization (a.k.a. social contract) and literacy took off the way they did with human beings: with both of these things, grandparents suddenly become <i>relevant to</i> the socialization of their grandchildren, and to their education, meaning you get an extension of kinship ties going beyond simple parent-child ties.  Suddenly you get a whole village interested in actually raising each child, regardless of the fitness of any given set of parents.<br><br>And that&#39;s not some great moral imperative or &quot;intelligence of the universe&quot; thing talking: that&#39;s just the accumulated math of reproductive success and evolution working out, _finally, for once_.  Whatever adds to a species&#39;s numbers is usually good, whatever subtracts from it, is sometimes really not so good.<br><br>In the end, Wolfram was more right than he knew.

I&#39;ll explain what I mean:<br><br>I think a very good way to understand how cells and microbiology works, is not to think of cells as &quot;alive&quot;, and &quot;communicating&quot;, but rather as very complicated machines. Machines are made up of lots of small, physical, moving parts that all affect each other. When one gear turns or a pendulum swings, it sets other gears and levers in motion, which creates a desired output. A cell works a lot like that; a protein or molecule will have a chemical reaction with another part of a molecule, which causes other proteins and molecules to have different chemical reactions to that protein or molecule, and so on. All the complex processes of a cell are not really much different to clockwork.<br><br>So when you say two cells are &quot;alive&quot; and &quot;communicating&quot;, it&#39;s like saying two clocks that are running and linked together are &quot;alive&quot; and communicating&quot;. <br>Where the cells push molecules across their membranes, the clocks move the linkage between their cases.<br>There is no magical &quot;life force&quot; at play, no molecule is deciding where to go because it is &quot;alive&quot;. Chemistry determines where it goes. Chemistry determines what neurons fire in your brain based on the inputs it receives, &quot;you&quot; never really have a choice in the matter.<br><br>So basically this is how I rationalize emergent behavior, it&#39;s all about how parts in a system <b>affect</b> each other, not how they <b>act</b> together.<br><br> (The key difference between a cell and an automaton is of course water, the molecular constituents of a cell are free to move around in 3D and put themselves wherever they fit best, unlike clockwork.

We know from sensory deprivation that if that external stimulus is taken away, consciousness quickly unravels and then dissolves.  We also know that emotional responses are driven by biofeedback between our body and brain.  If you can&#39;t flare your nostrils, feel your face get warm, and furrow your brow, then you can not feel angry.

What about how a tomography scanner works (CAT)?/ Even Maxwell laws of electromagnetism explained to a 3 yo child would be top / Implications of the fixed speed of light: the further we look into cosmos the further we see the past image of what we are looking at.

Weather patterns are chaotic: they follow well-understood patterns and can be fairly accurately predicted a day or two out before chaos kicks in. The movements of planets are chaotic as well, just on a larger time scale: we know with a high degree of certainty where any given planet will be 100 years from now but, due to the minute gravitational effects of every object in the solar system, we have no idea where the planets will be in 10 million years.<br><br>An emergent system doesn&#39;t even have that small degree of predictability. You could know every detail about every agent&#39;s position and behavior and still have no way of predicting the overall system&#39;s behavior.

I have just had a course in social sciences on my university, witch i did not pass jet so i might be wrong, where i got thought to define a nation as a imagined community. &quot;imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion&quot;(Anderson, 1983). What you described is more in line with a state witch we got thought to define as a organisation that claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of violence within a given territory. Therefor i think you, the researchers and r writers, accidentally mixt those two up. A compromise may be the nation-state where a state and a nation occupy the same territory.

Great work on introducing the Emergence. Here is some extra information on this concept. Emergence plays a central role in the theory of complex systems (a theory to understand and explain complex systems such as cells and society). I would like to point out few complexity metaphors:<br>- Phase space - phrase space: For example, water can be solid, liquid and gas forms<br>- Communicative connectedness: For example, ants have the ability to talk to each other in many ways and means<br>- Sensitive dependence on initial conditions: The big bang properties could be the initial conditions of our universe formation<br>- Edge of chaos - chaotic edge: For example, being flexible and the ability to take risks are important factors that lead to innovation<br>- Attractors: For example, the availability of food could be an attractor for the ants to decide where to build a colony<br>- Fractality: Very important concept. Describes ways to measure dimensions for self-repeating and self-organizing things like the snowflake<br><br>It would be great if Kurzgesagt builds a video for the evolution of single theories that attempted to describe how the world works explaining their limitations and strength. Every few decades scientists develop such theories in an attempt to explain the conciseness and complex phenomena such as synchronization (e.g. the pacemaker cells).
