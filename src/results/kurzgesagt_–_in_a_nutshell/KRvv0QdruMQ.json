I will provide you with a few evidence of advance ancient civilization. Long ago, we were just an ordinary breed of human without intelligence. Then the Gods arrived and genetically modified us to have intelligence.  That is why we are the only specie with intelligence on our planet after the Gods left. Before the Gods left, they leave behind the Holy Teaching to teach us morals and history. Also women have offended the Gods in the past, that is why women were modified to menstruates.  If we look at the entire animal kingdom female human are the only specie that menstruates. No animals menstruates except human. This is evidence that female human had offended the Gods to cause the Gods to modified us to menstruates.

An \u201cadvance\u201d civilization that had the ability to travel the sea with great accuracy, an ability we didn\u2019t even perfect until the 1800s, was essentially erased from history. <br><br>Why do we think this is a possibility? Well, i forget how but a map maker in the early 1500s was making a world map using smaller maps, some up which were very old, but not only that, were from the Library of Alexandria. One of this maps display Antarctica on the bottom of it when it hadn\u2019t been discovered yet, it also accurately depicted a land formation that, when the maps were made in the 1500s, were already well under water.<br><br>So that\u2019s one piece of evidence, other things that suggest an older \u201cadvance\u201d civilization is obviously all this ancient structures that we have no clue how they were built.

I live in Michigan, USA. In the northern part of Michigan, are two metal containing rock formations that any previous Lost Civilizations would have mined and humans would not have found them intact. One is in the Keweenaw Peninsula where ancient lava flows were produced during the Mesoproterozoic Era as a part of the Midcontinent Rift between 1.096 and 1.087 billion years ago. This volcanic activity produced the only strata on Earth where large-scale economically recoverable 97 percent pure native copper is found. This copper was mined between 1870 and 1910. The other is the Animikie Group, found in  both Michigan and Minnesota. This rock formation was laid down between 2.200 to 1.850 billion years ago. It contains thick, 50%-iron, layers and has produced the vast majority of iron mined in the United States. Both of the geologic sites formed long before multicellular life evolved. In fact the iron in Animikie Group is part of the total removal of dissolved iron from the ocean by molecular oxygen, after which the oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere, and without that gaseous oxygen it is impossible for there to be animal life on land, thus this iron ore body was in place before any possible Lost Civilization. The fact that it was not mined before humans found it means there was no prior Lost Civilization.", "comment_date": "2022-05-09T00:28:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JB", "comment_text": "kurzgesagt is for people with critical thinking skills of a potato", "comment_date": "2022-05-08T23:59:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blake Johnson", "comment_text": "our 18th winner", "comment_date": "2022-05-08T21:33:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bar\u0131s Balli", "comment_text": "this is literally the best channel in youtube", "comment_date": "2022-05-08T19:24:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Derek Snyder", "comment_text": "You guys should consider doing a video on the new age of storage devices.

Water just has properties that stand in the way too much. The viscosity makes tool usage difficult because water resists the act of hitting things hard. The only tools that could work fine are spears, and knapping flint for spearheads is also difficult because of the viscosity. Water also stores more thermal energy, so seasons change the environment less, and the animal needs to have less ingenuity to survive harsh conditions, lessening the evolutionary pressure of developing more intelligence. Most importantly, however, fire is impossible underwater. Human brain development accelerated because of the invention of cooking. Outsourcing part of the digestive process to an external energy source made food release more nutrients in the body, allowing there to be more fuel for a larger brain. It is simply more likely for cephalopods to live comfortably in the state they are without becoming sapient, just like what sharks have done for millions of years.", "comment_date": "2022-03-15T08:22:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Somar Slayer", "comment_text": "You did forget one thing that would stay for an incredibly long time and be almost impossible to miss, space debris. Satellites above low Earth orbits will basically stay there forever and so will any satellites we&#39;ve put in orbit of other bodies like the sun or other planets, probes and other stuff that we&#39;ve left behind on extra terrestrial bodies can also stay around for very long. Everything that&#39;s been left on the moon for example will basically have to be hit by asteroids to be removed and with how much we&#39;ve left and how low the rate of asteroid impacts is in our current solar system they&#39;ll basically stay there forever, immune to biological or atmospheric sources of decay. These things would be obvious tell tale signs of a previous industrial civilization and even if many of the satellites are destroyed due to Kepler syndrome it still wouldn&#39;t be difficult to recognize that these are artificial in nature. Any alien civilization that finds Earth before it is destroyed by the Sun will be able to spot and recognize these things and from that can easily extrapolate that there was once an industrial civilization on Earth, following the same logic given that it only took about 150 years from the invention of the steam engine to the launch of the first artificial satellite we can assume that any industrial civilization in Earth&#39;s past would probably have developed space technology and as such leave tell tale evidence in the form of satellites.\r<br>\r<br>There&#39;s of course other things we can look at to say that there probably hasn&#39;t been any industrial civilization in Earth&#39;s past, for example our extraction of hydrocarbons in the form of coal and oil is very noticeable and we have almost used up the entire supply of oil and have significantly reduced the supply of coal. Given how easy these are to use to power machinery we can kinda reason that just because we find them in amounts that are only consistent with us being the first to use them that probably means that there hasn&#39;t been any industrial civilization before us. Our coal deposits for example age back to the Carboniferous and many of our oil deposits started developing in later periods. We know that oil would take at least a few hundred million years to naturally regenerate to our current levels and the kind of coal formation that happened during the Carboniferous can&#39;t really happen anymore so we can reason with a lot of confidence that there haven&#39;t been any industrial civilizations prior to ours.", "comment_date": "2022-03-15T08:22:24Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "bruh cat", "comment_text": "Bruh is this guy a bird", "comment_date": "2022-03-15T08:16:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abdulkadir Acar", "comment_text": "S\u00f6hne sein Vater", "comment_date": "2022-03-15T07:59:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Veyron Darren", "comment_text": "How do things get buried inside land?

Wall Streeters and banksters are trying to obfuscate: they are trying to do with finance what some scientists do &quot;blinding you with science&quot; by using complex terms and very confusing explanations. <br><br>For example, what is being missed is that the &quot;Federal&quot; Reserve is privately owned by the ultrarich owners of its district banks AND not BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. &quot;Coincidentally,&quot; the &quot;Fed&quot; gives billions of dollars of ultra low interest loans at 2.5% per year to those very ultrarich people&#39;s banks (which is below the real inflation rate), and their banks then lend that exact money at 25% a year or more to waitresses, cab drivers, autoworkers, and teachers, etc., who actually pay taxes and actually contribute to society. It is amazingly profitable -- FOR THE ULTRARICH. (Scrt: If you research, you will see that Putin was not adequately sanctioned after he stole Crimea so he was enable to rearm and funded for years with Western funds, because then the ultrarich would have lost their investments in Russia, after the ultrarich actually had SELECTED Putin to rule Russia from many candidates. Read the history!)<br><br>Lawyers do the same, and so we have a legal system in which the best liar wins, the wealthy play games and pay lawyers to make evidence/witnesses unavailable or disappear, and bribery (sometimes by contributions to elect a judge that they then own) enables the ultrarich to avoid liability. Through settlements they can also force witnesses to keep quiet by requiring them to sign non-disclosure agreements (&quot;NDA&quot;), so I would sure like to hear what the 13 year old girl who sued the orange blubber ball claiming that he sexually abused her when she was a 13 year old  would say in detail, but the NDA that I bet he had her sign will make her unavailable as a witness forever.<br><br>For example, if the Sacklers did not have that incredibly GENEROUS, bankruptcy judge (who must be on their Christmas gift list for life, along with that judge&#39;s children, grand children, and great-grandchildren being rewarded by the Sackler&#39;s $10 billion family fortune for decades) approve their &quot;bankruptcy settlement&quot; to limit their personal liability what would happen? (That bankruptcy judge should be investigated and have all of his calls wiretapped for life by the FBI, in my humble opinion. I suspect through his approval of this settlement, that bankruptcy judge and his family, down to his last descendants, effectively won the lottery, each year for the rest of their lives.) <br><br>Thousands have died due to opioids reportedly produced by and pushed by their company. But for that WONDERFUL, GENEROUS settlement that this bankruptcy judge approved AGAIN, there would be many, many lawsuits against them and their company. <br><br>Once the Sacklers lost one case (for example, the 101st case), got a judgment against them, and it became a final judgment, then in all the next 899+ lawsuits the jury would be told that the Sacklers already had been found liable for misconduct due, e.g., to negligence, and as a result all that the next 899+ juries would only determine the amount of damages for causing the deaths of thousands of Americans. The liability on each case would have been GIGANTIC, particularly if they had been found to have acted intentionally and without any concern for the welfare of their customers, so punitive damages could be awarded: each jury could then award billions of dollars in punitive damages in EACH case, because the intent of such damages is to deter and their $10 billion fortune means that it would take billions in punitive damages to deter and punish them enough. <br><br>Thus, that GENEROUS bankruptcy judge saved the Sackler family from the risk of losing every cent they have, except for exempt property, like ordinary Americans lose everything regularly. The state AGs that backed this GENEROUS settlement to help the Sacklers, so they can keep BILLIONS will no doubt also have golden futures and have effectively each won the lottery. They will each doubtless get Sackler support, because the Sacklers will be deeply grateful, for decades and will become governors or US senators.", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T07:03:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Olarte", "comment_text": "Getting an ancient aliens vibes from this episode...", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T06:59:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rastz", "comment_text": "As always the way to explain such complicated topic with relatively simple animation and limited time is on its own lvl of quality, great work guys!", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T06:42:25Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "The Dishes", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRvv0QdruMQ&amp;t=10m34s\">10:34</a> theres jojo here", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T06:28:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CoolguyEgg3z", "comment_text": "6.9", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T05:53:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lady sauce", "comment_text": "did anybody else noticed that in every intro, the ape is holding something different?", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T05:48:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EBFilmsMan", "comment_text": "<b>laughs in Voth</b>", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T03:46:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ash", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRvv0QdruMQ&amp;t=10m36s\">10:36</a> <br>JOTARO!!??", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T03:37:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The tank", "comment_text": "I  saw a video saying that giants used to exist because people have found bones that a human, yet giant<br>and there where cave paintings describing figures fighting other figure that were bigger<br>so these ancient giants could have been the aliens", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T03:34:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BRAVO_01", "comment_text": "Maybe they\u2019ll be back", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T02:34:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Richardson", "comment_text": "I do hate when you make videos like this.

The use of the word &quot;indigenous&quot; is very interesting in this video, because it pops up repeatedly, although it&#39;s mostly to describe something called &quot;indigenous aliens&quot;... An oxymoron if I&#39;ve ever heard one. I understand what you mean by that, but perhaps you meant &quot;ancient indigenous peoples&quot;? Which leads me a subject I&#39;ve been meaning to dive into for a while.<br><br>&quot;Civilized society&quot; is setting our world on fire.<br><br>The perspective on science, technology and &quot;civilization&quot; are intrinsically tied together. After all, Galileo came from a civilized society, as did the scientific method and the vast majority of technological and scientific progress that we have today. Except, &quot;civilized&quot; is a very funny term, as it is always people who call themselves civilized who get to define it. <br><br>&quot;Civilized society&quot; is setting our world on fire.<br><br>Galileo was tried by the inquisition for his scientific findings. Throughout history, knowledge was something that &quot;civilized&quot; society went out of their way to suppress and destroy. How much could we have gained from China, if only there wasn&#39;t so much conflict between dynasties? How much could we have learned from Egypt, if the library of Alexandria was not destroyed? What could we have learned about society, if the Nazis didn&#39;t burn books on communism and gender theory?<br><br>&quot;Civilized society&quot; is setting our world on fire.<br><br>And this is from &quot;civilized society?&quot; The same societies that invaded /actually/ indigenous lands, genociding, raping, torturing, enslaving and acting as cruel as humanly possible. That&#39;s civilization? Societies that decide to go to war with other nations, causing the deaths of millions of civilians, because of political gain? Claiming it all in the name of religion? <br><br>&quot;Civilized society&quot; is setting our world on fire.<br><br>Even if you don&#39;t care about petty squabbles between people what about the way &quot;civilized society&quot; is treating the earth? The one place we call home? The easiest place for us to live, somewhere that is so comparatively hospitable that we evolved without intervention from intelligent life forms. Somewhere we don&#39;t have to terraform, we don&#39;t have to have generations of people inside a pod in space just to REACH the damn place. What are we doing to our home?<br><br>It&#39;s being destroyed. Quite deliberately. Fossil fuel is far from the most efficient source of energy, and it&#39;s been that way for almost a century. We&#39;ve known, to an accurate measure, since the beginning of the industrial revolution, what would happen if we keep burning coal and oil. <br><br>&quot;Civilized society&quot; is setting our world on fire.<br><br>The sound pollution from ships is eventually going to kill everything in the ocean of we don&#39;t stop. Certain parts of the ocean are going to be irradiated longer than humanity because of nuclear arms testing. You might think that&#39;s fine, since &quot;nothing lives there&quot; but for bikini island, that&#39;s not true. Indigenous people used to live there, and we&#39;re forcibly removed by Americans after world war 2. <br><br>&quot;Civilized society&quot; is setting our world on fire.<br><br>Industrialists, politicians, scientists and billionaires alike won&#39;t shut up about setting up a &quot;Mars colony&quot; as if that could ever be a good thing. What would /really/ be the purpose to a Mars colony? A Dyson sphere? Sure, it might be possible, but the possibility of technology is NOT the same thing as the best possible outcome. We&#39;ve had trains for hundreds of years now, but &quot;civilized society&quot; can&#39;t figure out how to stop using cars. We won&#39;t have trains and buses everywhere they need to be, until cars don&#39;t need to be. Same with a Dyson sphere. We have all the energy we need, why would we need to enslave the fucking SUN for our energy needs? <br><br>Technology follows society, not the other way around. Until we fix our societal problems, we will NEVER be able to achieve what humanity is capable of, because &quot;civilized society&quot; is SETTING OUR FUCKING WORLD ON FIRE. WE CAN&#39;T MAKE A DYSON SPHERE IF WE&#39;RE ALL DEAD. WE CAN&#39;T MEET ALIEN &quot;CIVILIZATIONS&quot; IF WE&#39;RE ALL DEAD. And this isn&#39;t some vague problem for future people, we&#39;re living through it NOW. WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT /NOW/. In MY lifetime ALONE I will be lucky to live 80 years without seeing everything die around me. <br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love technology and science, but like I said: it follows society.

America is coming to a similar process and we are approaching the timeline for it in the past, We are a young nation and most nations reaching 200 something years eventually ALWAYS One hundred percent fall by the same things we are facing, <br><br>I could easily see with all the new info on quantum mechanics , multiverse theory , new dimensions etc. preparing us for the things to come, A funny theory is that MOVIES have been easing us into it, And as of 2021 The UFO report came out admitting to it. It can be close guys. I&#39;m no conspiracy theorist, But I am a realist as ironic as it seems or out of place, But hey that is just a theory... A GAME THEORY! <br><br><br>Oh.. _crap is that meme dead... I&#39;ll go home now.. <br>Love will win in the end and our fighting spirit haha, We as humans aren&#39;t as dumb as they make us out to be, I truly believe that! We all should! Whatever they throw at us, We are the over-comers, and we shall over come!!! SORRY ABOUT THE PARAGRAPH --- If you made it this far you are a real one, thanks for listening!!! I wish everyone the best , People are learning and I believe those interested in this topic are not of this world , we don&#39;t take things at face value.

All humans on the face of the earth 100,000 years ago didn\u2019t all suddenly become farmers at the same time. That makes zero sense and is extremely unlikely. Look at the difference between Africa and the United States. We are living in the same time and look at the difference in not only civilization but how we have affected our land respectively. Secondly there is no way in hell there was a sudden boom where all single celled organisms just became multicellular. Science always makes false assumptions just to simply things or try to explain it without having proof. People believe all these scientific theories without even questioning the reality of the chances that it really happened that way. I have nothing against this channel I really enjoy watching and the animations are excellent. I just wanted to share my opinion and see if anyone felt the same way. Too many scientific theories and thoughts of the past are so wrong but people don\u2019t question it whatsoever. Just like assuming people went through evolution. Evolution would not affect all humans across the planet in the same way if evolution truly made humans into what they are today there would be MAJOR differences in humans as in different species of humans, humans in mid- evolution, and humans in far less evolved states. Yes you could argue the less evolved humans would have died out but it still doesn\u2019t explain how all humans are relatively similar. It would be the same for animals also. Lastly there\u2019s the whole argument about dinosaurs how scientists just assume what they look like based on what we find in fossils but no one knows exactly what a dinosaur really looked like and for all we know what we know of dinosaurs today could be completely wrong we could be throwing bones together in completely random ways that looked nothing like animals from the past and even if after everything that\u2019s been said and know whether the dinosaurs were real or not where the hell are all the in between species? If we find dinosaur remains where are the human remains from those time periods. People claim humans lived 10,000 years ago then they claim it was actually 200,000 years ago then they claim we had cousin species.. WHERES THE PROOF. So many things about our history don\u2019t make sense and until someone provides some absolutely concrete evidence that the past was how (insert scientist name here) claimed it was   I don\u2019t think people should be so quick to accept things as facts. Always use your own judgment and remember we all have minds we all have the ability to think and use common sense so believe what you want.

Water just has properties that stand in the way too much. The viscosity makes tool usage difficult because water resists the act of hitting things hard. The only tools that could work fine are spears, and knapping flint for spearheads is also difficult because of the viscosity. Water also stores more thermal energy, so seasons change the environment less, and the animal needs to have less ingenuity to survive harsh conditions, lessening the evolutionary pressure of developing more intelligence. Most importantly, however, fire is impossible underwater. Human brain development accelerated because of the invention of cooking. Outsourcing part of the digestive process to an external energy source made food release more nutrients in the body, allowing there to be more fuel for a larger brain. It is simply more likely for cephalopods to live comfortably in the state they are without becoming sapient, just like what sharks have done for millions of years.", "comment_date": "2022-03-07T21:23:12Z", "likes_count": 582}, {"comment_by": "Costlier Cart", "comment_text": "Love the music in the background!", "comment_date": "2022-03-07T21:20:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cernos", "comment_text": "dayum these graphics can make a civilization building game", "comment_date": "2022-03-07T20:14:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mogs", "comment_text": "Your motion graphics and animation is AMAZING!", "comment_date": "2022-03-07T20:14:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blue Spartan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRvv0QdruMQ&amp;t=3m26s\">3:26</a> Those faces don&#39;t really scream intelligence though \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-03-07T20:14:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ukballyhoo", "comment_text": "They would have depleted the mineral and hydrocarbon resources we are depleting now.

There is this really common idea that plastics will never degrade, but they are organic after all, organisms will(and have) found ways to break them down for energy. What might even happen is eventually organisms will thrive on plastics as they&#39;re an abundant food source, then as the amount of plastic in the environment dwindles, organisms will evolve to produce plastic as an energy storage biomolecule. While plastic is far less efficient in storing energy than fats, carbs, or proteins, the fact that organisms are already producing enzymes capable of breaking it down means there&#39;s a selective drive toward it. We might even eventually seen plastics incorporated into the polysaccharide layers that make up biotic colonies, then as those colonies specialize, they may become lichen-like. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if in the far distant future, there&#39;s even more plastic than there is today, since the aforementioned organisms would thrive, but diversify fast as it&#39;s an entirely untapped biological niche, something that hasn&#39;t existed in hundreds of millions of years. As these new plastic organisms thrived, the only thing that could break them down is more of the same organism or cousin species, meaning there&#39;s massive evolutionary pressures. As the diversity of plastic life increases, they&#39;ll eventually take over and there will be more plastic than ever before in Earths history.", "comment_date": "2022-03-04T22:44:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vadusnisky", "comment_text": "There would be evidence but unfortunately there isn&#39;t any whatever despite the slot you are suggesting.where&#39;s the evidence?", "comment_date": "2022-03-04T22:42:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dainn066", "comment_text": "History channel at 3am:", "comment_date": "2022-03-04T22:42:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CrispCentre", "comment_text": "The guy from ancient aliens watching this video: \ud83d\ude0f", "comment_date": "2022-03-04T22:36:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mirul Scott", "comment_text": "Another quality content \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2022-03-04T22:36:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Gibbons", "comment_text": "Weeeellll.... we do have extensive records of periodic runaway buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere followed by a sudden drop and an ice age.

The motion condemns the organ harvesting by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and urges the Taiwan government to implement laws to help end the atrocity. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Chang Chiu-ming, a member of Yilan County Council, said a motion was passed on December 24 against organ harvesting. \r<br>\r<br>When the 76th United Nations General Assembly took place in New York in September 2021, five nongovernmental organizations from the US, Europe, and Asia issued UDCPFOH on September 26, the last day of the World Summit on Combating and Preventing Forced Organ Harvesting. \r<br>\r<br>UDCPFOH has been supported by parliament members, government officials, and leaders from many countries. They include Changrok Soh, member of UN Human Rights Council, and Thierry Valle, director of European Federation for Freedom of Belief. It was also endorsed by Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University and the founding director of the Medical Ethics Division. \r<br>\r<br>The Taiwan Falun Gong Human Rights Working Group has since contacted the central government as well as county-level governments in Taiwan, urging them to support this initiative. The Group believes that by raising awareness to the general public and taking further actions, leaders from around the world can stop the CCP\u2019s organ harvesting through joint efforts. \r<br>\r<br>During an ad hoc session held by Yilan County Council on December 24, the motion was initiated by three council members including Zhang Chiu-ming, Chen Han-chung, and Tsai Chin-hui. To fulfill its human rights commitment, the motion aims to support the UDCPFOH, condemn the organ harvesting atrocity by the CCP, and institute related criminal legislation. For specific implementation of this resolution, the council requests the county government to contact relevant agencies of the Taiwan Executive Yuan. With 25 cosponsors, including Wu Hong-mo and Yang Tree, this motion was passed in the council. \r<br>\r<br>Chang said he was happy to see Yilan Council supporting the upright with this motion. Yang pointed out the CCP\u2019s brutality of organ harvesting is anti-humanity and it is a disgrace to mankind.

Satellites above low Earth orbits will basically stay there forever and so will any satellites we&#39;ve put in orbit of other bodies like the sun or other planets, probes and other stuff that we&#39;ve left behind on extra terrestrial bodies can also stay around for very long. Everything that&#39;s been left on the moon for example will basically have to be hit by asteroids to be removed and with how much we&#39;ve left and how low the rate of asteroid impacts is in our current solar system they&#39;ll basically stay there forever, immune to biological or atmospheric sources of decay. These things would be obvious tell tale signs of a previous industrial civilization and even if many of the satellites are destroyed due to Kepler syndrome it still wouldn&#39;t be difficult to recognize that these are artificial in nature. Any alien civilization that finds Earth before it is destroyed by the Sun will be able to spot and recognize these things and from that can easily extrapolate that there was once an industrial civilization on Earth, following the same logic given that it only took about 150 years from the invention of the steam engine to the launch of the first artificial satellite we can assume that any industrial civilization in Earth&#39;s past would probably have developed space technology and as such leave tell tale evidence in the form of satellites.<br><br>There&#39;s of course other things we can look at to say that there probably hasn&#39;t been any industrial civilization in Earth&#39;s past, for example our extraction of hydrocarbons in the form of coal and oil is very noticeable and we have almost used up the entire supply of oil and have significantly reduced the supply of coal. Given how easy these are to use to power machinery we can kinda reason that just because we find them in amounts that are only consistent with us being the first to use them that probably means that there hasn&#39;t been any industrial civilization before us. Our coal deposits for example age back to the Carboniferous and many of our oil deposits started developing in later periods. We know that oil would take at least a few hundred million years to naturally regenerate to our current levels and the kind of coal formation that happened during the Carboniferous can&#39;t really happen anymore so we can reason with a lot of confidence that there haven&#39;t been any industrial civilizations prior to ours.", "comment_date": "2022-03-04T18:35:06Z", "likes_count": 1327}, {"comment_by": "Oda Hime", "comment_text": "that Jotaro caught me off guard LMAO", "comment_date": "2022-03-04T18:34:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Fuscellaro", "comment_text": "When it comes to earth, I think even if human die off from our own wrong doing, the planet will always create some sort of life form basically until the sun dies.

There is significant geographical evidence of a global flood from an asteroid impact in canada when the ice sheet was miles thick. You can look at any map and see the light blue areas between the deep sea and land where 99% of prehistoric civilizations would have existed before the sea swallowed the land. There&#39;s also the evidence of continuity in the most ancient of religious stories across the globe. A lot of them describe cataclysmic flooding and weather events that parrot a description of an asteroid impact. There&#39;s also an interesting theory that the stories of &quot;people that came before&quot; are the retellings of retellings of communications between prehistoric people and the displaced people from those ancient &quot;advanced&quot; societies. Gobekli tepe predates every timeline for hunter gather society and it surpassed what researchers assumed they were capable of building. Some make the case that they inherited the structures from a much more ancient civilization. They make a similar case for the major structures of ancient egypt, petra and machu picchu.

Here is merely SOME evidence suggesting not only a human presence on Earth BILLIONS of years ago, but also suggesting complex human civilisations on Earth BILLIONS of years ago:\r<br>\r<br>* A human skull fragment from Hungary dated between 250,000 and 450,000 years ago\r<br>* A human footprint with accompanying paleoliths (stones deliberately chipped into a recognisable tool type), bone tools, hearths and shelters, discovered in France and dated 300,000 to 400,000 years\r<br>* Paleoliths in Spain, a partial human skeleton and paleoliths in France; two English skeletons, one with associated paleoliths, ALL at least 300,000 years old\r<br>* Skull fragments and paleoliths in Kenya and advanced paleoliths, of modern human manufacture, in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, dated between 400,000 and 700,000 years\r<br>* Neoliths (the most advanced stone tools and utensils) in China of a type that indicate full human capacity, dated to 600,000 years\r<br>* Hearths, charcoal, human femurs and broken animal bones, all denoting modern humanity, in Java, dated to 830,000 years\r<br>* An anatomically modern human skull discovered in Argentina and dated between 1 million and 1.5 million years (eoliths, which are chipped pebbles thought to be the earliest known tools, at Monte Hermoso, also in Argentina, are believed to be between 1 and 2.5 million years old).\r<br>* A human tooth from Java yielding a date between 1 and 1.9 million years\r<br>* Incised bones, dated between 1.2 and 2.5 million years, have been found in Italy\r<br>* Discoveries of paleoliths, cut and charred bones at Xihoudu in China and eoliths from Diring Yurlakh in Siberia dated to 1.8 million years\r<br>* Eoliths in India, paleoliths in England, Belgium, Italy and Argentina, flint blades in Italy, hearths in Argentina, a carved shell, pierced teeth and even two human jaws all bearing a minimum date of 2 million years\r<br>\r<br>Curiously enough, several of the very earliest artifact discoveries display a truly extraordinary level of sophistication. In Idaho, for example, a 2-million-year-old clay figurine was unearthed in 1912. But even this discovery does not mark an outer limit. Bones, vertebrae and even complete skeletons have been found in Italy, Argentina and Kenya. Their minimum datings range from 3 million to 4 million years. A human skull, a partial human skeleton and a collection of neoliths discovered in California have been dated in excess of 5 million years. A human skeleton discovered at Midi in France, paleoliths found in Portugal, Burma and Argentina, a carved bone and flint flakes from Turkey all have a minimum age of 5 million years.\r<br>How far back can human history be pushed with discoveries like these? The answer seems to be a great deal further than orthodox science currently allows. As if the foregoing discoveries were not enough, we need to take account of:\r<br>* Paleoliths from France dated between 7 and 9 million years\r<br>* An eolith from India with a minimum dating of 9 million years\r<br>* Incised bones from France, Argentina and Kenya no less than 12 million years old\r<br>* More paleolith discoveries from France, dated at least 20 million years ago\r<br>* Neoliths from California in excess of 23 million years\r<br>* Three different kinds of paleoliths from Belgium with a minimum dating of 26 million years\r<br>* An anatomically modern human skeleton, neoliths and carved stones found at the Table Mountain, California and dated at least 33 million years ago\r<br>But even 33 million years is not the upper limit. A human skeleton found in Switzerland is estimated to be between 38 and 45 million years old. France has yielded up eoliths, paleoliths, cut wood and a chalk ball, the minimum ages of which range from 45 to 50 million years.\r<br>There&#39;s still more.\r<br>\r<br>In 1960, H. L. Armstrong announced in Nature magazine the discovery of fossil human footprints near the Paluxy River, in Texas. Dinosaur footprints were found in the same strata. In 1983, the Moscow News reported the discovery of a fossilised human footprint next to the fossil footprint of a three-toed dinosaur in the Turkamen Republic. Dinosaurs have been extinct for approximately 65 million years.\r<br>In 1983, Professor W. G. Burroughs of Kentucky reported the discovery of three pairs of fossil tracks dated to 300 million years ago. They showed left and right footprints. Each print had five toes and a distinct arch. The toes were spread apart like those of a human used to walking barefoot. The foot curved back like a human foot to what appeared to be a human heel. There was a pair of prints in the series that showed a left and right foot. The distance between them is just what you&#39;d expect in modern human footprints.\r<br>In December 1862, The Geologist carried news of a human skeleton found 27.5 m (90 ft) below the surface in a coal seam in Illinois. The seam was dated between 286 and 320 million years. It&#39;s true that a few eoliths, skull fragments and fossil footprints, however old, provide no real backing for the idea of advanced prehistoric human civilisations.\r<br>But some other discoveries do.\r<br>In 1968, an American fossil collector named William J. Meister found a fossilised human shoe print near Antelope Spring, Utah. There were trilobite fossils in the same stone, which means it was at least 245 million years old. Close examination showed that the sole of this shoe differed little, if at all, from those of shoes manufactured today.\r<br>In 1897, a carved stone showing multiple faces of an old man was found at a depth of 40 m (130 ft) in a coal mine in Iowa. The coal there was of similar age.\r<br>\r<br>A piece of coal yielded up an encased iron cup in 1912. Frank J. Kenwood, who made the discovery, was so intrigued he traced the origin of the coal and discovered it came from the Wilburton Mine in Oklahoma. The coal there is about 312 million years old.\r<br>In 1844, Scottish physicist Sir David Brewster reported the discovery of a metal nail embedded in a sandstone block from a quarry in the north of England. The head was completely encased, ruling out the possibility that it had been driven in at some recent date. The block from which it came is approximately 360 million years old.\r<br>On 22 June 1844, The Times reported that a length of gold thread had been found by workmen embedded in stone close to the River Tweed. This stone too was around 360 million years old.\r<br>Astonishing though these dates may appear to anyone familiar with the orthodox theory of human origins, they pale in comparison with the dates of two further discoveries.\r<br>According to Scientific American, dated 5 June 1852, blasting activities at Meeting House Hill, in Dorchester, Massachusetts, unearthed a metallic, bell-shaped vessel extensively decorated with silver inlays of flowers and vines. The workmanship was described as &#39;exquisite&#39;. The vessel was blown out of a bed of Roxbury conglomerate dated somewhat earlier than 600 million years.\r<br>In 1993, Michael A. Cremo and Richard L. Thompson reported the discovery &#39;over the past several decades&#39; of hundreds of metallic spheres in a pyrophyllite mine in South Africa. The spheres are grooved and give the appearance of having been manufactured. If so, the strata in which they were found suggest they were manufactured 2.8 BILLION years ago.\r<br>\r<br>What are we to make of these perplexing discoveries? They cannot simply be dismissed. If even ONE of these discoveries is TRUE (and I believe that MANY if not ALL of these discoveries are TRUE), then it changes EVERYTHING that modern mainstream anthropologists THOUGHT they knew about the human species.", "comment_date": "2022-03-04T08:12:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cinfoni", "comment_text": "i find it wonderful and poetic how we humans, seemingly alone on the universe, guess what is going on out there?

Which means if we want heavier elements, we need to create them from scratch, which is very hard.  A simpler solution would be to simply find the right stars that produce heavier elements (which isn&#39;t difficult), and make a home there. If we want to leverage the benefits of those heavier elements on any large scale, we will need to leave our solar system and go there.

You completely missed a few additional concepts that are not unreasonable but bring us a lot closer to identifying intelligent life.<br><br>The first is scale. We clearly see evidence of moderately intelligent &quot;aliens&quot; in insects, like ants. Even an industrial insect hive society would leave an incredibly tiny footprint compared to our scale of thinking, and that would be difficult to find at best. Ants dig tiny underground complexes that, when the hive is gone, their living space doesn&#39;t last much longer. We&#39;d probably never find that even if it was happening today, let alone millennia ago.<br><br>I think you kind of touched on the idea of a form of natural industrialization. For example, crows use cars to run over nuts to make getting at the meat easier. I know, cars aren&#39;t natural, but from the crow&#39;s perspective, it&#39;s using a tool that already exists in what it perceives as its natural world. It doesn&#39;t see a car as a machine, the car is just something that exists and has a predictable pattern. We also share an &quot;us-centered&quot; view of the world (as demonstrated by the lack of mentioning such possibilities in this video). We see what we do and assume we can predict patterns of intelligent existence, such as scarring after we mine minerals. What if an intelligent alien could just use the metal without disturbing it, like crows use our cars? <br><br>Another form of intelligence we seem to completely ignore is shared consciousness. Just as the neurons in brains communicate via electrochemical signals, some lifeforms share intelligence outside of their own bodies via a variety of transmission techniques. I&#39;ll start with ants again as a good example: Ants leave chemical trails to communicate with other ants to help locate food and avoid dangers. Humans are just now entering an age of shared consciousness via the internet. I&#39;m not talking about some new-age spiritual consciousness, but rather a collection of individual processors (us) communicating with each other like neurons communicate with each other. I don&#39;t know if this super-consciousness will survive as it seems to be struggling. <br><br><br>Are there more?

Prehistory is fertile ground for the ancient alien hypothesis mainly because we do have the story of our deep past wrong.  This is mostly due to detection bias.  Do most of your digging in the two rivers region because you\u2019re curious about the Bible and most of what you find that is very old is going to be there too.  It\u2019s not logically sound to assume that because of that most old human activity took place there or that civilization began there.  <br><br>There\u2019s plenty of evidence to indicate that more was going on and much earlier than 3700 BCE, but right now conceding it is professionally toxic.  The reasons for this are that people have staked their careers on the current story, and two conceding we might have it wrong gives credence to people at the edges of our profession who\u2019ve been saying so for decades now.  Some of those people have good ideas, others very bad.<br><br>This is what I tell people who ask me about ancient aliens, when I\u2019m asked about it, which is very frequently: Have you seen Lord of the Rings?  Tolkien made that all up.  Have you seen Star Wars?  Lucas made that all up.  Simplest explanation is ancient peoples made it all up too.  <br><br>The next question I\u2019m always asked is why are the stories so similar?  And my answer is two fold.  First people moved around a lot and shared their stories.  Second, there are seed civilizations in antiquity that spread their ideas by war and conquest; and like it or not those ideas and stories are the ones that survived and became a part of our shared heritage.<br><br>Again, politics makes it professionally difficult to expand upon this.  Point out the similarities between Greek, Egyptian, and Hindu philosophy and someone is going to accuse you of diminishing Egyptian and Hindu history and promoting white supremacy.  Point out the massive role winning wars and conquest have had in shaping our civilization and feminists become apoplectic.<br><br>So yeah, I\u2019m a historian, doomed to answer ancient alien questions for the foreseeable future because my profession is institutionally committed to not really understanding the past very well.

Maybe they destroy themselves using ultra-powerful weapons.  Maybe they pollute their planet to the point where it&#39;s unlivable.  Or maybe they use up every resource until they can&#39;t sustain themselves anymore.  Given our own rate of advancement, it&#39;s not hard to imagine these things happening fairly quickly (in galactic terms), like within hundreds of years or less.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions .<br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment.

Mit dem Ma\u00dfstab, den wir andere anlegt wird man euch messen. Behandelt stehts andere wie wir auch behandelt werden m\u00f6chtet. Ein guter Baum tr\u00e4gt gute Fr\u00fcchte. Wovon das Herz erf\u00fcllt ist das spricht der Mund aus. Wenn dein Bruder Schuld auf sich geladen hat stelle ihn erst unter 4 Augen zu rede. Tut denen gutes die euch hassen. Wer sich selbst erniedrigt wird geehrt. Nicht den eigenen Willen suchen. Beispielsweise auch andere zum Festessen einladen die es dir nicht zur\u00fcck geben k\u00f6nnen.<br>Das sind nur paar S\u00e4tze wie Jesus uns die liebe zeigte, es gibt noch sehr viel mehr auch gibt es sehr tiefgr\u00fcndige Gleichnisse die Jesus uns lernte noch dazu die ganzen Wunder und Hoffnungen die ganzen Weisheiten die sich immer mehr vertiefen und und und. <br>Liebe ist geduldig und freundlich. Sie prahlt nicht und schaut nicht auf andere herab. Liebe verletzt nicht den Anstand und sucht nicht den eigenen Vorteil, sie l\u00e4sst sich nicht reizen und ist nicht nachtragend. Sie freut sich nicht am Unrecht, sondern freut sich wenn die Wahrheit siegt. Liebe nimmt alles auf sich, sie verliert nie den Glauben oder die Hoffnung und h\u00e4lt durch bis zum Ende. Die liebe wird niemals vergehen.<br>1 Kor.. 13 / 4-7<br><br>Hass f\u00fchrt zu Streit, aber liebe sieht \u00fcber Fehler hinweg.

It is really cool to think about the fact that our planet can wipe out the record of any civilization in what amounts to a small blip in the timeline of the universe.  Not only the ability to bury the historical record deep in the crust, but the earth&#39;s continued recycling of the crust is something of an endless resetting of what is happening on the surface.  It is not a stretch at all to assume that there have been many cycles of intelligent life over the last billion or so years.  One thing the video doesn&#39;t comment on is the fact that the human race has advanced at incredible rates in the last one hundred years or so.  The fact that we are on the verge of becoming a multiplanetary race with the efforts to begin a colony on Mars, when we were bound to the earth until the first recorded flight in 1903, it is incredible to think this could occur in less than 150 years.  Humans may be the first to live on other planets in our solar system, and may be the ones that are able to break free of the cycle of being wiped out and turned back to molten rock in our planets every refreshing of its outer crust.  What would be interesting is that if we are able to successfully make it to Mars and do some archeology that we find that we were not actually the first to make this trip.  Of course there could have been multiple intelligent civilizations on Mars as well, and who knows, maybe we are are the descendants of life that came here from Mars, or even some other planet in our solar system, or some other solar system.  It really is beyond our true comprehension how vast time really is, and what may have occurred before us.  We really tend to think in terms of hundreds or thousands of years, or even millions of years, but time is so much more vast than that.  What we understand and have seen is such a small blip in the historical record of our universe that we have likely not even considered how much has occurred prior to our consciousness in this great expanse.

We (logically) demonize war now, but \u201cwar\u201d itself, as the need to collaborate onto a common goal against the competition of others, may be among the elements that helped survive those more alert to absorb and pass the knowledge of their discovered advantages (and that could only happen if our brains were capable enough).  <br>\r<br>For us humans some argue that a climate change in the past forced our primitive more-chimp-like ancestors to venture into the savannas and take advantage of (more) dead animals\u2019 scavenger to later become hunters, but gave a huge energy boost to build a power (and energy hungry) brain. But that was one of many other events. <br><br>We are not even sure (so there are some theories) of why the agricultural revolution happened (may be once human expansion around the world was finally over, contending with other humans forced a more creative approach than the simplistic nomadic hunter-gathering on already occupied areas, thus forcing your land to yield that that you coveted on your own land, and hunger is a huge incentive for observation and invention). When growing plants was easier (and more food productive) than having to kill other humans for that hunting-gathering occupied rich lands elsewhere, then that may have been quite a revolution.

Actually I&#39;d bet my boys it won&#39;t even be too far in the future (geologically speaking). We aren&#39;t coelacanths, sharks, or squids; we are just turbo-monkeys.<br><br>Will homo sapiens go extinct? Yes, only the most arrogant of fools would disagree! To be honest I actually look forward to the day! You may think me some nut case or whatever, so be it... though if you&#39;ll permit me one question I  reckon ill convince you too:<br><br>Did the human species end with homo neanderthalensis? How about when homo naledi vanished? Homo heidelbergensis? Homo floresiensis?Homo erectus? Homo rudolfensis? Homo habilis?... Mkay, that was technically seven questions. I might have gone overboard.... but perhaps just two more?<br><br>Second last:<br><br>As we make our way along each branch of the evolutionary tree how has human existence changed?<br><br>Hint:Think quality of life, the wonders we&#39;ve discovered along the way, the ones we built, stewardship of the planet... I mean yeah there have been ups and downs but we&#39;re learning as we go. We are <b>TURBO-MONKEYS</b> for peet sake!<br><br><br>Just before I ask you my last question I want you to take a moment to look at your surroundings, <b>really look</b> at them. Perhaps, like me, your finding something to listing to as you fall asleep atop a bed in a nice warm house. Maybe that room, like mine, is painted a brilliant red... RED! I mean who coulda thought of such a thing... welllllll actually my mother dreamt that up \ud83e\udd23. She invisioned barn red paint, then she turned that thought into reality. Then there&#39;s the actual paint itself:<br><br>For almost the entire span of human existence my only real option would have been red ochre. Ocher is a sandy clay that contains ferric oxide, but when it contains a-lotta hematite it&#39;s a brilliant and almost pleasing shade of red(ish) brown...<br><br>Three and a half thousand years ago and provided I lived in India, I could have considered crushing up some rubia tinctorum roots, also known as rose madder. A quite lovely shade it is too, though a tad finger-stainie \ud83d\ude11<br><br>Then two millenia ago it would have been vermillion red, assuming I was which is a pigment made from cinnabar- aka mercury sulfate. Great stuff to cover the inside of your home with... actually I think lead (ii) oxide, aka red lead, was just starting to take off in Rome around that same time. Anyone up for  \u0336h\u0336e\u0336a\u0336v\u0336y\u0336 \u0336m\u0336e\u0336t\u0336a\u0336l\u0336 \u0336p\u0336o\u0336i\u0336s\u0336o\u0336n\u0336i\u0336n\u0336g\u0336 death...<br><br>Then around six hundred, maybe seven hundred..<br>ish....  years ago there were some absolute animals that&#39;s were crushing bugs to dye their clothes red. Count me out.<br><br>I do know that just a centry and a half ago alizarin we first synthesized in Germany. And I guess it&#39;s a little cool that its probably alizarin thats coloring my doors.<br><br>Thats enough about red, though you caught me red-handed: I&#39;ve read a lot about red, Red.<br><br>I just so happened to also glance at my favorite little buddy, Lee \u2764. Now his glass tank is made up of 9 pieces of float glass, which were made by combining river sand which could have come from anywhere (btw its just fine ground silica dioxide, this is the base glass structure) with soda ash (sodium carbonate, which is flux and lowers the melting point by ALOT), some limestone (calcium carbonate, gives it strength), and a pinch of dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate, for that pinch of &quot;more extra strengths&quot;)... oh yeah, and I seem to recall alumina (aluminum oxide) is in there, can&#39;t remember.<br><br>Anywho, those all get mixed together and put in a big @$$ crucible. But before the magic can happen someone, somewhere else had to shoot air cannons at the ground so they could listen SUUUPER  CLOSELY to how the earth raddles. That way they know where they sould start digging their couple-uh-miles-deep hole so they can recover the remains of creatures that lived half a billion years ago (thats 4% the age of the universe by the way). With their essence-of-earth-fart gas in hand they are nearly ready to go! They just have to add some essence-of-deadly-fart to it, ya know... for safeties sake...<br><br>So they take the earth-life-fart out of the ground, purify it so it&#39;s just methane which as we all should know is a highly flamibe, possibly explosive gas. Then they mix in some methanethiol, which ca  naturally be found in bad meat, good cheese, bad breath, goose death, and pretty much anything else that could be decried as &quot;pure stank&quot;. Guess I should also mention its slightly more flammable then methane... oh, and it&#39;s fair bit more explosive.... aaaaand its INCREDIBLY POISONOUS... AAAAANNNNNNNDDDD it once your in the &quot;danger zone&quot; your sense of smell and taste are the first things to go.... but don&#39;t worry: the irreparable liver damage, lung damage, kidney damage, skin irritation, comma, diarrhea, kidney stones, convulsions, soar throat, anemia, disorientation, pneumonia, brain damage, nerve damage, muscle damage, muscle weakness, palpitations, seizure, death, and slight eye irritation.... oh ya and if it gets into the sea it&#39;s like Fukushima 2.0 \u00d7 a billion. But on the bright side it doesn&#39;t cause cancer!<br><br>Anywho,.we take that Megadeth mix and blast it on that aforementioned crucible of sand. Eventually the silicon dioxide turns into MOLTEN BEACH LAVA! \u2122<br>   \u1d3e\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49\u207f\u1d57 \u1d56\u1d49\u207f\u1d48\u1da6\u207f\u1d4d<br><br>That beach lava is then floated across a lake of molten zink, which is collected by attacking rocks with lightning (or electrolysis if your lame)... then that post-floated-glass is cooled and cut, not necessarily in that order.<br><br>Those chunks of glass are then packed into a truck, or a plane, or a boat, or a comically large backpack, and sent anywhere from a few feet to more-than-one-earths-widths away where they get get stuck together with glue which, fun fact, is made of a polymer who&#39;s bade structure has the same elements and ratios as glass, it just gets a little extra stretch.<br><br>Once that&#39;s done it gets shipped literally around the world, from one factory, to a warehouse, to a store. Then, despite it being delicate, going tens of thousands of kilometers, and having countless look-a-likes... somehow when the store ordered 1 &quot;4&#39;x2.5&#39;\u00d718&quot; front access reptile enclosure&quot; they got it... despite hundreds of people, buorcrats, war zones, lions, pirates, train bandits, and lord knows what else it made it. For someone to purchase... that I then purchased from them because these buggers are EXPENSIVE, and I couldn&#39;t turn down a $50.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the devil&#39;s vine I&#39;ve got growing in there which is native to South Asia, the spider plant from West Australia, a Chinese Evergreen from New Guinea, a teenie Norfolk Island pine from Norfolk Island, and a Bonsai from Japan (which they stole from China).<br><br>Then there&#39;s the mesh top... it&#39;s from somewhere.<br><br>The bulb has more of that lovely red pigmentation we talked about earlier, it&#39;s also got a tungsten wire (which probably came from Vietnam or China), a brass fixture (China), a plastic bit (China), a glass bulbular shaped bulb (China) which has aluminum (China) electroplated (100% China) on the interior for efficiency... oh and it&#39;s also filled with a gas that was extracted from the atmosphere.... which is accomplished by two hair-pin-trugger hydraulic pumps pushing and pulling a few helium balloons worth of helium back and forth. Yes, that&#39;s actually how its done.<br><br><br>And then there&#39;s my love himself, Lee. He&#39;s my labyrinth het snow red tail boa. He is absolutely gorgeous, a gem to hold, hes super curious, and odd as it sounds he loves people! He &quot;surfs the room&quot; as I call it. He chills with someone for a bit, then reaches out to get hold of someone else and chills on them for a bit before moving on to someone else. Probably good he&#39;s chill af because some people FREAK when he tries to get on their shoulders... I get it though. After all it is a 7 foot eating machine coming at you from behind when you least expect it \ud83e\udd23.<br><br><br><br><br>Now I reckon its about time for that lest question... think about all we&#39;ve done, all we can do. I mean I&#39;m just some random 26 year old college drop out working a dead end job, not exactly &quot;the pinochle of humanity&quot; material... even so I&#39;ve found time to learn all that and a half trillion other bits and bobs. I may not be the best our species has to offer, but I&#39;m still going to <b>try</b> .... my question is this:<br><br>If we all tried to be the best damn human on earth do you think we could make homo sapiens go extinct a little bit quicker? The sky is the limit my friends. Keep fighting, keep growing, keep learning, keep pushing; cuz one day you&#39;ll push-off and find yourself amongst the stars. Being a turbo-monkey is great and all, but we godhood is just around the corner.

This concept is often associated with Easternized philosophies/spiritual beliefs which of course will eventually be appropriated by Western culture like yoga and meditation have already been.

Unnatural radioactive elements could possibly be undetected since they could&#39;ve been decayed into non-radioactive elements in the millions of years passed, or they&#39;re just somehow be detected as naturally occurring, or the ancient civilization could very well have used radioactive elements that cause practically no radioactive pollution, like hydrogen fusion.  It\u2019s also worth noting that (as I heard from some other sources, please correct me if I&#39;m wrong as the info I got was mixed) there\u2018s a blank interval of about 100k years in human history, which almost no evidence of human civilization/tribe/group was found.  Considering modern humans are anatomically surprisingly similar to ancient humans, and (relatively modern) humans took only about 10,000 years to go from basic agricultural civilizations to our modern technological super-empires, it&#39;s not very convincing that humanity didn&#39;t advance much between that 100k-year time period.  Also, think about the ancient civilizations, like the Sumer, the Egyptian, the Chinese, etc.  We aren&#39;t that far in the future, but far enough that we don&#39;t know much about them and thought of them as far-behind or underdeveloped (don&#39;t know the right words), yet archaeological results tell us that they&#39;re surprisingly advance, sometimes even to a point where not even modern technology can (easily) replicate or explain.

Now that\u2019s a genuine feature (evolution) but somethings missing.. can never place my finger on it, but there is a gap in humanity\u2019s time thts a missing puzzle piece &amp; unfortunately bc the globe is a giant molten bit of rock, wae a bowling ball iron core, a halo shielded nearly 8 billion monkeys kicking about on it, with no goal. There\u2019s gotta to be a little bit extra other than we\u2019re \u2018just in this moment and no more\u2019. We\u2019re never gonna find out those missing links, genuinely that\u2019s a loss on everyone\u2019s hands as the past will tell us of our future (I believe); yea we can read disaster events and actually predict them now-a-days but to hold something and say it\u2019s a hell of a lot more, than it looks is the goal on learning more n there\u2019s plenty to learn where we all really came from. I know it sounds out there but maybe mars could\u2019ve been our chemistry lab or home until not suitable. All of Mars\u2019s soil still has 2% water after 2-3 billion years??

Exploring inside the vast wreck, they find in the debris a large semi-circular plate of some unknown hard metal that proves that the ship came from Mars. And they also find what seem to be the descendants of  the Martian expedition that servived the crash- Revolting dwarf mollusk men- Round, boneless humanoids, alien and malignant,  that suck the blood out of any living animal they swarm. Armed, the explorers keep the boneless monstrosities  at bay.  The explorers plan to immediately return to civilization with with the Martian plate, but one man is killed by a poisonous snake, and the other just barely makes it out of the jungle alive, catching a fever and  loosing the Martian plate in his desperate struggle to survive the journey out. Proof gone, nobody believes his story, thinking it nothing more that a fever induced delirium. Later, after he&#39;s recovered, the explorer  realizes something disturbing-  The disgusting boneless things living on the isolated plateau aren&#39;t the Martians-  They&#39;re Earthmen,  the descendants of the few survivors left after the shipwrecked Martians and their fecund progeny took the Earth away from them.

The level of confidence in such statements about how rapidly certain signs of civilisation would decay or blend into the background are too high in my view. Already your &#39;facts&#39; on 300k year old humans doing absolutely nothing but hunt and gather until 10k years ago are disproven by the historical sites in Turkey, particularly the famous Gobekli Tepe where megalithic sties were built 11.5k to perhaps 14k years ago.  Even that 300k year date was very recently pushed back from only 200k years which was believed until the past decade or so...and that 300k number itself may end up getting pushed back further when we find more evidence.  Even in the robustly explored areas of early human habitation in Africa, one of the most studied places on Earth, we continue to find out new things.  This &#39;presentism&#39; of our current knowledge is a very limiting perspective where somehow the channel comes across as though we&#39;ve reached the end of knowledge through overconfidence in expression of quite temporary &#39;facts&#39;.<br><br>The ending of the video is also very strange where you make the very error your saying not to make...a lack of evidence is not the same thing as evidence of lack.  The world is enormous, landscapes and biomes have changed, and relatively little of the Earth&#39;s geology, much less the ocean&#39;s geology has been explored to look for such signs, if they can be found at all without fading into the background.  Many a small scale agricultural society with pottery and even primitive metal usage could have emerged with all evidence wiped away over time with our currently limited technology and scope of examination.  <br><br>How much of the currently underwater continental shelves which used to be above water when sea levels were much lower have been explored?  How many core samples, drillings, or other attempts have been made to seek out artefacts of human habitation in such places? Would our current methods even work?  the slow and careful process of years using tiny picks and brushes from terrestrial archaeological sites clearly are not applicable in the ocean. the answer is very little of this area has been explored, despite it being the absolutely most likely places for such prior human civilisations to exist, not to mention deeper layers which might contain traces of non--humans from tens or hundreds of millions of years ago.  Far too much certainty and confidence is put into this &#39;lack of evidence&#39; without acknowledging we also &#39;have not even looked&#39; yet.<br><br>If we say &#39;evidence is impossible&#39;....then say &#39;don&#39;t think about it&#39; that&#39;s just baseless speculation.<br><br>Kurzgesagt has created an impossible standard and encouraged us to close closed our minds to evidence you did not consider? There are many forms of evidence other geology where one might dig up a stone tool, including a large number of anomalous genetic findings we have yet to explain with many genes connecting far flung populations.  Connections which might be explained by there having been global sea faring societies in our distance past.  How else could genes from Europe be found in Australia and New Zealand going back 30k or 50k years without any connecting genetic lines showing migration in between, far too many and genetically similar to have so many odd variants co-evolve by chance....yet there would have been and currently are quite reasonable sea routes for some ancient Greek technology level global civilisation with a few peaks and valleys in their capabilities compared to the ancient Greeks.  <br><br>Even today with Wade Davis&#39; work and documentaries we have see the wayfarers show us it does not take advanced tools or knowledge to navigate vast swaths of the ocean.  The channel would make do to step outside of establishment knowledge bases in order to consider other ideas, even if you discard them it would be far better to show some process of consideration and debate of ideas than to express apparent ignorance of key archeological insights over the past 30 years.<br><br>We know for a fact many cataclysms affected humanity over our 300k year history.  Without evidence does not mean we can know nothing as we can reasonably infer things based on our own example.  The idea that humans did nothing at all for 290k years and had no rises or setbacks in technology, agriculture, building, animal husbandry, pottery, stone tools, etc. is itself the more preposterous idea.  The ruinous effects of time are severe and we know processes of geology and changes in sea level and habitable landscapes which would make it extremely unlikely for us to find anything.  <br><br>What we DO HAVE is evidence that people were anatomically the same for nearly 300k years...with perhaps some major changes in the 40k-50k year range.  It is quite possible people truly made no advancements at any point in our history, but through what is known we can reason it is more likely that pockets of civilisation emerged and were wiped out.", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T03:32:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shashou", "comment_text": "The wise refer to them as \u2018fallen angels\u2019", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T03:32:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abhishek Baba", "comment_text": "Noice \ud83d\udd25", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T03:32:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Yash Holkar", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRvv0QdruMQ&amp;t=00m38s\">00:38</a>  <i>the BEST intro</i>", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T03:32:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jimmy Chevelle", "comment_text": "One thing about other intelligent life, it seems to reason they would have to have a hand of some kind of how could they build things.

I found it surprisingly difficult to find any direct analysis of ultra long term perturbations for satellites in geo orbit (I think because the math is extremely sensitive what with the 3 body problem, and there is no compelling reason to invest the computational resources to analyze something so sensitive and so trivial). Also, my orbital mechanics is admittedly rusty, but given perturbations like lunar gravity, solar gravity, solar photons, and the solar wind, I don&#39;t see a reason to expect all of a prior civilizations geo satellites to decay in at least a few hundred million years (anyone reading this with direct experience in eon timescale orbit evolution, please weigh in as I&#39;m really curious about this one). <br><br>Similarly, the moon doesn&#39;t have plate tectonics, vulcanism, erosion, or any other weathering processes besides solar photons and solar wind. To my knowledge, most moon rocks are about 4.5 billion years old (i.e. roughly the age of the moon). We have pretty complete maps of the lunar surface and we haven&#39;t found anything seemingly synthetic. So either we&#39;re the first ones there, or whoever was there before us did an incredible job of cleaning up after themselves.<br><br>In light of both of these factors, I think we can put a pretty strong upper bound on prior civilization technology as &quot;at least not space faring&quot;. That is to say, as far as I can see, humans have likely gotten the deepest into the tech tree for any beings that have lived on this planet so far (obviously excluding the dolphins and the mice).", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T02:45:32Z", "likes_count": 54}, {"comment_by": "Someone Random", "comment_text": "Uploaded and immediately #2 on trending lmao<br>I&#39;m right under 2 mil views as of viewing this", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T02:45:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "emraan fahim", "comment_text": "in past there was civilizations that too modern even we didn&#39;t past them (said in alquran )", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T02:44:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Labib Rahobar", "comment_text": "aliens wont find out chicken bones , bcz i ate and chewed chicken bones.........", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T02:44:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Varun Steven", "comment_text": "Great video but...

They had comparable lifespans and reproductive rates to humans. So if we ignore the infant mortality in each and focus on the number of adult and subadult skeletons we find, we would expect T. Rex to be making around a 400-ish dead per year. Let&#39;s call it a billion T. Rexes to ever die as adults.<br><br>Well, homo Sapiens already have a hundred billion dead. Even if you discount infant mortality, there&#39;s still at least tens of billions of humans who have died globally. A healthy number of which would be in all three periods of human existence.<br><br>That number will go up by billions before the average viewer of this video dies.<br><br>Ergo, a hundred or so million years from now, we should expect every continent to provide at least a dozen complete fossil skeletons from humans of each time period. Probably quite a bit more though, because humans often bury their dead, which, while it doesn&#39;t guarantee fossilization, may make it more likely.", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T01:34:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antonio Santana", "comment_text": "When I think my imagination went wild and thought about something no one else has, KGST has already made a video on it.

It&#39;s not that we are 100% sure that ancient aliens didn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s that, in over a century of research, there has yet to be any clear evidence for such a phenomenon. We become frustrated by ancient aliens theories because such theories often contain significant logical fallacies that are invisible to many people that aren&#39;t actively researching the past. This is because our work contains lots of details that are often spread across hundreds of kilometers of sites, and only connect to give us fuzzy details about a society&#39;s cultural variation and patterns. For example, studying pottery fragments from different sites can tell you the specific clay mixtures used to make a specific type of vessel, or the sequence of steps used to produce that vessel. Variation within these techniques at a single site can tell you how many pottery workshops there might have been and whether or not we have some kind of standardization. These link together between sites and give us a picture of how their pottery economy might have functioned in the past and how it might have linked to other crafts. This is extremely important for understanding how long-term climate shifts may have impacted these societies, since the subsequent layers often represent adaptations of older techniques (depending on the time and place).<br><br>If you were to research the Middle Paleolithic (starting ~50,000 years ago), this suddenly becomes far more complex because you can&#39;t tell if your deposits are contemporaneous. For us that are researching the Bronze Age, layers can represent centuries, but in the Paleolithic, layers can represent several millennia. People used to be hunter-gatherers, and a well-preserved cave deposit could represent 5,000 years of use that all appear to be a single layer. This means that Paleolithic archaeology and Paleontology both require a lot of attention to details because tiny microscopic differences can be incredibly meaningful. The reason that nobody thinks we had ancient civilizations at this time is because despite all of this attention to detail, nobody has found anything that would indicate this", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T23:03:09Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "PbZeppelin", "comment_text": "I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a super intelligent race of dinosaurs formed a society, developed life extension technology, and hid away in underground safe zones to escape planetary catastrophes.

Take iron for example, natural native iron is almost exclusively found in meteorites. I presume any post-Iron Age equivalent society would leave behind relatively high concentrations of pure iron in particular places, which wouldn&#39;t fit with a pattern of meteorite impacts. <br><br>Also, whilst fossilisation requires niche conditions, preserving cut gemstones or carved stone isn&#39;t anywhere near as difficult.

As can be seen by numerous extant examples and significant university studies to the contrary, the dating of modern human habitation sites around the world are still maintained as beginning  in the 7th millennium BCE.  That there are numerous religious sites which date many thousands of years older indicates that the desire to maintain a narrative is more important than getting the actual chronology correct.  Archeology has become so politicized that science takes the back seat.  A great example is the dating of the Sphinx.  It is fascinating that every single monumental work of ancient Egypt displays the general ratio and proportions of a design ethos and the relative structural component relationships of animals and people.  Yet, the Sphinx is a creature that is so disproportionate that it forces any objective observer to conclude that the head was reworked from some more ancient form and into its current form.  That the stone work shows signs of weathering consistent with its construction 4000 years earlier than accepted by the Egyptian Board of Antiquities just means that the studies by experts in Geology are unimportant compared to politics.  <br><br>Second, having a city does not not mean it is durable.  Let&#39;s  use the fossil record as an example.  You know there are deer in the wooded area by your home.  You walk the woods often.  In your entire life you&#39;ve never seen a deer carcass not the skeletal remains of a deer.  There are reasons.  But here&#39;s the point.  If, 250 years in the future, all deer gave died out, no one will ever believe that deer existed in your present location because in the future no one can find their remains.  So, remains do not last...nature reacquires them.  <br><br>There&#39;s a great show called life after people.  One of the great takeaways from it is that our modern cities would be largely turned to dust within a few thousand years after our hypothetical disappearance.  The most ancient habitation sites around the planet point to at least 20 millenia BCE.  Therefore, any prior civilization would have existed well before that....that is pre-glacial melt.  That is more than enough time for them to turn to dust. <br><br>Third, there are about several million square miles of land area that were slowly lost following the last glacial maximum.  If any people formed cities then they would like us have populations heavily skewed to coastlines.  Therefore, any remnants of those cities are buried under massive quantities of silt and are under 300 to 400 feet of water.  We are looking in the wrong place. <br><br>Thankfully, the internet is available to help the ignorant.  But only if they know to do research first.", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T19:26:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GaraxyAurora", "comment_text": "Is that a jojo reference?! go go go go", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T19:26:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ram\u00f3n Elias Toro", "comment_text": "Maybe some Ooparts are objects left behind", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T19:26:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omar", "comment_text": "That new Kurtz dropped \ud83d\ude2e\ud83e\udd13\ud83d\ude80", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T19:26:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Capit\u00e3oPa\u00e7oca", "comment_text": "Why isn&#39;t anyone talking about Jotaro on the screen at the end of the video?", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T19:26:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Bianco", "comment_text": "Jomjo", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T19:26:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Zhang", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRvv0QdruMQ&amp;t=10m35s\">10:35</a> HoLy ShEeT iS tHaT a JoJo ReFeReNcE", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T19:25:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tylor Mobley", "comment_text": "This was an amazing video but I have a suggestion for a future one.

The Voyager and Pioneer probes along with New Horizons and other probes that have been given enough energy to escape the sun&#39;s gravity will orbit the Milky Way more or less forever and if you had a hand in constructing any of these incredible machines you will have achieved a sort of immortality that is very rare.<br>     You see, we each experience 3 deaths. There is the personal death. That is the death of our body. Then there is the death of the last person who knew us, and finally, though it doesn&#39;t actually involve anyone dying, there is the destruction of the last trace of our existence. It could be the destruction of the last record that we existed, say when the name on our tombstone finally becomes illegible, or the last object we had a hand in creating is destroyed by time. <br>      Some will live longer than others with this 3rd life. For example, Narmer, the earliest Egyptian Pharaoh we are fairly sure actually existed lived more than 5000 years ago, yet the woman who was the mother of the guy who made Narmer&#39;s first bed was probably forgotten not long after the death of her last grandchild.<br>      Does it make you feel insignificant to realize that in 200 to 500 years not a trace of your ever existing will be left anywhere in the universe?<br>     Consider the people who matter to you.

We humans evolved from a prey species and I think the discovery of fire was essential, it gave us the upperhand in the animal kingdom, that was the click in our brains we can change the enviroment and fire has so many uses that simply opened many doors to us, after all we are still a civilization based on fire technology, if fire wasn&#39;t possible on earth I think we would be still be very primitive right now. And migrations of early humans was very possible because of fire, I don&#39;t think moving around bare feet for kilometers is possible without fire.<br>We can make an imagination exercise and compare amish people to nasa people, amish people stopped by various reasons to farm life while others strive to go the stars, this is diference between humans and other animals, being always hunted and weak made us go out of comfort zone and learn things, like fire. This is why I think evolution of species is doomed if the enviroment is comfortable and advanced civilizations are the 0.000000whatever1% after life emerged and adapted to survive, to be an interplanetary species you can add a million zeros to that number, if somehow the solar system doesn&#39;t contain an exotic material that does the magic for fast travel or at least hints to it.<br><br>I am glad you keeping in the science real, Graham and his fanboys like Bright Insight.

I think agricultural era can be moved 10-5k years around, people didn&#39;t started planting from day 0, like we count our christian calendar. And the amazing stone works, like pyramids are the great achievments at the end of stoneage era, which any of these &quot;scientists&quot; forget to mention is when the actual stone age ended, because by my educated guess, ancient egypt is still stone age, Fred Flinstone stone age, not monkey igning fire with stones stone age. This is a bit of venting, people too hyped up in ancient civilizations boil my blood because they tend to act like a cult, somehow like flat earthers. Everything in the history of humankind is credited to humans in their time frame.<br><br>This is all my educated guess, I have very sturdy hype breaks.

Gobeki tepe TOTALLY destroyed the hunter gatherer narrative of ending around 5 thousand years ago. It&#39;s a mega structure that was built some 12 thousand years ago.

And for you to sit and say that they&#39;re would be evidence if so, and then turn around and say if we were to have an event all evidence would be destroyed.

Talk about being accepting of everyone but yet these corrupt institutions ostracized religion for putting a sense of responsibility, and morals into people.

But it&#39;s worth considering that it is a view that is based on 1) mere speculation  by European philosophers in the 16th and 17th centuries, and 2) on lack of archeological evidence to the contrary.<br>Well, archeological and anthropological evidence has been steadily piling up over the past 100 years which suggests that the lives of our hunter-gatherer ancestors were far more complex than we imagined. Instead of small, isolated bands of inbred egalitarians  (or witless pawns under the yoke of a tribal chief) scratching out a meager existence, humans 50 000 years ago were doing pretty much the same things as humans are today, except with simpler tools and materials that have long since turned to dust (mostly). So, far-reaching trade and contact over thousands of miles, complex social institutions and relatively monumental architecture built by huge numbers of coordinated labor are all present in pre-agricultural times.<br><br>A book that synthesizes much of this evidence is &quot;The Dawn of Everything&quot; by Graeber and Wengrow.

So to just dismiss it because &quot;woo-woo&quot; is stupid.<br>What people dont understand regarding archaeology, is that what we find, and CAN find, is less than 1% of 1% of what existed.<br>Billions of T-Rexes and their close relatives existed during their time, across a few million years. Yet we havent, nor can ever, find billions of intact skeletons. We&#39;ve found a few hundred at best.<br><br>The fact that we find ANYTHING AT ALL from past human civilizations such as the sumerians, is simply because they&#39;re so close in time, relative to the age of the planet. And we dont find 100 thousand arrowheads, we find a few dozen, and make estimations based on those finds.<br>Think to yourself how many arrows bows and swords must have existed in the ancient world, think about Xerxes army in Persia, several hundred thousand strong, each one with a pristine sword, spear or bow.<br>We dont find 100 thousand swords, we cant ever find that, because 99.9% of them have eroded or become lost to time.<br><br>So just because we dont find any evidence of a past civilization, does not mean they didnt exist.<br>What is even remaining for us to find and make any conclusion based on, is a fraction of a percent of what actually existed back then.<br>And the further back in time you go, the fraction diminishes exponentially.<br>People dont realize this, they think we&#39;ve found millions of velociraptor skeletons. We havent. We&#39;ve found a handful.<br>A handful out of billions that existed during those ancient eons.<br><br>And just because we cant find or prove it, doesnt mean we should just ignore any thoughts about it.<br>There&#39;s a common misconception about the mainstream scientific principle which is &quot;if you cant prove it, it didnt exist or isnt worth speculating about&quot;. Which is entirely wrong. Speculation is healthy, it opens the mind to possibilities that are currently unknown and unproven, but might become proven with enough effort in the future.<br><br>If gallileo didnt speculate about distant worlds, he&#39;d never have built his telescope.<br>Speculation is not the antithesis of the scientific principle.<br>It&#39;s what feeds its direction for decades to come.<br>As long as we remember that speculation is possibility, not evidence.<br><br>And of course this applies to interstellar civilizations as well.<br>No matter how pessimistic, OR optimistic you are about CURRENT living civilizations in the galaxy, there simply must have existed far more civilizations than CURRENTLY exist, simply due to the passage of time, and how the past is always a greater &quot;volume&quot; than the present.<br>We&#39;re not only interested in finding currenly alive civilizations, we&#39;re also interested in finding xenoarchaeological artifacts from the countless of previous civilizations, drifting through space. And that&#39;s where most of the volume will lie, in the ancient derelict artifacts, not in the current functioning living technologies.<br><br>When you seriously sit down and think about this, and do the math (adopt the drake equation to factor in migration and colonization, as well as multiply the end number by how many civilizations must have become extinct in the past), you realize that something like Oumuamua actually being a relic, is not implausible to think at all.

Is it something that brings revolution or it\u2019s just a delusion?<br><br>A new religion has evolved in the global culture. It\u2019s called Scientism. Even though modern science has absolutely nothing sensible to say about the reality we live in, the general population is convinced that science has explained away the need for God and religion.<br><br>Scientific theories like abiogenesis and evolution, even though they are pure and unalloyed myths, are being taught in all educational institutions of the world as scientific facts.<br><br>Who has decided that technological expertise is the best way to measure our ability to understand the reality we live in? Those who are influential in defining peoples&#39; realities - the producers, scientists, the media, politicians, etc. -- have made technological advancement the barometer of human progress. They claim that the advancement of technology is the most noble pursuit of the human race, that it has made the world a better place to live in.<br><br>As proof, they list all the consumer gadgets we use and are dependent upon - computers, cell-phones, televisions, DVDs, cars, and so on - and say that the intelligence to build these things shows that we have advanced our understanding of nature and how she works far beyond our ability in the middle ages.<br><br>But is this assertion correct? To build a computer, one certainly requires advanced knowledge of physics and chemistry, but these disciplines describe only a tiny part of the reality we perceive. A far greater part of reality is our conscious experience of it -- something most people don\u2019t even think about.<br><br>Few people ponder the fact that their understanding of the world is conditioned by the culture they grew up in. They automatically take it for granted that the way they perceive the world is the correct one, and that nature is best described in physical and chemical terms.<br><br>Modern science is very useful for making technology, in fact, it\u2019s the only thing it is good for, and when we live in a world where the masses are kept in awe and reverence of technological wonders, science is, of course, a most important undertaking.<br><br>But the jubilation of modern people over the newest technology is no different from the gaping wonder with which people in the middle ages looked upon sorcerers and magicians firing off sulphur and gun powder. The magicians did this to dupe their audiences and secure their comfortable hold on society.<br><br>In the middle ages, in the West at least, the regents of society kept people in ignorance so they were easy to control and manipulate, and today the exact same means are used to enslave people in ignorance. In the global culture the slaves have just been upgraded to a middle-class with their own house and car.<br><br>People still slave their lives away in boring jobs and are marred by the same endless worries and miseries, people have always suffered from. They are still being ground down by taxation, victims of greedy politicians, exactly like they\u2019ve always been.<br><br>There is no basis for saying that advanced knowledge of mathematics and physics enables a person to better understand the world any more than the cave dweller of some 2000 years ago who worshipped nature and various gods.<br><br>If the modern culture is based on a better understanding of the world, why is it ruining nature and her inhabitants at an alarming rate? If modern man is more advanced in his understanding of nature, why is he sawing the branch he is sitting on?<br><br>Despite the so-called advancement of modern society, people are till not able to transcend their mental conditioning. The proof is that modern society does not produce people with evolved consciousness. Rather, we see the exact opposite taking place - in direct proportion to the advancement of technology, people have become more and more base and idiotic in the way they treat and relate to each-other.<br><br>Some years ago, WHO published a report saying that the biggest health crisis facing the world in the new millennium is that more and more people will be born with mental defects. Is that the symptom of an evolved society?<br><br>Society, as it is, is not equipped to facilitate self-realized human beings. What need does a self realized person have for the plethora of useless products being produced by the few conglomerates that control world consumerism? Such enlightenment would indeed negate the necessity for the technological advancement upon which the world&#39;s finances now rely.<br><br>That is why, in the current global culture, a deliberate campaign exists to transform people into atheists. In such a culture, religion is being ridiculed and has been replaced with politics. Instead of voting for a particular religion, the public now votes for politicians, who are mostly hired by those multinationals with the biggest checkbooks -- all in the name of serving the people, of course.<br><br>The modern, global culture has already made the whole world into one big marketplace - a worldwide altar where technology is worshipped as the new opium of the masses.<br><br>Being fed endless propaganda from Hollywood where technology saves the day, we quickly forget that technology, despite assurances to the contrary, cannot save us from the onslaughts of nature. Time and time again, technology comes up short in the fight against nature.<br><br>The new high-priests of society, now clad in white frocks instead of black, fail to comprehend how the mechanisms of nature work. And how could they? They also suffer from the misunderstanding that everything is dead matter, and are restricted by the assumption that their knowledge of physical laws can explain the world.<br><br>Yet more important than understanding how physical matter works is the understanding how consciousness, false ego, intelligence and mind work. These make up a much greater part of the reality we perceive. As long as we fail to understand the difference between matter and consciousness, we cannot even be said to have evolved beyond animal consciousness.<br><br>That&#39;s why atheism is dangerous - it keeps the consciousness trapped in a 3-dimensional world of matter. It keeps the self from its rare mission in the human life form - to understand consciousness. It cultivates a perception of life where the consciousness cannot see itself - a deception where the self being absorbed in matter forgets itself.<br><br>Every individual is duty-bound to alter their consciousness and connect it with the whole - Sri Krishna. While Srila Prabhupada was a nitya-siddha, he was also a social revolutionary, as was the Lord he served - Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. The political correctness that predominates in the world and passes as social etiquette should not stop us from assisting him in his mission - to silence the atheistic class of men, and to inundate the world with Krishna Consciousness.<br><br>Krishna says:<br><br>The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.<br><br>The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another, as the air carries aromas. Thus he takes one kind of body and again quits it to take another.<br><br>The living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of ear, eye, tongue, nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He thus enjoys a particular set of sense objects.<br><br>The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this.<br><br>The endeavoring transcendentalists who are situated in self-realization can see all this clearly. But those whose minds are not developed and who are not situated in self-realization cannot see what is taking place, though they may try.<br><br>\u2014 Bhagavad-gita 15.7\u201311", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:32:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shaunak Jayashree", "comment_text": "&quot;Indigenous aliens&quot; created  existential crisis for me lol.", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:32:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nilika perera", "comment_text": "10 :32", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:32:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Calory_Consumr", "comment_text": "dayum, 31 minutes on youtube, and already almost 2k comments", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:32:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nishio Shigure", "comment_text": "Ah another great video to get into existential crisis.<br>Also, Jojo reference!", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:32:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate Ruiz", "comment_text": "I was worried you&#39;d go the way of the history channel-", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:32:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DEXZACR", "comment_text": "right.. too much maybes", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:32:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "KimoNova", "comment_text": "It&#39;s interesting to imagine that intelligent life could&#39;ve developed on Earth independently numerous times, it would change everyone&#39;s perception of reality if there were any", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:32:02Z", "likes_count": 545}, {"comment_by": "proximo", "comment_text": "Your videos are getting better", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:32:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hindus Lack Unity&Shatrubodh \ud83d\ude4f", "comment_text": "&quot;Shree, Venkatesha Charanam Saranam Prapathye&quot; \ud83d\ude47<br><br>Shree Venkatesha : I&#39;m going to stand here on the tirumala hills forever to protect my devotees in this unholy Kali yuga.. <br><br>For a devotee who have complete faith in my holy feet am here to take care of him/her and his/her entire family during all the times they pass through the problems of this inhuman world.<br><br>As long as my devotees have complete faith in me I will not allow the flood waters of this Bhava Sagara ocean of problems go beyond their hip level&quot;.", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:31:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nilika perera", "comment_text": "10.32", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:31:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hopin8krzys", "comment_text": "Arent some satellite orbits really stable, like potentially billions of years on the same course?

We also know species that were very sturdy, even moreso than us, could also just be wiped off. What we have, though, is technology that gives us an edge. Why do we not invest in a way to give everyone protection against the most catastrophic events that we know can and will destroy us. <br>Here&#39;s how I see it. There are a few things that we can never protect ourselves from if we do not just escape it. These are meteors, a black hole appearing and the moon getting yeeted. If our atmosphere goes, we can go underground and make life grow there. Have what little oxygen we can muster and keep the species going, maybe even keep it from extinction if we&#39;re lucky. <br>As for any cosmic event like a massive solar flare that destroys our magnetic field and burns us, we can make a magnetic field if we ever invest in technology to create magnetic fields and even maintain them. Earth quakes we can just create massive machines that counter attack the quake to cancel it out (this one is theoretic by nature, I personally don&#39;t know enough about plate tectonics to make any suggestion on how to deal with them. Like I said, this is how I see it). Lightning we already have solutions for. Tornadoes are the same principal as the magnetic field. Just find a way to control the atmosphere and boom, climate change done, wind? nah. Tornadoes? what are those? We can literally become masters of our planet. We can do that NOW.<br>All we need is the right investment and no power politics in our way. I&#39;ve already invested into neuralink for instance because I believe in a future where mankind is mixed into it&#39;s own tech. I think with it we can control even ourselves to such a degree that we could become literal gods of our planet. Probably not others though what with the confirmation of aliens being a thing post 2020. And I&#39;ve heard stories of pilots seeing objects straight up ignore laws of physics.
