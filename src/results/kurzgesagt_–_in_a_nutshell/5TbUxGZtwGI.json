While 5.8% doesn&#39;t seem that long at first glance, considering many conditions necessarily for life may not exist earlier and that you can only possibly fit 100% / 5.8% = 17.2 of such segments in the universe, it appears pretty long to me.<br>Secondly, the time it takes for the first intelligent species, (almost certainly) aka humans to emerge from the evolutionary history of life on earth was incredibly long. Life on earth was at least 3.77 billion years old, so it takes about the same length for humans to evolve from the earliest instance of life (human history is so short in billion scale). This is a much larger portion of the universe&#39;s span, 3.77 / 13.7 = 27.5%. So more than a quarter of the universe&#39;s life it took to incubate life for human to emerge.<br>Lastly, the window of opportunity is pretty narrow considering the future. Since the condition necessary for life will soon be gone in roughly 1.5 billion years when the sun becomes too hot, that means had humans not exist at present, the life on Earth only have about 1.5 / 3.77 =  40% of time it already spent for the intelligent life to emerge through evolution. In order words, the life on Earth used a sizable portion of its entire possible period of existence for intelligent life to emerge.<br><br>The second and third point is more convincing. Let&#39;s think about it this way. Getting intelligence life is like rolling a dice or something. Had intelligent life been pretty common and easy to create, then most life in the universe would have taken very little time for intelligent life to emerge, and there&#39;s plenty of time left for it to continue to evolve. So either we humans are a rare case of intelligent life, or intelligent life itself is pretty rare, so the only once we get from rolling the dice is something that took so long and barely had anytime left. So in this sense we are extremely lucky. I think the latter scenario is more likely.<br><br>There may be some more serious statistics analysis done about it in research papers, but above is my rudimentary thoughts, and that kinda solve the fermi paradox as well.

Scientists should at least come up with a nice understandable, believable model or theory explaining the region beyond that point in spacetime. Instead, it has come up with the same creationist argument as Christianism, or many other religions, except that it excluded the role of a creator. Not very original, imho! It says that spacetime arose from nothing by itself, but it&#39;s very much contrary to our experience (and our thinking, too) that time and space can ever start and cease to exist without any cause, or external interference. Self-ceation from nothing is very difficult to explain! If, according to the theory, there were only quantum fluctuations at that point, that means that definitely there was something, and the quantum fluctuations had to have a cause or origina, which means that there had to be something before that, too, if causality was valid at that point.<br>Whatever the case, science has a great debt to pay back to humankind! Humanity is on its way to get rid of their gods in favour of science, and still, it cannot explain the origin of our Universe.<br>More seriously, I think that this lack of understanding has to do with the fact that physics and theories are just theories that can never completely describe the real world, which is infinitely more sophisticated.", "comment_date": "2022-06-30T20:42:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kirb", "comment_text": "It was 8 years, now 4 years ago, where is the history and future of everything  remastered remastered", "comment_date": "2022-06-30T19:11:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheElevenFirst", "comment_text": "i asked my crush out after this but she said no \ud83d\ude25<br><br>ima try again next time though never give up", "comment_date": "2022-06-30T06:18:06Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "marlenedesu", "comment_text": "Sad to learn that Celino Jaramillo passed away not too long after this video posted.

I think a better ending to this video would be that all of this is based on knowledge we have been able to acquire so far (the key terms being SO FAR), otherwise why even bother caring bout what we do in our current time? because if existence would stop forever (which is honestly a questionable statement to make) it would all be meaningless regardless of whether you give it an arbitrary one or not. \r<br>Who is to say there is no way to save the universe? who is to say there is no way to traverse into another universe? who is to say that we can&#39;t create our own universe? or manipulate it? the possibilities are pretty much endless. We can&#39;t be arrogant and say that we already know everything there is to know about existence and then presume we know what happens at &quot;the end&quot;, new knowledge can easily shake anything we know about existence, for example knowledge on the origin of the big bang will change the outlet of physicists at a remarkable way, lets be honest, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time we got something wrong, hell so far we have made estimate observations of the universe at approximately 46 billion light-years radios from earth, and estimated that its 90 billion light years in diameter from earth, but we don&#39;t even concretely KNOW what is within 1 million light years radius from earth, hell some of us are still wondering if there is life on mars, hell we aren&#39;t even aware of all species living on earth TODAY. So while it is an interesting theory I have to reject the premise, both on account that I&#39;m not comfortable with it (not gonna lie lol) but more importantly on the basis that knowledge is incomplete, hell FAR from complete I would say.\r<br>We could still use our time to pave way to a generation that can possibly evolve to ways we cannot even comprehend or imagine. Imagine in 1 million years our successors develop time traveling? or inter dimensional rifts by some illogical means? truth to the matter is we don&#39;t know what will happen, only make predictions based on what we can comprehend. What really matters is what you do with your time right here and now with the little time YOU have left, feel free to make whatever choice you can and know that it has meaning, hell ask that girl or guy out you like, who knows? your union might pave way to something greater, or maybe you will die a lonely virgin who&#39;s body will become substance to something that may in some way contribute something to something, even if you or your offspring from many many generations could disappear in the endless sea of time, at the end it definitely was not meaningless. Until we at least figure out how the universe began I refuse to believe that we know what will happen to us, life or even existence.", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T14:57:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ample man", "comment_text": "who still wants to live forever?", "comment_date": "2022-01-04T05:25:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alex Oakley", "comment_text": "Does anyone else get a little teary from Kurzgesagt videos?", "comment_date": "2022-01-03T23:39:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "imispeaks", "comment_text": "I tried..

After 50 years or more The future people will have their memories turned into a code or some sort of message or energy than can be sent back to the past state of the time capsule when its created. The time capsule reads this turns this in a memory potion which people in the past can drink thus gaining the memories of the future owners. \r<br>\r<br>Two huge problem is figuring out how to sent a message to a computer years back. As for that, I dont know.(Maybe we can create 2 time capsules, One on a planet or location that has a slower time?). And how turn a memory into code and vice versa, but maybe in the future we can have a computer with that ability, or only turn IMPORTANT memories into code and forget about useless ones.\r<br>\r<br>Also im just 16.

There is also pyramid dating pre Ice-Age (20 000 years old!) called Gunung Padang in Indonesia, this is huge as &quot;modern&quot; archeology tells us that first civilizations originated around 4000 BC. We might be species with big amnesia and there is a lot of to learn from our past ancestors. There is tons of hard scientific evidence confirming this; I recommend for everyone who is interested in this to listen to people like Randall Carlson, Graham Hancock, Robert Schoch or Anthony John West. It makes be very sad that these people are being labeled as Conspiracy Theorists as we speak now while closed-minded archaeologists like Zahi Hawass are being put on pedestal.

Also if we die and don&#39;t have a second life, all of our loved will be forgotten and all of our happiness and joy and success... is meaningless because it won&#39;t matter and you will just a blink of an eye in time; all the suffering in the world that has happened in history won&#39;t be justified and the millions of babies being killed by diseases seems to be sad. Many people who starve won&#39;t be happy amd they will die in suffering. Even if our bad memories be forgotten, good memories will not be remembered and the drug users and all people suffering from diseases are unhappy and will die worthless. Imagine this for a moment: all of the great wars like WW1  and WW2, the cold war and the napoletic wars..., the diseases that has killed millions of people like the Black plaque, malaria...

Religion will always be with human history no matter the scientific advancements because even science can&#39;t answer the core question that started every everything. If science can&#39;t answer what happened before existence or what happens after existence, it can&#39;t provide a reason and the cause for existence itself, rendering god as the only possible solution. (we can&#39;t figure it out, so let&#39;s say some supernatural that&#39;s out of our understanding created us)<br><br>2. Just like how the world has its beginning and an ending, humans do as well. I believe that since the birth of the universe and the birth of humans were at different times, the death of each would be different as well. And I also believe that death of humans would be caused by humans just like how the birth of humans were caused by humans. And death is inevitable as long as there is birth. <br><br>3. The reason for all the political debates is essentially because of speed as to how fast we change, or how fast we age as humanity itself. The logical and rational way is to stay conservative and stay alive as long as possible. The natural and innovative way is to be progressive and let the natural take us all. Simply put, there is no right answer. All has reasons. All has purpose. All contribute to reality. And the flow of reality is out of our control. <br><br>If that doesn&#39;t make you worthless IDK what would. Personally, this just makes god more believable.

But at the same time, what about the law of conservation of mass which states \u201cmatter cannot be created or destroyed\u201d which in this case ruins our whole theory (specifically the Big Bang part) But still even if we take out the part where there are endless cycles of \u201cbig bangs\u201d we will still be in some giant cycle because after everything \u201cdisappears\u201d elements and atoms form together to make more complex mixtures such as celestial bodies, therefore meaning that there can never be \u201cnothing\u201d because every time a star or celestial body \u201cdies\u201d or \u201cceases from existence\u201d more will just be formed again from wandering elements, because that\u2019s how they are made, AM I EVEN MAKING ANY SENSE????", "comment_date": "2018-04-10T23:29:17Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Delvin Lora", "comment_text": "You forgot to mention the universe was created by a bear and a goose.", "comment_date": "2018-04-10T23:28:40Z", "likes_count": 219}, {"comment_by": "hue br", "comment_text": "O t\u00edtulo  est\u00e1 em portugu\u00eas", "comment_date": "2018-04-10T23:23:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A2Matos", "comment_text": "From nothing cames everything, the everything goes to nothing, now repeat that in some different possibilities.

MV firstly sorry for my bad english i will try to tell you why something such as &quot;nothing&quot; cant/dont exist. 0 is equal to nothing. There was only 0 at start. But 0 <b>is</b> a thing since i can talk about it.lts paradoxally both a thing and nothing.(if you understand please keep reading) we are 3 dimensional a flat surface is 2 dimensional and a line is 1 dimensional. Before existance there was nothing which means 0 dimension and 0 dimension is a dot. A dot is so small that it does not exist. What can fit inside of a dot? Nothing can. Think about  the sentence before this sentence. it does not tell you everything can&#39;t. It says 0 can fit in 0. 0+0=0. If we were to try fitting matter in dot (or universe which is a dot yet) that matter would not fit. But dot would be full. And matter inside dot(such thing is impossible btw)would not stay as matter because a dot cant contain matter. (Since 0 plus 0 is 0 this dot has dots in it. This dot is  also inside of itself.) So there is a thing in this dot  So a will p\u0337o\u0337w\u0337e\u0337r\u0337 will exist. Will is not matter or energy or perceptible or anyhow. Also immeasurable or infinite. So this is how god exists i think. And then he creates time and expands dot into a universe. And expands is  suddenly because why wait? lol so  big bang occurs.

Essentially,  it&#39;s impossible to say that this is the oldest person,  but also impossible to say the opposite - not without adjusting what we are willing to accept as proof. To give an example,  I recall a few cases from a few decades ago - a few from rural china - where people had documentation,  but it was so old that the people reviewing the paperwork had never seen it before and assumed at first it was a forgery. Of course k even if they were older I have no way of knowing if any of them are stilp alive. On the flip side,  if we accepted such proof it would be fairly easy to fake.

But what&#39;s also crazy though is that human knowledge is exponentially increasing and the technologies. Once we have our first artificial intelligent &quot;species&quot; of robots, its game over. Knowledge will EXPLODE especially because this is no longer limited by human capabilities, and from here on out it seems likely that AI&#39;s will be making all the discoveries. Assuming AI&#39;s can have morals like humans and be nice to us, then our human race is in luck. There exists things that are unexplainable or things we can&#39;t even comprehend especially at the moment of how certain things function in the universe. With exponentially increasing knowledge, we should have an ENORMOUS amount of time to reach our limits and know just about anything and everything in our universe. Who knows, maybe we&#39;ll be traveling to other universes that are young to keep our species alive forever. Of course it&#39;s still a theory, but if existence just came out of existence through the beginning of existence, who&#39;s to say everything that came to existence has been existing for eternity and us humans won&#39;t ever be able to comprehend why things have ended up the way they are now or how existence is born from [whatever] its caused from. With our knowledge expanding exponentially, who&#39;s to say in hundreds of millions of years from now we discover one of the deepest secrets of the universe ever that would seems to defy all logic and physical mechanics to create existence from &quot;nothing.&quot; Its certainly not impossible if we assume it does exist. If we exist and our universe exists now and came from a singularity, maybe we are able to harness and create singularities and universes and &quot;create&quot; energy in ways we could never have comprehended in today&#39;s age but in millions of years our species would be EXTREMELY different if we can manage to get through all of this mess of climate change and potential nuclear wars. Eventually our knowledge and technology will level off and no longer be exponential and it is then where we will know everything ever including a reversal of entropy. No more new questions could possibly exist unless the one we are asking now still does. If that is so, then yes, humans and the universe will cease to exist and nothing, not even time, will exist anymore which means we&#39;ll never find out how the universe was created.", "comment_date": "2018-04-09T18:33:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V GAMING \u2764\ufe0f", "comment_text": "how many people work in making this phenomenal videos...please mention them too and to this channel youtuber please do a draw my life.. please man !!", "comment_date": "2018-04-09T18:33:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "firexgodx980", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t believe life has existed on earth for that long, holy shit", "comment_date": "2018-04-09T18:31:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeb Garcia", "comment_text": "I mourn for Nova Roma", "comment_date": "2018-04-09T18:31:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Georgie", "comment_text": "Yay!!!

But if a Big Bang happened once what stops it happening again?. I kind of think that there is an exo universe, just infinity if nothing, and when a Big Bang happens it creates a universe, which is the limit of what we can do, the universe has all the space it needs to expand, and shrink. This exo universe is a sandbox, we can\u2019t venture out of our universe. Maybe that\u2019s how there can be more than one universe.I\u2019ve got a question though, recently we discovered an Icarus star 9 billion light years away, so because we are seeing 9 billion light years into the past, the Star is only in its early stages of development. What if we looked 13.5 billion light years away, what would see? The edge of the universe? Can the universe only expand at the speed of light or faster? Did the Big Bang happen at the speed of light? Is there faster than the speed of light?

So far we know  that we cant create matter. Thats probably right but just because we cant doesnt mean someone or something else cant. We know that before the Big Bang there was no matter, right? And we cant explain where it came from. So maybe the Universe can create matter. That would explain what was before the big bang: There was a Universe just like now just it was already dead.
