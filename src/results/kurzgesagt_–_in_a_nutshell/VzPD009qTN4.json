I was hurt and depressed so I was too curious and wanted to try Dr. Hazim , then i contacted him through his email when i contact him, he assured me 100% that he will heal me, i pleaded with him to help me out. My treatment was a great success, he healed me just as he promised. he sent me his medication and ask me to go for check up after 21 days of taking the medication. i agreed with him i took this medication and went for check up after 21 days of the treatment, To my greatest surprise my result came out\u00a0 negative after the treatment, I&#39;m very happy that i was cured and been\u00a0 healthy again. I waited for 3 weeks to be very sure if I was completely healed before writing this testimony. I did another blood test one week ago and it was still Herpes negative. so i guess its time i recommend anyone going through Herpes, HSV-1 or HSV-2, HIV, HPV, Hepatitis B, Diabetes, Cancer, ALS\u00a0 to contact this great man through his Email (usmandrhazim@gmail.com) OR add him up on whatsApp\u00a0 +2349058026857Thanks Doctor Hazim Usman", "comment_date": "2019-11-12T16:32:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Botato the dev", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzPD009qTN4&amp;t=6m15s\">6:15</a> <br>WTF", "comment_date": "2019-11-12T12:14:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Micah", "comment_text": "I wish this guy was my science teacher my science is boring , but not you", "comment_date": "2019-11-11T10:27:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carol Thompson", "comment_text": "I think you mean more sensitive to insulin instead of less!

Maybe, and hopefully, a way to get rid of antibiotics entirely. We already know that antibiotics are failing because we&#39;re relying too heavily upon them. Sure, it kills bad bacteria, but natural selection is at work, killing the weak bacteria, while the strong bacteria survive, becoming immune to each new iteration of antibiotic that needs to be made, until eventually we&#39;ll have super bugs that are immune entirely.<br><br>Antibiotics are, of course, non organic. It can&#39;t evolve or adapt, it needs us to keep making newer and more effective versions. Maybe we&#39;ll be able to get microbes to fight the bad bacteria. Unlike medicine, it won&#39;t simply go away. It&#39;ll be in our system, breeding continually as all organisms do, fighting bacteria. If the weak microbes die, the strong microbes that survive will pass on how to defeat bacteria, and rid it from our systems every time it tries to invade. If a new, stronger form of the bacteria comes along, again... weak microbes die, strong microbes survive, they pass that information on<br><br> It&#39;ll be anti-bacteria, and eventually through human procreation, we too will pass it to our children, eliminating the need to vaccinate or otherwise implant the bacteria-killing microbes.<br><br>This thought was spurred on because I knew about planting good poop microbes into other people who&#39;s gut flora was way off, but I had no idea it could be used to fight c difficile. It&#39;s what caused my grandfather to pass away earlier this year. He contracted it I think two or three times while in hospital, and each time he was given antibiotics, but I think they were failing him due to what I explained above, the fatal flaw of antibiotics. I wonder if he would still be alive if he had a fecal transplant instead of antibiotics... honestly, I couldn&#39;t say either way. He also had Alzheimer&#39;s, and it was pretty far along, and who knows what else may have contributed to his death.

I can tell when I&#39;ve kind of got off track somewhat as I tend to slow way down and am on the tired side.

In doing this, they also prevent allergic disease. Some believe that the reason people in &quot;developed&quot; countries are more likely to get allergies is because we take anti-helminth medication to expel them from our bodies. In &quot;developing&quot; nations where people are more likely to have helminths, people are much less likely to have allergies (about 1/3 of the world&#39;s population is infected by helminths and MOST of them lead symptomless healthy lives).  I know what you&#39;re thinking &quot;correlation does not equal causality&quot; but studies done involving the removal of helminths have found that children in developing countries  often don&#39;t develop allergies until after they&#39;ve had helminths removed from their bodies (sounds pretty causal to me). Obviously helminths can cause their own diseases if they get out of control (or if its a particularly pathogenic one) but everything in moderation right?", "comment_date": "2017-10-05T16:25:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tfolkedahl", "comment_text": "I&#39;m always super excited when a new kurzgesagt pops up in my subscription box", "comment_date": "2017-10-05T16:25:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "StrohhutBuddha", "comment_text": "Mhh, interesting...

However to my knowledge, people who are overweight tend to have lower insulin sensitivity (aka Insulin resistance), not thin people. This is why obese people have a higher risk of diabetes, their pancreas needs to produce higher amounts of insulin due to them NOT being sensitive to insulin, and it eventually tires the pancreas out. Medical student here, just wanted to put in my 2 cents.

I guess that would explain my negative first experience having avocados.<br><br>I didn&#39;t get to try avocados until I was in my mid twenties when it came as a side on a meal, and the first time it really upset my GI tract. I didn&#39;t really care for the taste that much so whenever I ordered that main dish I would just have a nibble of the avocado, but over time I noticed that it stopped messing with my digestion and I actually began to grow fond of the taste and texture. I suppose that when you try a new food you run the risk of it not appealing to the gut bacteria that you have at the time, and that, on the other hand, you can luck out by already having gut bacteria which happens to be able to handle the new food if it&#39;s similar enough to something you typically eat (which originally cultivated that bacteria). <br><br>So, as long as the bacteria you already have happens to also be interested in whatever new food you&#39;re about to try, you&#39;ll be fine. Which makes me think: if you&#39;re a picky eater, it&#39;s probably in part due to a vicious cycle, because if you were to have a more diverse diet, your microbiome would be diverse as well, meaning more chances that you already have a kind of bacteria that&#39;s compatible with whatever you&#39;re about to try. I&#39;d be interested in seeing this hypothesis tested. <br><br>Would a picky eater get GI distress more often than an adventurous eater when they&#39;re both trying new foods? Do picky eaters statistically have less GI stress if they&#39;re slowly introduced to new foods in smaller portions rather than binging on their first taste? I wonder if we could find out which foods have more bang for your buck, so to speak, by cultivating a set of bacteria that is as versatile as possible, so people prone to GI distress can have more jack-of-all-trades bacteria in their arsenal. I&#39;d bet that people with GI distress more often than not have a great deal of unitasker bacteria.", "comment_date": "2017-10-05T16:17:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonatan Mendoza", "comment_text": "I used to be able to drink till blackout and wake up feeling actually refreshed like a good long night of sleep even if it was less than 6 hrs.
