They aren&#39;t conspiracy theories, governments of the major world powers have admitted on several occasions that they are already doing this and it disrupts the jet streams causing massive climate change. It&#39;s not just gas powered cars and militaries, it&#39;s the existing geo engineering thats effecting the climate, as well as increasing rates of disease like lead and mercury poisoning, heart disease, Alzheimer&#39;s, and of course cancer. It&#39;s why wildfires, draughts, and groundwater evaporation keep getting worse. Nothing good will come of this and we must stop them from doing it before they kill us all. Like we all can admit we rely on the sun to live, so blocking it out will help no one. It&#39;s vaguely suggested in religious texts from a multitude of Bible type writings as well as Dante&#39;s inferno that blocking out the sun is part of &quot;Lucifer&#39;s&quot; plot. I understand if you don&#39;t believe in Lucifer but can we at least accept that the people who wrote those stories are the ones who started this and their descendants are the ones in power today, and they&#39;re doing all the evil shit they said they would using the Bible as some sick way to make people overlook it and accept it as though it&#39;s somehow a divine plan rather than a manipulative human plot for world domination?

Target areas over 100\u00b0 and reduce temperatures to say less then 90\u00b0. Do local and regional territories. If there  are problems, just stop and let the dust settle out, this should be a stop gap program to give cultural and technical change on earth to take hold, things like electric cars and solar and wind power have more time to develop.

Direct Air Capture is very difficult with the diffuse air and it is so much cost in capital to capture air. You might as well find a higher concentration of CO2 from CO2 neutral fuels like biogas from anaerobic digesters that can also pair with making biochar from the waste heat of the thermal power plant.

Carbon neutrality is and always will be a pipe dream, the truth is to stop climate change radical changes to our economy have to happen _right now_. Literally anything less will result in irrevocable damage. The only problem is, those changes would harm the economy enough that we&#39;re talking about an equivalent loss in life anyway. The economy is more than just &#39;more money so we can be richer&#39;, it&#39;s production, logistics, and consumption.<br><br>We don&#39;t have the production in lithium to replace fossil fuel vehicles with battery powered. Even if you made them all illegal today, you would be talking about halting shipping of things like food and medicine across the country. Outlawing fossil fuel energy production would cause electricity costs to skyrocket, to the point that anyone even close to the poverty line would be unable to afford it and vital infrastructure would go dark.<br><br>If you wanted to do all of this with minimal loss of life, the only option is to nationalize every production industry. Otherwise, profits will drop so hard that those businesses will just fire 90% of their employees and move on to other industries that generate more profit (as large corporations always do when the economy tanks) while small businesses would be left to die.<br><br>And all of those points are just about first world countries like the US and Europe, the loss of life in third-world countries, and transitionary/recovering economies like India, Russia, and China would be in the hundreds of millions, perhaps even edging into the billions. As those countries industrialize (or in the case of Russia, recover production), they require cheap, plentiful energy and logistics, and lots of it. This is why China and India are the greatest polluters in the world, _they literally do not have the economic means to switch yet_.<br><br>To get third-world countries and developing/recovering economies to switch, would either require a miracle or military force.

Yet myself and others have watched our skies being sprayed for 10 plus years by dozens of planes all day and at times even through the night; and not flying regular flight patterns. We knew they were doing something, as the trails were absolutely no regular &quot;contrails&quot; and we were all ridiculed. Further more the government and professionals denied all this for years but, now all of a sudden its a &quot;present/future plan&quot;. I was never one to think or feel it was to poison our soil, water and bodies directly; though who knows the effects it has had for years and will have. I did know that they were trying to deflect and reflect the Suns heat for so called global warming, but I also felt it may be also for blocking the Suns spiritual light (consciousness, emotions, mood, mind) to our Planet and bodies too. I wonder the effects of years of this going on to our vitamin d intake, consciousness, energy bodies, plant and tree growth and ocean life growth too; and much more. Most people dont even look up at the skies and when they do, they are blind to seeing anything unusual to them; this is like a conditioning of a tech type consciousness and the poor food they eat and more.<br><br>I saw Space X has been blasting away at this so called solar geoengineering, by launching vast amounts of satellites and plans to put about 30,000 plus into low atmosphere; along with a few other companies doing the same. So tons of satellites beaming down radio waves to earth based receivers daily and coming through the  &quot;work&quot; of the sun blocking projects, the daily use of fossil fuels and other harmful chemicals and so on. Seems very counterproductive on all levels. We have the tech to build war machines, satellites that send and receive, space stations, mars trips and so on; yet we dont they dont even care about this Planet and all its inhabitants. If they did, they wouldnt worry about money and they would make sure the tech would be updated and free energy across the Planet, energy thats clean and green and beyond any wind mills and solar panels. Everyone would have clean food and water, clothes and shelter and everything would be done from a pure loving heart-mind unified.<br><br>Everything is energy, that is how we live before even food and water, because our consciousness fills our physical bodies with the energy and power to run. Call it soul, but the soul is an energy form of our body that holds the consciousness and awareness in it. If it was cut off or tuned out, you would not exist. Food and water keeps the physical body going, but our bodies are designed to run via energy; the energy that initiates the start  up of our brain, heart and nervous systems. If we cleaned up our bodies, minds, opened our hearts and understood true spiritual-science; we would not need almost all the foods, comforts and tech we have. We would be more advanced, live simple, yet have more health, wellness and spirit-tech as our bodies are the greatest biological tech the Creational Source has created. We just need to tune into our heart centers and unified mind as one unit via unconditional love for self and all of creation. We have to be like nature and less tech, as tech interferes with the natural frequencies of our Souls consciousness and awareness; as well as the natural frequencies of the earth and all upon it. Like one big collective energy consciousness and even physical power too. Our bodies are basically the ground receivers and transmitters of consciousness, awareness and energy, that we receive from our Source, all its extensions stepping down the energy and also the Earth itself. We may be more conscious then animals in the sense of being able to create, but they dont ruin the planet via greed, money and profit. They dont take more then then need and they actually live from their hearts far more then these Humans who rather spend and create tech to control things from their other techs and systems that are causing the damage in the first place. <br><br>Ancients civs have come and gone, some evolved far past our state of being and without the mental mind alone and damaging tech; others have been less evolved and lived peacefully that way, like those tribes people of the world today. They built massive structures of the earths stones and sand for spirit-science reasons and most still stand today after thousands of years; some going back over 10,000 years. We build with steel, metals, wires and such, that corrode in decades and harm the soil and other life. Some things dont corrode for a long time and then they cause massive damage when they do; like the ddt and others dumped in the ocean and landfills. We make foods with chemicals and such while others dont even have food to eat. Our civ is far from the natural state of being of those ancients or the tribes people of today and far away from the natural frequencies a flow or harmony of nature and our Souls higher consciousness and awareness. Away from Loves Intelligence and Wisdom of Light of Consciousness and Awareness. To those of you who have noticed the spraying and mass planes for years and all those who do their best to live in their hearts and to live with love and compassion for all lifeforms; may that love raise you and those around you up higher. To those of you still joking around and ridiculing or living mostly unconsciously, may the loving light within you awaken to the natural loving and aware Being you are. We are a spark of the Creator -Sources Light of consciousness and awareness, of intelligence and we are an extension, direct connection and expression of all that love and intelligence within. Awaken that spark by healing, loving purely and natural upon healing and tuning into all the natural frequencies of nature on earth and within your daily lives. Uplift others and be uplifted, inspire others and be inspired to do the pure and true; for Love is Truth and Truth is Love and together is Freedom and Liberation of lower energies and consciousness or behaviors. Let your healed heart minds be unified to feel and know the expanded awareness and evolve consciously with each breath and embody more of the loving light within by doing so. Love one another and always assist each other or be assisted, the separation has to stop and we have to come together. Dont be afraid to face and heal your wounds and pain and when we all stop running from our inner pain, we can love like this easily and we turn things around so fast; as consciousness of the individual and collective embodies the higher light of loving intelligence. A love that does everything for the greatest good of all of Creation and all upon this Planet. Happy Mothers day to all of you Mothers and to the children you created. To create life and to create it at higher embodied consciousness, awareness and sacredness of love; is the greatest gift, blessing and ability given to US and all lifeforms.

Aliens left crop circle images with a spiral starting from the bomb in Hiroshima 1945 and ends in 2048... 2050 is also the year that the computer (search the video on youtube) predicted that the quality of life, which is at a peak now, will diminish once our resources diminish which will be by 2050... it can&#39;t be a coincidence. I will be nearly 50 years old and ill be ready for the inhumane things we might have to do. &quot;Much pain but still time&quot; is what the aliens left in the crop circles. But the media won&#39;t talk about it. It also said something along the lines of &quot;we do not condone trickery&quot;. They also have left many images of our seven shakras in those same fields. They&#39;re on our side. The news has just released footage of unknown spacecraft. Not only that but in 1948 after Hiroshima, the greys hovered over Washington DC and its literally in the newspaper!!!!! They said &quot;we cannot say that these were spacecraft, but we cannot say that it wasnt&quot;. They&#39;re hovering over Washington bcuz they bombed japan!!! They asked the US to hand over our bombs in exchange for their technology and medicine but the US refused and they have been leaving messages In those fields for a reason. A WELL KNOWN  military leader in Iran even said Trump knows about Mars and how there&#39;s Americans and aliens meeting there. There&#39;s legit news articles on it just search it up. We need to make large corporations take accountability for all the pollution they are producing. Somebody left tons of barrels of toxic waste here in Southern California Long Beach area and guess what. Nobodies doing anything about it cuz the system is so corrupt. Thats why we just gotta bring back the nooses. Like they did in that one country where the boat blew up from fireworks.

But there is time, so they have two options: Either they try to steer the spaceship away from the planet, which will take a lot of effort and money, and will require everyone on the ship to push on one side, but the scientists are confident this will work with less drastic measures and consequences than the second option: blowing up the planet. Sure, everyone might continue their usual life, but the risks are immense: the planet may not blow up, the explosion may even fling a part of it directly to the spaceship, damaging it even further.

That is a HORRIBLE idea from thermodynamics perspective. You DO NOT want to add more junk to air at high altitudes. There is a reason air is very cold at altitude. As air rises, it expands and cools. Conversely, downwards air currents heat up. A pressure differential leads to an almost fixed temperature differential. For relevant altitudes, differential with surface is about 75K. If we spray an aerosol at high altitude, that&#39;s where thermal radiation equilibrium is established. If atmosphere was perfectly transparent in all wavelengths, average temperature on Earth&#39;s surface would have been about 255K. If the aerosol has similar albedo and leads to temperatures of 255K at altitude of aerosol, which is average of 330K at the surface. That&#39;s guaranteed death for all land life.<br><br>Current mean temperature on Earth is 287K. To have aerosol be helping, temperature at altitude where aerosol is sprayed has to be bellow 210K or so. That&#39;s almost impossible to achieve for an aerosol. The radiation equilibrium temperature is controlled by relationship of 1 - albedo and emissivity in infrared. To achieve temperature of 210K or bellow, the ratio (1-a)/e must be less than 0.58. For particles less than 10 microns in diameter, that&#39;s basically impossible, and for these less than 100 microns very difficult, because you&#39;re effectively trying to make something that&#39;s really, really good at absorbing IR and is also very, very reflective in visible light. You&#39;d need some way to make sure more light is reflected up than scattered horizontally.<br><br>Volcanic eruptions are a horrible example. The short-term effect is cooling, sure, because less sunlight at the surface, but all this time, upper atmosphere is heating up. That takes a while, but once it warms up, it starts heating up lower atmosphere and the surface. Long term effect of more dust in upper atmosphere is ALWAYS heating.

Imo we shouldn&#39;t be so resilient about not changing the way we live today. I think that solving climate change is much more important than having excessively many things to spend money on. We don&#39;t need the majority of things that exist in our lives to survive (or even to live a good life), we should stop being such babies and take serious action to find solutions, even if we have to give up the luxuries of modern life for a while (or at least some of them). Climate change is our fault, we shouldn&#39;t be looking so hard to escape any punishment because we deserve it. That&#39;s why I&#39;d much rather switch instantly to eco-friendly energy sources and give up fossil fuel completely (or keep it to an absolute minimum). I might be wrong, but without all the useless stuff that we have and could rid ourselves of, it should be possible.  And also, it won&#39;t be permanent, just until things get better and we find better solutions. I don&#39;t see any reason against this other that people are too stubborn to go back in development a little, it may be our nature. But I still think it would be the quickest and best solution. The actual problem is with the people. The big guys don&#39;t want to lose their oil money and the little guys wouldn&#39;t trust a leader proposing such a drastic measure (also wouldn&#39;t like losing their comfortable lifestyle for a while). Also, some people think that if it won&#39;t have grave consequences in their lifetime then climate change is not a top priority. If we could just all agree to do this as a whole, for OUR good in the future, it would be best, but that&#39;s a bit too idealistic.

I don&#39;t really know of anybody I have read or talked to who thinks we should just use one of these techniques to the exclusion of others. For solar radiation management I can easily see a combination of troposphere surface and upper atmosphere based Solutions helping get the temperature issue under control quickly. Perhaps the stratospheric sulfate aerosols to get it under control really quickly then we build surface based mirrors and Marine Cloud brightening systems to get it under control over a slightly longer time with less severe consequences. All of that while we get CO2 under control through things like ocean alkalinization, ocean iron fertilization, growing more trees, creating biochar. Some of this you would be able to help with yourself at relatively low expense. If you burn some brush bury the charcoal in the ground, opt for lighter color shingles, etc. You could intentionally grow Bamboo use it for decorative purposes and instead of letting it rot when it dies releasing all the CO2 it has sequestered turn it into biochar and create some terra preta with it.", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T00:38:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ana Carolina Matos", "comment_text": "The way that kurzgesagt simply ignores the roll of capitalism in the climate change is just...

When will lobbyists and whoever else makes it worse ever be forced to do the right thing?<br>Like come on, there really seems like a fucked up greater good scenario is gonna possibly happen where people who cause climate change to be worse and lobby for all that getting attacked or threatened by vigilantes might be the only thing that could stop them. <br>The problem with the way things work now in the world is that money runs everything. And the more you burn the earth the more money that makes and the more they can use that money to continue lobbying and burning more of the earth and the cycle repeats. It really feels like the law can&#39;t do shit, the politicians can&#39;t do shit, cus money is power , because before looking at it as evil think of all the good that can be done using the kind of money these lobbyist pay the governments. it&#39;s fucking irresistible to them considering how difficult and tight the budgets are for most governments.<br>To me I do see it as a problem of the money based society, not just capitalism, but that because everything runs on money, you can never truly escape the problem that short term bullshit that fucks up things in the long term always makes a lot of money. So maybe we need a man made God? Like something that ensures just punishment for things that most rich or people in power or corporations get to evade because they can buy the best lawyer. <br>Ok what if instead of punishment, it&#39;s kind of a resource tax. And it&#39;s double the profit you would make from fossil fuel etc. For e.g: if you cause X amount of global warming you pay double the amount of total money, not just the profit that you make. So if you make say 100$ of off something that fucks things long term, you pay 200$<br>In converse, if you restore the environment, long term goals, etc, of you heal the world using 100$ of your money, you get 200$ back.<br>And all the funds for this will be taken by brutally cannibalising all the gas companies everything., Like utter destruction of them. They will be in debt for the amount that they are worth. And then all that can be used to fund the future.<br>Yeah it&#39;s fucked, but it&#39;s actually an equivalent exchange of you think about it, the debt we have is not just of what we think, but also the debt we must payback someday to the universe. And in a sense it&#39;s like karma, since that would basically reverse everything instantly, if it can be made happen. And it is very wrong and fucked up, but it&#39;s the best thing you can do now for far more worse conditions of the future and far more worse fixes we might have do in the future.", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T13:09:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "luft waffle4", "comment_text": "And when we wanted them most they dissapeared ( until the next great video ofc)", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T12:58:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ownerfate", "comment_text": "...

Humans are REALLY good at adapting. Brainless organisms that have been in stasis for millenia are not good at adapting. Especially when their lives depend on too much symbyosis. The better alternative to combat ocean acidification is the one that directly removes dissolved CO2 from seawater, namely the last of the three mentioned here, Ocean Fertilization. Unlike the other options mentioned ocean fertilization takles the problem at its source by fixing the equilibrium equation of the carbon cycle. If we&#39;ve already done alot of higher flowrate out of the lithosphere we have to fix equilibrium by accelerating flowrate into the lithosphere and the main way that happens is by ocean floor deposition. Many organisms depend on this part of the carbon cycle and serve to redirect carbon back up, to combat this reaction we can do one of the things we do best, overfish. The overfishing would specifically need to target the species that carry carbon back up, like bristlemouths (extremely high population).", "comment_date": "2020-10-30T16:22:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "( O_\u3009O)?", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t clouds pumped with Sulphur Dioxide also produce acid rain?", "comment_date": "2020-10-30T16:12:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Austine Kiiru", "comment_text": "The narrator&#39;s voice can&#39;t be changed.

Which is a non-invasive non-surgical procedure using specific frequencies and wavelengths of light to safely trigger tissue growth. It\u2019s applied to the vaginal canal to tighten woman back up to how they were years prior. Practiced in the US and France and other European countries. In the US I\u2019ve found doctors who\u2019ve been trained to apply the 30 minute Thermiva treatment in California and other states. <br><br>Why is that a breakthrough for feminine medicine? Because it addresses the female insecurity of looseness and incontinence too. <br>Which is great. Less insecurities means less fuel for suicide or depression. <br><br>But what about Masculine medicine? We don\u2019t have a male version of Thermiva for lengthening or girth increasing. We don\u2019t. All we have is diet and cosmetic surgery and placebo devices and placebo pills.

He interviewed Falun Gong practitioners Ms. Yang and Mr. Liu, who were incarcerated in China for their belief. Both practitioners talked about how they suffered as a result of the CCP&#39;s persecution. Both said that they were periodically forced to undergo medical examinations.\r<br>\r<br>Ms. Yang recalled that in 2005 she was detained in a Beijing labor camp for 18 months. She said, \u201cThey checked my body every three months. They took all these Falun Gong practitioners to the hospital. The hospital belongs to the police department and is very near the labor camp. The medical examinations included X-rays of our chests, liver examinations, ultrasound B scans, and blood tests.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Mr. Liu was released last year. He said, \u201cI was subjected to medical examinations several times while I was imprisoned. Blood was collected. All Falun Gong practitioners are forced to renounce their belief. If you do not yield, the prison guards beat your arms, legs, and buttocks, but not your vital organ areas.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>In the program BBC Impact, Mr. Hill explained to Philippa Thomas why the CCP wants to persecute prisoners of conscience and Falun Gong. The CCP considers anyone outside the control of the state and any minority groups to be threats.\r<br>\r<br>When the number of Falun Gong practitioners reached 100 million people in 1999, the CCP viewed them as a great threat. First they were slandered by the Communist Party, and then they were detained on a large scale.\r<br>\r<br>The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture noted that Falun Gong practitioners who adhere to peace and faith were being tortured in detention centers.\r<br>\r<br>Mr. Hill referred to the independent investigation report by David Kilgour, Canadian former Secretary of State for Asia; David Matas, Canadian human rights lawyer; and Ethan Gutmann, a senior reporter from the U.S. They were interviewed in the BBC program, \u201cWho to Believe?\u201d They reminded viewers that the CCP persecutes prisoners of conscience not for money but to carry out cruel genocide.\r<br>\r<br>Mr. Matas said, \u201cThe death penalty number has been decreasing in China but the transplant volume is going up. There is the volume without any other obviously explained sources besides prisoners of conscience. There is a huge arbitrary detention of prisoners of conscience in the hundreds of thousands in China.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>He continued, \u201cShort waiting time. People come when they want and get organs almost immediately, which meant somebody was killed for their organs.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>David Kilgour said, \u201cIf you are considered an enemy of the state, then your life is valueless. That&#39;s the problem. For the Tibetans, Uighur, and some house Christians, especially Falun Gong, there are lots of reports.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Ethan Gutmann said, \u201cIt&#39;s about (how) the state destroys its enemies. The money is an incentive for this to happen.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Mr. Hill summarized his investigation by saying, \u201cWe will not stop doubting that the CCP is still conducting organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience. The huge difference between the numbers that the CCP officials claim from organ donors and the actual organ transplants. (In 2015, the CCP claimed to stop using the organs procured as a result of the death penalty. Current organ transplants rely mainly on organs from patients who have died in intensive care units.) Due to the lack of transparency, the source of organs in China&#39;s transplant tourism market remains a mystery. Therefore, we will not stop doubting that the CCP is still conducting organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience.\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T23:30:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis Carlos Porras Gandarilla", "comment_text": "Sigo esperando los subt\u00edtulos en espa\u00f1ol unu", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T23:25:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mdoerkse", "comment_text": "The chemtrail people would love the idea of spraying acid in the atmosphere.", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T23:23:06Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "flips dchannel", "comment_text": "you&#39;re making me scared with this video", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T23:18:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DudeBro", "comment_text": "&gt;have to do<br><b>*Laughs in solar minimum*</b>", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T23:17:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kulukay", "comment_text": "Matrix was not a good enough plot?", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T23:15:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mahuba", "comment_text": "im pretty sure mass producing CO2 collecting stations wouldnt be so hard if EVERYONE did it", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T23:14:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael G", "comment_text": "You guys need to tone down the constantly political and &quot;social issue&quot; posting.

It&#39;s out in the open (just not publicly acknowledged or advertised to the general population - because people would be understandably angry). There are even regular geoengineering conferences that you can go to if you want, where leading scientists and organizations in the field discuss the latest developments and technological capabilities. It is very real. These same scientists even admit that they have no clue what the long term health effects of injecting huge amounts of these metals and chemicals into the atmosphere is going to have, not only on us humans but also the wildlife and environment. <br><br>The aluminium oxide, for one, is responsible for mass tree die-offs around the world. It is bio-available and trees uptake it through their roots (after it falls then goes into the soil after rainfall). Coincidentally, Monsantos GMO crop seeds are specifically engineered to be resistant to aluminium. But that&#39;s just a coincidence - right? <br>You can even hire private companies to do regional geo-engineering. Drought in your state or area? You can pay a company to do cloud seeding using silver nitrate spraying, to literally make it rain, anywhere. You can even pay companies to spray floral scents (or any scent you want) in the sky above your wedding. <br><br>Another aspect of the &#39;geo-engineering&#39; programs is to create an atmosphere that is highly conductive and conducive to the enhanced broadcast and strength of radio signals and stuff like over-the-horizon radar systems, as well as advanced real-time worldwide 3D imagining. No need for satellites, when you can just bounce stuff off the ionosphere from a ground based array system, over the horizon, and get a live all-and-any-angles feed. <br>Then there&#39;s smartdust.

Why?<br><br>World governments (i.e. governments large enough) are unable to implement the solutions to climate change because energy infrastructure is privatized and the technology they&#39;d adapt to combat climate change isn&#39;t financially advantageous relative to what private industry wants. That is to say, the loss of mining/drilling, transportation, refinement and processing removes many points of investment, reduces the value of property/ equipment used and ends the need for the employees risking their lives to make it all happen. Furthermore, it grants a significant sense of importance on the individuals and families who own the capitol.<br><br>However, an alternative (or stopgap) that utilizes and necessitates large investments in capitol (e.g. planes, runways, chemical plants) similar to what is already expected is something our financial masters would prefer, especially if their well lobbied governments will give them money to make it happen. Furthermore, it allows fossil fuel companies to extend their overspent grace period of getting the fuck out (if any even had the sense to do so and weren&#39;t just stalling for time and opportunity).<br><br>SAI is a solution that appeals to billionaires and billion dollar industry, which allows them to stay relevant while maximizing profit, gets them good PR, and doesn&#39;t solve climate change (kinda like fracking).

The bill, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (trafficking in human organs), was thus first read in the House of Commons.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>MP Garnett Genuis\r<br>\r<br>In a statement made on Monday, MP Genuis said, \u201cFor 10 years, members of Parliament have been trying to pass legislation to address the scourge of international organ trafficking. My colleague, the member for Etobicoke Centre, as well as former Liberal MP and justice minister Irwin Cotler, both presented bills on this issue in the previous Parliament. None have passed until this point though.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Genuis commended the work of the Senate, and Senator Ataullahjan in particular, for getting Bill S-240 through the Senate and perfecting the bill.\r<br>\r<br>\u201cThis is further than this bill has ever made it before, but it is critical that we pass this legislation in this Parliament, so we do not have to start all over again.\u201d said Genuis. \u201cI hope we will finally be able to get this done in this Parliament.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>The bill has two key points. First, it makes it a criminal offence for Canadians to go abroad for an organ for which there is no consent by a donor.

Those aren&#39;t goals, that&#39;s a damn wishlist (as said by J.Peterson). From an economists theoretical standpoint, what needs to happen is that underdeveloped nations become developed nations sooner (these are UN goals as well). This means better education and more geniuses. It also means higher resource consumption (approx.avg developed nation 1 person energy consumption vs rural 600:1). This will naturally create a higher demand of resources and result in the formation of alternative energy etc. In the perfect world, instead of suppressing developing nations (hello American sanctions), nations join hands reach technological advancement.

Melting ice is like ice in a cooler. It helps temper the planet as it melts. When the ice is gone we will know what global warming is.

Does some of it radiate to space? Evaporating water takes 970 Btu per pound with it into the atmosphere. What happens to the latent heat of vaporization as the water condenses and falls back to earth? Does some of that heat radiate to space? If so, precipitation is like a built in air conditioning system for the planet.

People like Trump aren\u2019t really helping matters. He frequently will avoid the question when asked about climate change and just talk about how we are managing climate change \u201cthe best in the world\u201d right now, and not actually speak about plans to move the economy towards different energy sources. The time for fuel-based energy is dying, it has to. There\u2019s too many poor side effects to its use and those effects are building up. However, NO energy source is \u2018perfect\u2019 for human needs/desires, NOTHING. Wind power? High cost per-yielding of energy, kills birds, only works when it\u2019s windy out. Water? It just doesn\u2019t produce enough energy because there aren\u2019t very many rivers compared to the amount of land and still oceans. Solar? Still kind of expensive, only works when it\u2019s day out, panels only work for a little while, and the materials necessary are really bad for the environment when the panels do die. Nuclear? Risky, although managed properly it should theoretically be fine. It is I believe also decently expensive. Honestly nuclear is pretty good, but the main issue is just getting businesses to use it and keeping it safe enough so that something like Chernobyl hasn\u2019t a chance of happening. Now, let\u2019s look at fuel. Yield? High in terms of how expensive the fuel is and the facilities can last decades. The energy-making process can happen all day long. The uses for it are many, and have been around for perhaps the longest time of any energy source, and are thus incredibly tried and true. The amount of fossil fuels also is very high in the world, so there will be no shortage any time soon. The only side effects to burning fuel as an energy source are its waste outputs. They\u2019re bad to breathe and heat up the world, in short. Their negative effects have really only begun to become apparent in the last several decades. This is the only problem with pure capitalism. What we need is concious captalism. Very concious capitalism. We must stop using so much fossil fuels. Sooner or later, we must. For now, we must invest in new technologies and policies, regulating as they may be, to counteract the fossil fuels.

IT&#39;S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES\r<br>ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK &#39;READ MORE&#39;)\r<br>\r<br>There are some things that you should know:\r<br>\r<br>1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:\r<br>\r<br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSu5sXmsur4&amp;t=3m23s\">3:23</a> &quot;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSu5sXmsur4&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a> &quot;As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:&quot;\r<br>\r<br>It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.\r<br>\r<br>2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:\r<br>\r<br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSu5sXmsur4&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a> &quot;For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Ro 5:8 &quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It&#39;s the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That\u2019s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won&#39;t go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won\u2019t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.\r<br>\r<br>3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).\r<br>\r<br>Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.\r<br>\r<br> Heb <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSu5sXmsur4&amp;t=9m22s\">9:22</a> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.\r<br>\r<br>You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him. \r<br>\r<br>Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.\r<br>\r<br>Ro 10:9,10;13 &quot;that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:\r<br>\r<br>\u201dDear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.

If our civilisation is to survive then we will have to bring CO2 emissions under control, and the sooner the  much better.<br><br>Edit: and at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSu5sXmsur4&amp;t=4m55s\">4:55</a> there&#39;s that Highlander 2: The Quackening poster again.", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T23:01:42Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "f0v3r.", "comment_text": "Moral of the story: we&#39;re doomed", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T23:01:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Esposito", "comment_text": "Oh please lol", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T23:01:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niyo", "comment_text": "please just don&#39;t mess with nature, in the past this has never turned out good", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T23:00:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sergeant So N' So", "comment_text": "Ah, yes, the earth is warming, we&#39;re exiting the ice age!<br><br>scientists &amp; major corporations: yeah, no, we cant have that. that&#39;ll kill off like 25% of earth&#39;s life, if we&#39;re super super unlucky<br><br>also scientists: comes up with a plan to BLOCK OUT THE FUCKING SUN AND PLUNGE THE EARTH INTO THE COLDEST PERIOD OF IT&#39;S HISTORY.<br><br>everyone: fucking dies from the cold.<br><br><br>the end, life on earth, ended because a bunch of people feared the heat so much, they cast it into eternal darkness.", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T23:00:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evan Clarke", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSu5sXmsur4&amp;t=4m55s\">4:55</a> is he hitting a bong?!?!?", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T23:00:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kostas papakitsos", "comment_text": "Who recognized the house at the beginning? its from the movie interstellar if anyone is wondering", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T23:00:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriela Mejia", "comment_text": "It&#39;s over we have made our own trap.

Blocking sunlight altogether with something safer than sulphur dioxide can also be problematic. After all, the plants and algae depend on sunlight to undergo photosynthesis, and they are the only thing taking CO2 out of the atmosphere. If we diminished sunlight hitting the Earth&#39;s surface, we&#39;ll get fewer plant and algal growth, so less photosynthesis, and therefore less CO2 taken out of the air. We could just end up back at square one, if not worse. I think the kind of geoengineering we need to do is to have more green areas on the planet and we need to start as early as possible.

They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can\u2019t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.<br><br>EMBRACE MONKE", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T20:57:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "A Lonely Soul", "comment_text": "Sounds suspiciously like Operation Dark Storm.

They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can\u2019t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T20:55:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BreadLoafBrad", "comment_text": "This is sounding uncomfortably like Snowpiercer", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T20:55:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin Verrisin", "comment_text": "essentially... we need things to get bad enough first, for people to understand they need to take it seriously<br>- then we can artificially cool off the planet for a bit, but we must use that time to fix everything, not make it worse...<br>- and if we do it too soo, stupid people will think it&#39;s no big deal* , keep making world worse, until we eventually boil...<br>(* and probably chemtrails) <br><br>Lovely....

It&#39;s why we&#39;re in this situation in the first place.<br><br>Climate Change is a type of geoengineering, just an accidental one. It&#39;s large scale global change caused by artificial processes that have a proven significant effect on the planet that might render it uninhabitable for us.<br><br>So, what&#39;s the problem then? Well, you can imagine that, given that we had several decades of findings on Climate Change, we have demonstrable horrible effects of it happening for years, we have all the science backing and several minds around it, and significant findings and support, we still are not able to do much about it... this is likely true to any other geoengineering project. It&#39;s effectively uncontrollable, for us.<br><br>And the thing is, any geoengineering project that is aiming for faster widespread effects, will potentially also have faster widespread unpredicted side effects, of which we will likely not be able to neutralize or remediate, given our history. It doesn&#39;t matter if we put the most brilliant minds to it, just as much putting the most brilliant minds to climate change isn&#39;t solving it.<br><br>The thing is, all these proposed geoengineering projects might look mostly good in a bigger picture, or at least manageable and applicable in last case scenarios, but really - we don&#39;t know. What is being presented is an extremely optimistic and biased view, because we want to believe so much there is a simple shortcut to solving the climate crisis. So we overlook enormous logical gaps like trying to say anything we do would be anywhere close to a volcanic eruption. You know it wouldn&#39;t be. We don&#39;t even understand volcanic eruptions properly, how can people think aerosolizing chemicals into the atmostphere would have the exact same effects? Of course it won&#39;t. We don&#39;t get the entire process, and we are already taking shortcuts to say one is equal to another.<br><br>Much like it took us too long to understand the implications of pumping too much CO2, methane and other gases into the atmostphere, we don&#39;t really know, don&#39;t have the tools to accurately predict, and won&#39;t have enough time to really know every single effect that geoengineering projects can have - because the number of variables and number of potential effects are essencially infinite.<br><br>And the faster those unpredicted effects come, the less we&#39;re able to respond. Climate Change might not lead to a humanity extinction event, we&#39;re not totally sure, but geoengineering projects to counter it has several times more chances of doing it for us, because it&#39;s supposed to act faster, it&#39;s supposed to be a fast counter act to climate change. And as some people will know, the problem isn&#39;t the change, the problem is speed. What life is generally vulnerable to is fast change that surpasses it&#39;s ability to adapt.<br><br>You know how we can&#39;t even, as humans, create software that is bug and vulnerability free? Geoengineering is a problem orders of magnitude more complex. And the consequences for errors are deadly, up to mass extinction.<br><br>What would we need to do Geoengineering more safely? We&#39;d need a perfect Earth simulation, with as many variables as possible included, if not all. If we had anything close to that, here&#39;s other stuff that we&#39;d already be able to predict at this point - volcanic activity, weather systems, natural disasters.... climate change effects.<br><br>So, in essence, we let unqualified people mess with the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, and now we&#39;re expecting unqualified people to do a quick fix for it. I&#39;m not trying to offend any scientist who is thinking of and working on geoengineering projects, this is just a fact. No one today is qualified enough to tell the full breadth of consequences that any proposed geoengineering project may cause. It&#39;s outside our species capabilities to do it currently. Planet Earth, if looked as a system, is so massively complex and interconnected that we&#39;d really need something like a Matrioshka brain to predict consequences of changes in the near to far future.<br><br>So, ultimately, it&#39;s a high stakes high risk gamble. Geoengineering would be humanity&#39;s biggest gamble with least chances of winning. If there is any opportunity for us to do something else, we should avoid it. But as a last hurrah, why not?

Basically, these materials reflect heat directly into space by shifting to a frequency that the atmosphere won&#39;t block. This is actually the basis of ancient ice houses in the desert which would turn water into ice overnight by literally beating the heat into space, but these new materials can achieve that effect during the day. If you were to coat every roof in the world with these materials then the Heat Of The Sun Won&#39;t radiates into people&#39;s homes. It would reflect off into space. That would keep homes cooler, significantly cooler, in the summer time. Of course, it also means reflecting heat during the winter time, but that&#39;s the trade-off. More importantly, these metamaterials can make solar panels operate cool. The reason why solar panels have only a few Decades of life is because the heat they are exposed to causes cumulative damage over time. By preventing the build-up of heat while exposed directly to the Sun you allow the solar panels to operate longer thus reducing their overall cost.", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T19:12:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tim bull", "comment_text": "I really hope that the government will just change so we don&#39;t have to do this very dangerous technique.", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T19:12:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gizdalord", "comment_text": "This is (based on the first 2 mins) basically the matrix.

A few months ago the Infographics Show and others hinted that aliens are real, and the rich and powerful are using blood infusions of the young to extend their lifespan and look younger. All of these things were dismissed as conspiracy even just a year ago. If you said &quot;the planes are spraying chemical particles to alter the atmosphere&quot; people would call you crazy. Supposedly these things have been happening, or in development for a LONG TIME and that we just weren&#39;t ready to hear the truth. 2020 has been a year of crisis and confusion, at this point what would have previously been &quot;shocking&quot; information is just kind of an &quot;ok&quot;. Aliens have been rumoured to exist for thousands of years, yet the theory gained a lot of popularity in the late 40s and 50s due to the Roswell Incident. <br><br>Now is the BEST time to release world-changing information because it will not upset the status quo. We are already going through a chaotic period and learning aliens are actually real and already here wouldn&#39;t really change that, just add something else to the mix. <br><br>The media has definitely mentioned a lot of conspiracies in the last six months as if they are real. Does that mean we&#39;re being prepared for the next step in our evolution? We have to get used to these big ideas FAST because 2020 has highlighted problems and accelerated them considerably. We are gathering pace and sprinting towards a different world. It&#39;s changing rapidly around us, but at least some of this is BY DESIGN; because we have to be prepared to accept information that could throw everything we know into doubt. They think the people will lose their minds and stop being functional members of society if we learn something so huge like the earth is miles closer to ecological destruction than we anticipated. They&#39;re aware that existential fear can stop us in our tracks, so to be good capitalists we have to be IGNORANT to the true nature of the world around us, the real motivations of government and authorities, and the destruction we&#39;re causing.<br><br>When you see things like this confirming that old conspiracy theories are indeed real it means one thing only: humanity is fucked 2020. Future people will look back on the period 1950-2020 as a time of greed, profit and reckless damage, that if we only stopped to think and moderate ourselves we could have DONE something.

Nuclear energy produces more energy per unit than fossil fuels or wind and solar and also makes significantly less waste than other energy sources. Disasters are much more avoidable with better safety measures and also using elements besides uranium like thorium. I would say Nuclear energy is the &quot;greenest energy&quot; because what most people don&#39;t realize is that the precious metal for solar panels comes from massive, environmentally devastating strip mines in places like south Africa and south east Asia and is itself unrenewable but people are able to ignore that because it is not in their home country, so therefore it is not their problem.

I mean seriously, I bet most of you don&#39;t even know that Ozone is actually a greenhouse gas, yet it protects life from the harmful radiation from the sun. Methane and nitrous oxide trap a vast amount more heat than co2 ever will. Co2 does NOT play a significant role in the heating of the planet. If this planet were to suffer from a catastrophic heating event in the NEAR future, the culprits would more likely be spikes in Methane and Nitrous Oxide than it would be Co2. We know this because through geological history there have been times the earths atmosphere had a higher c02 count then it does now but the planet had colder temperatures. There&#39;s also been times where the average temperature was a lot higher then it is now with almost 0% co2 present in the atmosphere. So to draw a direct correlation between co2 and the heating of the planet is just blatantly wrong. This is a natural cycle, the planet goes through heating and cooling periods, we see plenty of evidence for this in the geological record. Nothing we do is going to change that fact. If all humans died right now, the earth would continue to warm, and then in about another 80 thousand years or so, it will cool back down as it enter into another glaciation period. Sorry but humans do not have as much of an impact on the temperature as people would lead you to believe. No science for it, No evidence for it, there&#39;s just nothing to show the opposite to be true. <br><br>*Also I&#39;m not saying to believe me on this, this is all published scientific data that I encourage you all, especially those that have a passion to help the environment, to go look at. My hopes are it will shift the attention from the things we cant truly control or change (at least not yet), to the more immediate things and the things we can control and change. <br><br>We should be talking about our waste, and how we plan on properly disposing of it. Its time to stop looking at the temperature of the planet, which by the way, is affected by a myriad of different variables, most of which we have no control over in the slightest, and start looking towards the things we can have an impact on. People want to talk about climate change but they always go straight to global warming, and the ice caps. Well here&#39;s another fun fact for you, the planets sea levels naturally rise and fall as well. Doggerland (an actual place that used to connect the UK and Ireland, as well as the Nordic countries, with mainland Europe) used to be above sea level. Many cities in Rome were above sea level and then sunk below it in the span of a couple generations. I&#39;m no historian, but I&#39;m fairly certain Rome wasn&#39;t an industrialized civilization, yet they still had to deal with the same problems that we are dealing with 1000 years later. These things happen over the course of geological time, and actually pretty frequently. My point here is, stop focusing on the things we cant control, rising sea levels, temperature changes, things that have been happening for millions of years. They were happening long before humans were around and they&#39;re going to happen long after. The earth and life, will be perfectly fine. This past year and the global quarantine because of Covid has shown so. Within months, animals were moving back in to territory used by humans, nature was reclaiming many installations built by humans. THE EARTH AND LIFE WILL BE JUST FINE. WE need to focus on the things that we can control, like waste, deforestation, conservation and preservation. Not worrying about the ice caps and the sea levels. Even if humanity somehow were to take ALL of the carbon out of the atmosphere in the next 24 hours, the ice caps will still melt 100 years from now. There is no stopping it, there&#39;s only expediating it or slowing it, but there is no stopping it.", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T18:03:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HeyArlene", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve been to Mt Pinatubo crater its marvelous.", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T18:03:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Geek Net", "comment_text": "Kurzgesgat is the most objective youtube education and news channel", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T18:02:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kiel Meakin", "comment_text": "&quot;The world&#39;s governments enact... ficton then?", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T18:02:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eggsbread", "comment_text": "Looks like snow piercers gonna have a reboot", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T18:02:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "myforever13", "comment_text": "cool, yeah lets do something before we all die", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T18:02:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manas Hejmadi", "comment_text": "All the climate change deniers should to extinct", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T18:02:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KamiEuKiTo", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSu5sXmsur4&amp;t=1m20s\">1:20</a> Snowpeircer \ud83d\ude84\ud83e\udd76", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T18:02:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lemon Party", "comment_text": "If we can&#39;t even manage forests in California to reduce wildfires, hiw will we fare at changing the planet&#39;s climate?

H2O concentration is dependent on an equilibrium with the oceans (and terrestrial water sources) that is dependent on ions in the ocean and temperature. CO2 is the most potent greenhouse gas we can directly effect. If temperatures increase, water in the atmosphere increases and we get a positive feedback loop which is why small CO2 increases can have drastic effects over several years. <br><br>If we quit seeding the atmosphere, it&#39;s very likely that we&#39;ll see temperatures rise, but it&#39;ll take a while for that feedback loop to kick in. If we wait long enough to allow the poles to re-ice, it might mitigate a lot of that positive feedback loop and can slow down the temperature shock. We have to do some form of CO2 scrubbing as well, but still... even if we reforest the entire earth, we still don&#39;t win this game.

Look at the kinds of megafauna that existed during the last ice age and look what happened to them when the ice age ended. Wether by human activity or not, extinctions are more the norm than not.
