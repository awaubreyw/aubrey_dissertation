If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!
