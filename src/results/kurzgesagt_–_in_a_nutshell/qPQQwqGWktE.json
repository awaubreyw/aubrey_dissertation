The problem is you&#39;re all looking at the problem from the wrong point of view. <br>Instead of using a conventional elevator that is dependent upon a fantastic unfeasible cable of non existent material that can support its own weight and the payload. <br>There is another way.<br>By building an artificial mountain, of ordinary terrestrial material. To the altitude of 250 miles high (more or less). Where a staging area can be utilized to deploy and recover payloads and personnel going to and returning from space using conventional boosters tugs and freighters. <br>Inside the mountain conventional elevators (in stages like a normal express elevator in a skyscraper) can carry passengers and small payloads. <br>While larger freight elevators can carry bigger loads. <br>Also on the exterior of the mountain, using ordinary railroad tracks and special tracks (at the upper altitudes where microgravity is a problem with oversized freight) electric trains can haul finished components for habitats and space faring vessels.

The key to a workable space tether is a workable fusion power reactor producing electricity.   The byproduct of a fusion power reactor is helium.   Almost an unlimited supply of helium.   Helium is the key to a space elevator.  It will take a century or two if we wait for a space tether made from carbon nano tubes.  Even if we had the technology to produce carbon nano tubes, it is very expensive to produce.  What about long and skinny pressurized  tubes filled with helium and made from kevlar?  Maybe twenty to thirty of these long and skinny pressurized kevlar tubes about a kilometer long and sealed off at each end and all these kevlar tubes bound together with one giant kevlar sleeve.  The tubes would be self supporting all the way up into space by the lighter than air helium.  After the helium pressurized tubes reach above the earth&#39;s atmosphere there would be no more need for the helium filled kevlar pressurized tubes.  Above the earth&#39;s atmosphere all that would be needed would be a simple kevlar rope or tether.  This tether would be attached to a space station that is held in a geosynchronous orbit fixed in space above the earth.  The pressurized helium filled tubes that reach into space would need to have many kevlar tethers attached all around the pressurized space tether attached for miles around it from all different directions 360 degrees around the tether and anchored to the ground to keep the space tether secure.

We could create a really long tether in space with three ports along it; two of equal mass at each end and one in the center. Then we could spin the tether so that the two ends move in a circle very quickly around the center, creating a lot of centripetal acceleration. Then, incoming ships could dock with the center port (either by using AI to dock while rotating, or by adding a component to the center that rotates with the same RPM, but in the opposite direction as the tether, as to be stationary compared to an incoming ship), and passengers could take an elevator to the end, board a ship, and then disconnect themselves from the end, to be flung out into space. This would again require an extremely strong material for the tether, but if placed in GTO near a space elevator, you could potentially travel to anywhere in the Solar System with burning a single drop of rocket fuel. If we got really good at it, we could have ships coming in from different planets be &quot;caught&quot; in one of the end ports, without having to burn any fuel slowing down, and the passengers could ride down the tether to the center, take a short flight to the space elevator, all without ever burning fuel.", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T22:22:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "xaveirxx224", "comment_text": "If u launch from space the heat would destroy the rope re entry is a problem", "comment_date": "2020-02-18T03:55:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Big Biff", "comment_text": "Imagine spending years learning about physics just so you can learn how to miss a planet", "comment_date": "2020-02-16T16:04:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jellyfisch42", "comment_text": "There may be a material strong enough for a space elevator.

This limits the elevators upward maximum velocity. Best estimates are a minimum of 6 days transition time, could be as high as a month even. For the supposedly largest man made structure, this is supremely inefficient. Rockets accomplish the same in about 5 hours. This will severely limit mankind&#39;s ability to to transfer cargo at realistic rates. The idea that a single incredibly large elevator of very limited weight capacity and very long transition time can be considered economic in any larger space based construction project, is laughable. Crossing the Atlantic in a rowboat comes to mind.  <br>#2- Winds and storms will drift the elevator and the cord in an unpredictable way, we are talking about in the order of kilometers.  The only way to counter act this tendency is to greatly increase the cord tension which seems to be out of question since no chord is in existence today that can even support its own weight. The implications of a marginally visible cord wondering about the atmosphere not necessarily matching the likely different wind speeds at different altitudes, is an incredible safety concern to aviation.<br>#3- Graphene is highly conductive. Magnetic field changes associated with solar events could effect the cord via induction. These effects need to be studied and experimented on.They could be highly destructive. After all they can destroy power lines here on Earth.<br>#4-The cord is extremely long. In the order of thirty thousand kilometers. Its cross sectional area is therefore perhaps hundreds of thousand times greater than that of a space capsule housing humans. Likewise the likeliness of collisions with space junk and meteorites would increase in the same proportion. Is that a risk one can take? <br>#5 What about radiation protection? Passengers will need to be protected. How heavy? How effective? The cord itself has to withstand high radiation doses as well..<br>#6 Heat expansion effects, weather induced oscillations, earthquake and pole shift etc effects all have to be dealt with, at least conceptually.<br>Conclusion: This is a pipe dream.

Firstly an object climbing the cable will pull on the space station causing it to need rockets to maintain orbit.

Thirdly the cable will need to travel at orbital velocity all the way down for it not to provide any weight on the station.  Impossible.  The station travels at about 5000 mph, orbit velocity close to the Earth is nearly 18000 mph. It will therefore be a weight on the station, a huge one at that, even made from nanotubes, again pulling it down.  Fourthly, there are significant gravitational perturbations from the moon and sun in geostationary orbit, a major problem for geostationary satellites to maintain such an orbit.

To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.<br><br>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.<br><br>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.<br><br>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.<br><br>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.<br><br>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.<br><br>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.<br><br>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.<br><br>He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.<br><br>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.<br><br>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.<br><br>He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.<br><br>He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.<br><br>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:<br><br>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:<br><br>For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:<br><br>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:<br><br>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:<br><br>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:<br><br>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:<br><br>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies<br><br>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:<br><br>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.<br><br>He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.<br><br>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.<br><br>He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.<br><br>He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.<br><br>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.<br><br>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.<br><br>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.<br><br>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. \u2014 And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.<br><br><br>The Declaration of Independence.", "comment_date": "2017-02-26T19:18:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shitlord", "comment_text": "The whole concept is incredibly far-fetched and most likely impossible, but maybe we could build the base of the elevator on Sahara.", "comment_date": "2017-02-26T15:00:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K\u00f6nig von Preu\u00dfen", "comment_text": "so we basically need to put a leash on the moon", "comment_date": "2017-02-26T07:15:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheRealGamer", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPQQwqGWktE&amp;t=2m24s\">2:24</a> The ISS ways approx 500,000 KG not tons, so either you meant 1000 tonnes or you meant 2000 ISS&#39;s", "comment_date": "2017-02-25T15:46:29Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Ewan Perks", "comment_text": "NASA should hire this guy like wtf", "comment_date": "2017-02-25T12:38:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim Tong", "comment_text": "It is quite ridiculous that the biggest and maybe the only thing that&#39;s holding us back from advancing humanity is money...", "comment_date": "2017-02-25T12:33:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "39phamlee.", "comment_text": "I maybe will built the space elevator, whatever the problem is", "comment_date": "2017-02-25T08:23:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Clark", "comment_text": "I thought of Halo when I clicked on this video.", "comment_date": "2017-02-25T03:17:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sw3a", "comment_text": "I really want to support but I&#39;m only 11", "comment_date": "2017-02-25T02:05:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Swift Frost", "comment_text": "But... terrorism.. what if it was destroyed.

There are 2 factors that should be put in mind, 1. heating will propel an object towards the opposite side of the heat, 2. the climber needs to break through the Earth&#39;s range of gravity. To escape Earth&#39;s atmosphere, the climber needs to be launched strong enough, so heating may not be too great. If strong propeller continues non-stop, the climber might break the tether. So after escaping Earth&#39;s atmosphere, Heating should be used, Of course the tether must be Stronger near the anchor. How will heat propel the climber? Maybe a laser powered by the tether.<br>And another problem, Making a Space elevator may change the Earth&#39;s center of gravity and change earth&#39;s orbit.

There is no material light and strong enough to make the tether, and there probably never will be. That alone makes it impossible, even if we disregard all the other problems (some of which were mentioned in this video).<br>But the good news is, it&#39;s not necessary. The reason why getting stuff into orbit is so expensive is not because the rockets burn vast amounts of fuel, as stated in the video. The cost of the propellant is actually way less than 1% of the total cost of the launch. Most of the cost comes from the fact that it costs tens of millions of dollars (sometimes over a hundred million) to build a rocket (not counting R&amp;D, just the bill of material and labor to build the one piece of hardware) - and then it&#39;s used exactly once. After it delivers the payload, it is directed back to Earth to burn up in the atmosphere and crash into the ocean.<br>Imagine if airplanes were single use. If you had to literally blow up the airplane after each flight. How many people could afford to fly?<br>SpaceX has already proven that it&#39;s possible to retrieve the launch vehicle after successfully deploying payload to orbit. They did it by landing several first stages, either back on land, or on a droneship in the ocean. Incidentally, their first successful landing on a droneship was on the day this video went up. I should point out that the first stage constitutes the majority of the whole launch vehicle, with the most engines (9 out of 10 in case of SpaceX&#39;s Falcon 9). Pretty soon they&#39;ll start re-flying these retrieved boosters, leading to tremendous cost savings. Soon after that they&#39;ll introduce an architecture with a reusable second stage. Once they perfect this technology, they will have launch vehicles they can use over and over. This will yield the hundredfold reduction in the cost of spaceflight that is expected of this space elevator pipe dream. All without building a 36,000km tall structure out of a material that doesn&#39;t exist.<br>Kudos for the Tardis at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPQQwqGWktE&amp;t=3m05s\">3:05</a> though.

The upcoming energy crisis, rising sea levels, overpopulation, food shortage, water shortage are all converging at the same time. Some scientists believe the reason we haven&#39;t seen any evidence for intelligent life with advanced civilization is because, like us, alien civilization would have run into the same problems along their technological development. (Assuming carbon based life), So once civilization reaches the tipping point, all disasters converge forcing the people of said civilization to regress to a point that while still technologically advanced must keep a precarious balance with what&#39;s left of their world and the vastly diminished numbers of their species. So I believe once we reach our collapse and two thirds of humanity die what&#39;s left will probably live in highly advanced cities of no more that 100,000 each spread out through the planet. And there won&#39;t be much room for growth in these cities because unlike the fossil fueled industrial networks that support our mega cities, those small highly advanced cities will rely on green energy. No matter what you believe no other form of energy (with the exception of nuclear fusion) gives the same amount of return as fossil fuels. So 2 billion people spread around the world in small self sustaining cities will have little incentive to pour there limited resources into colossal engineering feats that have little chance of success and even less material return. I grew up loving science fiction, Issac Asimov, Arthur C Clark, Robert Heinlein, their ideas were far reaching interstellar human empires, galactic wars. Arthur C Clark was more reasonable his stories like Imperial Earth, Space Odyssey Etc, we&#39;re grounded in hard science fiction but still very much ignored the problems of current society that prevent things like space elevators and geocentrical habitats floating around earth.

Thus the trend is often that near circular orbits are faster when at lower altitudes and slower at high ones.

A trip to geo stationary orbit would take days as you are rising from sea level to roughly 35,786,000 meters above sea level.

If Space X continues to build on the landing systems they&#39;ve already made huge progress toward, then the rocket cost would drop dramatically. It would still not be as efficient as the space elevator, but it would be about 10X cheaper than today. So current disposable rockets = $20,000 per Kg, reusable rockets = about $2,000-1,000 per Kg, and the space elevator = about $200 per Kg. <br><br>So in theory, even our best projections for reusable rockets is still not as good as a space elevator, but it does have two major advantages. 1) We&#39;re doing it RIGHT NOW. Landing a rocket is no longer theoretical, Space X has successfully done it twice and will likely do it many more times this summer. 2) Reusable rockets are FAR less risky. In today&#39;s social climate, the space elevator would not be vulnerable only to natural obstacles, but human ones as well. If you don&#39;t think that the world&#39;s most expensive construction project wouldn&#39;t be a terrorism target, then you&#39;re just not paying attention. If that tether were to break for any reason, then the results would be catastrophic. It effectively puts all your eggs in one basket. Reusable rockets carry much less of this type of risk. <br><br>I&#39;m not down on the space elevator. I actually sincerely hope we build one in my lifetime.

One would generally put a space elevator in geostationary orbit, corresponding to an orbital velocity of about 3.1 km/s. Comparitively, the Earth only rotates at 0.465 km/s at the equator. It is true that climbing elevators will be sped up as they climb, but the energy necessary to accelerate the elevator from 0.465 km/s to 3.1 km/s is provided by the already in-orbit counterweight rather than by the Earth. You get some of the energy back when the elevator comes back down to Earth, but as long as you&#39;re lifting more than you&#39;re lowering the counterweight will lose energy and you&#39;ll need to use rockets to speed it back up. This is not necessarily a terrible thing, as since the slowing occurs over a very long period of time one can use ridiculously efficient low-thrust engines to maintain speed without much fuel, and furthermore even if one used chemical rockets to re-accelerate the counterweight it&#39;s still enormously better than the traditional way of sending up rockets with their payload (since you don&#39;t have to bring fuel with you just to carry your fuel).

If we have a long enough space elevator that it doesn&#39;t need a counter weight (the mass of the elevator tether past the geosynchronous orbit level would keep it taunt), we could use the rotation of the Earth to give the necessary speed to launch craft to Jupiter or Mercury by itself, if released at the right time. Which would save tremendous amounts of money for fuel and likely speed up mission times.<br><br>Furthermore, you can also use a space elevator to change orbit levels, using it to slow down (by descending) or speed up (by ascending). Missions to mars could launch from one level, for example. However, the price of it is of course detrimental, as is the risks.<br><br>I think a video on theoretical laser launch platforms might be a good idea to follow up this, though. There&#39;s some work on them so far, and they have the chance to be almost, if not as cheap as the space elevator for at least getting things into orbit. And while they can&#39;t be used to launch payloads to Jupiter, solving the hurdle of orbital launch will make future investments and construction in space much cheaper.", "comment_date": "2016-04-08T23:49:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "alefuentesbarriga", "comment_text": "hey guys, your channel is awesome! pls do a video about vaccines and autism, it will help educate people about the subject", "comment_date": "2016-04-08T23:49:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "edibleapeman", "comment_text": "If you liked this video, I encourage you to read Kim Stanley Robinson&#39;s trilogy of Mars books.

The ISS weighs 419 metric tons - NOT 500,000 TONS you total freaking idiots!<br><br>Jesus H Christ on a pony; the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier weighs just 100,000 tons. So you are only wrong about the mass of the ISS by THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE! THAT&#39;S ONE THOUSAND TIMES WRONG!<br><br>Then there&#39;s the price of access to space; your quote of $20,000 per kilo is TWENTY TIMES THE CURRENT COST TO LEO. Holy mother of drooling idiots - the Space Shuttle price quoted was the single MOST expensive way to get into space EVER. Elon Musk has broken the $1,000 per kilo to LEO barrier - and it seems very likely that he will reduce it much further with his reusable first stages, and his reusable, rocket-landing capsules.<br><br>Your estimate of 20 billion for the space elevator is, therefore so far from reality it is insulting to the intelligence. The ISS has cost well in excess to 100 billion dollars already - and it is a walk in the park to build that compared to an elevator!<br><br>Even if the cable can be actually manufactured, it seems highly unlikely that an elevator could be built for anything less than a couple of trillion dollars. Even with Musk&#39;s craft launching the raw materials into space and the factory built at geosynchronous orbit.<br><br>Let&#39;s now examine how much STUFF you can launch with an elevator. The Earth could not hope to produce hardware fast enough to keep the thing working efficiently. Only humans as passengers to space hotels make any sense at all.<br><br>Why? Because it took the planet more than 20 years, just to make the pitiful 419 tons of International Space Stattion. And we have to remember that this project was the most expensive in human history, and more nations and more humans worked on it than any other project in human history.<br><br>Therefore, it seems, that even if every nation on earth was funding the building of space craft of various kinds, and they were quite serious about it, they just MIGHT be able to produce 1,000 tons a year.<br><br>Of course, the elevator can lift a lot more than space ships; it can lift gasses, water and food - stuff which is dead easy to package up and ship into space. But the capacity of the elevator would far exceed that use as well.<br><br>Basically, there is no &quot;Killer App&quot; for an elevator - and I can&#39;t ever see a time when there will be - and I am a huge space nut. The risk in attempting to build it is mind bogglingly great. and only a Type I civilisation on the Kardashev Scale can even THINK about building one. We are not there yet - but we might be in a hundred years or so.<br><br>The use of a counterweight on the cable is simply impossible. It cannot be done, and no engineer would ever be stupid enough to even suggest it. Mass is money - and putting a super massive object on the end of a cable is what? Easy? Cheap? No - that is simply ignorant and stupid to even suggest it.<br><br>No - the way to create the cable is to extend the cable outwards, equally as far as inwards - so that it would be 65,000 klicks long - twice as long as you propose. This allows ships delivered to Geosynch, (and zero G) to then climb the cable &quot;downwards&quot; away from earth - gradually picking up g-forces - until you reached the end, and 1 negative G.
