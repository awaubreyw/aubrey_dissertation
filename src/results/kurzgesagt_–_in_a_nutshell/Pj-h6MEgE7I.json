It took until Copernicus for people to think we moved around the sun and Kepler to discover that the planets moved in ellipses, not circles.

I have seen fun animations on such interesting topics, that would be so hard to research in the first place! I admire how much time, and effort goes into this youtube channel, your merchandise, and everything else. Kurzgesagt needs at least 20 million subscribers by the end of 12,022, and if they don&#39;t, I will dig myself to the center of the planet, build a black hole generator there, and kill the planet. Kay maybe not but I can pretend. I have never found a more consistent, and just fun youtube channel.

Re-title: &quot;The difference between classical orbits and what a real orbit might actually look like over distance in some direction&quot;...<br><br>For those of you ACTUALLY curious about &quot;where&quot; you are: You are on what we have decided to call a &#39;planet&#39;. In English, this planet is called Earth, in other languages it is named something different. From here on I will only reference English names. The nearest celestial body is The Moon. It takes about three days to get there without smacking into it and dying. We have to take a curved path to get there, so while the moon looks like it is one place, it is actually a little farther if you try to go there, and if you try to go where it is right now you will arrive at empty space. Next, we are in a complex system of objects orbiting a star. That means our &quot;where&quot; constantly changes, but we can rest assured that &quot;right now&quot; the sun is in a direction and the moon in some other direction, giving us a &#39;good enough&#39; approximation to say we are between the sun and moon, as an example. Now, where is the solar system? The solar system is next to several different solar systems, but generally we just say stars to keep things simple. In reality, there is most likely a whole host of objects between us and the nearest star, so we could say something like, &quot;The Solar System is on the far side of Alpha Centauri in relation to Sagittarius A*&quot;, as an example. Then we can ask &quot;Where is our galaxy?&quot;. I&#39;m not going to bother looking, but as an example, we could say something to the effect of &quot;The Milky Way is part of a cluster of smaller galaxies that are moving towards Andromeda.&quot; This is loosely known as the Local Group which is moving towards &quot;The Great Attractor&quot;.

This means that the cosmological principal is logically forbidden as it neglects the requirement that all possible solutions to any system of partial differential equations for any given initial conditions be *unique*. This means that within an infinite universe every possible path through space can never be the same as any other path they are all equally unique and this uniqueness encodes the past history of the universe and thus in turn the entropy of spacetime which for all nontrivial flat or open solutions must be nonzero everywhere(when) resulting in any initial anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the early universe effecting the metric at all possible scales that is to say the strength of gravity anywhere in spacetime depends on nonlocal hidden variables which amplify with scale ensuring logical consistency and causality holds at the cost of forcing the metric tensor to always be within the maximally nonlinear regime  i.e. the Einstein field equations are always asymmetric appearing to be naturally consistent with the property of quantum entanglement as a nonlocal hidden variables. A.k.a. gravity== quantum entanglement of the wavefunction of spacetime so the assumption of the cosmological principal means neglecting path dependence of spacetime and thus violating the conservation of information which causes GR to become incompatible with Quantum field theory. Rejecting the cosmological principal appears to get rid of this problem and naturally leads to the quantization of gravity as well as eliminating several &quot;crises in cosmology&quot; such as the Hubble discrepancy the axis of evil problem and allowing the observation of net acceleration of spacetime to be naturally explained without the need to add some mysterious &quot;dark energy&quot; to the universe to force fit our models to observations. (Internally consistent solutions of the Einstein field equations always produce dark energy like effects because the Hubble rate can never be constant anywhere in spacetime for all possible logically consistent nontrivial solutions to the Einstein field equations.<br><br>Physics will only be able to progress again when the cosmological principal is finally allowed to die because mathematics requires internal consistency within any system of differential equations.", "comment_date": "2022-05-21T05:53:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K0UL", "comment_text": "Bro they look like they&#39;re wearing a diaper", "comment_date": "2022-05-21T05:50:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stuti Singh", "comment_text": "Lord Krishna showed multiverse to his mother - Ma Yashoda.....", "comment_date": "2022-05-21T05:48:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Landon Powers", "comment_text": "im not black", "comment_date": "2022-05-21T05:47:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sristi", "comment_text": "Animation is very good", "comment_date": "2022-05-21T05:41:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aether Mass", "comment_text": "I love the N64 and entrance to the Bob-omb Battlefield!!", "comment_date": "2022-05-21T05:35:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "theonetruemorty", "comment_text": "Very well done.

The Old Testament has numerous prophecies made hundreds of years before the New Testament. All of them come true in the form of Jesus Christ. They are quite specific (look them up). People might say that Jesus isn\u2019t even a real person, but history says otherwise. History and science support Christianity. Ponchus Pilate (the person who ordered Jesus\u2019s crucifixion) is a real person, an ancient  document concerning him was discovered. The Bible never contradicts itself. It is written so well and elegantly, everything connects. The Old Testament constantly points and talks about Jesus, hundreds of years prior to his arrival on Earth. God made the universe. Why have we seen no life? Out of the thousands of system surveyed? Because God made humans and the Earth! We are the only life. How can such a massive universe come out of nothing (Big Bang)??? You cannot have something come out of nothing. I cannot randomly make a watch out of thin air. That defies all laws of physics. That takes faith to believe, just like Christianity. God made the universe seem to be billions of years old, he made stars and everything already matured. He designed each tiny detail of life. DNA, ribosomes, chromosomes, the microscopic cells, the organelles in the cells, your nervous system, etc. Every part of your body is essential, it all connects. This isn\u2019t by accident. We are designed. Our consciousness is designed. If evolution was a thing, why aren\u2019t-there mixes of species? Half humans half apes? Animals in the midst of evolution? (We also don\u2019t have any examples of evolution). All the fossils are from the great flood found in the Old Testament. There\u2019s proof of it too. All what people claim is erosion is from the flood. Specially, the Grand Canyon. It\u2019s impossible to form over to me. The Grand Canyon is calibrated where only a HUGE, IMMENSE pressure (water) over a short period of time (40 days) can form it. There are fish fossils in the desert. Where apostles traveled are real places. My last point, all the people that saw Jesus after he resurrected were willing to die for what they saw! All of them! Nobody wants to die, but they were willing to because they <b>saw</b> him after he died (he 100% died physically. They poked him and water came out when he was on the cross). There was dozens, even hundreds that died because they say him and his miracles. Not one person admitted that it was fake. They all died for the truth. Open your eyes to Jesus. He saved you. Read the Bible.<br>Edit: the Bible also says the planets are circular.

Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness.

He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can\u2019t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated.

Modern Geocentrism and heliocentrism are both as accurate as each other because they use the same physics model with just a different frame of reference. We just swap between the two when it is convenient, but both frames of reference can perfectly co-exist, one at the level of intuition (when we get up and go to sleep) and one on the level of launching rockets into space. The sunrise in geocentrism isn&#39;t much different than looking at trees from a moving train. The train is your point of reference, and the trees are really moving, it&#39;s not an illusion because their position relative to yours is changing. If you want to say that they are really standing still, the only thing you&#39;re doing is jumping to another frame of reference. With that I mean that I find it a bit problematic to say that directions such as &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; is an illusion. The only logical conclusion from that is that your frame of reference is an illusion, but that&#39;s not true. Going a step further, that would mean that all frames of reference are illusions, but you need a frame of reference to work with reality, so you&#39;d be shooting in your own foot.

So really, the light has to travel the hypotanuse (c) of that triangle (a is sun to earth, b is old sun to current sun, and c is actual distance), but in the time it should take it to travel a. <br>I guess the photons are also effected by gravity so they are being brought along for the ride just as the earth and the sun is, but isn&#39;t the light still moving farther than is should be able to in those 8 minutes. Do calculations for how long it takes light to reach us take that into account? If the answer is just that it&#39;s all relative how is the speed of light a constant?", "comment_date": "2022-05-19T07:47:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mari__JUKI \ud83c\udf80\ud83d\udc8e", "comment_text": "I love how the depiction of our observable universe as a whole looks the same way neurons are usually depicted.

It knows this because it knows where it isn&#39;t. By subtracting where it is from where it isn&#39;t, or where it isn&#39;t from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the human from a position where it is to a position where it isn&#39;t, and arriving at a position where it wasn&#39;t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn&#39;t, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn&#39;t.<br>In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn&#39;t, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the human is, and where it wasn&#39;t.

Because a variation has modified some of the information the human has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn&#39;t, within reason, and it knows where it was.

The rest of the video is somewhat brutal in the sheer insignificance of our place in the universe--but at least it is somehow graspable. The first minute is not really graspable in the same way. Space is a wonderous concept in that it seem so intuitive and clear, yet, stops to have any meaning once you remove all &quot;things&quot;. No one has ever measured space, let alone &quot;seen&quot; or &quot;touched&quot; it. Space by itself is not sound concept either philosophically nor phyiscally. <br><br>Yet, to this day, even well-trained physicists talk about mass &quot;bending space-time&quot; and &quot;space-time&quot; being the real thing and gravity only a property of its inherent shape. Yes, mathematically you can describe it in the abstract geometric manner. But the as video states very clearly--without things, space (or space-time) loses any meaning. Things and physical fields on the other hand are real and we have &quot;positions&quot; relative to each other. Now the consequence is, and this is the brain-crush, to let go of a &quot;real&quot; space-time in which we have those relative positions. It is not needed. We positions relative to other things. Full-stop. No space and time required. Space and time are, if you will, only the language we use to talk about these relative positions.<br><br>It is a little bit like we lose casual language too!

It made me think of 20 years or so ago when I was in 8th grade. I borrowed my mother&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s little portable tv with a built in antenna and 3 inch very pixelated screen. I skipped school and watched tv out in the woods that I walked through to get to school. I remember watching the Super Mario Bros Super Show on it, as well as some other shows that the antenna picked up over the air, though tv during school hours was terrible after about 9am. <br><br>I brought extra batteries because the tv ate up like 4 AA batteries in an hour or two. Now, instead of gobbling up batteries for a pixelated screen picking up only like 5 stations, in watching whatever i want from all around the world on a crisp 1080p display with like 400 pixels per inch which is way more pixels per inch than the old portable tv had in total on its little screen. <br><br>That was a nice little 90&#39;s gadget and that was when I discovered my love for sitting outside in the nice weather and watching tv/videos and also listening to my cd player, which now is also replaced by my phone which has basically every song I could ever think of instead of just whatever cd I had in the player (which also ate batteries at a crazy fast rate so I had to replace them at the very least every few days). <br><br>It&#39;s just incredible how much has changed since 1999 or so. It makes me appreciate my phone so much more. It&#39;s a tv, radio, comic reader, book reader, game player, compass, flashlight, notebook, communication device, a video and picture camera, and more all in 1. Just to get even close to this 20 years ago I would need a ton of batteries, a portable tv, a portable cd player or radio, actual comics, actual books, a Gameboy, an actual compass, an actual flashlight, a gigantic phone or more likely a beeper, a huge camcorder, a camera, and a whole bag just to keep the stuff in while I carried it. <br><br>Do we even appreciate how bright modern phone flashlights are compared to the old flip phone terrible flashlights? I could barely use a flip phone light to light up the path going through the woods and now my phone can light up half a damn forest on the lowest brightness setting. It&#39;s just such a handy tool and it didn&#39;t even need batteries, it has a rechargeable one built in that i can charge with a portable solar battery charger that can get you an hour or 2 of screen use with a full day of sunny charging. It&#39;s just mind blowing how many utilities are right in our pockets everyday. <br><br>Just a some thoughts for passing readers to appreciate.", "comment_date": "2022-05-18T06:52:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kamel El abouti", "comment_text": "Could we just take a moment to appreciate the reference and the drawing of &#39;Le Petit Prince&#39; ? \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2022-05-18T06:52:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "smith549371", "comment_text": "The opening premise of knowing where we are is a bit strange and felt very disingenuous.

After the funeral services I was at the dinner we had at my oldest brother&#39;s house and I was watching my kids play with their many cousins, Aunts, and Uncles.  I noticed that slowly I began to regain my feet, and bearings.  It was then that I realized, I had always known where I was because I knew where she was.  She was my connection to the world and universe.  It had now passed to my kids, the only others I had that type of bond with.

Imagine most power fantasies where people have superpowers. There is one person with the power to be able to teleport from one point in space to another. They better hope that their power takes gravity into the equation or they might just end up halfway across the galaxy or universe. There is a superhero named Lemellion in the anime My Hero Academia.  His power basically lets him phase through things like matter and energy. He can walk throw walls and isn&#39;t affected by light while using his power. Thankfully for him, it seems he is still affected by gravity since when he uses his power he is usually pulled down towards the center of the earth and shot back up when he stops using his power. Hypothetically I imagine that if he wasn&#39;t still affected by gravity then if he used his power for even just a few seconds he might find himself stranded in or even out of the solar system given how fast everything moves relative in the universe. <br><br>As an example will just consider the speed of the solar system itself, ignoring the speed of the milky way and larger-scale clusters. It is estimated that the solar system is moving around the center of our galaxy at about 220 kilometers per second or 490,000 miles per hour. Assuming this is correct then with some math, we can say we (The solar System) are moving about 136 miles per second. So if someone with the power to ignore gravity and phase threw matter and energy used that power for even just one second the solar system would move 136 miles away from them, since they are not affected by the gravity of earth or the rest of the solar system. This is just a super basic way of explaining my thoughts cause it would be way more complicated if we took in all the factors and the speed of everything in the universe.

As the old saying goes Kansas, like many midwestern states, is as flat as a pancake. Somehow, pancakes became the golden standard for flatness, but do they really deserve such a title? A team of researchers from Texas State University and Arizona State University decided to find out. The researchers scientifically tested whether or not the state of Kansas was as flat as a pancake, and were surprised at what they found. Pancakes might be flat, but they are by no means the golden standard. The state of Kansas is actually flatter than a pancake. Who would have thought that was possible? The researchers figured this out by gathering data from the US Geological Survey about the topography of Kansas. They then obtained sample pancakes from none other than that breakfast staple, The International House of Pancakes. Armed with science and breakfast, the researchers headed into the lab. The researchers used a confocal laser microscope to compare the flatness quotient of a pancake to the USGS data about Kansas. For something to be perfectly flat (1.0) it would need to have no two points on its surface at different levels. A 2cm strip of pancake was placed under the microscope, and the researchers found that it was surprisingly inconsistent (0.957) with some sharp peaks and a lump in the center. Kansas, on the other hand, was pretty darn close to the perfectly flat designation, coming in at 0.9997. According to the researchers, this makes the state flatter than a pancake. Now, this isn\u2019t to say that Kansas is as flat as it gets, as it does fall short of perfect and there are bound to be some hills or other \u201cspikey\u201d things that would keep it from that designation, but the researchers were able to conclude that a pancake is shockingly bumpy and doesn\u2019t deserve to be the golden standard for flatness.</b><br><br>\r<br>\r<br><b>The Earth is Not Moving! The heliocentric theory, literally \u201cflying\u201d in the face of direct observation, experimental evidence and common sense, maintains that the ball-Earth is spinning around its axis at 1,000 miles per hour, revolving around the Sun at 67,000 miles per hour, while the entire solar system rotates around the Milky Way galaxy at 500,000 miles per hour, and the Milky Way speeds through the expanding Universe at over 670,000,000 miles per hour, yet no one in history has ever felt a thing! We can feel the slightest breeze on a summer\u2019s day, but never one iota of air displacement from these incredible speeds! Heliocentrists claim with a straight face that their ball-Earth spins at a constant velocity dragging the atmosphere in such a manner as to perfectly cancel all centrifugal, gravitational, and inertial forces so we do not feel the tiniest bit of motion, perturbation, wind or air resistance! Such back-peddling, damage-control reverse-engineered explanations certainly stretch the limits of credibility and the imagination, leaving much to be desired by discerning minds. If the Earth and atmosphere are constantly revolving Eastwards at 1,000 mph, how is it that clouds, wind, and weather patterns casually and unpredictably go every which way, often travelling in opposing directions simultaneously? Why can we feel the slightest Westward breeze but not the Earth\u2019s incredible supposed 1,000 mph Eastward spin!? And how is it that the magic velcro of gravity is strong enough to drag miles of Earth\u2019s atmosphere along, but weak enough to allow little bugs, birds, clouds and planes to travel freely unabated in any direction?</b> <br><br><b>We must take it on faith as mathematical proof doesn&#39;t exist.</b> \r<br>\r<br><b>N.A.S.A. on speed:</b> \r<br><b>The Earth&#39;s orbital speed around the sun is 67,000 m.p.h.</b> \r<br><b>The sun&#39;s orbital speed around the galaxy is 450,000 m.p.h.</b> \r<br><b>The speed of the ground beneath your feet, as a result of the Earth&#39;s</b> <b>rotation is</b> \r<br><b>600 m.p.h. at the latitude of Sheffield (53 degrees);</b> \r<br><b>1,000 m.p.h. at the equator.</b> \r<br><b>The Earth travels 584 million miles per year (one trip around the sun); that&#39;s 1,600,000 miles per day; 66,667 miles traveled each hour.</b> <br><br><b>\u201cThe distance across St. George&#39;s Channel, between Holyhead and Kingstown Harbour, near Dublin, is at least 60 statute miles. It is not an uncommon thing for passengers to notice, when in, and for a considerable distance beyond the centre of the Channel, the Light on Holyhead Pier, and the Poolbeg Light in Dublin Bay. The Lighthouse on Holyhead Pier shows a red light at an elevation of 44 feet above high water; and the Poolbeg Lighthouse exhibits two bright lights at an altitude of 68 feet; so that a vessel in the middle of the Channel would be 30 miles from each light; and allowing the observer to be on deck, and 24 feet above the water, the horizon on a globe would be 6 miles away. Deducting 6 miles from 30, the distance from the horizon to Holyhead, on the one hand, and to Dublin Bay on the other, would be 24 miles. The square of 24, multiplied by 8 inches, shows a declination of 384 feet. The altitude of the lights in Poolbeg Lighthouse is 68 feet; and of the red light on Holyhead Pier, 44 feet. Hence, if the earth were a globe, the former would always be 316 feet and the latter 340 feet below the horizon!\u201d -- Dr. Samuel Rowbotham,</b> ~ <b><i>Earth Not a Globe!</i></b><br><br>\r<br>\r<br><b>\u201cThe lights which are exhibited in lighthouses are seen by navigators at distances at which, according to the scale of the  supposed \u2018curvature\u2019 given by astronomers, they ought to be many hundreds of feet, in some cases, down below the line of sight! For instance: the light at Cape Hatteras is seen at such a distance (40 miles) that, according to theory, it ought to be nine-hundred feet higher above the level of the sea than it absolutely is, in order to be visible! This is a conclusive proof that there is no \u2018curvature,\u2019 on the surface of the sea - \u2018the level of the sea,\u2019- ridiculous though it is to be under the necessity of proving it at all: but it is, nevertheless, a conclusive proof that the Earth is not a globe.\u201d -- William Carpenter,</b>\r<br>\r<br><b><i>100 Proofs the Earth is Not a Globe</i></b><br>Surveyors, engineers and architects are never required to factor the supposed curvature of the Earth into their projects. Canals and railways, for example, are always cut and laid horizontally, often over hundreds of miles, without any allowance for curvature. (self.conspiracy)<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>The London and Northwestern Railway forms a straight line 180 miles long between London and Liverpool. The railroad&#39;s highest point, midway at Birmingham station, is only 240 feet above sea-level. If the world were actually a globe, however, curving 8 inches per mile squared, the 180 mile stretch of rail would form an arc with the center point at Birmingham raising a full 5,400 feet above London and Liverpool. Adding the station&#39;s actual height (240 feet) to its theoretical inclination (5,400 feet) gives 5,640 feet as the rail&#39;s necessary height on a globe Earth, more than a thousand feet taller than Ben Nevis, the tallest mountain in Great Britain.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br><b>The Suez Canal which connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Gulf of Suez on the Red Sea is a clear proof of the Earth&#39;s and water&#39;s non-convexity. The canal is 100 miles long and without any locks so the water within is an uninterrupted continuation of the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. When it was constructed, the Earth&#39;s supposed curvature was not taken into account, it was dug along a horizontal datum line 26 feet below sea-level, passing through several lakes from one sea to the other, with the datum line and the water&#39;s surface running perfectly parallel over the 100 miles. The average level of the Mediterranean is 6 inches above the Red Sea, while the flood tides in the Red Sea rise 4 feet above the highest and drop 3 feet below the lowest in the Mediterranean, making the half-tide level of the Red Sea, the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, and the 100 miles of water in the canal, all a clear continuation of the same horizontal line!

Because, when taking infinity into account, a postion in time can only be determined in relation to a period of time as well.\r<br>To me as an atheist, the philosophical realization from this is that you can give your life more meaning by changing the time frame to which you compare yourself.\r<br>Death gets really scary when you view yourself in relation to a larger timespan because only then you take into consideration the amount of time that is yet to pass, when you are no longer alive. But to you as an individual the most important temporal reference point should be your own lifetime. You can ignore what happens after that because you will not experience it anyway. If you view yourself in relation to your own lifespan, from that perspective your death is the equivalent the end of the entire universe.\r<br>At least to me, death is less scary if you think of it that way.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T20:48:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Konstantin Khitrin", "comment_text": "One of the nifty thing the video doesn&#39;t touch on is that while as far as we know all positions and orientations are equivalent, as the entire observable universe started from what we can&#39;t distinguish from the point, meaning every point in space used to be right next to every other, the velocity is another matter. From the fundamental physics perspective, there is still no absolute frame of reference for velocity, but we can measure the average velocity of everything. Because the momentum is conserved, a point that remained at rest from the moment of big bang, would observe uniform cosmic background radiation from all direction. But it&#39;s not. The radiation is very slightly hotter on one side, corresponding to red shift. And we can measure it very precisely. So precisely, in fact, that we know that the Solar System is moving relative to all of cosmos at a speed of about 369.8 km/s give or take just about 0.11km/s or less than 400km/h (!250mph) uncertainty.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T20:48:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Retr0", "comment_text": "Wait!

But I also feel if it were a phenomenon that simple, it would have been known by now. This tells me that it&#39;s not the whole story, and as we know, gravitational lensing can amplify objects of great distance. What if our own planet&#39;s gravity, in conjunction with it&#39;s atmosphere and the lenses of our eyes, creates the illusion of a flat plane- even though we know the world is round. Small minds can&#39;t rap their head around the contradiction here. Flat earthers are right. The Earth does appear, at ground level to the individual observer, to be flat. But not because it is. This can be proven simply by contacting another &quot;flat earther&quot; 80 miles or more due south of you to plant a 3 foot stake in the ground at noon. After being sure it is completely level, With a compass and tape measure, record and compare notes. The math will prove that the Earth is indeed a sphere.

Imagine two objects, one is orbiting another. Time flow for a orbiting object is slower, but why? If something can be measured only relative to something else and not space itself, then first object is orbiting second just as second is orbiting first. But only one of them has slower flow of time. <br>Now take that knowledge and imagine two objects. We apply some acceleration to both, so we know,  that both are moving in what direction. We know flow of time for both. Now we will slow one down - time flow for it will speed up. And we will continue to slow it down (apply opposite acceleration). Will time flow for it reach millions of years per one second on the other object? No. Why? Because &quot;faster object&quot; is faster relative to space-time, and not other objects, and flow of time for object is relative to space-time too. So when flow of time will no longer speed op and will start to slow down again then we will know - slower object has 0 speed on that axis relative to space-time itself.

And to make this even more bizarre. Even the concept of length and mass depend on where you look at it from. A body around you moving faster becomes heavier. It gains mass just through motion - but of course only from positions which view this mass as moving. The mass from its own perspective stands still and you are the one becoming heavier moving around it. So gravity doesnt actually get messed up by this concept of relative mass. But it gives light a mass which can be sucked in by black holes (which is what makes them black). Ever wondered WHY you cant travel faster than light? Its because the mass of the viewed as moving body increases as it gets closer to the speed of light. Mass increases at a rate of: m(relative)=m(resting)*(1/sqrt(1-v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). So m approaces infinity as v gets bigger. A bigger mass needs more kinetic energy to get faster by the same amount (v=m*v\u00b2/2). By the way (do not push v to c or beyond c in your calculations because you will get no real results (complex ones to be exact) or just undefined ones if v=c. But at least the total amount of |v| would be equal to infinity if v=c. Which makes sense - so Traveling at the speed of light with a resting mass would require infinite energy. So no resting mass can travel at the speed of light since you cant have infinite energy. However - traveling at these speeds will not increase your mass from your perspective if you are the one traveling. Actually You will just see everyone else become contracted in length in your moving direction. So depending on where you view and measure your distance from you can travel a 1ly distance in just 5 minutes depending on where you view in from. Everyone who is staying home will see that you traveled just over a year. You yourself will notice that the distance became a lot shorter from your perspective so you easily traveled it in 5 minutes - FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE.<br>Albert Einsteins relativity is a brilliant theory that feels even more brilliant once its understood.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T17:13:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nika andriadze", "comment_text": "<b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj-h6MEgE7I&amp;t=0m00s\">0:00</a></b> <br>Kurzgesagt: &#39;&#39;Look around you.&#39;&#39;<br>Me: Sees my cat in an adorable position.<br><br>Also me: Thanks to you funny German bird science YouTube channel that definitely doesn&#39;t fuels my existential crisis sometimes, for reminding me to hug my cat and probably disturb his sleep!", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T17:13:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrija Mitic", "comment_text": "Cool video, now I have existential crisis.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T17:13:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "d B", "comment_text": "damn this is also interesting to watch .. so many positions and information .. those positions could have some catchy name ..

Doc &amp; Marty would\u2019ve likely just found themselves in the vacuum of space if they simply travel to the same location but elsewhere in time. Shows like Dr Who, whilst are still far fetched with the story lines, at least allow the Dr and co to travel through both time and space to account for this.

As we know, we are moving in the space along with not only our Solar system but also the whole Galaxy. Suppose we finally know how to time travel and if we want to go 100 years &quot;back in time&quot;, won&#39;t we also have to factor &quot;where&quot; exactly in the space our planet was 100 years ago? We can&#39;t just disappear and then reappear at the SAME place and be 100 years &quot;back in time&quot; when planet Earth would be millions of miles away from that place.<br><br>Maybe I am wrong thinking about time travel this way but whatever little I&#39;ve read about those theories, it always involve physics and math. If anyone can clarify this in the comments, please feel free to! Maybe it&#39;s not as &quot;complicated&quot; and almost impossible as I think it to be. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af<br><br>Edit: And oh by the way, if there is some truth in my understanding, doesn&#39;t it further makes it almost impossible to time travel?
