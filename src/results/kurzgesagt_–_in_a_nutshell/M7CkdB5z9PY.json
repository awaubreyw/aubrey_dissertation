World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity; Similar is the case of money stolen by a thief who hides the ill-gotten money and then misuses it or commits more misdeeds; \u201cwho does not owe it does not fear it\u201d. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth.", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T13:08:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Plague Doctor", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7CkdB5z9PY&amp;t=5m51s\">5:51</a> dame bro take it easy y u gotta kill him like that god dame", "comment_date": "2020-08-10T06:05:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tiz", "comment_text": "Por qu\u00e9 ese es ingl\u00e9s y tambi\u00e9n espa\u00f1ol", "comment_date": "2020-08-10T02:52:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alin Vornicu", "comment_text": "Is this subnautica?", "comment_date": "2020-08-09T17:48:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ian Taggart", "comment_text": "Hydrothermal vents can go up to 400 degrees Celcius.

Depressed people always expect the worst, which contributes to their overall calmness when the worst actually happens.

It is also entirely possible that in different solar systems planets with more radioactive cores form producing even more energy this way.

I have an idea of why there might not be other life. Life started on earth when our cells and bacteria started to work together, by somehow communicating. Because of this they started to create a systems, like governments we have today. They made these systems to better survive rather than struggling alone. Other planets might have microorganisms, but not intelligent ones, I think that these cells and bacteria on other planets never learned to work together causing them to struggle alone. So as stated in one of your videos we are very lucky to be alive and might think that we could&#39;ve been more advanced but really animals is a miracle. I assume once one cell learned an easier way (working together ) other cells wanted to copy that so that their lives could also be easy, after that they evolved along the way. Just like the first person to stand on two legs, others copy to make it easy. That&#39;s my idea of why aliens might not exist anywhere nearby our planet. (So basically an animal is a planet and the cells are the people, they work together to form a system, a civilization) I thought of this by myself, please make a video about this or do research on it, because I want to know if I was correct.

Rouge moons could have their cores heated up this way, and it could be sustained for potentially tens of billions of years, or even hundreds of billions to trillions if orbiting a failed sub brown dwarf, but also a super Jupiter (as they are the same.) so these moons could sustain heat in their cores long enough so that another moon, Astroid, or even another rouge planet joined the party. This could gravitationally change the orbits of the planet and moon we started with, and thus heat up the core of the rouge moon again once it\u2019s cooled. The earth alone will take 91 billion more years for its core to solidify, and in addition to the 4.6 billion years it\u2019s already existed, that\u2019s 95.6 billion years for an earth sized planet. And for a rouge planet that is on the verge of being a mini Neptune, it be 10 earthly masses. It would also have that atmosphere mentioned in the video with hydrogen, making it habitable (theoretically) on the surface. 10 earth masses is 10 times the gravity, which is roughly 10 times the gravitational force, which heats up the core 10 times as much. This should mean about 10 times as much time until the core solidifies, which makes an incredible 956 billion years on the upper end from start to finish! And a large moon of this planet would have at least a few trillion years under the surface. Add more moons into the system, and the moons own heat, and that rouge moon is having life for several trillions of years.

Pressure is very apparent when being under water, any lifeform there (intelligent or not) perceives it when changing altitude, though intuitively as a relative rather than absolute quantity, much like heat/temperature. At this early point, they might think of positive and negative pressure as symmetric and potentially infinite. <br>But if they&#39;re intelligent in a way similar to humans and challenge traditional beliefs, or maybe by accident, they would eventually discover vacuum, i.e. observe that negative pressure can not be increased beyond a certain point.<br>This way they should realize that there is no negative pressure that increases with altitude above their comfortable altitude indefinitely, but rather that there must be some altitude where pressure is (close to) absolute zero (i.e. not further reducible), and that there can be (almost) no more mass above that altitude. <br>They could even go further and estimate the height of the ice sheet under the assumption that it&#39;s homogeneous, by measuring the pressure difference induced by a given change in altitude of some unit distance, dividing the pressure against vacuum at their current altitude by that difference, and scaling with the density ratio of ice and water derived from measuring the buoyancy of ice pulled under water. If they noticed in their altitude-pressure-difference measurements that it very slightly changes with altitude (gravitational pull is weaker the further away from the center of mass you get), and have discovered calculus, they can refine their estimation by adjusting for that factor. <br>Imagine how super hyped up such a civilization must get from this scientific discovery, and the sheer wonder and admiration when an expedition in pressurized suits and water in them makes it to the top of the ice sheet and they see the night sky for the first time, ever.", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T16:19:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "you", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7CkdB5z9PY&amp;t=6m25s\">6:25</a>  wasn&#39;t that us for a long period of time not trying to leave believing we are trapped", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T16:17:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "simon shrestha", "comment_text": "Where are the 3 part video series to learn about your animation style?

Also fire is not the only source of heat, as in this case Jeothermal features of the planet can be used as heat source. <br><br>Therefore, I think it is a good possibility that there might be more advanced or less advanced lifeforms compared to us living under ice on Rogue Planets or alikes. I think this because, when we seek traces of life in space, we tend to look for near-star planets, and finding one like our Earth is hard because liquid water is not there. We do not even think there might be advanced life on cold planets, because conditions are not met. In this under the Ice concept, liquid water will be there and other conditions will be very different which creates contrast to our familiar conditions and I think that part is important. Hence a planet like that would have the possibility to sustain different life forms.<br><br>I really like this Under the Ice concept, thanks for the video.

But there are many limits in our universe. <br><br>Can someone help me write as many criteria as possible for life to form?<br><br>I&#39;ll name a few things I know:<br><br>1. Only a few atoms on the periodic table are able to form weird complex structures that could later become life. One is carbon, another is maybe silica (can&#39;t remember). Carbon is very abundant, silica isn&#39;t. If there&#39;s life out there, the highest chances are that it&#39;s carbon based, then silica.<br><br>2. It has to form on a body in space: a planet, star, moon or an asteroid. It cannot form in open space, or at least, let&#39;s say the chances are ridiculously small. So, every lifeform out there is enslaved and shaped by gravity.<br><br>3. It has to be a material system. A machine that consumes energy and spends it. It has to reproduce and multiply, or have another way of evolving. But if it&#39;s just one being, chances are low that it will survive. Chances are very low that it&#39;s just one. Every lifeform out there probably is many.<br><br>4. Local energy source. No need for explanation.<br><br>5. Heat.<br>There has to be a local source of heat or the lifeform has to produce heat from energy. The lifeform has to need heat. No heat means no life. Because on the absolute 0, only the atoms move. And the cold=nothing. Warmth is movement. Warmth is life.<br><br>6. Stable enough environment. To not kill all life in there.<br><br>7. Turbulent enough environment. For a sharp natural selection.

Vulcanic activity is also possible under water and any form of life, no matter of what it is made, has a benifit of &quot;warmer&quot; environments. Warmer is of cause relative, but chemistry works faster there and when you move from 10 K to 20 K the kinetic energy for the molecules is doubled! As long as life building machines like our proteins are not broken up by these relativly high speeds life in this regions will be faster than life elsewhere. Therefore intelligent life might prefer such places as we prefered to live next to warm places and used for this need fire places. Of course you can&#39;t ignite everywhere a black smoker, but you still can use them. And there you can possible watch new chemistry happen and maybe one these new discovered processes is melting metal into new forms. Yes, you also wont go even close to a vulcano, but the possibility still exists, that some living being can manage to get close enough to make use of it.<br>And you do not need wood to invent tools. Many human tribes used only stones and bones and the evolution of bones is in my opinion a very logical step, when creatures become to big to carry their mass without. So even without the discovery of fire, tools will exist and tools can be used to do further exploration (maybe even trough that mysterious ice sheet...)", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T18:20:35Z", "likes_count": 524}, {"comment_by": "Eric Ma", "comment_text": "Ahh real world subnautica", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T18:20:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sven van der Vegt", "comment_text": "Hey!

Intelligent life evolves on a planet,  a technological society emerges, and then the planet becomes a Rogue. Could they survive? Could we? It&#39;s not too far fetched. Sure, if that society had space capabilities, many would escape that way. But how many would be left behind? Think about our current state: We are a space faring civilization, but up to a point, we haven&#39;t yet developed the technology necessary to survive in space for extended periods of time without being dependent on the earth. But we already have technology that would allow us to survive in a rogue planet on the surface. Think, for example, nuclear submarines. If the earth were to suddenly become a Rogue planet, you could theoretically survive inside a nuclear sub, even as the ocean and atmosphere around you freezes. A nuclear sub has its own powerplant fit to last a few decades, it creates its own heat, its own air, it recycles water. The only thing it doesn&#39;t produce is food, but we already know how to do that, if the power is available. Could a technological society such as ourselves create nuclear-sub like refugees, with enough nuclear fuel to last a reduced number of people for generations and generations?", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T15:50:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miguel Panayotty", "comment_text": "Nice treat at the end!

Before i watched this video, i was outside looking at the night sky, the stars,taking deep breaths, wandering whats out there, whats life after my death, do my soul/spirit go back to my origins or will it vanish, do my memories will vanish to, can i go out there without spaceship? did an alien just look at me at the nearest habitable planet, or that he wanders that someone/some humanoid look at him and thinks the same..

I think aquatic aliens could be able to produce metals by use of galvanic cells, long story short, you take two vessels containing concentrations of different metals dissolved in water, stick in electrodes (with could just be minerals containing high proportions of each) and you&#39;ll get pure metal on one of the electrodes. With the case of forging, while iron would be largely inaccessible metals like aluminium and lead can be shaped easily and could be produced galvanically. <br>I&#39;d imagine iron being treated as an unworkable waste product seeing that that they couldn&#39;t just be melted underwater.<br><br>You could use precious metals like gold, which is already pure in natural environments to use wiring for these electrodes and you could use hydrothermal vents as an energy source.
