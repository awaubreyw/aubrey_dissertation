Then, looking at it this way won&#39;t it be tHe best to just create simple informative podcasts(with a gameplay or a loop background video as background) and a voiceover. They would be the lowest budget and can still explain the topic, right?<br><br>Looking for advices and opinions:-)", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T13:49:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sourabh Rajput", "comment_text": "This much effort into one video and the people like xQc just sit there eating food showing thousands of people your videos made with your efforts and then say they were helping you by that but in reality he just stole thousands of views form you.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T09:01:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Benjarat Sayanivas", "comment_text": "Great Channel!!!!!", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T07:20:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wtflino", "comment_text": "dude, the rick and morty thing at the begginning, its like a... toy? yeah, sure ;) AHHAHAHHAHAH", "comment_date": "2022-05-13T14:51:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elad Asaban \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1- Jewish", "comment_text": "While you are making a video once every two months, the infographic show make 2 videos a day.", "comment_date": "2022-05-09T22:08:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hector Ibarra", "comment_text": "Que onda,g\u00fcey?

As the world moves towards creating more and more tools that aid in making our lives easier, it&#39;s easy to fall into the belief that great things are made easily. I find myself always wondering if I&#39;m good enough, or skilled enough; For example, does my lack of skill in drawing on paper, but my ability  to use 3D modeling software make me a cheater or less of a creator than those who worked before these tools. But it&#39;s important to be grateful of what we can accomplish today. Life becomes more complex with everyday as we create and learn new tools, new rules, and new ways of thinking. Being able to use said tools, without understanding how they were made, is a feat in and of itself.
