Nuclear Weapons Poliferation. The key ingredient that makes nukes so deadly is Uranium, and even then MAD is a thing, also we can convert to thorium plants which are much harder to weaponize since it is fertile rather than fizzile. 2. Nuclear wast and pollution. most waste is held in storage plants inside layers of concrete inside steel casks. even then they also bury it too which research has proven does not actually do much radiation wise. to further this point I will quote this article which I will cite. The accident in Japan at Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011 followed a major earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami flooded out the power supply and cooling systems of three power reactors, causing them to melt down and explode, breaching their confinement. Although 154,000 Japanese citizens were evacuated from a 12-mile exclusion zone around the power station, radiation exposure beyond the station grounds was limited. According to the report submitted to the International Atomic Energy Agency in June 2011:\r<br>\r<br>\u201cNo harmful health effects were found in 195,345 residents living in the vicinity of the plant who were screened by the end of May 2011. All the 1,080 children tested for thyroid gland exposure showed results within safe limits. By December, government health checks of some 1,700 residents who were evacuated from three municipalities showed that two-thirds received an external radiation dose within the normal international limit of 1 mSv/year, 98 percent were below 5 mSv/year, and 10 people were exposed to more than 10 mSv\u2026 [There] was no major public exposure, let alone deaths from radiation.\u201d \r<br>Nuclear waste disposal, although a continuing political problem in the U.S., is not any longer a technological problem. Most U.S. spent fuel, more than 90 percent of which could be recycled to extend nuclear power production by hundreds of years, is stored at present safely in impenetrable concrete-and-steel dry casks on the grounds of operating reactors, its radiation slowly declining. <br>3. Accidents and disasters. actually according to a mortality rate in 2012 coal was the highest and nuclear the lowest. that is comparing 100,000 to 90, wind and solar are actually more deadly and if not properly disposed of when damaged can actually pollute the environment.", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T05:36:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mano bianca", "comment_text": "All lies!!", "comment_date": "2021-01-27T13:28:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alessandro di Tocco", "comment_text": "South korea have civilian nuclear power and no nuclear bombs, North Korea have nuclear bombs and no civilian nuclear power.", "comment_date": "2021-01-27T12:12:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "McChess", "comment_text": "Its a joke guys", "comment_date": "2021-01-27T06:33:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ricardo Maximiliano Tovar Rdz.

First off, i think we need to stop worrying about nuclear proliferation. There have only been two bombs ever dropped on people and despite several other countries (including North Korea which never had nuclear reactors) getting nuclear weapons, they haven\u2019t ever used them. Everyone is deterred by self preservation because if they would be taken out if they even tried. And we have to face the fact that getting what you need to make a nuclear bomb is actually quite easy and all the information you need is available online for free. If a kid in the 80\u2019s can build a function nuclear reactor in his backyard, how easy do you think it is for someone today to build a nuclear weapon? Fact is we can\u2019t stop them, we can only detour them, and nuclear reactors have actually caused many countries to dismantle their nuclear weapons to use for fuel. <br><br>As for the waste problem, there are several solutions to this. The reprocessing you said we can\u2019t do yet we actually can do in high power reactors. You also have the nuclear pebble solution which significantly reduces the waste and eliminates the possibility of meltdown as they can simply design a heat plug at the bottom that will melt if the reactor gets too hot emptying out the reactor without any actions required by operators. We can make reactors that can go unsupervised now.<br><br>As for the accidents, those have all been from old reactors that were entirely avoidable if they had admired to protocol. Chernobyl was gross negligence, and Fukushima was outdated technology that had should have been updated but wasn\u2019t. In fact, there was a nearby power plant that\u2019s didn\u2019t melt down because it was newer. Also keep in mind Fukushima caused no deaths, aside from the botched evacuation which killed over 100,000.

It is certainly possible to build nuclear reactors while minimizing nuclear proliferation. Since the Cold War, the number of nuclear weapons in the US and in the world has decreased significantly (although the number of nuclear reactors has also dropped - but that needn&#39;t be the case!). More to the point, if you&#39;re concerned about other countries using nuclear fuel for weapons, as other commenters pointed out, give them Thorium. Thorium reactors don&#39;t produce Plutonium and are desirable for other reasons. (I also think that the video exaggerates our inability to tell if other countries are building weapons; we have ways of gaining intelligence).<br>2. First, we are good at storing nuclear waste and there&#39;s not much of it. All of the nuclear waste we have ever produced could fit on an area the size of a football field, with negligible risk of an accident if cared for properly. Further, newer designs for reactors would produce waste that could be reused entirely. And reactors could be kept offshore to further security.<br>3. Nuclear energy causes less deaths per unit power produced than any major energy source by far! On a par with wind and solar. (Look it up, it&#39;s baffling that most people don&#39;t know this.) And while the notable past accidents are truly terrifying, they were primarily the result of extraordinary negligence. Reactors of the future will merit improved design and safety measures.

The IAEA does this with a multitude of countries that people don&#39;t want to have nuclear weapons (as if the world doesn&#39;t already have enough to cause humanity&#39;s destruction).<br><br><br>The IAEA inspections act as an alert system providing a warning of the possible diversion of nuclear material from peaceful activities. The system relies on;<br>Material Accountability\u00a0\u2013 tracking all inward and outward transfers and the flow of materials in any nuclear facility. This includes sampling and analysis of nuclear material, on-site inspections, review and verification of operating records.<br>Physical Security\u00a0\u2013 restricting access to nuclear materials at the site of use.<br>Containment and Surveillance\u00a0\u2013 use of seals, automatic cameras and other instruments to detect unreported movement or tampering with nuclear materials, as well as spot checks on-site.<br><br>To this date, we don&#39;t have nuclear proliferation occurring (well, because of nuclear power).\u00a0<br><br>2. Spent Nuclear Fuel is quite literally the ONLY waste that is meticulously maintained. Never once has it hurt anyone, and it never will. Tell me, what are the plans for solar waste and the toxic elements, like cadmium, that don&#39;t decay? That can&#39;t be used in reprocessing? Also, we do have reactor designs for reprocessing, and France is a good example of this. It is quite perfectly within the scope of our scientific capabilities, but democratic administrations oppose this legislation. It&#39;s also worthy to point out of little waste there actually is. It is effectively nonexistent. The &quot;SNF could be use for proliferation&quot; is merely a part of point 1, not 2. Countries that have this technological capability already have nuclear weapons, so it&#39;s a red herring to even bring up. A &quot;milligram&quot; can kill you.. okay, show me a single person in the past 70 years that has died form the small amount of nuclear waste that is apparently so plentiful? Oh, wait, that&#39;s right.. not a single person. And reprocessing IS a good idea in regards to Germany. You know what is ironic in this context? They decommissioned all of their nuclear plants, went &quot;renewable,&quot; and ended up with higher electricity costs and CO2 emissions because of this, and now rely on natural gas to fill the void that nuclear left. Mhm, strange, wouldn&#39;t you say? The &quot;hundreds of thousands of tons of waste&quot; is, again, misleading like most of this video. Uranium is EXTREMELY dense, and so are a lot of nuclear byproducts of fission. It weighs a lot, but comparable to the amount of room it takes up, it is considerably less than you would think. For the US, it&#39;s about the dimensions of a football field that is 15 meters deep. That is negligible. Now, imagine if we also had reprocessing and the anti-nuclear nutcases weren&#39;t so patently absurd about opposing this legislation.\u00a0<br>3. Accidents and Disasters....<br><br><br>Well, look no further than shear data and statistical probability. If you are irrationally scared of nuclear incidents, of which only one in 6 decades (Chernobyl) resulted in the deaths of humans, but you are totally content on flying planes, you are a nutcase. No, there haven&#39;t been &quot;7 Major Accidents.&quot; That&#39;s a lie. Only THREE are considered major accidents: TMI, Fukushima, and Chernobyl.. TMI, nothing ended up even happening, and the other 4 you listed were even less of an impact.  These 3 are the only ones that suffered considerable core damage, and this point is a good example of why it is annoying listening to individuals who have no professional background in this industry. Realistically, only 2 are of any major concern, as nothing even happened with TMI, leaving just fukushima and chernobyl. &quot;Four of them released significant reactivity into the environment.&quot; Two*.. the word you&#39;re looking for is two*.  While many claimed that lands were &quot;unfit for human habitation,&quot; a lot of these efforts were just completely bananas. Japan is PERFECTLY fine to inhabit in the relative vicinity of the reactor plant. What you&#39;re claiming is just an utter lie and pure sci-fi. Even the local marine life is doing just fine, and Ukraine was never uninhabitable, ever. Only the immediate area, and to assert that it was for &quot;decades,&quot; again, is another lie. This just isn&#39;t true. You&#39;re propagating fear-mongering myths of the extent of radiation. How people reacted is NOT indicative of what was actually true or how they should have treated the situation. For example, the mass evacuation effort at Fukushima made things MUCH worse. Some ionizing radiation from a reactor plant isn&#39;t going to make countries uninhabitable. That is just fucking science fiction, dude. Honestly, did you guys consult experts for this video? &quot;The death toll was probably in the thousands.&quot; NO, NO IT WASN&#39;T. Where are you getting research? You should know this isn&#39;t true if you have read anything from the UN in this century. It&#39;s on the order of a few hundred, were the vast majority of deaths occurred from first responders. Chernobyl is credited by the UN as being responsible for about a quarter of the thyroid cancer cases,  and no other cancer. They reported 20,000 cases, leaving about 5000 cases of thyroid cancer attributed to Chernobyl. Thyroid cancer has a 1% mortality rate.. yes, abut 50, maybe 100, maybe less, died from cancer as a result from chernobyl, and a couple hundred from radiation sickness, and a few from fire and one from rubble. You can&#39;t even break 500 with the most recent reports, let alone &quot;in the thousands.&quot; It&#39;s like you&#39;re so careless with the data you&#39;re gathering, that you&#39;re taking it from reports in the 80s or early 90s. <br><br>Also, when you suggest &quot;different reactor types having a disaster every 30 years or so&quot; is, again, bull shit. What happened at Fukushima was entirely different than Chernobyl, and the consequences were too. NO ONE died at Fukushima as a result of radiation. NONE. Every experience is also a valuable learning lesson, especially as reactors gets more advanced. You also have to remember, only Chernobyl and Fukushima are the real offenders here when it comes to significant core damage and the release of radioactive material. Fukushima was hit by a 9.0 fucking earthquake and tsunami, and even then, the US&#39; NRC criticized their plant design and said it could have been avoided, which it could have by merely elevating diesel generators. Chernobyl, if you understand the physics, cann&#39;t happen with other reactor designs. It is unique to the RBMK-1000 reactor because it has a positive reactivity coefficient, and even then, they had to DELIBERATELY disable emergency cooling, bypass the scram, and disable other redundancies, as well as go below the minimum requirement of rods that are supposed to left in the core. That reactor couldn&#39;t even be licensed in the US, and reactor operators here wouldn&#39;t be able to disable safety equipment like that on a whim. The RBMK was also not a LWR, and it had a graphite moderator with NO containment vessel. Despite the poor regulations, incompetent operators that maliciously disabled safety features, and just utter stupidity, the situation could have been avoided if they merely installed a containment vessel, like they do with every other reactor in the world. We have reinforced steel with several feet of concrete here in the US. The design flaws were just the cherry on top for Chernobyl, and if one were to replicate that day perfectly with their own RBMK-1000 reactor, ALL of it could have been avoided form releasing radioactive material into the environment if they just had a damn containment vessel. <br><br>HOWEVER, despite these, nuclear still is statistically the safest with the lowest mortality rate, deaths/Kwh, and there are energy disasters that have been FAR worse that no one seems to talk nor care about, like the Banqaio Dam collapse in China that killed 200.000 people and displace 11 million from their homes. I guarantee 99.9% of the population has never even heard of this. We&#39;ll never get movies, series, or YouTube videos warning people about the dangerous/pros&amp;cons of hydroelectric power, nor the level of fear-mongering, fictionalization, and sensationalism that Nuclear receives. <br><br>If you care about climate change, you can&#39;t oppose nuclear. It&#39;s an oxymoron.

It is a simple and effective accommodation.  Here is a corrected and usable transcript:<br><br>3 REASONS WHY NUCLEAR ENERGY IS TERRIBLE (PART 2/3)<br><br>Three reasons why we should stop using nuclear energy: <br><br><br>1. Nuclear weapons proliferation. Nuclear technology made a violent entrance onto the world stage just one year after the world&#39;s first-ever nuclear test explosion in 1944. Two large cities were destroyed by just two, single bombs. After that, reactor technology slowly evolved as a means of generating electricity, but it&#39;s always been intimately connected with nuclear weapons technology. It&#39;s nearly impossible to develop nuclear weapons without access to reactor technology. In fact, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty serves the purpose of spreading nuclear reactor technology without spreading nuclear weapons; with limited success. In 40 years, five countries have developed their own weapons with the help of reactor technology. The fact of the matter is that it can be very hard to distinguish a covert nuclear weapons program from the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In the 1970s, the big nuclear powers were happily selling peaceful technology to smaller countries which then developed weapons of their own. The road to deadly nuclear weapons is always paved with peaceful reactors.<br><br><br><br>2. Nuclear waste and pollution. Spent nuclear fuel is not only radioactive, but also contains extremely poisonous chemical elements like plutonium. It loses its harmfulness only slowly over several tens of thousands of years. And there is also a process called reprocessing which means the extraction of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel. It can be used for two purposes: to build nuclear weapons or to use it as new fuel, but hardly any of it is used as fuel because we don&#39;t have the right kind of reactors for that. A milligram will kill you, a few kilograms make an atomic bomb, and even an inconspicuous country like Germany, literally has tons of the stuff just lying around because reprocessing sounded like a good idea decades ago. And where will all the waste go? After dumping it into the ocean was forbidden, we&#39;ve tried to bury it, but we can&#39;t find a place where it will definitely stay secure for tens of thousands of years. Over 30 countries operate nearly 400 reactors managing several hundred thousands of tons of nuclear waste and only one is currently serious about opening a permanent civilian waste storage: tiny Finland.<br><br><br><br>3. Accidents and disasters. Over sixty years of nuclear power usage there have been seven major accidents in reactors or facilities dealing with nuclear waste. Three of those were mostly contained, but four of them released significant amounts of radioactivity into the environment. In 1957, 1987, and 2011, large areas of land in Russia, Ukraine, and Japan, were rendered unfit for human habitation for decades to come. The number of deaths is highly disputed, but probably lies in the thousands. These disasters happened with nuclear reactors of very different types, in very different countries, and several decades apart. Looking at the numbers we may as well ask ourselves: are 10% of the world&#39;s energy supply worth a devastating disaster every 30 years? Would 30% be worth another Fukushima or Chernobyl somewhere on earth every 10 years? What area would have to be contaminated so we say \u201cno more?\u201d Where is the line? So, should we use nuclear energy? The risks may outweigh the benefits and maybe we should stop looking into this direction and drop this technology for good.", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T21:25:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik Flaaten", "comment_text": "Fukushima didn&#39;t have meltdown!

Thorium reactors (molten salt reactors) lack almost all the problems that uranium reactors have. Thorium can&#39;t be easily weaponized so they don&#39;t contribute to proliferation. You have to constantly ADD heat rather than maintain cooling to keep a reaction going, so you don&#39;t have the risk of meltdowns (uranium reactor containment domes explode and release radiation because the water used to cool it evaporates too much and produces pressure until a critical failure-- no water cooling is necessary for MSRs). Thorium doesn&#39;t produce huge amounts of horribly dangerous waste. Thorium is also multiple times more efficient and more plentiful on Earth than uranium. Literally the only reason we chose to pursue uranium power is because it was more weaponizable, and once the first generation of uranium-plutonium fuel cycle reactors were built, no energy corporation wanted to be the first to invest in replacing their infrastructure, which is why we still use dangerous reactors from the 70s (yes, believe it or not, in many ways capitalism HOLDS BACK innovation and technological progress). But the foundational research has already been done 40-50 years ago.<br><br>We could easily make the obvious choice to switch over if we had the means to collectively invest based on what would benefit society and humanity rather than what will maintain and maximize profit next quarter. In countries like India they are already pursuing thorium power, a huge advantage and benefit moving into the mid 21st century. But yeah; I just hate to see ALL nuclear power demonized as if it&#39;s all as terrible as what we have now. I would like to see Green Parties and other left-wing and social ecological institutions push to revamp our nuclear power with thorium, both for safety and efficiency. Maybe it can be phased out altogether one day, but in the meantime it&#39;d BE A HUGE step forward. The fact that almost no one has heard of thorium energy demonstrates the power of the energy lobbies.

However, the only thing I found was that you guys failed to mention thermal pollution. It is a large problem for nuclear energy plants- fission creates a lot of heat (obviously, this is needed to convert water to steam and turn the turbine, etc.). Water is used in nuclear energy plants to avoid the plant being overheated, but in the process \u201cpicks up\u201d the heat. This water used to be directly piped back into local ponds, which killed tons of fish and other aquatic organisms. Because thermal pollution is really hard to detect (bordering on impossible), we didn\u2019t even know why nearby fish were dying for many, many years. Today, holding ponds can be created and used to literally hold the hot water until it cools, but of course this solution isn\u2019t perfect. Ultimately, the point here is that I think you guys did a fantastic job as regards the more well-known risks of nuclear energy, but you may have accidentally neglected to talk about another type of pollution that, while not as well known, can be devastating.", "comment_date": "2018-02-03T00:50:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "United Brony", "comment_text": "Fallout 2", "comment_date": "2018-02-02T05:50:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Regalian Lin", "comment_text": "Ted talks on this subject said after research there was no deaths due to radiation in those examples given though?", "comment_date": "2018-02-01T12:57:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jere Pet\u00e4jist\u00f6", "comment_text": "Suomi", "comment_date": "2018-01-30T19:01:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hayden Lau", "comment_text": "Germany, inconspicuous country, said no one ever", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T02:12:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TrollFace", "comment_text": "nuclear is bad and stupid", "comment_date": "2018-01-26T12:27:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Arthur", "comment_text": "1) As for weapons, you&#39;ll never be able to stop that.

It&#39;s not like solar or wind, where we hope we can make it more efficient by researching it.

MSR is liquid fuel, not water cooled, at ambient pressure and cannot melt down, and burns nearly 100% of its fuel and does not need reprocessing or storage. In fact MSR is the answer to burning the existing stored nuclear waste. It is a common misconception to lump all nuclear reactor types together, but would have been much more informative if the specific problems with each type were explained. Some people are aware that Thorium can be used in a reactor but do not realise that it is the reactor technology that is the problem/solution, not the fuel. It should be noted that the MSR was shown to be a viable working reactor in the 1950s, and that China and other countries are now reopening this technology to make Gen IV nuclear reactors for the future.

A couple billion years ago the natural concentration of 235U was high enough that a uranium vein with water running through reached criticality (that&#39;s what it&#39;s called when a nuclear reaction becomes self-sustaining) and began to produce heat. This heat eventually boiled the water and it erupted like a geyser which in turn stopped the reaction for a time (because that natural reactor needed the water as a moderator* like many modern reactors do) until the water flowed back in and started the process over again. <br><br>*a moderator is any substance used to slow down the neutrons being emitted by the nuclear fuel. Neutrons emitted by the fuel are initially actually moving too fast to cause fission of other atoms of fuel in so called thermal reactors, so the neutrons are made to travel through the moderator, as they do they bounce off the atoms of the moderator and lose some energy until they reach an energy state (speed) called the thermal region.", "comment_date": "2016-11-11T07:17:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gaurav Ghosh", "comment_text": "no, let&#39;s use nuclear energy but only with thorium.", "comment_date": "2016-11-11T04:35:48Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "angelheart1701", "comment_text": "Um... at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEYbgyL5n1g&amp;t=1m00s\">1:00</a>...

In fact, there are designs that don&#39;t even use uranium.<br><br>If we only made airplanes that were unsafe to fly, nobody would fly, and airplanes would be seen as not essential. But the problem of global travel is well understood, and so investing in safer aircraft design made sense. Here, the energy crisis is poorly understood, and the possible energy generation systems are also poorly understood by the general public. Therefore, while the need is as or more pressing than safe flight, the powers that be are unwilling to invest in better, safer, and more practical reactor designs.<br><br>None of these reasons are due to the inherent nature of the technology. We took a design made for ocean use (in ships and subs) and put it on land, where we spend most of our time convincing it that it&#39;s still at sea. Just as you wouldn&#39;t use a cargo plane for commercial flight, it it equally silly to insist that we have to use light water reactors on land--a place that they are inherently not designed for.<br><br>If you study the energy situation, it quickly becomes obvious that nuclear is one of the most powerful and valuable technologies with very low risks--for comparison, while thousands might have been killed by radiation released, millions are definitely killed by the by-products of the fossil fuels used, and the radiation release from those, especially coal, is orders of magnitude higher than from nuclear power. Other forms of clean energy produce variable and relatively small amounts of power, making them impractical for large-scale generation.

We can&#39;t switch it off and let it be, closing a plant haven&#39;t been properly funded (or funded at ALL for that matter).. and expending them would mean a massive cost for a very limited expansion (and we&#39;d still be working with a 50+y old reactors prone to disaster.. AND the closing up cost will still be at the end of the road!<br>So basically no matter our choices now we&#39;ll have to pay an efty price for what&#39;s to come, and the price rise will hurt a lot no matter what.. so yeah the price we&#39;re paying now isn&#39;t the right price at all, we&#39;ve been living a dream and will have to wake up with a slap in the face, and that&#39;s never fun<br><br>basically for france alone we&#39;ll have to invest 50b \u20ac to expand the current plants to 60+ years.. which is ludicrous whereas you&#39;re pro or con nuclear energy, the cost is massive for such a little gain.. can you imagine how many solar/wind/tidal plant we could create with that kind of money? <br><br>well I&#39;ve run the numbers and with those 50b\u20ac we could create at the very least 22 solar plant powering up 580MW each.. sure it won&#39;t replace the whole parc, but those facilities would be brand NEW, safe and easy to build and run, and would last way longer than those fixes we&#39;re planning to put on the old plants we have.<br><br>and what I just mentioned was only the cost to update the current plants to keep them running for a little longer (granted they ARE validated by the authorities.. which isn&#39;t 100% sure, it has to be checked plant per plant, some might not go through the tests).. then will still come the closing up cost.. official numbers (probably bottom prices, if things goes wrong it can go higher but still..) 123B\u20ac to close up europe&#39;s plants up to 2050.. PLUS the toxic waste management.. which funnily enough is higher than the closing cost: 130B\u20ac.. <br><br>So to sum it up, just to have nuclear energy up to 2050 europe need to invest 123B\u20ac+130B\u20ac to close them up.. I mentioned france plan to use 50B just to keep them running that far.. so you can add up UK, italy etc that will probably do the same and you get over 400b\u20ac easily.. <br><br>Like I said you can think what you want about nuclear energy but facts are facts: it costs a fortune in the end, if people would have to pay the real price of nuclear they would probably change their mind about it.. but that will come sooner than later for obvious reason. <br><br>Also all that money wasted into it WON&#39;T go to clean energy, meaning we&#39;ll have to invest more money to replace our plants ANYWAY, whereas we choose to be new nuclear power plants or solar, wind, whatever.. <br>Good to mention also that unlike the video said thorium seem to be the future of nuclear energy.. well maybe, but that&#39;s not before the end of this century, by then I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ll either be fucked up by climate change, or we would have found a way around it already, meaning those plants will just arrive after the war... Because our 70&#39;s plants are for the most part already planned to be switched with new nuclear ones, the new EPR NM plants.. which is basically the same as the 70&#39;s ones, just a bit more efficient.. IF they ever work, because as a matter of fact we&#39;re investing so much money and we&#39;ve never made it work so far! (no joke, look it up)<br><br>Over the years I&#39;ve come from pro nuclear 100% to let&#39;s have a mix of both, to let&#39;s use our current nuclear  plants for our transition and invest in a few new plants to be the bottom part of our mix (those can run 24/7 and emits close to no CO\u00b2). <br>and maybe one day have the fusion plants take over and solve all our problems.. <br><br>bottom line: save up energy, it&#39;s our best hope for the future", "comment_date": "2016-10-07T23:43:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lars", "comment_text": "Or can&#39;t they just place all the nuclear plants in one place so if it would be destroyed all radiation that will be leaked by the plants only stack up in one place and only in THAT place.

Should we develop a method to get rid of the waste in a more elegant way, this project is design so that we can recover the containers that were buried.

But the link between nuclear power and nuclear weapons is purely imaginary, not physical, and no amount of bias can really justify attempts to link the two.<br><br>The core issue is that you cannot use waste-grade plutonium in nuclear weapons. Yes, as of writing, YOU CAN NOT PHYSICALLY DO IT, NO TECHNOLOGY OR THEORETICAL METHOD CONCEIVABLE ALLOWS YOU TO SUSTAIN A NUCLEAR CHAIN REACTION IN THE FAST NEUTRON SPECTRUM WITH PLUTONIUM CONTAINING OVER 20% PU-240!!! It simply contains too much Pu-240 and as a result its critical mass approaches INFINITY for the fast-neutron spectrum that nuclear weapons utilize. You are not even dealing with a very slight &quot;maybe it&#39;s possible&quot;, you are dealing with &quot;no, it is completely absolutely utterly impossible and it makes just as much sense as claiming 1 + 1 = 5&quot;.<br><br>Now, maybe, and this is a very big maybe, we will find a way to separate Pu-239 (the fuel isotope) from Pu-240 (the problem isotope) in the distant future, using technology that supersedes the effectiveness of current enrichment by several orders of magnitude. But this is effectively converting waste-grade plutonium to weapons-grade (you are not using waste-grade plutonium directly in a bomb, because again this is IMPOSSIBLE TO DO), and even then there will be absolutely no sensible way to justify producing weapons-grade plutonium via this route because it will always be easier, faster, and more efficient to enrich uranium, or just produce very pure plutonium to begin with.<br><br>The grey horse is reactor-grade plutonium, produced as a &quot;waste&quot; product from certain specialized reactors, but mostly produced from low-burnup cycling in heavy water reactors and in research reactors. It is called &#39;reactor grade&quot; because it can support a nuclear fission chain reaction under the right circumstances, but usually these circumstances are long burnup and slow reaction propagation, with both cases being the polar opposites of what nuclear weapons need to favor. In the future, if we ever develop the Gen IV reactors that operate on the plutonium cycle, we will likely be mixing weapons grade plutonium with waste grade plutonium to produce this sort of in-between plutonium, ideal for fueling those reactors but far less useful for fueling weapons. That said, you can use reactor-grade plutonium in weapons and this has been done a few times before, but the yield and reliability of the weapon is mediocre at best and decreases exponentially as you approach 20% Pu-240. And, most importantly, you still need to develop the necessary implosion technology, which is arguably the most difficult part of building plutonium bombs to begin with. Because of this, only a few nuclear weapons in human history have utilized reactor-grade plutonium and these were strictly delegated to tests, resulting in mediocre weapon yield at best (see US-UK test using plutonium from a Magnox reactor in the late 60s) and a complete dud at worst (see most recent Korean weapon test that &quot;fizzled&quot;). Reactor-grade plutonium production across a fleet of nuclear power plants is also much slower than simply dedicating a couple reactors entirely towards producing weapons-grade plutonium, and would produce far less energy than dedicated power plant reactors, so why even bother?", "comment_date": "2016-04-12T16:00:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Kraus", "comment_text": "I fact often overlooked when talking about nuclear reactors.

My main problem with fission nuclear energy is that it simply has too many risks to justify its perceived benefits.  Just look at what happened at Chernobyl and what nearly happened at Three Mile Island long before that.  Secondly, I believe that even if the risks could be contained, we lack the discipline to properly maintain our fission nuclear technology, as evidenced by the fact that some fission nuclear power plants aren&#39;t even safe to begin with due to their shoddy construction.  Maybe fission nuclear plants could be built on a much smaller scale to reduce the risk of contamination if one of them blows up.  Maybe they could be built on floating modules out in the ocean with long, thick wires taking their power to shore.  But even if those things were possible, I still don&#39;t know how well they would work because no matter how you cut it, fission nuclear energy is potentially dangerous to everything around it, including the atmosphere itself.

In addition, the main cancers that would be expected due to fallout exposure are highly treatable.\u00a0<br>- The Chernobyl exclusion zone has become a nearly pristine nature preserve now that humans aren&#39;t there polluting it anymore.<br>- The Fukushima exclusion zone is due purely to fear-mongering, as the statistical increase in expected cancers living right up to the gates of the plant is negligible.\u00a0<br>- The Fukushima accident was only upgraded to INES-7 due to political pressure from ignorant environmentalists. It meets none of the criteria or guidelines specified by the IEA for being classified as a level 7 event.<br>- There are multiple places in the world with natural radiation levels above those of Fukushima and Chernobyl, whose cancer rates are shown in some cases to be <b>LESS</b> than those of areas with lower background radiation.<br><br>- Currently operating civilian reactors are nothing more than scaled up military designs, which is why there is any weapons proliferation concern at all.\u00a0<br>- Currently operating civilian reactor designs are well over half a century old, which is why they have any kind of accident danger at all. How much do you think technology has progressed since the 1950s?<br>- Currently operating civilian reactor designs are the reason there is any long-lived nuclear waste at all. Bowever, that waste can be reburned in newer <b>and</b> older designs and essentially rendered harmless. It is due to an executive order by President Carter that the United States does not reprocess waste and reburn it in reactors. This executive order came from ignorant environmentalist pressure as well as those advocating nuclear disarmament.\u00a0<br>- Ignorant environmentalists spewing &quot;radiation as a boogey-man&quot; propaganda is the reason we&#39;re stuck with these old designs, as it is impossible for any replacement designs to get traction due to all of the government red tape and public fear.<br>- Plutonium&#39;s toxicity is greatly exaggerated. Chemically it is roughly as toxic as lead. Radiologically plutonium must be ingested to present a significant hazard for most isotopes.\u00a0<br>- Modern, safer reactor designs can be built that do not produce or require plutonium or uranium and result in waste products that only last roughly 200 years. However, once again pressure from environmentalists is preventing this progress.<br>- Both wind and solar require far nastier chemicals used in their construction than the construction of a modern nuclear power plant design, are far more expensive, and in the case of wind, far more environmentally destructive.

Three mile island emitted only about 480PBq, and Kyshtum was about 80PBq - just lumping those together as &quot;significant amounts of radiation&quot; completely ignores the actual scale of the accidents, even if we ignore the fact that not all radioactive material is equally dangerous (most of the TMI output is considered harmless).\u00a0<br><br>I get that you&#39;re making two videos, and each represent a different side, but doing a for/against doesn&#39;t mean you have to omit facts in either of them.
