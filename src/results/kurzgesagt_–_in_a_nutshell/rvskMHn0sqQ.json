If one person of a poor city or tribe plants some seeds so he can eat the food that grows out of that seed and he notices the advantages he creates. And because of the fertile soil in Africa he could plant seeds on a much bigger scale and make a farm out of it. So just like we did in other prosperous countries. The problem here is not that they aren&#39;t able to plant seeds and create agriculture and farms, the problem here is the mindset of the rest of the people living there. If you tell people working there &#39;if you work ten times harder tomorrow I will give you a 5 dollar bonus&#39;, so you give them the 5 dollars because they worked harder, you would suspect that they would start working harder because they noticed that they would earn more. But no because of their mindset they just don&#39;t show up the next day because they need to spend that 5 dollars. If someone builds a farm or creates proper agriculture the rest of the people just take what they can get and move on, they don&#39;t think ahead like we do in the rest of the world. That isn&#39;t racism, it&#39;s just their education, they got that mindset from their parents. That&#39;s also why they were never able to step out of their lifestyle after they got so much money, support and help from other countries. From the moment they stop helping Africa, the people living their will just go back to spend what they can spend and eat what they eat. \u201cIf you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime&quot;, in Africa that would say: &quot;If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.

I think that&#39;s great. Technically, though, that isn&#39;t altruism. Helping others isn&#39;t even the essence of altruism. That is a common misconception. Actually the essence of altruism is self-sacrifice. If you benefit others while benefiting yourself at the same time, that is by definition not altruistic. Hence egoistic altruism is an oxymoron.<br><br>Benefiting other people is great, as it truly does make the world a better place for you to live in, again generally speaking, depending on who you&#39;re helping or in what way you&#39;re helping them. For example, benefiting others who are trying to actively harm others in turn does not make the world a better place. Nor does helping others who only seek to take advantage of your benevolence so that they don&#39;t have to lift a finger to help themselves, and can live purely at the expense of others such as yourself.  That&#39;s because these forms of helping others are not positive sum. They are just other ways to have a relationship where one person wins and another person loses, except that you aren&#39;t the beneficiary. As a consequence of such relationships, the value gained for some people comes at the cost of value lost for other people, so that there is no net gain, and the world as a whole does not get better. It is also important to point out that not only does helping others often benefit yourself, but harming others comes at a terrible inherent cost to yourself: making enemies. And when you can benefit yourself by helping others instead, while having a much greater potential to create friends in the process, the choice is obvious.<br><br>Given these basic facts about human relationships, one should ask a more basic question: why is it necessary to think of benefitting others as an end in itself in the first place? If everyone can build positive social relationships on a selfish basis, then people do not have to think of others first in order to have a cohesive and healthy society. If one wants to take some time, even the vast majority of one&#39;s time, or all of it if that was possible, to benefit oneself without effecting others one way or the other, would that be wrong? If you truly respect and love yourself, you should understand that other people are a value *to you*, and that is the whole point of having relationships, hence it is a tragic mistake to put those relationships, or the well being of others, ahead of your own well being. You deserve to be the primary focus of your efforts. Of course if you are morally consistent, you should recognize that other people likewise are entitled to benefit themselves, and since it is in their interest to do so in a way which does not harm you, and they are smart enough to understand that, there should be no cause for distrust or resentment. To live your life for your own purposes, alongside others who are doing their own thing with your blessing, is the true nature of partnership.<br><br>Altruism, as the morality of subjugation and sacrifice as such, is an old, mistaken idea, which unfortunately has the weight of a lot of moral tradition, including religious tradition, thrown behind it. It isn&#39;t necessary at all. In fact it is quite destructive, and should not be the basis of moral judgement or aspiration. As fast as the world has grown over the last few hundred years, it could grow so much faster if the people doing the work of growing it were better motivated and if they believed in themselves, instead of having their spirits depressed by the belief that they owe their whole lives to everyone but themselves. Slaves do not make good workers. Without the ability to benefit from their own efforts, they lack the proper motivation, and their work suffers. The same is true for those who are enslaved in spirit, who though they have the legal right to enjoy the fruits of their own labour, lack the self-esteem, the sense of moral entitlement, to do so committedly, proudly, and unapologetically.", "comment_date": "2021-12-05T23:24:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rico", "comment_text": "I was wondering why this video felt like propaganda and then it says it\u2019s by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2021-12-05T23:18:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glamastro", "comment_text": "Ok.. question...<br>Now that the &quot;money pie&quot; isn&#39;t finite, but the &quot;resources pie&quot; still is, won&#39;t that mean inflation will put things back to the way they were( the amount of money pie in exchange for resources pie will increase and hence making the money pie larger won&#39;t change anything?)", "comment_date": "2021-12-05T06:56:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luguime", "comment_text": "hahahahaha...

And so you see it is because we all were born with the sin of Adam, who was deceived by Satan the devil to choose the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge and that is how come now every past teaching of what those carnivorous so-called Christian and every other religious education institutions had been preaching so unrighteous and totally opposite of the Truth about how to be obeying our Most Loving Creator Gods Commandments. So I am writing this to all my brothers and sisters who really want to receive an honest to goodness True Clarification of why our Divine Creator God sent here on His magnificent beautiful only livable planet His Beloved Son Jesus Christ to teach us, brothers and sisters how to 1st pray to be humble &amp; born again to truly want to obey the1st Commandment of our Holy Father inscribed on those stone tablets, and that is to love our Almighty Creator God with ALL our heart, and with ALL our newly cleansed spiritual mind, and with ALL our now forgiven soul. Again it is now the time to sincerely really pray and give all your utmost effort to become a vegan which is being obedient to no killing but eating the true healing food that our Most Healing Creator God planted here for both precious beautiful families. Now to receive our Divine Gods Real Healing and Blessings to be delivered from that evil manipulation and this carnivorous corrupt system, we know that we can be checking online to be seeing so much of what we had not been taught that was vitally important, things that are obviously intolerable to everyone to deal with or horribly wrong, and so simply or possibly take the time to type in some factual data &amp; stats on just how many newborn deformities and diseases, and these subjects just never seem to get brought to mind to every brother and sister, and that is because our parents and teachers just couldn&#39;t see how those important matters would have certain consequences, you know, for instance, how we all feel about the continuing of high rising prices that affects our health with frustrations, animosity and financial intolerable family problems. And so you see the conniving, swindling world system just cannot provide much of any good solution. So you see, we need to pray to our Holy Father and be a reborn heart to start to faithfully focus on the healing diet, and also we can type whatever questions and be able to find out so much of our histories of the stubborn pride and egotistic unrighteous ways that just could never come close to the True Wisdom of our Holy Fathers&#39; Miraculous Blessings, and so again we must pray to stay obeying our Divine Creator Gods Commandments. And then we are blessed to receive our Holy Fathers Gift of the Holy Spirit to go forth and freely get out to share all that what Christ Jesus had taught us to do that He would be with us always, and we continue giving all praise to our Divine Heavenly Father for His Grace and Glorious Gifts, now and forever Amen.", "comment_date": "2021-07-02T14:52:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vladimir Sevastyanov", "comment_text": "You guys are just awesome!

This is a major flaw, since its conflicting even with &quot;kurzgesagt&quot;&#39;s own videos about the climate change. Nothing in nature is infinitely growing or has an unlimited lifespan. Since the human race is a part of nature, they are also bound to these laws. Secondly and this in line with the first flaw, there are just not enough resources for all countries on earth to reach the development of the highly industrialized countries. Thirdly and this is the saddest part about this is the presumption that class is completely ignored in this video. It is highly likely that almost all people on earth want the same stuff we have in our first world, but there is an interest of the ruling class to actually keep many people poor so they may fulfill the role as an industrial reserve army or a labour force reservoir to exploit as the bourgeois sees fit.

There are a lot of reasons why people look for better solutions to existing problems or for new solutions to as-of-yet unsolved problems, be it a desire to make an existing solution less of a burden to the inventors or innovators, to find a way to save more lives, or just because the inventors and innovators have a genuine passion for the subject matter. The rate of innovation is also not strictly dependent on the number of wealthy patrons you have, though more funding never hurts, the biggest bottleneck to innovation and invention is the number of passionate people you have working on the project in question. One of the very first professors I had in my engineering undergrad told us the story of a European inventor (whose name eludes me as of this moment) who had major funding from several nations to invent the world&#39;s first heavier-than-air flying machine. When he read in the paper that two bicycle shop owners in Ohio had done it first, he just quit, because the reputational and financial incentive were gone. No one is going to get rich off of being the second person to invent the airplane, so he didn&#39;t bother. The lesson that our professor was trying to tell us is that two people with little to no funding but a lot of passion for the subject will outpace a single person with a lot of funding but little to no interest in the subject matter beyond what they can gain personally from it every single time.

While the argument is laid out great, the reality looks way more grim: Innovation needs resources; It&#39;s great if you can pay for 7 times as much, but at the same time there must be produced collectively 7 times as much. However, there are only so much resources on earth, distributed over countries. Countries that have different cultures and different levels of development. One needs a minimum level of development on a country wide scale to be able to use these resources according to the context of the video. However, in a less developed country the mentality might be like this &quot;If I work hard, I can barely survive here. If I work less, rich people will come and give me money...&quot;. While I am well aware, that this is a provocative argument and not many people think like this, it is sufficient if the right people there think like this. Donald Trump is a perfect example of such a man in power, that does not share the same thinking as the majority of the FIRST WORLD  country he is ruling. Further more, the pie increases each year, yes, but not equally! If you have a lot of land (referencing the picture in the beginning of the video), the pie stack is bigger in volume than when you have less land. Thus, wars for resources are still a thing and robbing and plundering happens now less visible on Wallstreet. Patent law and lobbying are major factors too and the focus or universities is shifted from &quot;push our knowledge further&quot; to &quot;push economic interests further&quot;. While I, myself, would strongly support an idealistic world, where everyone is better off and knowledge is SHARED instead of monopolized, I see this only possible if the way of thinking of people in general changes and I don&#39;t know how we should achieve that on a grand scale...

All of these factors contribute to stagnation, corruption and greed, etc. in moderate amounts, they are negligible, as a matter of fact, this video inspires greed through the lens of selfish altruism; but excess corruption can seriously debilitate a nation and collapse of a proper familial structure spells the end of a civilization. We shouldn\u2019t dispel the idea of a second dark ages too quickly, despite how unreasonable it sounds. But the world is not a pretty place, not everyone knows that. This video is entirely predicated on the presumption that none of these factors tilt the balance of power too far in one direction or the other, and off the very faith we have in western civilization to continue existing.

You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God.

For instance, there are limited number of cell phone companies. USA, China, S.Korea dominates the global cell phone market. Even developed countries like UK, Germany, France can&#39;t enter those markets because of the competition.<br>This situation makes them stay poor if they have not enough natural resources. They can&#39;t invest in education, healthcare systems, infrastructure, etc.<br>One option would be to let foreign firms create businesses inside your country to use the cheap labor, so the country can increase its tax income, and can learn related technologies from those firms by observing, faking, or by agreements.

Innovation has always happened. As a matter of fact, it happens at an exponential rate. However, this means that it starts small, then starts to get big. This is because the more things there are to draw knowledge from, the faster we can think of things. The more we can connect ideas, the more we can find the best ideas. But new ideas don&#39;t come out of nowhere, thus it takes time for the amount of ideas to increase. 2) Their description of economics has the right idea, that demand and free market leads to innovation, but its watered down in a way that makes central planning seem like a good idea. That is a problem, because central planning attempts to take away personal demand which leads to 1) slower innovation, and 2) doesn&#39;t meet personal demands. So when they say &#39;imagine how much farther along in cancer research if more people could pay for it&#39; isn&#39;t exactly an accurate statement because the ability to pay for something doesn&#39;t determine the supply. Say a million people were to pay one dollar for cancer research, the funding would only be one million dollars, thus they only get a million dollars of benefits.

Social rights and benefits have been based on social revolutions, and there are even societies that still exploit the worker under the excuse of &quot;development&quot;. What really changed is the social order, democratic societies began, and in practice, they had little democracy: women couldn&#39;t vote, they had no right to study or develop as a person, the poor became even poorer because  of industrial exploitation, identical to how they approach it at the beginning of the video with the explanation of the cake. In countries like Chile, workers weren&#39;t even paid with money, but tokens were used that only served to exchange within the place where they worked. Perhaps those that I emphasize isn&#39;t so visible today, perhaps they will be able to say that at least it has been improving. But under what consequences? Repercussions that continue to this day when they see that in highly developed societies they don&#39;t have sufficient social economic security to defend themselves against a virus. Despite all the scientific and technological development, the economy that dominates and is based on industrial development, remains precarious due to the economic concentration in a few. All of the above has to do with the type of economic system related to the industrial period. What changes, apart from the economic one that has benefited a small group of people, have been thanks to the industrial era? The positive was the development of the sciences, but if we take a detailed tour of human society, not much has benefited for collective development. Because although we look at our cities and their buildings, cars and their great growth thanks to that &quot;economy&quot;, it is still an unequal and unfair system.

Being a lifelong Christian and conservative, my opinion on this matter is quite different. Yes, Capitalism drives us to innovation and we all benefit from it, sometimes leading all to greater increase in wealth, or as the diagram illustrated it, an increase in pie. However, there is no good from which bad does not come. For a business to thrive and increase in power and income, there has to be another business which dies out. This is the glorious business cycle and how it should work. The way this relates to goodness and being helpful to others is an important one. Spreading the message that God has sent Jesus Christ to accept our sin and die for us is the ultimate happiness for me, for I am boosting my faith while bringing others to God to have life after death. The competitiveness of Capitalism is great because it lets us all learn and help ourselves, boosting the American economy and boosting our own self interests. We all need to be good to others, but we do not only feel good from profit. We show others the ultimate sacrifice of our Lord and how he has given us amazing things.

This looks good on paper but in reality this is not what happens. As more people work on something the output of each individual decreases because of the size (administration, communication, worker motivation etc.). This is the basic idea of economy and it has been proved in many cases. After a point the added value of 1 man is close to 0. This mechanism is constantly dropping the wages (as worker supply rises) and after a certain point the people cannot buy what the rich can and they could earlier. <br><br><br>Even if you don&#39;t agree with this argument, there is another reasoning. The &quot;production of things&quot; (most of the time) depends on materials. But materials (iron, litium for batteries, helium etc.) are not endless. If we keep expanding without borders then the price of these things rises more quickly (because the demand rises for it and it is getting scarce faster) and then the poor cannot buy those thigns once again. (And I haven&#39;t even opened up the conversation on what this does to the climate.)<br><br><br>All in all, there are some true points in this story but it doesn&#39;t takes into account the damage we do by expanding products to everyone (resources run out faster) and some economical mechanisms. Also some other things are also needed (laws, barriers) which prevent us from eating up everything this planet has to offer. Without these steps their argument cannot become&quot;true&quot;. <br>Their argument also makes the assumption that if more people work in science then the solution is closer. But in reality we do not know the technologal boundaries and this might not be true.

There are routes of education and knowledge of place and space that is more valuable to human health and safety. This knowledge is often inside the minds and hearts of Indigenous people all over the world. People who love and respect the land understand natural patterns, locations, and resources that are most valuable.  I get that conquest and theft makes the convenience simpler to achieve, but we should also take the time to value every form of knowledge so that we can advance technologically, but not do it at the stake of Earth&#39;s health, or minority wellness. If we advance too far technologically, the balance of Earth&#39;s atmosphere can be offset, causing a negative reaction even if we can&#39;t see it right away. Climate change is an example with flash floods, drought, tornados, earthquakes and more all increasingly occurring after we began to mine and frack for fossil fuels. And the decrease of health and safety policy surrounding people of color, as we are the ones who have been most impacted by loss of biodiversity and resource value; and are navigating the system of federal policy to change our conditions. <br><br>Also, some people enjoy simplicity. This life is unfair with politics, it transfers power. But everyone has their own power and every little action taken from planting a tree, to buying a biodegradable product in a supermarket is a way of grasping our power and changing the world. <br><br>My suggestion is: rather than conquering the world as a major power source, we first, collaborate with people, understand their needs, educate the minority population about the various opportunities that could be available and we benefits. Then, we can customize the products produced based on their Intergenerational wisdom and geographical region. <br><br>Everyone deserves a good education, clean water, clean and nourishing food, and healthcare....but we all have different needs, and sorry to say, but the specific ingredients in a European diet does not nourish the body in the same way for everyone which can cause disparity in health and wellness. I can tell you that as an Indigenous person, I wish I had the knowledge of my ancestors of what to eat off the land to cure my symptoms, because our people ARE doctors...as well as engineers, mathematicians, etc. We have developed knowledge over centuries of time, and though our history may not be as clear cut, it is there. It is wrapped in who we are.

Agreed, life doesn&#39;t have to be a zero sum game. That&#39;s all true. Every evil idea is based on a nugget of moral truth, otherwise it wouldn&#39;t get any traction.<br><br>I&#39;ll start with the factually wrong before I get to the things about this that are morally repulsive. One: there is no linear relationship between money spent on research and innovation. If the old image of the lone genius scientist inventing a flying car in his basement was wrong, the modern idea that science is a commodity produced in labs like cheese out of a dairy is even more wrong. For a variety of reasons, most labs produce junk science. The science that isn&#39;t junk mostly has very narrow applications: for example, a specific drug alleviates specific symptoms of a particular disease in some people. Most science of that sort doesn&#39;t lead to any broader understanding of the universe.<br>Some labs do good science, consistently, and that&#39;s why we have amazing technology. But ten times the money and ten times the number of researchers doesn&#39;t = ten times the science. It maybe results in 1.1 times the science.

The more you invest, the more expensive a product/service becomes. Its nice to theorize about this ideal world, but when the 1% keep skimming all the cream of the top, there will never be enough cream for the less fortunate. So, you end up becoming just as competitive and selfish as the people you despise in order to take what others worked harder than you to produce. It is true that all the new technology and science does eventually make its way to the mainstream consumer, but it happens at such a slow rate that innovation outruns deployment which ends up causing increased income inequality. Trying to leverage it back into balance is really hard and can lead to critically stable economic models. How do you put a monetary value on productivity? How can two people who work the same hours and deliver the same amount of end product not receive the same monetary compensation for their effort? One is just better at negotiation and as such is promoted faster than the other, even though both deliver the same results. If both were to receive the same promotions, the big boss would just increase the selling price of the business offers. This loops back on the workers and now they have to work harder just to sustain the same level of living comfort. Then we account for automation and the internet where everyone becomes more diverse, so now people get laid off simply because the business no longer requires their inputs. These people could start their own businesses, which then encourages competitiveness and selfishness. The world no longer cares about whether a person&#39;s needs are looked after just for the sake of it. There are always strings attached. Make your workers happier because then they will give you more effort and you can exploit them further.<br><br><br>It is the way things are for now and until we can convince ourselves that there is enough to go around for everyone, nobody will be satisfied.

Live with a tribe, you still have to do a lot of those things, though friends and family can help. Bigger tribes become more efficient, each person is safer and better off than they were in a smaller tribe, because they have a lot of people that can defend against attackers, raid others, and gather resources. As societies build, less people need to be dedicated just to farming, because now you can have people whose job it is just to count food, do finances, and so on. You don&#39;t industrialize, but you do invent tools. Societies can also improve human output through motivations, from the nice (honor and caring for your community), to the neutral (profits) to the immoral (slaves are very motivated). You can spend less time defending yourself and more time farming, and people who are good at certain tasks or enjoy them more have more freedom to do them. Yeah this sounds a lot like the industrial revolution, it&#39;s the same kind of progress, just far smaller.<br><br><br>I say this because it&#39;s also my argument in favor of immigration, against the idea that jobs can be &quot;taken&quot;. If it isn&#39;t true that additional members of your society creates a net gain, a net increase in wealth and happiness, then trading and civilization itself wouldn&#39;t have happened.

Also, when foreigners visit, it also helps the economies of developing countries for street vendors and other sellers to sell foreigners their goods and increase demand for them. This is why war and oppressive Communist and Fascist governments have high poverty rates and very little visitors from foreigners from most countries. Focus more on increasing the size of the global pie than trying to get somebody else\u2019s or trying to exclude another group from accessing the pie due to arbitrary reasons (race, gender, orientation, etc.).

I know it seems like I&#39;m taking everything thats being said very seriously, but I&#39;m not really just and maybe I just haven&#39;t payed enough attention. But yeah I think even though you need to keep it a bit more fact and very concrete which is important. I think that these things with some outcomes of industry should also be more addressed  that for example; we might be using a lot of ressources and people to find a cure for cancer which you know with more minds to think about this + better education for people of course is important. But also those things like demand and all of this industry also causes pollution and leads to natural disasters that kill so many people as well and I don&#39;t know but a lot of diseases we trigger ourselves: like asthma from air pollution. And I know that you also make videos about that and I know that just because you&#39;re saying one thing doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t saying another thing just right now. And it&#39;s difficult cause everything is connected and everytime a problem that most people would consider a problem &#39;dissapears&#39; another one begins or in the meantime cause it&#39;s just different sides of the same coin or maybe just the same side just viewed differently and everything is built into how we are living now. We probably just need to keep it simple and switch to more sustainable practises for example. Step by step to not die so much. I just always want to get to the root, but that can never really be, cause everything is everything. Being more sustainable can be to switch back to older practises and making more of our own food. Cause often we&#39;re talking about needing some new magical solutions although that magical solution probably is using your feet to walk on. But we also have a strong need to use our knowledge for something to create to try and understand this world that there&#39;s probably no right way of understanding or really knowing anything, we just gotta keep on going. We gotta experiment and see cause we&#39;ll never be quite satisfied. And things shouldn&#39;t be too restricting either cause that&#39;ll also cause killing in some way shape or form, maybe then some of us think that they just don&#39;t know the reasons to why not doing these things. And then we don&#39;t know in which way we&#39;re right or wrong or what that means everything is a mess and beautiful. Balance seems to be the perfect thing, that could never be achieved and would also get boring as everything else occasionally do which we probably just need to accept a bit more.<br><br>This comment will get lost please let it be it&#39;s just rambling please don&#39;t comment on my indecisiveness or stupidity. It just seems like there&#39;s often no way of making the world &#39;better&#39; cause from every new invention and fun thing that seems to solve a problem like for example communication over longer distances with phones will also cause addiction that we&#39;ll get caught up with and find new ways to forever make ourselves more anxious and we don&#39;t we just all have different definitions and will forever missunderstand and nothing seems real. Of course everything that we perceive we&#39;ve created words and it&#39;s obviously just a way to make sense of and describe things, I know so yeah words be words.<br><br>I&#39;m trying to, just trying to post things and let them be, so please don&#39;t comment on it and I don&#39;t know who would wanna read this.

I&#39;m not against your altruist point of view, which I deeply share. But collaboration has nothing to do with capitalism.<br>Nowadays we adore gods like comfort, entertainement and super production that do more harm than good. We are all fat because we live in the opulence and excesive comfort. I&#39;ll make a picture for you: We adore the best football players in the world, and some of them die very young of heart attacks or absolutely destroy their bodies before their 40&#39;s. If we lived according to out nature, we would be saying to these men: calm down, lad. You don&#39;t need to be the best, you can be regular.

But it can&#39;t - because the powerful always gain if the system stays distorted. <br><br>In reality, the size of the pie is indeed increasing as you argue, but a disproportionate share of this increase is being accrued to those who already have the largest share of the pie.

Purpose: This argument for humanity fails to account for basic human nature that must be adjusted on a social level before its premises can be effective -- that is our tendencies to quickly abandon altruism once we&#39;ve found a modicum of abundance for ourselves.  A tremendous subcategory of this is often the search for a &quot;forced multiplier.&quot;   A forced multiplier (as I define it) is a way of circumventing innovation when it is discovered that innovation would decrease the wealth of those providing it.  Forced multipliers can be found everywhere in our society today.  They exist in the planned obsolescence of our phones and the disposable nature of consumerism at large.  Forced multipliers are tremendously profitable in the short term but also do a tremendous amount of damage.   The world we live in today doesn&#39;t simply provide innovation for the sake of innovation, it trades innovation for privacy, for information, for control, and to a lesser extent, a fee.   This argument states that if there was a greater demand to cure cancer from a funding standpoint, we would have cured it.  I think that is false.  The ideal cure for cancer in the measure of profitability isn&#39;t a cure, it is treatment, a subscription.   So this argument fails to point out the fundamental precursor for it to work: a social revolution, that is a shift from profit to purpose.   <br><br>2. Spiritual Maturity: The definition of &quot;what&#39;s better&quot; is not a constant variable for all of humanity, nor should there be one &quot;better&quot; for all.  It wrongly makes the assumption that everyone wants to live in a man-made dense urbanized, technology rich world as opposed to the idea of living more in tune and balance with the natural world.  It seems to advocate that the newest idea is always the best one, which is not always true.  We could stand to learn a lot from the way our ancestors used to live: -Climate control is an excellent argument here:  when the luxury of forced heating and air condition didn&#39;t exist, our ancestors had to work with the land, environment and seasons to build their structures intelligently, even the color at which you painted something affected how it absorbed or reflected heat, our ancestors learned this.  If we thought more that way today, we would not need as many resources and as much technology to circumvent the arrogant ways in which we build our homes and infrastructures today.    <br><br>To the point of wealth equating to happiness, here is an interesting paradox:  I know many people who have worked hard to amass a great deal of wealth only to end up on the other side of it in retirement unhappy and in &quot;poor&quot; health now spending most of that wealth on a treatment-based healthcare system that could have been avoided had they lived a different pursuit.  This is largely because they sacrificed their well being in the pursuit of wealth, using coping mechanisms like over-eating, stress, over exertion and/or controlled substances to simulate the natural happiness that stems from being in the present moment.   In contrast, I know people that have chosen happiness over wealth.  They many not have a lot of money but they are in better health, therefore they are in less need of technology to right the problem in the first place.  These people are not a drag on society nor are they billionaires, they have simply found balance.  Where advancement constantly needs more advancements to correct the problems that the former advancements created, there is a spiritual maturity that is all too often overlooked in the idea of progress.   <br><br>3. The Truth of Oneness:   Your body is made up of  7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms, over 37 trillion cells and billions of sub-organisms that combine to form the person that you see in the screen from the selfie camera.  If you break a bone, you don&#39;t view the atoms or cells in that bone as lazy or a drag on your otherwise perfectly working system, you view it as a result of a consequence that should be properly taken care of.    Is your solution to a broken bone amputation? (or) Is it mending?  What serves your body the best?  Coming from this perspective it&#39;s easier to see how this same idea can apply to humanity as one even larger working organism.  Not much of a jump then to see our planet the same way or our entire universe.  <br><br>So the argument states that the industrial revolution created abundance for all but glosses over the fact that the industrial revolution would have never taken place if it hadn&#39;t first exploited the poor and working classes.  This is a consequence of progress.  <br><br>In the time of the industrial revolution, the abundance of nations like Europe and the US would have not sustained without the exploitation of other resource-rich nations who were often made to abandon their own cultures or even worse, whose own systems were made into often cruel puppet dictatorships allowed to persist as long as they freely traded with industrialized nations who touted &quot;equality.&quot;  This is an even bigger consequence of progress and in direct contradiction to the idea that &quot;What helps the individual, helps the group.&quot;  <br><br> We are a species who has become very accustomed to class-based systems.  At first they were our means of survival.  We selected our strong leaders because they would help our tribes grow.  As our technologies advanced passed our own social maturity the idea of leadership became a distortion.  We instinctively still feel we need it but it has become a formality that advocates ruling classes regardless of that class&#39;s qualification for leadership.

Altho this totally makes sense and is a logicaly good idea. What about global warming?<br>IF there where 7x the people having cars, and demanding production, wouldnt global warming also be 7x greater than it is today? And with this theory, the population would sky rocket, meaning it would be 7x less time until we hit the maximum capacity of people on earth. When that  happen, demand for moon and space bases would sky rocket. And assuming based on humas greed and boiological standing, there would become conflicts about who should control the bases or who should live there. Noone would want to live on earth anymore. And do we even got enough rescources on earth to supply 11billion people(which is the estimated maximum of people on earth by scientists, Take Rosling for an example) demands?v Would we be able to leave earth and colonice other places if we had to move 11 billion people, maybe more. THis theory and idea is great and good for every human on earth. But is it poseble? Even tho technology might sky rocket, wouldnt it already be to late to save earth? And we are animlas, even if you dont want to admit it, we are. So our natural instinct would also make a world as theorised in the video , full of war. As soon as someone sees a posebility to take power and control, it would probably happen. And politics? People are all different,, we already have a problem today with politics in the world. 7x more people, would be 7x more meanings and demands. Which would make a liveble society even harder. This theory has good point to it and the solution of poordom and maybe some sciencetific problems, but making it happen? I dont think thats actualy poseble in a world with humans.

The issue is that people on both extremes of the social ladder tend to think in short term. <br><br>After all, someone who has everything he could ever want and no worries, can do virtually anything he feels like it or simply find an alternative. While, in the extreme polar opposite, someone whose survival is a daily task, can&#39;t let up to think about fifty years from now, rather focusing on making to tomorrow. <br><br>Now, it doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have long term goals. It&#39;s just that a billionaire can subside his wish for space travel via the many other ameneties he has access to and even simulation. While a beggar still needs warm clothing for winter but will trade it for food and water to survive a schorching summer.<br><br>Now, the issue becomes getting both of those, as well as the ones in the middle, to think about common ground. It&#39;s intrinsicaly hard, as natural selection and competition has created an extremely competitive race where those who let up get clobbered in the head. After all, common ground means trusting and cooperating with someone, that is risky.<br><br>Personally, I have little practical idea of how making that a reality within my own radius of influence. Much less how to reshape a global society and the species currently in control of it. My best guess would be the already mentioned issue of health and food. As well as knowledge, e.g. cientia (the word science is just knowledge and the fact that so many people use it without knowing is a very clear sign that it&#39;s not properly spread).<br><br>In many ways, we have reached the new height in those fields and it might seem pointless to push forward. Yet, the reality is that disease is still a big risk for everyone in this world and that culinary is still a prized field no matter the social degree, even though the requirements vary strongly. And knowledge of those fields are strongly dependent on others while it&#39;s still important to maintain the current one.<br><br>So, I imagine that we can find common goals in more than just curing cancer, that we could also agree in finding new tastes while preserving others. After all, medicine is an always evolving field, as we fight an arms race with a big plethora of ailments. While culinary is determined by ingredients, which can find and create or protect and destroy. And it&#39;s necessary to research other items to properly advance our knowledge of those.<br><br>Now, starting from the pressumption that we find such a common cause, we would need to first spread through our own community and range of influence. For it inherently depends on convincing from the inside of each group spreading the ideology to new ones, starting from the middle until reaching the extremes.<br><br>It&#39;s ironically similar to the spread of pathogens. Except that this would be a positive force for each person that comes in contact with it and starts spreading it further. That shows other issues, like the need to differentiate positive from negative strains of this base idea and how to better enforcing it. <br><br>In this case and from this perspective, it becomes very clearly more defined and finally taking the shape of something whose definitions are also full of secondary meanings: politics and religion.<br><br>Now, I also don&#39;t feel qualified to deeply think about it. But I would like to take a positive point from this, perhaps a silver lining. The idea that this crazy wish for a better world might be really hard to achieve and much easier to mess up. Yet, nonetheless, it&#39;s universal for all of us. And that the several stumbles and setbacks we have suffered and even self caused, were important steps in trying to achieve this goal.<br><br>Admitelly, it&#39;s a really positive optimistic take. But, when we are so deeply entrenched in pain or pleasure, I doubt it will be a chastising or a lecturing voice that will convince us more than the offer of a better place and a better feeling...

It would make more sense to get rid of all the unnecessary jobs that only exist to serve the system such as retail, banking, lawyers, etc, and focus on educating everyone so we can have magnitudes more scientists, engineers, and artists.<br>The human race has only spent a fraction of a percent of it&#39;s existence in our current paradigm, it would only serve our &quot;human nature&quot; and our prosperity to return to our egalitarian roots, and use our current level of technology to improve all our lives.<br>So yes, helping others helps yourself, but for the opposite reasons.", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T17:39:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "- xARCHONx -", "comment_text": "And war is funded by the clinton foundation", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T17:20:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silence43", "comment_text": "Says pie <b>shows cake</b>", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T07:45:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silence43", "comment_text": "How is this selfish!?

This 1-3% inflation rate creates an artificial demand. Besides the obvious negative affects of inflation, this has a negative affect on technology. Manufacturers aren&#39;t as motivated to find new and innovative ways to create cheaper products. Rather then save money, consumers buy immediately to the point of using debt to pay for everything. If this method of artificial demand existed in 1908, the mass production of the Ford model-T and the industrial revolution may have never existed. 65% of Americans save little or nothing and the average household debt is $139,000.

Now you pump money into that area, and just like before a new demand for innovation emerges somewhere else. Now did anyone stop to take into account the changing standards of living? They say nowadays that if you go to the US with 10$ in your pocket and no debt then you are richer than half of all americans, yet in my own country that would make you poor, and while the economy and population of the world grows so does inflation. So while you might expect money to come your way due to demand in innovation, that money values less and less over time. 1 trillion dollars 50 years from now will be no different than 100 million dollars in the present, <br>I also find the idea with cancer treatment rather interesting, what would happen if 7 billion people afforded cancer treatment? ok, how do you do that? how do you make cancer treatment affordable to 7 billion people in order to get the money needed for innovation? because by the time you reach that state the treatment has become so refined and cheap that is requires no innovation, and maybe the inflation of the economy is so high that you can be poor while having millions of dollars in your bank account. <br>Also reality check, the resources of the planet are limited, do you actually believe that you can go on creating cake forever? there is a reason you need to you fertilizer, and if you use it then someone else isn&#39;t,  and if you use insecticide to keep pest off your farm you are at the same time decimating the bee population, which I remind you is a serious problem. Is it any wonder that the bee population is at it&#39;s best in countries where farming is not so well developed? <br>Think of it like this: you give the farmer tons of free money, that farmer can afford insecticide, fertilizer etc and the yield of the farm will increase, but all the other farmers do the same. So while he produces more, the value of that work staus the same, yet the environment suffers, and their grandchildren will have to live by eating seafood because the death of bees will be the death of most life on Earth. <br>So yeah, you gain more pie, but the value of the pie decreases, if in the past 1kg of pie was 10$ then in the future 200 kgs of pie will be 10$, yet did anyone stop themselves to ask where the sugar, grain, fertilizer, water, etc came from? because it&#39;s not magical.", "comment_date": "2018-05-07T20:09:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trry", "comment_text": "&gt;says pie<br>&gt;shows cake", "comment_date": "2018-05-07T13:00:51Z", "likes_count": 83}, {"comment_by": "Ahmed Wael", "comment_text": "Too bad humanity is still stuck  in the zero sum mindset", "comment_date": "2018-05-07T11:46:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Verhagen", "comment_text": "I can somewhat agree with the utopian sentiment in this video but it doesn&#39;t mention that even if they had the funding required for it every human would have the ability to significantly further develop the &quot;pie&quot; due to a smaller IQ for example or that not all people around this world currently share or will share this point of view in the future due to cultural, religious or ideological differences which is the sad reality of human nature.", "comment_date": "2018-05-07T11:14:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Venia", "comment_text": "It started before the industrial revolution.

It&#39;s in the best interest of the world and humanity to have sustainability in every aspect. Sustainable transportation technology, manufacturing, agriculture, health care, national and international political relations and practices, international non-partisan collaboration between innovators, and a system which allows people to pursue the innovations they come up with, while also regulating potentially harmful advancements such as biological warfare agents, destructive computer viruses etc. <br>Overpopulation is not an issue as long as innovation is being made in regards to cultural changes in how people are going to live, how much food we can grow, and how many people will be too busy educating themselves to have children. Wealthy countries tend to have a lower birth rate because there&#39;s no need to have 5+ children per household in order to survive, or have the children survive.<br>It&#39;s an ideal which is in almost every way utopian, which is why it should both be strived for, and closely monitored and scrutinized.

The idea of zero-sum game and positive sum game society seems kind of questionable. I know it is a concept from game theory, but is this something really used in economics or sociology? Anyway, here are some of my objections<br>1.  It seems that you could argue that modern economy will eventually evolve to a zero sum game. The clearest reason being that resources on the planet are limited. We have temporarily been able to sustain economic growth building on the power harnessed from coal and oil, but this will not last forever. Even renewable resources are intrinsically limited in supply. So the &quot;cake&quot; will not keep growing forever, or at least not as fast as it did before. Most economists agree on this I think.<br>2. A lot is thrown under the carpet with the concept of &quot;being better off&quot;  Do things like being part of a rich culture, having meaningful relationships with other people, etc ( immaterial things one can value in life) counts towards &quot;being better off&quot;? I think it should certainly be the case. Then preindustrial societies are far from zero-sum games and people in &quot;underdeveloped&quot; countries are not that poor. It seems that in these societies, there are even mechanism that diminish productivity in favour of immaterial goods (think about the prohibition of work on sundays for example).<br>3. It is explicitly said in the video that we tend to desire for more even when we get what we want. This is obviously enhanced in our modern societies. Why presuppose that we should just let this logic continue in an increasing way? Is it that crazy to be satisfied with what you have?<br>4. From an entirely selfish point of view, I want the indian worker\u2019s salary to be as low as possible because any increase in his wage will be reflected on the price of my goods. It seems much more rational to stick to this logic rather than speculating about this guy\u2019s children maybe going to college in 10 years, and maybe becoming scientists in 20 years and maybe finding the cure to cancer in 50 years.", "comment_date": "2018-03-26T05:29:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lil cam", "comment_text": "Can you please make a video about the neutron star collision, or more specifically, gravitational waves", "comment_date": "2018-03-26T05:24:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohi Mozumder", "comment_text": "It is communism but it is not,as the rich stays rich and those who are poor will benefit from it.

Because if someone practices self-abnegation for the sake of others, if they help others survive, then they&#39;re valuable to the community The people around them are more likely to help them out in return, because they want to be able to continue to rely on that person. Like, I think communes can work IF they&#39;re necessary for survival, if there&#39;s no alternative. In that kind of situation, someone who does the work they&#39;re supposed to do and provides for the community is valuable; someone who&#39;s lazy and only takes from others isn&#39;t, and will probably be punished or ostracized from the community. After all, it&#39;s no coincidence that humans are such social animals; our interdependence on one another has been key to our survival and success. Of course, there are limits to this-- people do take advantage, and it probably only works that way on an inter-personal level. After all, humans generally think in terms of &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them,&quot; because... Well, our time and our minds are limited, so we can&#39;t get achieve intimate knowledge of everyone we meet. It benefits us to surround ourselves with people we trust based on experience and knowledge, and to not trust new people so much. At least, that&#39;s true in a survival situation. But the easier life is, the less beneficial that instinct becomes. It&#39;s like how, in the stock market, if a stock crashes, it only becomes worse if everyone pulls their money out. Everyone knows this-- yet people don&#39;t trust each other to stay in.

All substantive technological progress came out of the non-market sector. R&amp;D is a long-term and high-risk investment, and you cant afford such investing if you need to worry about being outcompeted. Take as one example Ma Bell, they invented transistors, modern cryptography, solar cells, the laser, the C programming language, and mobile phones; but when the monopoly was broken up, Bell Labs was sold off to Alcatel-Lucent,  after a few years they announced they were cutting all funding for basic research to focus on more immediately profitable applications. The computer, mouse, Internet, digital camera, and email, radar, the jet engine, satellites, fiber optics, artificial limbs, nuclear energy, etc, etc, that all came from the state sector. Technological progress requires socialization of risk and investment.<br><br>Also, people can innovate simply bc its good for oneself and others to innovate. No one acts entirely selfishly, everyone thinks altruism is good. Basically everyone will agree that society should function with everyone&#39;s interests in mind, not only in the interest of a some subset of the populace. So, we should organize society so that innovation is invested in, and that everyone is well off. <br><br>Note that this doesnt even require radical change of the system, only a system something like the west already had between thirties and seventies. Although we are basically on the verge of automating the economy anyways, so some kind of radical change of the system will be necessary lol..", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T14:15:33Z", "likes_count":

If your goal is to be truly selfish, it doesn&#39;t make sense to help the entire world - only a small subset of it. Which is exactly why people who want cures for cancer will donate to certain organizations dedicated to this cause rather than giving aimlessly.

This, unfortunately, is not one of those. While the idea of positive sum game society is a noble one and we as humanity should aim to build one, we are NOT in that state yet. To prove that I present you three fallacies contained in the video:<br><br>1, The exponential progress started by industrial revolution was caused by innovation. This is a half-truth. Yes, it was, but the cost of innovation itself was fueled by new, very cheap and to that point unprecedented energy sources, namely coal and oil. Growth of comlexity in the system is caused first and foremost by pumping more energy into it, clever reorganization comes only as a byproduct of this energy surge. Why? That leads me to number 2 -<br><br>2, Innovation does NOT come for free. This video treats innovation as some magical free resource, which is of course naive. Actually, the cost of innovation growths exponentially with time. In the past, you only needed one Isaac Newton to progress human knowledge a significant amount, these days, Nobel prizes are almost exclusively handed out to well funded teams, not individuals anymore, and discovering a single particle (say, Higgs boson) requires infrastructure and human resources comparable to Apollo project. And as all exponentials, this is unsustainable. It worked for a while, becouse the energy costs were hidden by mining cheap, milions of years built energy sources, but if we dont have something to replace them as they are depleted, expect, and let me quote Margin Call here: &quot;the entire world get really fucking fair really fucking quickly&quot;. For an excellent resource on this topic search youtube for Collapse of Complex Societies by Dr. Joseph Tainter.<br><br>3, Finally, innovation in this video is treated as The Good Thing\u2122, while this of course is again extremely simplified and misleading view. Internal combustion engines, nuclear weapons, Internet-wide surveilance, single use plastic containers or dragnet fishing are products of innovation the same way vaccines for cancer are. Why do you think Elon Musk spends his entire fortune trying to get people to space? He is just an IT guy who sees the whole picture and understands the importance of backups.

People will have to WANT to get the education.  Right now, there are a great many people who have the opportunity to get the education they need, but because of cultural preferences, they consider education &#39;uncool&#39; and don&#39;t pursue it.  Until this changes, there will always be sections of the world, even within advanced societies, that will be poor.  The brain is just like the rest of the body, and working it will make it stronger.  Those who refuse to work it are not those who don&#39;t have the capacity.  All people must be made to see this.  If they want more, of they don&#39;t want to be poor, then they HAVE to work their own brains.  Those who don&#39;t learn will be poor.<br>2. The investment must be done by those who both pay for it and reap the rewards.  It can&#39;t be forced through government agencies who don&#39;t have to pay from their own pocket and take the rewards from those who pay for it.  Excessive taxation and government spending do not advance anything, it only drags down the advancement.  The reason this doesn&#39;t work is simple: those who don&#39;t invest their own resources have no interest in making it work the best way it can.  Government workers aren&#39;t motivated to make things work properly, and most government projects will fail to get the desired effects.  When people invest their own resources, risking the loss of it, they have a vested interest in making sure it is done right.  <br>3. There will ALWAYS be some left behind.  You&#39;re never going to change this.  For people to move forward, they have to want to do so.  Keeping them from feeling the results of their bad choices will just allow them to keep making those same bad choices.  Allowing them to go without food or shelter for a time because they made the bad choice of spending their money on entertainment instead of expanding their self education will result in them making better choices later, and thus moving forward with society, and helping all of society to move forward even better and faster.  However, at the same time, there are a lot of people who simply won&#39;t have the ability to find a place in the new world.  There are some people who simply don&#39;t have the mental capacity to handle the complex tasks needed for a living wage.  These people must be identified and cared for, but without including people who are just lazy.  Government simply can&#39;t do that effectively.  <br>4. Finally, there MUST be income inequality.  It is an absolute MUST for such a world.  It is a GOOD THING.  Those who work harder and smarter make more.  Those who refuse to work and push themselves forward will not get as much.  That is the way it HAS to work.  If those who refuse to work aren&#39;t penalized, then they have no motivation to change.  If those who work hard and smart aren&#39;t rewarded, they will not continue, and others will not see what brings them rewards and won&#39;t do the things necessary to get there.  Oh, and BTW, digging ditches, flipping burgers, sticking shelves, and hammering in nails is NOT working hard.  It doesn&#39;t matter how tired you get physically.  Working hard isn&#39;t working hard unless you are MENTALLY tired from it.  Working you body means NOTHING.  Working your BRAIN is what is needed.  People need to be paid the value of their work, and flipping burgers is NOT worth anywhere close to $15/hour.  Writing computer code is worth FAR MORE than flipping burgers.  If you want more, get your nose in a book and LEARN to do more valuable work.

We were the first species to be able to &quot;trade&quot; (rather than &quot;share&quot; or &quot;gift,&quot; to exchange resources with the expectation of receiving something in return whether in the future or immediately). It started with the evolution of gender roles, where females became specialized in caring for children and foraging for edible plants or small animals nearer to camp while males became specialized in hunting larger prey further from camp, allowing both sexes to benefit from each other&#39;s specialized work, and allowing the tribal unit to benefit from the work of individuals. <br><br>Progress was very, very slow for the majority of human history, but exchange between humans has always been positive sum to the extent that it has been voluntary--if one of us is willingly exchanging something with another, whether in a momentary trade or a prolonged social arrangement, it&#39;s because each person subjectively values what they are receiving more than what they are giving up, and that&#39;s positive-sum by definition. The reason it took so long to reach the point where the &quot;economic pie&quot; was growing at the speed we see in modernity was not because we were merely waiting for the technology that enabled the industrial revolution, it was because we were waiting for the cultural and political changes birthed from the European Enlightenment which slowly led to an institutional recognition of property rights for people outside of the nobility (along with a growing emphasis on consent in governance). The broadening institutional recognition of property rights meant that for the first time, common people could become merchants or skilled tradesmen and accumulate wealth for themselves, instead of for lords or guilds; for the first time, common people could save for the future with some assurance that their savings would not be outright confiscated by the ruling class, allowing generational wealth accumulation and enabling investment in the enterprises of others. Culture began to shift from one that denigrated merchants and businesspeople to one that tolerated them. Voluntary exchange and association became a much greater part of the social order and public life, drawing a great many more human minds into the productive economy and enabling them to benefit personally when they applied their creativity to discovering valuable new ways of solving problems for others. These changes preceded and produced the technological innovations that drove the industrial revolution. <br><br>Technological progress and economic growth, fundamentally, are the effects of a growing proportion of voluntary human exchange and interaction as opposed to coercive human exchange and interaction, and this continuum tracks back throughout the entirety of human history. Individual consent is the fundamental virtue underpinning all human progress, and it only took a relatively limited expansion of respect for individual consent in a few particular areas to create the explosive growth in technological advancement, wealth generation, and social progress that we have witnessed since the industrial revolution. The &quot;human family&quot; can progress as fast as we want, in every sense of the word, if we focus on broadening and deepening the importance of individual consent throughout our political and cultural institutions.", "comment_date": "2018-03-20T00:36:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Impretzive", "comment_text": "I doubt this argument will work on the billionaires", "comment_date": "2018-03-20T00:32:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ruce Bajer", "comment_text": "I think this is what the US federal government did/tried in the post war era.

Also all those wars werent just wars of jealousy or greed. There were a lot of other very important reasons for poverty and underdevelopment in history. Also this industrial revolution didnt just &quot;happened&quot; and it didnt make anything better (look for the reasons for communism and nationalsocialism). What Im trying to say is that the worldview of the society you look at will determine how good you will do. The other things correlate but you cannot prove that they are the reasons for the development or poverty although they help. The other problem is that money does not solve any problems if in the wrong hands. Just look at the billions of donations for Afrika and look at the output. Now imagine we give this money to some good investors or companys and they will give a much better output. Now my point is not to spend no mony to Afrika but be more aktiv in the development yourself and that you need to change the worldview of people in under developed countrys. Its just like giving a baby a truck. I wont use it for driving but for playing, thus destroying the truck in the long run. So its NOT only Supply and Demand.

As energy moves through an ecosystem, individuals gain some of that energy for metabolism, growth and reproduction by short circuiting entropy.

There has always been a positive sum game, but it is counterintuitive to us. The early economic understanding was that all things had an intrinsic value, which was fixed and metaphysical. So in their understanding, all trade was a system of a winner and a loser. That is the zero sum game, and it was never the actual state, it was just a part of some outdated economic systems like mercantilism (nationalist), socialist and Marxist economies. <br><br>Secondly, altruism <b>was</b> the dominating system during the medieval period. The Church owned a third of all land, and provided for the poor. Education, work, welfare, retirement etc. a little problem of course was that it kept people poor for generations. The Church also kept altruism a dominance in the state. Again that is something intuitive to us, take care of people, we don&#39;t like to see people suffering. Socialism doesn&#39;t need trying out, it was the dominating economical system for the entire medieval period, it <b>is</b> the feudal system.<br><br>Now comes the 19th century, they learn that there is a positive sum game, which is unfortunately not the stab of death to mercantilism. It should be, but the zero sum game is just too intuitive to us, that it keeps coming back in different forms. There is an age of laissez-faire economy, free trade and growing peace and prosperity for all. One of the great maxims, altruism, is challenged, because self-interest is better at serving our fellow man than altruism. Also the free market does a better job at regulating itself than governments are, the economical crises since of the 20th and 21st centuries were caused by government meddling. These are the lessons Adam Smith, which lead to the progress of the 19th century. <br><br>In short, what is intuitive to humans, is what works in small communities. Altruism is fine in a small community, it&#39;s how our ancestors survived, but it is destructive to the state. If we take the central lesson from this video to heart, it is &quot;the quicker we progress the better it is for mankind&quot;. And that road is paved with self-interest, not altruism.

There is certainly a kernel of truth to that assessment, but the video fails to address several problems. <br><br>1. While the entirety of consumer products is a plus-sum game thanks to innovation, the entirety of natural resources that are needed to produce these products (materials, land, freshwater etc) are are not. Control over these finite natural resources means control of the world&#39;s economy. Thus the fighting and extreme economic inequality never stopped, it just largely shifted away from our cosy industrial &quot;winner&quot; countries.<br><br>2. The video entirely ignores one crucial ingredient to both the industrial revolution and our global economy today: cheap labour. As is, a global economic utopia where all 7 billion people are well-educated and wealthy and free to innovate can&#39;t exist, the cost of labour would make prices of goods rise to the point were some people can no longer afford good education and  are no longer wealthy and free to innovate. Our current system at our current level of technology requires some people to be economically desperate enough to do the work that no one wants to do. Of course, automation (innovation) does have the potential to solve this problem, which brings us to our next problem:<br><br>3. Capitalism. Yes, if it wasn&#39;t political already, this is where politics becomes unavoidable. In a perfect world, the abolishment of human physical labour due to automation would benefit everyone. but in a capitalist world, it only benefits the owners of the finite natural resources as described in point 1. Resourceless people who so far needed to undersell their labour in order to survive can now no longer even do that, since there is no way they can compete with automation once a certain level of innovation is reached. And of course, without the assets, they are also barred from the level of education required for them to live off &quot;innovating&quot;.<br><br> In conclusion, if we continue on this path, the plus-sum nature of potential consumer products will become irrelevant and we will end up back in the zero-sum game of natural resources, with even worse options for poor people than in the thousands of years before.", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T15:08:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicol\u00e1s Poli", "comment_text": "oink oink", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T15:07:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adri\u00e1n", "comment_text": "nah the real is that the rich people wanna be more rich and to be it poor people need to be poor and cancer is just a busines for those rich people.", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T15:06:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Observer", "comment_text": "This video has a very good point.

Some people\u2019s time is worth drastically more than others\u2019, and as technology and innovation go further and further, you\u2019ll continually see that very wealthy individuals will compile more and more of this \u201cpie\u201d of value. <br><br>Your time is not even valuable unless if you exchange it with a company for wages, as almost all resources are claimed, privately owned by important and wealthy people. You can invest in the value of your own time by setting yourself up to farm, or to produce content, but you\u2019ll be forced to heavily rely on companies for your only valuable resource (time) to be exchanged. <br><br>These days, instead of survival, you\u2019ll slave your life away to pay off debts that seem contrived and forced upon you, sacrificing years upon years for the hope of enjoying retirement when it\u2019s all over, never being allowed to live while still young.", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T10:47:09Z", "likes_count": 104}, {"comment_by": "Fropps", "comment_text": "I think the theory behind most of the video is good, but the parts about innovation being driven by supply and demand are a bit... wrong? Maybe that&#39;s a bit harsh. <br><br>Beyond the fact that lifting people out of poverty is a good thing and the more people that are able to work on technology the better, there is little evidence that monetary incentive actually helps technology advance. For instance, all the components on the original iPhone were developed in the public sector. As Muzzocato says in her book <i>The Entrepreneurial State</i> \u201cEvery major technological change in recent years traces most of its funding back to the state\u201d. In addition, we can see that inventors are almost never compensated for their efforts. You can&#39;t just say &quot;the demand for innovation increases as people get richer and can pay for new solutions&quot; because the profit motive doesn&#39;t make people &quot;invent harder&quot;.<br><br>This whole video is also a bit of a bad faith argument. Shouldn&#39;t we just be helping other people because it&#39;s morally right? What we really want isn&#39;t for other people to think that helping others benefits themselves, but that helping others is morally right and an intrinsically good thing to do. <br><br>Lastly, if you accept that you will be better off if everyone else is better off, then you have to recognise that this conflicts with capitalism. The system of motivations capitalism provides incentivizes precisely the conditions we see today: The systematic exploitation of weaker and poorer countries. While it would be great for everyone if these people were treated like human beings, the people in charge of extracting money from them benefit more from withholding this from us. If you care about the future of humanity, you can&#39;t just sit by and let the world be held to ransom by a handful of corporations when we have the resources and technology to resolve our problems if we just worked together with the goal of alleviating suffering rather than maximizing profit.", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T10:44:32Z", "likes_count": 83}, {"comment_by": "Peter Hwang", "comment_text": "This is an amazing video.

Then there&#39;s the risks in academia of creating path-dependencies where fringe ideas are less tested because the consensus is against them. Finally, there&#39;s all the frictions that make such transfers of wealth and knowledge very slow. As a comment I have seen previously argued, the organisations with the capabilities of empowering wealth distribution are short-sighted and would rather focus on extracting a greater part of the pie than of growing it.

It gets just about everything wrong: from its insane, arbitrary definitions of &quot;zero sum game&quot; and &quot;positive sum game&quot; to its misappropriation of supply and demand, all the way to its apparent thesis that total wealth continues to <b>magically</b> increase in a post-industrialized world.  Wealth is not a social construct, it is an indicator of economic utility.  Economic utility is the capacity of a resource to satisfy a human (or &quot;society&quot; in macro-economics) want.<br><br>You simply can&#39;t ignore resource production in any macro-economy.  Even if you live in a society that has largely evolved its own economy past the point of needing a large population of manufacturers, that does not mean your economy doesn&#39;t rely on manufacturing.  It just means that your society is able, at a sustainable rate, to trade for the requisite manufactured goods from another society.  Right?  This is how trade works-- it allows some societies to specialize and, as consequence, spreads access to goods and services to a much wider domain.  However it does not negate the necessity of manufacturing-- it just concentrates where it comes from.  We cannot live in a macro, global economy that is mostly (or entirely- as this video suggests) made up of information/ service sector micro-economies.  Resources matter!<br><br>Example:  Just because I did not harvest the cotton my clothes are made from does not mean that cotton isn&#39;t a valuable resource to me.  I didn&#39;t chop down the trees that provided wood for my chair or desk, nor did I mine the gold that&#39;s in the motherboard of this computer.  But someone did, thus allowing this Internet video to waste seven minutes of my life.  Had there been no society whose economy manufactured these resources, none of this would even be possible.<br><br> Technological advancement does not negate this principle.  Tech production and tech progression still need resources.  Production of ANYTHING will still need a supply of resources-- i.e. magic does not exist in the real world.<br><br>I would like condemn this video for poor fact checking or lack of healthy pre-production criticism but I suspect that the actual roots for this video&#39;s anti-intellectualism are more nefarious.  So to address the ugly, black-masked elephant in the room here, socialism is a bad idea because it is built from failed ideas.  It has never worked.

For example: The Gates Foundation uses its immense wealth to advance libertarian-y causes like the privatization of public schools. Even when its fund benefits traditional public schools, it de-democratizes things like curriculum. Common Core, for example, was broadly pushed by the Gates Foundation and tied to basic funding promises.<br><br>Also, a lot of people in here are very confused about capitalism vs &quot;socialism&quot; aka libertarian socialism. Capitalism is when the means of production is owned by business owners and corporations ect. Socialism is when the means of production is owned by the people, the working class. The video is cannot be arguing in favor of capitalism because in a capitalistic society, people HAVE to be poor for others to be rich. Corporations must benefit from the work and products/services produced by its employees and so forth. Some people have to have more cake than others. <br><br>This video is saying that&#39;s bad and that everyone should get an equal portion of cake. In this scenario, the means of production would have to be owned by a people as a collective so that no one would be able to dominate the cake and take a majority of it. JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE GOODS THAT ARE PURCHASED WITH MONEY WITHIN A MARKET DOESN&#39;T MAKE A SOCIETY CAPITALISTIC. The altruism displayed in the video is encouraged in this type of society because it would mean everyone would be able to have access to things like food, healthcare, even luxuries to some extent. <br><br>Eventually, the currency system would probably be abolished anyway if this system continued because there would be no need for money if everyone pitched in and everyone was &quot;rich&quot;. The concept of money really is a way to enforce the powers of capitalistic business giants and keep them powerful for as long as the system allows them to. So, in a way, the values expressed in this video could be interpreted as leftist anarchist, although that&#39;s not explicitly what it says so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s safe to interpret it like that, especially with Bill Gates funding it.", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T05:48:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mario Arias", "comment_text": "Yet another amazing video", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T05:47:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liam Patel", "comment_text": "easy said than done tho", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T05:46:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "melody glegg", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t believe that u guys are #2 on the trending nice job", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T05:43:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akuretaki Nikolay", "comment_text": "altruism is for the weak and poor. read Nietzsche - The Gay Science", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T05:42:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Ray", "comment_text": "Are we in the positive sum game? <br>Is there no evidence that another part of the world is actually dying because the other part is having a bigger pie?<br><br>I still think that the law of energy conservation applies here and every part of out lives.

Before then, the amount of food you could produce was roughly the same as you consumed. The amount of value you could create (value = a need or want) was roughly the same amount of value you consumed. Food was only gathered or hunted, and land had a set amount of food that replenished over a certain amount of time, so migration was necessary as the population increased.<br><br>Then agriculture was developed. This made it so that one person could produce enough food for 11 people. This resulted in 10/11 people being able to do things other than create food. They created other forms of value, like housing, or clothes. Farming also created slavery and animal husbandry - one person could grow enough food to support 10 other humans, or other animals, and thus slaves then became profitable - before agriculture, slaves were mostly impossible to keep, as you couldn&#39;t feed them.<br><br>I disagree with this video on land usage and agriculture - the world wasn&#39;t a zero sum game during times of agriculture, and there wasn&#39;t a shortage of land until very recently - 1,000 years ago. Very blatantly wrong.<br><br>Innovations kept being created, one of which was better agricultural practices, which made the 1 person able to farm enough food for 32 people, instead of 11. This further increased the amount of people able to do things other than farming. This number kept increasing. Agriculture is the direct cause of laws, civilizations, war, slavery, etc. Also the cause of all technology and modern pleasure.<br><br>Because of the innovations of agriculture, new innovations in other fields were made. With every innovation, the amount of value a person could create increased. The reason life is so awesome now is because every person can create more value then they consume. 1 person can create enough value for 10 people to be satisfied easily. Value is defined as something that gives someone pleasure. Food and other basic needs give pleasure, but so do things like gold, video games, TV, clothes, etc. With the creation of industry, one person can create enough value to satisfy thousands of people.", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T05:03:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0410d\u0113ptus Me\u00e7ha\u00f1ikus", "comment_text": "Like that would ever happen in capitalist society lol", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T05:03:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "christian Cedillo", "comment_text": ",p", "comment_date": "2018-03-19T05:03:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spoonman", "comment_text": "This is by far the most meaningful video on the internet.

It&#39;s a good ideal and bears merit overall...<br>    This is a gross oversimplification, however. I know &quot;for nothing more than a YouTube video&quot; it&#39;s a principle that needs simplified to some extent, and that&#39;s also certainly worth merit... BUT the most notorious misrepresentation here is &quot;...that we&#39;ve been making a bigger pie...&quot; <br>   Folks, it&#39;s a planet. It hasn&#39;t been getting THAT much bigger (cosmic dust and hair-splitting aside) in the last couple thousand years (or probably several million)... If you don&#39;t get off-world and find more pie to bring physically back here, the pie does NOT get any bigger.<br>   SO what have we done? We have advanced technology and explored more of the pie we have to BE ABLE to use it more efficiently. Certainly, this is still important, probably more important than anything to do with making a pie any bigger... BUT it has NOT spontaneously generated a &quot;Positive sum game&quot; from a &quot;Zero sum game&quot;... Society did that as an invention WAY BACK around the time we (humans) invented things like farming and livestock... and villages.<br><br>    Frankly, I&#39;d suggest investing just a little time to check out the work of George R. Price... Particularly his efforts in applying game theory to natural selection. THAT will explain quite effectively how &quot;selfless activity&quot; (altruism) is in fact the positive efforts of your own genes seeking to influence their own preservation through socialized effort.<br>    This is simple. It&#39;s no more than cooperating within the society to efforts for the net benefit of others, which in turn creates a social trait of reputation... That reputation creates an additive trait of VALUE in your person for others, and thus they ACTIVELY seek to keep you around. Now, this is also a simplification. It&#39;s the narrowest scope of the simplest model of the theory. BUT it proves the point without any neo-mystical ideologies of &quot;generating bigger pies&quot; out of thin air, something that is basically impossible.<br>    This same notion works in greater scopes from individuals in groups, to smaller groups within larger social structures, and from larger structures showing their support of even &quot;offensive&quot; neighboring structures when in need... Needs get met, and people are happy. Reputations grow and values increase... Neighbors appreciate GOOD neighbors, and seek to keep them around. The cycle of investment to returns (not always monetary) can and WILL always function well mathematically...<br>   Finally, I&#39;d like to point out that George Price&#39;s work has the dubiously extraordinary feat of not containing citation outside of his own work. This is something that was even held as extraordinary in the early 1800&#39;s, and is all the more impressive when you understand he was still publishing papers on these and related matters into the 1970&#39;s...<br><br>   I don&#39;t disagree with Kurzgesagt. I actually enjoy their work, and I find it (mostly) useful, relevant, and beneficial. I just honestly, truly think this could have (should have?) been done from a less fantastical perspective and the references to Price and others involved in the likes of applied game theory could give viewers something to take note and research heartily on their own... I can understand seeking to influence a younger viewer base, but fantasies of bigger pies instead of the hard reality of more efficiently enjoying all the pie we have leads too easily to fallacy... and innovation for the sake of change is NOT innovation for the sake of pay-off... pay-off should be celebrated.

The world is still zero sum...just a bit less. There is a reason every country on Earth is not flooded with an oversupply of rare-elements and expensive machines and other rare/ expensive things. There are only so much of them. For any resource or service, no matter how much you increase it, there will always be a finite amount. Example: there are only so many doctors to provide healthcare. There are only so many farmers to grow food, only so many soldiers to defend you. Putting people in one economic sector usually means they are not in other ones, so no matter how much investment of resources you put in it will never be a positive return for all areas. Now make no mistake, I see few flaws in the video apart from this. Increasing the number of people who are able to produce and innovate will absolutely benefit you in the long term. But you must spend resources to produce resources. Not every part of the world, individual person, or section of the economy has an efficient ratio. Many are even net losses.<br>The only other thing that comes to mind is something else it said: basically as you solve problems you develop new ones to solve. Apply that to resources (objects, time, services, etc). No matter how many resources you consume, you will always have a demand for new and different ones. Meaning your consumption keeps increasing to counter your new wealth. It gets more and more and more expensive to keep you alive even as innovation drives that cost down.<br>It is definitely in your best interests to help people.

For example, in the 70&#39;s people in the Western World believed that if we industrialize the western world world hunger would cease. We made cheap loans available to their governments, brought in new equipment, seed, and fertilizer, and their food output really did increase. Well, initially. The problem was that their original crops were better suited to their region and nothing went to waste. The food was less productive, but animals could be fed the scraps so there was a higher net positive. Now the farmers have to use heavy fertilizers and pesticides and can barely afford to feed themselves. Meanwhile, their countries have debts which now exceed their GDP meaning they will never be able to pay those debts off. Clearly they would have been better off without that approach.<br><br>Even in North America where such practices work very well, there is still a hidden consequence: Trace minerals are extracted from the soil without being replaced. Where seasonal flooding events used to replenish the lost minerals in the midwest, innovation in flood control to protect farmland also destroyed this mechanism. Now Americans are extremely trace mineral poor which directly contributes to disease rates. Take Chromium, for example. Diets poor in CFT Chromium leads to both forms of diabetes without actually being a cause, like how scurvy isn&#39;t specifically caused by insufficient Vitamin C, but is prevented by it being in the diet. We are facing major health issues due in large part to many different innovations backfiring on us.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say all Innovation is bad - much of it is very very good - but we need to be careful how we apply it.  For example, we can deal with the consequence of the trace mineral issue simply by setting up a national program for extracting the required minerals from the sea and distributing to farmers. Such an innovation would result in a decrease of such health consequences and therefore pay for itself, but because people rarely innovate to solve hidden issues this is unlikely to occur. The farmers do benefit in yield when they use evaporated sea water in the right portions, but they benefit more in yield from increasing chemical fertilizer and pesticide use for the same area so they have very little incentive to deal with this issue. <br><br>It should also be pointed out that with each increase in food production the amount of work required by each individual has increased. So while the carrying capacity of the land is increased the diseases related to overwork has also increased through time. Analysis on bones have even measured how injuries were affected during such transitions. Of course, the innovation there would be a robotic workforce, but we&#39;d also have to deal with consequence such as processing of rare earth metals and pollution, not to mention dealing with change as a society.", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T23:38:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NotSo FatCat", "comment_text": "soo.. just going to lay it out there .. large chunks of Africa south America need to get better off for are sake.. how to we westernize those land masses and peoples", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T23:37:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Dover", "comment_text": "I think you&#39;re ignoring the fact that almost all goods in the west is produced cheaply in other countries.

Don&#39;t be fooled by virtue signaling and politically correct terms certain companies use to look nice and honest on the surface while they get away with producing products for next to nothing by treating the labor/production force like shit in non-1st world countries. You want everyone to have more pie (or cake), have better purchasing practices. Doing that can really go a long way, it&#39;s slow but can have an impact. Look at big box stores and malls right now. Sure, Amazon has really put stores like Toys r Us and Sears in the gutter because of low prices and fast shipping, but there is another side to this coin. The 2nd hand/used item market. Shopping at Thrift Stores and Flea Markets has really become a trend, which has resulted in more Thrift Stores like Goodwill, Value Village, etc to pop up more locations. Also, there is an influx of used item sellers on sites like eBay, Poshmark, Thredup, and Mecari. Need a nice dinner dress or jacket? Go to Macy&#39;s and spend 80.00 or go to Savers and find a gently used dress or jacket for 10.00? Also by buying from a non-profit thrift store, you are usually helping others land jobs within your local community. If more people become more shop savvy and keep their perfectly good items longer or donating goods, instead of upgrading to the newest trendy shiny things, companies will see a slow down in their main consumer market. They might just have to adopt better practices to draw people back to their products.

Numerous research papers contributed to the theory that humans don&#39;t want others to feel even slightly as happy as they are, let alone in a similar state of power and/or well being the individual simply wishes to be on top of the other. Just look at how money/power hungry we are. The moment we can let such childish attributes of ourselves go is the moment the video has any chance of becoming reality. <br>The only reason we&#39;re producing more than we can consume is because the thrive to have more wealth/power because of it. This is also where Kurzgesagt&#39;s pie equation ran into a cliffside: companies use overproduction all the time to drive competitors into the ground. But where we used to steal a piece of the pie of the other, we now simply make our own share of the pie so large, it suffocates the other side, because no one can take another bite of pie.<br>The cancer argument Kurzgesagt makes is also backwards in my opinion: We shouldn&#39;t throw more money into it so the research can quicken, we should quicken the research so that the individuals we save with it can contribute more to society. Unfortunately there&#39;s slight bumps (understatement, Chinese wall 2.0 is more like it) in our way, namely pharmaceuticals and nearly all the patents in the world. We deliberately keep knowledge and technology under wraps only to sell to the highest bidder, at the literal cost of human lifes. <br>If this video its wishful thinking wants to come to fruition in any realistic sense, it should also take those elements into the equation. Without doing that, the whole video seems to be mostly aimed at pandering to give more money to charity... And feel free to delve a bit deeper into what charities you give too, and how much of that money goes straight into the pockets of just a few.<br><br>Sadly, that&#39;s why I consider it wishful thinking.

Short term selfish action is a means to a more direct end obviously, but the cascading effects end up being a net loss after the initial gain and that&#39;s besides the potential negative effects on due to conscience or the soul.

We may not be on the gold standard anymore but if you are getting payed more for the same amount of labor it doesn&#39;t mean that your making more it means that the currency you are receiving is worth less. This was a good video but I felt it was incomplete like a build up with no conclusion. The ending probably would have stated something along the lines of exponential consumption, finite resources, global warming, cutting down non-necessities. The video seemed like it was making a case for a Utopian world (the more people with education the less my education is worth, the more people coming up with ideas the less likely mine is to succeed, the higher the base line education the more likely the value of their labor is to increase). Just putting it into a nutshell would you think a phd was an amazing feat if everyone had one? Would you still pay a phd 30 dollars an hour if they were flipping burgers? The value of a person is rooted in their work, and the value of their work is derived from the scarcity of the ability to do that work.

If I&#39;m helping people because I want them to owe me, it&#39;s not a very stable grounds for a moral society. It would have to be the case that materialism was the only source of happiness and well-being in people&#39;s lives for this to work.

That is because people normalize what they have. If it&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; for you to have lots of wealth, food, and free time, you aren&#39;t going to appreciate it as much.

The total sum of wealth can be increased, but it cannot be infinite. The more people who want the same thing, the harder it is to get it. Material goods can get around this concept, as a company can increase its production to match the supply to the demand, but other types of good are either much harder to increase or even impossible to increase (at least in a controlled or moral way).<br><br>This idea of Egoistic Altruism ignores the concept of competition. When more people are competing for the same amount, people will lose. For example, the increase in education in Asia has led to increased competition for top American universities, as there are more students trying to get into the same number of positions. As some students get accepted, others lose those opportunities. Competition can have some very positive impacts, but only for those who win and the system as a whole. Those who lose may gain some benefits from the positive impacts, but they are left personally unfulfilled and angry. How can you convince people that it is better to increase the competition, and to live for the betterment of everyone, even if it goes against their own dreams and aspirations, or even directly hinders their chances at success? How do you get around the focus of the human brain on improving its own situation and standing in society? <br><br>The idea of Egoistic Altruism focuses far more on the altruism and ignores quite a bit of egoism. How can you expect people to act for the good of the world, even if it may possibly bring some obscure good to their own families, when they can instead invest in their own families, and see a noticeable positive impact? This a particularly troublesome question when you compare the rate of change to the human lifespan. Compare our relatively short existences to the much slower change of human society, and you can see the problem. Why should I donate to a charity acting in some other part of the world I have never been to, when instead I could send my children to college, establish stable investments, and ensure my family&#39;s growing wealth? I can significantly increase the chances that my children will be successful within the next 20 years by giving them a solid college education and economic support, or I can wait for some unknown number of years (most likely more than 20) and hope that this theoretical farmer sends his/her children to college and they grow up to be that rare innovator that changes the world. I would argue that, historically, the former has shown itself to be far more viable than the latter. The rich get richer, so why should I make my family poorer? And even if some astonishing inventor comes out of one of these areas, how can I guarantee my family easy access to their invention? If I keep my money and increase my wealth, then I increase the chance that either I or my children will be able to access and afford new inventions and technology, especially when it comes to medicine, which is often very expensive. <br><br>Furthermore, how do you make this argument who those who are already in need? Do you expect only the rich to give their money and time away, or are the poor expected to also pitch in? How can someone who works multiple jobs and still makes very little money to be able to help? I know far too many people who have nothing to give, and they are often split between people who struggle to give even the tiniest amount back to the community when they can and people who couldn&#39;t care less what happens to anyone else as long as they can get by. This leads to the issue of the large number of people, whether poor, rich or somewhere in between, who care little to nothing about others. Some of them follow the same ideas of family I proposed in the 3rd paragraph, while others are focused only on themselves. Of the latter, some actively leech off of the world, while others are merely focused on a single goal that will eventually place them into the right position to give back far more to the world. Do you force these people to help (which is a massive slippery slope) or do you convince others to give proportionally more in order to reach the same effect? How is this fair for those who give back, if others can mooch off of their work? Does this not impact those hard workers who could eventually reach a high enough position to give back far more to the world than you could ever force them to give you now?<br><br>I&#39;m not against altruism (in fact I openly support and engage in it), but this argument of altruism based on egoism (which is the key issue here) seems to either be based on massive misconceptions, or it is actively jumping around with assumptions.

And I don&#39;t want to fall in the clich\u00e9 of quoting Africa: in the majority of countries we live in there&#39;s a lot of people that doesn&#39;t perceive these &quot;Innovations&quot;. There are lots of examples, but my point is that money is not increasing for everyone nor being distributed to everyone; the access to the inovations has to be payed. And this people <del>I think</del> it&#39;s not poor because they want to be poor: they don&#39;t have the same opportunities, knowledge, and conditions to escape from that social position: the public education is a disaster in various countries, the access to internet and knowledge doesn&#39;t get to every place and you have to pay to access. I repeat, the improvement and the growth of the economy it&#39;s not reaching everyone and every place. If we just focus in our own lives, interests, and we only work  to create ideas and innovate, maybe we would be creating this innovations only for the people who can afford it, increasing the inequality. It&#39;s not about forgetting about our own lives, and live for the welfare of the world and all the good things that we all dream of but we can&#39;t or we don&#39;t want to do it, because it&#39;s difficult and blah blah blah. It&#39;s about to be a critic subject, a reflexive person, asking some questions about what are we doing: Why am I doing this? For who? Will I only work to sustain the way the world is? How can I make this Innovation reach everyone, to make it accessible and good for the majority of people? How is the world I want to live in and I want to leave? It would be a desirable world to the entire population? Am I working for that world? How can I get the things better for the ones who live in bad conditions and don&#39;t have the same opportunities as I have, if I am working only for myself and the possible improvement of people like me? These are some of the questions that we have to make and think about. If we want to help it&#39;s not only about &quot;innovating&quot; and hoping to this inovations to reach the poor people magically and without any effort. It doesn&#39;t work like that. I am a little bit disappointed about this video, and it&#39;s not weird that it is called &quot;egoistic altruism&quot; and it&#39;s financed by one of the most rich, egoist person in the world.

Everything done without God is done in vanity, it has zero purpose. You work to what end? You get yourself nice things here because they make you happy, or at least they hold your attention, then you&#39;re on your deathbed and you realize all your work was in vanity. There is never going to be peace and prosperity in this world until Jesus is the one ruling. All work done in the name of Jesus is not vain, rather, it&#39;s everlasting. You can&#39;t take money or objects with you when you die, but you can take the fact that you loved people, helped point them to their Saviour and receive their salvation. These things are eternal. Jesus said:<br><br>&quot;Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&quot;<br><br>It sure it easy to live a life blind to God, it may be hard to accept God, since it&#39;s a totally opposite viewpoint and goes against what you were taught to believe, but it&#39;s worth it. I have a joy that is out of this world, nothing phases me because I know my end. If you stop and actually think about what these famous atheists/hedonists/Crowley followers are saying, you will realize its all junk. Science is blind because it only looks at what it can see, hedonists are blinded by pleasure (which is vanity), Crowley followers are blind because they have to justify the horrendous acts they&#39;ve committed. The fact is, in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Let God be true and every man a liar.<br><br>This world, day by day, is turning farther and farther away from God, which is building up God&#39;s indignation on this earth. The reason his wrath is building up is so that we all have a chance to come to Christ before its all kindled, but know this, God&#39;s wrath will be kindled, it is called the time of Jacob&#39;s trouble. Study bible prophecy, study Christian testimonies, study the archaeology behind the bible. There is only one Truth, and that is Jesus. He is the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by Jesus.<br><br>You&#39;ve sinned against a holy and righteous God, which is bad news for you because God is light and in him is no darkness...What is he going to do with you. The wages of sin is death, but thank God Jesus died that death we all deserve and through his blood we have life. So believe in the gospel, pray your repentance to God, ask him for salvation, get yourself a bible and enter into life. Staying on the path you&#39;re on will only lead to death. This is the way the universe works, you can&#39;t wish away God. It is appointed unto man once to die, but after this the judgment. If you are left being judged by your own righteousness, you will be damned, but if you are judged by Jesus&#39; righteousness, you will enter life. The Lord is my righteousness, is he yours?

A capitalistic society requires poor labor for wealthy nations to thrive. (i.e. No one will pay $8000 for an iphone just because laborers in Indonesia are being paid $10 an hour instead of $1 a day.) The economy would suffer. One solution would be to pay everyone more in the wealthy nations to account for the INSANE inflation, but then those Indonesian laborers become poor by comparison and we are as we started.

We already are egoistic in our altruism; when we <i>rationally</i> invest ourselves in something outside of us, whether it is seen as self-serving is merely a function of how directly it serves ourselves or something we see as part of ourselves (typically our family, our tribe, or our ideas)--but <i>all</i> such rational actions serve to at least indirectly benefit them.  We differ in our altruistic interests, however.  Education can shift that, but we are not totally fluid in our value structures.  As long as we have such a broad diversity of cultural backgrounds, those interests will continue to differ enough for the potential of conflict.  (Pointing that out doesn&#39;t make me an enemy of cultural diversity!)<br>2. In capitalism, the business is the prime source of turning innovative thought into actual innovation.  Its cold and calculated efficiency is amplified in corporate and other group-owned business, which sacrifices individual vision for group interest--and that interest is almost universally reduced down to increased profits over a 5-year term.  That&#39;s just the natural selection of business.  If a place is currently too poor or destitute to buy anything, business interest can&#39;t become altruistic to them because it will take more than 5 years for payoff.  Assuming this video isn&#39;t trying to make a case for socialism, the business altruism in improving lives elsewhere needs to be leveraged by a humanitarian interest with capital to satisfy businesses&#39; short-term interests.  So thanks for that, Bill and Melinda.  But don&#39;t make <i>me</i> feel like I need to do something about this directly.  Very few of us can be successful entrepreneurs and fewer still can both afford and desire to be philanthropists.<br>3. The type of personal action that makes the most sense here is political action, which is implied but not discussed (and that discussion is particularly pertinent to a practicality-of-values topic like this).  But politics in much of the West are overrun, possessed by self-serving lobby mechanisms all their own that pretty flatly screen out interests like this.  Green parties have a tough go of it because they can&#39;t make green (the other kind of green) promises.  Without that lucre, you can&#39;t budge the status quo.  And as long as dominant-party tribalism, dishonest/negative campaigning, and inefficient election methods affect as large a share of government representation as they do, the Green parties will at their best have the wherewithal to squeak into the din of corporatist machinery--to push and hope for small local changes, but not really to improve the world.

So we won&#39;t have many space companies who help each other, but concurrents who - if they succeed with e.g. building a city on Mars - won&#39;t see it as a chance for humanity to become a type 3 civilisation, but will try to make as much profit as possible and thereby hindering the development of humanity. So if we want to get humanity to the next level we first need to overcome capitalism.", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T16:16:07Z", "likes_count": 70}, {"comment_by": "Junior Jaw", "comment_text": "Step 1 : Be finna woke", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T16:15:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MNVinela", "comment_text": "I like how he kept saying pie but it\u2019s very clearly cake in the video", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T16:15:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LordMichaelRahl", "comment_text": "Knowledge is power.

Vested interests constitute one such aspect. In cancer research for instance, such interests may be empowered by increased demand to channel investments for cancer research into the drug industry. In the capitalist economy, profits are central to material development. If costly treatments that only diminish pain from symptoms of cancer generate more profits because of a decades long dependence upon such medicines, most investments will probably be channeled to research into drugs and other symptom-alleviating treatments rather than into cheap and effective treatments. Integrated businesses may even actively prevent research endeavours that make their own products dispensable. This is especially prevalent in the energy industry. The Norwegian professor and political scientist Espen Moe wrote a book about this where he talks about how vested interests prevent the development and application of renewables in countries where oil and nuclear industries have traditionally occupied a dominate position in the economy. The book is called \u2018Renewable Energy Transformation or Fossil Fuel Backlash\u2019. \u2018Climate Innovation: Liberal Capitalism and Climate Change\u2019 by Harrison, N., Mikler, J., \u2018Carbon Democracy:<br>Political Power in the Age of Oil\u2019 by Timothy Mitchell, and \u2018The Ecological Rift\u2019 by J.

However the point should be emphasised that we are highly unlikely to see anything like the economic explosion following the industrial revolution ever again. Economic growth happens because of invention, discovery and expansion. Yes, there are still technologies out there which we have yet to discover - and yes, there are more exciting things to come with more opportunities. However it won&#39;t be on the same exponential scale as the industrial revolution.<br><br>Another point to note is that while economic growth provides more wealth and resources to go around, the effect is diminished while there are MORE PEOPLE sharing those resources. In the language of this video: it&#39;s great to double the size of the pie. But if you also double the number of people who want to eat pie, then no individual is any better off.<br><br>I get the point about the poor farmer whose children might go to university and cure cancer, sure. But this is highly dependent on developing people striving to succeed and make their own world a better place. The reason I&#39;m making this point is because unfortunately there are a lot of people who selfishly squander whatever is given to them.<br><br>To give a more specific example: the message I&#39;m getting from this video (sponsored by the B&amp;M Gates&#39; Foundation) is that we in the West should be more alturistic about developing countries. And that&#39;s all great. I agree. But ONLY IF whatever we do to help them can be specifically identified to have a positive LONG-TERM effect on increasing the quality of life in those countries. For example, I&#39;m more than happy to see my tax money go towards foreign aid in the form of education, birth control, digging wells etc. These are all things that will slowly help poor countries become better places. HOWEVER I am not happy to see Western money just handed over to corrupt regimes, or programmes which only benefit individuals in a short-term capacity, with no prospect of ever actually making a PERMANENT change for the better.<br><br>As always, the devil is in the detail.<br><br>We&#39;re all familiar with the old saying: &quot;Give a man a fish and you&#39;ll feed him for a day: teach a man to fish and you&#39;ll feed him for the rest of his life&quot;. Well this in the point. Western money and support should be used only to teach others to fish.

My point is, I do believe this is a well calculated formula for building a world that is successful and flourishing - if not a little utopian. However, I also firmly believe that, we as humans are incapable of reaching this state. If I had to propose a solution to this obstacle, I\u2019d say that innovation to the level of increasing longevity such as the cure for cancer will not be found in this generation. We need to teach other members of society how to adjust to this new age of technology that the rapid advancement of science and human thought has brought us into. The more people know how to use advanced tools, the more they can push themselves to innovate - which could turn into a world that we so desire. But, even I am unsure as to what the solution is.

The best was to increase wealth is to increase free trade and, historically, this trend of Free trade is what has been uplifting poor societies, but there&#39;s only so much it can do. Many places in the world need to turn into more liberal, western republics for wealth to truly start growing. (Historic Examples, Germany, east vs west, Japan, South vs North Korea). Good Government and good cultural values (such as a basic understanding of human rights) are what set the ground work for prosperity inside a capitalist world economy. Once a country is stable, people will invest, early investment in Japan was certainly encouraged by the US occupation and later their radically western constitution of their own witch all led to foreign interest.<br><br>Right now wealthy people are working to improve the lives of the poor by this sort of international investment across the board.

I liked the perspective of the video. However, I would like to indicate a few things.<br><br>The perspective relies too much on the idealistic nature of capitalism as the niche to innovation. The idea of one&#39;s selfishness resulting to an overall positive sum goes by the principle of the Invisible Hand of the Free Market. We should, however, take note that this is true assuming ceteris paribus, as well as the presence of a perfect market, where everyone has all the information, the means of transport, and the capability to afford goods. In an ideal world, it may be so, but in reality, it is very different. Social injustice exists, and corruption within governments means that it cannot supplement proper fiscal and monetary laws such as protectionism. There are also so many things to consider that overall dispels the ideally good nature of egoistic altruism. Perhaps innovation, a spearhead of societal advancement, doesn&#39;t necessarily remove the class divide which oppressors actively exploit the poor. But it is a good start to trying to advance humanity as a race.<br><br>Tl;dr: I think that this video holds optimistic and idealistic information, and there is a slight lack of juxtaposition to the real world.<br><br>This was just my two cents.

However the debate and discussion really runs around, &quot;well how do we make people better off?&quot; I won&#39;t get into the specifics unless someone wants me to, but suffice it to say I think it needs to be said.<br><br>Also I will say that while things are positive sum there are still very real limitations to what we can do. There are certain things that you just can&#39;t really speed up no matter how much money you throw at it. For example there&#39;s still going to be a limited amount of space for people to live in on earth, that&#39;s a very real and salient problem we have that in the coming decades will only become more and more apparent to the average person. By the same right could we be further along with cancer research if we threw seven times the resources we have already at it? In all probability the awnser would be yes, but we don&#39;t know that for sure, there&#39;s a very real chance that we would be exactly where we are today, partially because innovation to an extent does follow inspiration and while inspiration can be focused and driven it is by it&#39;s very nature spontaneous.<br><br>And that&#39;s not even to get into the nature of diminishing returns.

While there would be steps and leaps in innovation in these parts, I&#39;m certain the increase in pollution would precede its solutions, and once the polluting has already been done, if it&#39;s bad enough and big enough it&#39;s likely too late to fix it.

Renewable resources like food arent really the problem, but rather, limiters like fuel and rare elements like lithium. While its unlikely that these resources will run out soon, greater demand means they will become much more expensive. The price we would pay for products produced in ways and places that require lots of cheap labor (think chocolate) would also increase. Also, the capacity of the planet to support life is limited by the amount of CO2 it can safely handle. If everyone had a carbon footprint the size of the average American, we would be looking at an ice free world a lot sooner than we currently are.

This is because the pie actually grows through voluntary trade, aka mutually beneficial exchange, which is in of itself a positive sum game, since you wouldn&#39;t make a trade if it didn&#39;t make you better off form your own perspective. It&#39;s not innovation, which is a side effect of voluntary trade. Innovation results from voluntary trade becasue voluntary exchange results in competition in production, which results in producers investing more of their own capital, which results in research that produces innovation. Innovation may grow the pie but without voluntary trade, the big pieces created by it stay in the hands that create them or those who steal from those that created them (aka the government).
