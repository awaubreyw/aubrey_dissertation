Depressing because depression mainly strips away your normal... healthy routines, habits, just the basic normal things a normal human does. While watching, I look back on 2019-2020 where I was learning languages, how to draw portraits, how to draw bodies, how to color, I tried a bunch of apps to talk with people all over the world, exercising, finishing schoolworks satisfyingly, managing an anime page, reading books and downloading (visual) novels/choice of games, bingeing Gintama, reading complex psychological manga, listening to audiobooks while doing my laundry, online co-op with my friends, watching movies at discord, learning to play easy songs on guitar, discovered Touhou, trading answers with schoolmates, doing my daily morning chores at the house, buying breakfast and freshly baked bread at 7AM, spend time with my cousins and teach them what I&#39;m currently interested about, help my grandmother, manage our home business and WiFi hotspot, learn morse and other codes... everyday... I try learning new skills, how to edit, make lofi beats- I did all those productive stuff while staying at my grandmother&#39;s house.<br><br>TRIGGER WARNING<br><br>But as my explosion spurt of doing something with my life, there was also an explosive mental breakdowns and attempts. I was living everyday in a whole 360. One moment I&#39;ll be doing my routine just as usual, the next I have a kitchen knife pointed at my throat. I wake up and sleep wanting to die. It was weird. It was hell. I thought and reflected &quot;atleast now you&#39;ve done more stuff than before, even if nothing changes, atleast I&#39;m doing something&quot; I&#39;m still as depressed and suicidal but I&#39;ve achieved tons of things. <br><br>I&#39;m really trying to better myself. Physical, mental, and emotional. I meditate, I reflect a lot, I write A LOT. In my notes, notebooks, pads, I write everything down. Poems of helplessness, my screams of agony stored within the inked sheets of paper, fictional stories that reflected my soul, my explosive thoughts typed with continuous speed to vent it all out and reduce the harm in my physical body. I&#39;m really trying to keep it all under control. <br><br>I remember crying till I fall asleep in the bath. My face is so hot with tears, eyes burned, and the cold water on my body. I was getting better with these newfound habits, tactical skills that I can use in the long run... but also my mental health is at the edge of the other side of the spectrum. <br><br>2021-2022 now it all came crushing down. Bad thing after bad thing after bad thing. As if I wasn&#39;t suffering enough already. I was supposed to end it. I skipped my whole 11th year. I didn&#39;t do any schoolworks. I didn&#39;t do any of those routines I did in the past. I stopped writing, I stopped getting up in the morning, I stopped reading and drawing, I stopped learning the guitar, I barely watched any anime, barely read any manga. It was gone. I was really hoping to continue it once I&#39;m back living with my mother and sibling. Show them how much I&#39;ve changed. Influence my sibling to experience new things. It was supposed to be better but it didn&#39;t and it wasn&#39;t.<br><br>A year and a half till now 08/17/22 I don&#39;t sleep anymore. I can barely take a bath. I don&#39;t eat... I make food, bring it to my bed, take a bite, then go sleep to the point the food spoils because I&#39;ll be waking up the next evening, the cycle repeats. I have a bad case of food coma. I&#39;m acidic and it got worse- just eating anything makes my stomach hurt and want to throw up. Typing this comment makes me nauseous, I could feel the acid in my throat I have to sit up. I was supposed to kill myself. But I just ended up doing nothing but suffer for a whole year. The only good thing is I&#39;m clean of cutting myself. But at what cost... my hygiene, basic routines- I&#39;m like a new born baby. It&#39;s 2:25 AM right now and I&#39;m feeling trippy and disconnected. What was this all about? LOL <br><br>I wish I could change again. But I&#39;m dried out of motivation. I&#39;m gonna die anyways so why bother. But I still want to live normal, think normal. I&#39;ll try again at the next school year. Everytime I write things like these, it reminds me of that scene from modern family where the dad says &quot;she&#39;s like a self-cleaning oven&quot; <br><br>Well that&#39;s all, thank you for sparing your time with a stranger&#39;s dump.

To help gain some consistency in your routine (and eventually build it into a habit), set a reminder every Saturday on your phone to clean your room. Do these two things with consistency and you will set yourself up on a road to being more productive.

Like I felt nervous before doing something and immediately calm when I did it. But those were just small things like playing Onmyoji. Usually I felt weird after doing all daily things in Onmyoji so I just sad and tried to do anything. At the same time I was trying to wake up earlier to train a bit to be less fluffy (and get nice muscles &lt;3 ) but I usually heard the alarm and just shook the phone to shut it up. But after some time I noticed I feel bored when doing things on auto in Onmyoji so I started reading books while doing it. So somehow I recently read two 430 pages books in two days. Like one book a day. Also in this weird moment when I didn&#39;t know what to do after playing Onmyoji I thought I may try doing my small excersices. And now instead of doing one round in the morning and one round in the evening I do 4 exercises 50 times just after playing Onmyoji, then shower (I like showers so it&#39;s also another reason to take more showers a day &lt;3 ) and then I either draw or read. I noticed that when I finish Onmyoji I just make tea and immediately go for my training clothes. If I sit down after bringing tea I just feel like if I was sitting on a hedgehog. I have to get up. After shower I watch cute things like your videos or some cat videos and then I already have my music to listen to while drawing appearing near videos so I automatically click it and I always have paper to draw or notebook to plan my stories or a book on desk. So I automatically do what&#39;s needed. If I don&#39;t have anything prepared I feel weird and I have to write a part of my book on computer. Like, I have to. I will feel nervous if I won&#39;t, like, empty, I have to do something. So maybe it is still a bit wrong as it&#39;s all around &quot;I feel nervous if I won&#39;t do it&quot; but it&#39;s more in good things. Make tea and do exercise, make cocoa after leaving shower and draw something. I didn&#39;t even notice when my life changed from feeling emptiness to being like running to the library and scaring librarian with asking about books they didn&#39;t know they exist every week.

By the way, your life advice videos are absolutely ridiculous lmao, and the fact you mention reddit so many times is funny, cause it really is as autistic as a reddit thread. &quot;muh metaphors, metaphors, &quot;believe in yourself&quot;, &quot;believe in belief&quot;, &quot;belief the believe&quot; won&#39;t help anyone.

Also a lot of over-explaining on things that nobody actually knows anything about, on little theories that get questioned daily, like black holes. And somehow you manage to overexplain in a simplified way, ending up with a pile of nothing. if I can summarize that, I&#39;d say it&#39;s an autism speech. You should opt to only making sci-fi videos, because at least you have a reason for over-explaining on things you don&#39;t know, there.

A lot of small changes all around in your life creates a ripple effect that only speed up and expand as time goes on and the actions become more natural and fluid, and if you focus on making improvements on the process over time, and if it is small adjustments, this can the make expansion and speed of progress even more intense.

The approach here is basically the following: you should take baby steps towards the direction you think would help you improve your life, with a certain goal in mind you want to achieve. This way you can get rid of bad habits and replace them with new good ones little by little, day after day after day, and just take absolutely all the time you need to achieve one tiny goal at a time by being consistent, and that is absolutely fine because that&#39;s how science has proven your brain works. It&#39;s not about you being unable to exert your willpower and fucking get the thing done, this is not a video for the weak-willed of the crystal generation, or for lazy, depressed, anxious and burnt out people. And yet that other video made us see how truly short life is, and how you MUST make the best out of every single day because life is precious and wasting time doing things that don&#39;t add anything, that aren&#39;t productive, not sharing your time with your loved ones and just not living it to the fullest is little less than a capital sin, a crime.

You&#39;d think that would be enough to get an exercising habit but, as you guessed, it didn&#39;t stick. Because I went to the group classes to motivate myself and the plan of those classes changed. Then summer began and it became too hot to walk home after a workout. And then trainers got used to the place and started slacking off. Then the gym got crowded. Then my sister quit the gym. Then the gym fee got raised up. Then I got bored just like you who&#39;s reading this comment. <br><br>So yeah it was my habit then it wasn&#39;t. So I believe there are two ways to keep a habit. You should need that action right away like bathing. You smell and feel dirty and when you do it you feel nice and clean right after it. Or the action should make you feel good while you do it like browsing Instagram or eating chocolate. The video suggests that you make yourself think the action is kinda like these two. But my brain knows that&#39;s not true. I can listen to my favorite podcast while lying down. Plus, I might not have the time to work out everyday because something urgent or just unplanned comes up. Then the routine is messed up. You have to make the habit happen, try to keep the routine all the time. This isn&#39;t sustainable most of the time and for most of us.

To make things clear, I still have plenty of things I want to change in my life, but this one is something I struggled with for a years (used as an example in video as well). Obesity.<br><br>Ever since I landed my first job, I gained so much weight and was obesse ever since then. That was back in 2016. Things changed in 2021. Simply put, 5 years with struggling. Things are even worse because I was never fat before that, I just enjoyed spending my money on food (since financial situation in my home never allowed me to get money from parents in childhood). From time to time, I&#39;d start &quot;changing&quot; my life, but all of that was thrown into water after short time. Maybe even too short. Then I really wanted to give it a serious shot!<br><br>It all started in small &quot;portions&quot;. Slightly change food I eat, slightly change amount of food that I eat, slightly remove sugary drinks and live only with water, slightly add physical activities in my life, slightly reducing amount of time spending on PC. Result? Losing 4kg in a single week. And that was my trigger.<br>Ever since then, I started to enjoy in changes I made, without having urge to eat too much / unhealthy / drink sugary stuff. With all this mentioned, physical activities were also easier to participate in, and they became a habit. I started first month with 90kg (on 170cm which is extremely overweight), ended up first month with 80kg. That is 10kg in first month!<br>Funniest thing, I thought removing those unhealthy habits (with food) would be the worst thing for me. But instead, inflammation of muscles were the biggest problem. And if you ever participated in physical activites, you know that once you overcome them, they won&#39;t be problem anymore. And that was exactly what was pushing me even further. Life without trash food felt amazing, all activities were performed more and more smoothly and I couldn&#39;t be happier with myself. I literally &quot;programmed&quot; myself and this is how my day looked like:<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=8m00s\">8:00</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=14m00s\">14:00</a> -&gt; work (includes 15km of cycling every day and a lot of walking)<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=14m30s\">14:30</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=15m30s\">15:30</a> -&gt; cardio training<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=15m45s\">15:45</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=17m15s\">17:15</a> -&gt; rest<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=17m30s\">17:30</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=18m30s\">18:30</a> -&gt; jogging for 10km<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=19m00s\">19:00</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=20m30s\">20:30</a> -&gt; taking a walk with dog (5+ km)<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=20m30s\">20:30</a> - until sleep -&gt; chill with friends<br>And no, I haven&#39;t planned my life to be like this, it just happened. Also I was never tired in-between any activities, but after everything, falling asleep at the night never felt that good. From both burning myself out to make positive changes and knowing that I did something useful for that (and every other day).<br><br>Thing that pushed me is instant result. If you are seriously overweight, just try out with some changes, results will come in shortly! As said, I lost 4kg in my very first week. First month ended up with 10kg lost, 2nd month with additional 8kg lost and 3rd month with 4kg lost (I wasn&#39;t even trying to lose extra weight in 3rd month, but kilograms kept on melting). Thats 22kg in 3 months... 3 single months to beat something that I was struggling with for 5 years! In total, I lost 25kg, and no, I haven&#39;t regained a single gram, because I did all of this naturally. No diets, no special treatments, consuming whatnot, etc..<br>This year, I am jogging once again, ever since March, and no, I haven&#39;t lost any additional weight, neither is that my goal now, I&#39;m just enjoying my healthy habit I developed last year and keeping my body fit. Oh, and one last thing. The satisfaction when people start noticing how much weight you lost and keep on asking how you managed to do it is unexplainable (happened a lot since my job is basically being surrounded by people through whole shift).<br><br>Don&#39;t think about if you will be able to do it, because you can! And let any results just to push you even further into your final goal! I believe in you! \u270a", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T15:06:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Annu Rani", "comment_text": "Love and thanks", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T14:48:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Victoria Perez", "comment_text": "Nukes here we come \u2026.. hahaha", "comment_date": "2022-06-16T14:47:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rak Kingabed", "comment_text": "Oye oye oye.

Was everything you ever did without purpose and never really mattered, or will you just stop existing after your heart beats for the last time? Think about this, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real, place of eternal bliss. Hell is real, place of eternal torment. You&#39;re gonna spend eternity in one of those places. God&#39;s will is, that nobody would perish. One day, each and every one of us must appear before the Judgement Seat of the Holy Righteous God, and to give an account, how we have lived our life. The only way to get to Heaven is, if you haven\u2019t broken any of God\u2019s Laws, in other words, if you\u2019ve never sinned, and every single one of us have sinned. That is why God in His love and mercy sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. He left Heaven\u2019s Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a holy perfect life while being in the same temptations as we are, yet without sin, was condemned unjustly to death although being innocent, was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf, for there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, but Christ, the spotless and unblemished Lamb of God, the Perfect Sacrifice once and for all, died for us, so we may be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God, after the fall in Paradise by satan&#39;s tempting, through the Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Calvary, in His everlasting love towards every single one of us.<br>\u00a0<br>If you truly repent and ask for forgiveness of your sins from Jesus Christ, and believe with all your heart, that Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, rose from the dead by God\u2019s power on the third day according to The Holy Bible, and by faith receive Him as your Lord and Savior, through the Royal Blood of Jesus Christ you will be saved, and are born again of the Holy Spirit. Every sin that weighs down your inner being, even the ones you never dare to speak of, will be forgiven. Repent, believe, follow Christ, and you will spend eternity in Heaven with our Holy King, where is no more death, sorrow, pain nor crying.<br>\u00a0<br>John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son (Jesus Christ), that whosoever believeth in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>\u00a0<br>John 14:6 - Jesus said unto him, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father (to Heaven) except through Me.\u201c<br>\u00a0<br>Book of Acts 4:12 - Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men (only Jesus Christ), whereby we must be saved.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 10:9-10 - That\u00a0if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart, that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 10:13 - For whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD (Jesus Christ), shall be saved.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 8:1-2 - Therefore, there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus (born again of the Holy Spirit), who walk not after the flesh, but after the (Holy) Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.<br>\u00a0<br>1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.<br>\u00a0<br>Ephesians 2:8-9 - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>\u00a0<br>Isaiah 1:18 - Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br>\u00a0<br>John 10:10 \u2013 (Jesus said:) \u201cThe thief (satan) cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\u201c<br>\u00a0<br>1 Peter 5:8 - Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking, whom he may devour.<br>\u00a0<br>Ephesians 6:12 - For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>\u00a0<br>The LORD bless you and keep you; The LORD make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; The LORD lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.<br>\u00a0<br>In Jesus Christ Holy and Mighty Name.

At the start it gave a list of things you &quot;should&quot; be doing. Choose the one you like, not that you &quot;should&quot; be doing. For example, I was drinking and gaining weight, it was not going well. I tried so hard to quit drinking and to work out. This little step at a time thing did not work at all. So I decided I wanted to go somewhere, Mexico to be exact. The trouble was, I didn&#39;t speak a word of Spanish, none whatsoever. So I started learning Spanish, I enjoyed it, but there was a downside, drinking loads of alcohol made it hard to concentrate. So I cut down, and considered quitting all together. I didn&#39;t quit, but I did cut down and studied something I wanted to study. Eventually I thought what do I want to do in Mexico, well there were some phiscal activies I wanted to do that involved a bit of hiking. I put a bag on my back, put 5km on the treadmill and at the steepest incline and thought it would be a walk in the park, turns out being fat makes this hard to do. This now became my goal, since it was reasonable to think this would be what I would be doing. Even once I achieved this I was so exhausted. Eventually I lost the weight, went to Mexico and had a great time. <br><br>My secret is not what I &quot;should&quot; be doing, but &quot;why&quot; am I doing it. If you have no reason to lose weight, then don&#39;t. If you enjoy alcohol, know the risks (to you and other) can afford it and are happy with the outcome, don&#39;t quit drinking, or cut down until you are happy. <br><br>I&#39;m sure loads of mental health professionals are reading this and cringing right now, at the end if the day it worked.<br><br>PS. Mexico is so underated, it was a fantastic country, great people and just a fantastic culture. <br><br>PPS. No the Mexican Ministry of Tourism did not pay me to say that.<br><br>PPPS.

These concepts are all still generally true, but it&#39;s always difficult to really deal with fact that my neurodevelopmental disorder is a kind of &quot;hard mode for life&quot; and so things like &quot;removing as much barrier to action as possible&quot; is so much more important for me. <br><br>I&#39;m happy for things like this video. It&#39;s generally really good advice. I&#39;m also kinda sad that I have to work harder to scrape by and related topics like how people generally don&#39;t really understand what this disorder is like at all. (my immediate circle is much more science-friendly, but my family? eh, they kinda had to focus on meeting more basic needs &amp; didn&#39;t have the same educational opportunities or special interests so they don&#39;t just <i>know</i> this stuff and it&#39;s tough dealing with that ignorance and what that means for me.)<br><br>like, people think of dopamine as a reward chemical in the brain and that is about where the thought process stops. But the thing is that it&#39;s not just the reward at the end. it is also the chemical that gets you motivated to start on your task in the first place. your brain squirts out some dopamine so that you can even begin tasks so that you have some amount of motivation juice to, well, do the thing.<br><br>we ADHD people? our brains don&#39;t do that. &quot;normal&quot; folks have brains that make the motivation feeling for them so they &quot;just do the thing&quot; while we can&#39;t &quot;just&quot; do things. I dunno, I try not to let it get to me (especially when it comes to people that I am not close to) but since this is a brain thing, it impacts EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF MY LIFE so it&#39;s something that can kinda get me down.<br><br>but I do what I can. I remove as many barriers as possible. I am slowly reworking every aspect of my personal space and my routines to optimize for how my brain works to reduce the amount of precious limited bandwidth I have been &quot;wasting&quot; on forcing myself to do things I need to do but am bored to bits over. and by all accounts I am doing well in life. I&#39;ve paid back most of my debts and I am investing so that I can cash out that mutual fund over time as a retired person living a very quiet life. It sucks to think that I don&#39;t have the responsibility to be a pet owner when I retire but I can pick up dog walking instead and it&#39;s that kind of problem solving that is going to take care of the little things in life. I&#39;m way less mean to myself about the amount of frozen food I eat and I am in therapy so you know, all big steps towards being nicer to myself and more comfortable in my body. <br><br>and when I need to have me a cry, I reach out to my closest friends and my partners and I give them a big hug and hold them tight. I am grateful for the emotional support they offer and that I can vent about having to work so much harder to try my best to not backslide and they hold that space for me. sometimes you just need to scream out at the world before going out there and going at it again, you know?", "comment_date": "2022-06-13T17:15:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dale Massey", "comment_text": "this made my anxiety a million times worse", "comment_date": "2022-06-13T17:05:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Entropy As a Service", "comment_text": "How about a Speedrun tutorial next?", "comment_date": "2022-06-13T16:58:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DyllanDrake", "comment_text": "I love this channel.

Here are my four to add: <br><br>1. Remove boundaries to starting: if you&#39;re want to practise guitar more then leave it out and plugged in. Make it so you can just walk past, play for 5 mins then get on with something else. It has to be as easy as possible.<br><br>2. Become aware of the things that stop you - sometimes quite small random things, like the guitar is always out of tune (so buy a tuner), or the only time you get to practise everyone is already in bed (so use some headphones) or it&#39;s difficult to hold the guitar on your bed (so find a good chair and move it next to your amp)<br><br>3. Remove pressure - if you&#39;re doing it to be famous then you&#39;re always going to feel the pressure to achieve. You&#39;ve got to do it primarily because you love it. <br><br>4. and this is key for me - Acknowledge you only have limited energy. It can feel like if you have 5 free hours then you can do one hour of guitar practise, an hour of exercise, an hour to read your book, an hour to cook, etc. But in reality each activity has not only a physical cost, but also a mental load. Acknowledge the mental load, then free yourself of it. If you have a stressful job then you probably won&#39;t do your hobby - the job has taken all your mental load and that is why you&#39;re watching Netflix for 5 hours.<br><br>5. You do not have to change the world. It&#39;s ok, there are already plenty of authors, musicians, entertainers, photographers, etc. You can just do this for fun. Just honestly and seriously, start from the position that the world does not need you to do this thing, and will not care if you never do it.

They&#39;re right that it&#39;s all about habits, and if something isn&#39;t already part of your routine, it can be difficult to do. The jungle path analogy is apt and they&#39;re right that it takes energy -- but therein lies the problem. Every time I come across one of these self-help things, the solution is always for the person to &quot;do x&quot; or &quot;think about x in a different way.&quot;<br><br>The fundamental problem with this is these solutions involve the person just doing the thing that helps themselves. This is a problem because helping ourselves is the very thing we struggle with. The problem is <b>starting</b> the new habits. If we don&#39;t have the energy/discipline/strength to forge the new pathways, then we&#39;ll struggle with any solution we&#39;re told to do, because it will become just another piece of homework to struggle with. If your struggle is that you can&#39;t get yourself to do stuff, then you&#39;re not going to be able to get yourself to do the solution either. And often, after expending energy on the gear-shift you have even less energy left over to work on the new task, making it all the easier to slink back into procrastination.<br><br>This is usually the problem with me. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve found that help from someone else is often the key in these things. I work with a tutor to help get school work done. By being prompted and held accountable by someone else, there&#39;s an outside source of energy jumpstarting and fueling the change, and I can ride it to get my own momentum going. If staying on track is hard then you need someone else to keep you on track so you can eventually build it into a habit. Because otherwise, you&#39;re just going to get exhausted and grind to a halt, the same way you would regardless.<br><br>The only problem with help from someone else is that if you don&#39;t have someone to help you, then finding someone will be just another difficult task.<br><br>Also, Kurzgesagt got it backwards. They said starting is the easy part and continuing is the hard part. Deciding to change is easy, but when you actually do it, it&#39;s the other way around.

Why do you say that &#39;my brain hates spend energy&quot; when in reality I work like a mule every day and I don&#39;t complain like the useless and idiotic children I had who were browsing the internet every day? A year ago, I took away all their electronic devices and sent them to to work the land like black slaves so that they suffer what I suffer, because making my own children suffer makes me very, very happy. And if they were wrong about something, I punished them with the whip and I, happy and joyful, I saw his blood run, his tears come out and his mouth scream. Those were the happiest days of my life. Everything was fine for a few months, but it happened that one of my children committed suicide, I didn&#39;t care anymore, at least I had at least second and last to whom I forced him to work more. He begged me that he couldn&#39;t take it anymore, but I pushed him, threw him to the ground and gave him so many, many lashes that I lost count. Afterwards, fed up with the whip, I proceeded to kick and stomp on him. And when I got tired of kicking and stomping on him, I proceeded to pummel him with my great and glorious fists. When I got tired, I contemplated my wonderful work: an amorphous and reddish mass of ground meat, broken bones, etc... Magnificent work of art! Wonderful! Gorgeous! It deserves to be exhibited at the Louvre Museum in Paris! At the Prado Museum in Madrid! At the Museum of Modern Art in New York! At the Sistine Chapel! No wait, the sistine chapel is a chapel, not a museum... Anyway, MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH... Oh no, wait... now I feel empty, I&#39;m lonely, I get depressed... Anyway, I&#39;m going to kill myself ...

The first thing you need to do is to plan your trip through learning the language. To make this easier, get for example a textbook series, like the books you used in school. For example, when I started to learn japanese I got the Genki books. That took a huge load off my mind, because they planned the path I should walk for me. They already had an order of things I learn and when I learn them, so all I need is to follow them. -&gt; Less energy spent on planning stuff.<br><br>Then, you need a certain trigger, like the videos said. For example I started to do at least one assignment of the book series, or read one grammar point every day right after I had lunch. It became a fundamental part of my meal. First I eat, then I brush my teeth and then I learn a bit.<br>Over time I expanded this. For example I used a vocab- and kanji learning app and a grammar practise app every morning after breakfast, and I repeated that after every meal too.<br><br>Having a clear trigger for these things makes stuff so much easier. So, I encourage you, think about your day, what is there that you do every day? Link your learning to these things! At the beginning I often forgot it and I needed to remind myself, that I need to do this now, but over time it became more of an integral part of my meals to study afterwards.", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T20:24:49Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "B87 Beveiliging", "comment_text": "Its a small step for man but a giant leap for mankind", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T20:24:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PrimroseFN", "comment_text": "for someone who needs more of a framework, a lot of this can be achieved by reading atomic habits &amp;/or using RSLTN - great video kurzgesagt!", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T20:23:29Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Captain Smith", "comment_text": "there is always bit coin.

Was everything you ever did without purpose and never really mattered, or will you just stop existing after your heart beats for the last time? Think about this, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real, place of eternal bliss. Hell is real, place of eternal torment. You&#39;re gonna spend eternity in one of those places. God&#39;s will is, that nobody would perish. One day, each and every one of us must appear before the Judgement Seat of the Holy Righteous God, and to give an account, how we have lived our life. The only way to get to Heaven is, if you have never broken any of God\u2019s Laws, in other words, if you have never committed sin, and every single one of us have sinned. That is why God in His love and mercy sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. He left Heaven\u2019s Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a holy perfect life while being in the same temptations as we are, yet without sin, was condemned unjustly to death although being innocent, was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf, for there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, but Christ, the spotless and unblemished Lamb of God, the Perfect Sacrifice once and for all, died for us, so we may be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God, after the fall in Paradise by satan&#39;s tempting, through the Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Calvary, in His everlasting love towards every single one of us.<br>\u00a0<br>If you truly repent and ask for forgiveness of your sins from Jesus Christ, and believe with all your heart, that Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, rose from the dead by God\u2019s power on the third day according to The Holy Bible, and by faith receive Him as your Lord and Savior, through the Royal Blood of Jesus Christ you will be saved, and are born again of the Holy Spirit. Every sin that weighs down your inner being, even the ones you never dare to speak of, will be forgiven. Repent, believe, follow Christ, and you will spend eternity in Heaven with our Holy King, where is no more death, sorrow, pain nor crying.<br>\u00a0<br>John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son (Jesus Christ), that whosoever believeth in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>\u00a0<br>John 14:6 - Jesus said unto him, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father (to Heaven) except through Me.\u201c<br>\u00a0<br>Book of Acts 4:12 - Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men (only Jesus Christ), whereby we must be saved.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 10:9-10 - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 10:13 - For whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD (Jesus Christ), shall be saved.<br>\u00a0<br>Romans 8:1-2 - Therefore, there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus (born again of the Holy Spirit), who walk not after the flesh, but after the (Holy) Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.<br>\u00a0<br>1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.<br>\u00a0<br>Ephesians 2:8-9 - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>\u00a0<br>Isaiah 1:18 - Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br>\u00a0<br>John 10:10 \u2013 (Jesus said:) \u201cThe thief (satan) cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\u201c<br>\u00a0<br>1 Peter 5:8 - Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking, whom he may devour.<br>\u00a0<br>Ephesians 6:12 - For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>\u00a0<br>The LORD bless you and keep you; The LORD make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; The LORD lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.<br>\u00a0<br>In Jesus Christ Holy and Mighty Name.

I can tell when something tastes good, but I receive very little satisfaction from eating it, so I don&#39;t care much about what I eat as long as I don&#39;t dislike it. There&#39;s no mental signal in my head to tell me to eat either, so I&#39;m not sure of when I&#39;m hungry or not until my stomach starts hurting. Despite this, I&#39;ve managed to keep eating semi-normally. Late at night, my stomach starts aching and rumbling, which is pretty obnoxious. <br><br>When I notice it&#39;s dark out and notice my stomach hurting at the same time, my immediate impulse is to eat. I first find what I plan to watch while I eat, and prepare it on my computer for when I get back to it with my food. I then go downstairs and begin preparing a meal. It&#39;s almost always something simple, so it doesn&#39;t take much thought. While it&#39;s cooking, I always scroll through Reddit to pass the time. When I notice the timer is almost done, I get a beverage ready, like soda or ice cold water. I get my food and my beverage, then sit down at my computer and begin watching whatever it is that I prepared, such as this video. It&#39;s actually what I was watching while eating just now. When I&#39;m done, I set my plate or bowl on the table next to my desk, take a sip of my drink, and usually start doing something else on my computer, such as writing this comment.<br><br>Eating is usually a really tedious and bothersome task for me. Sometimes I&#39;ll take a bite of a snack and just not finish it because eating it is too annoying to do. However, I don&#39;t find it as bothersome when I have my late-night meal. Thanks to this video, I now understand why that is. I plan to try using what I now know to recreate the necessary conditions to form a habit, and maybe improve myself a tiny bit. I aspire to be far more than what I am now. I feel inadequate or insufficient.<br><br>Perhaps that feeling towards myself will change someday.", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T03:52:09Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Juan Carre\u00f1o", "comment_text": "Guys your videos are trully amazing, really appreciate each of em, please never stop doing them.", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T03:38:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sobbing Cat", "comment_text": "2 unskippable 15 second ads right at the beginning", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T03:36:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zaturn Nep", "comment_text": "Amazing!", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T03:36:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jakub", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt please do episode on Psychadelics", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T03:33:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sayan Gaming", "comment_text": "Turning routine into habits.", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T03:28:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ruair\u00ed M", "comment_text": "Ignoring the topic of the video, I just wanna point out how perfect this voice is to Kurzgesagt.

Great parents, great friends and great schools. The circumstances were seemingly perfect. It just so happened I was always told I was very smart at all ages as a child. It came not just from my parents, but quite literally from every teacher I had and the majority of my friends. Even people who&#39;ve just had a few interactions with me picked it up and saw that as an obvious quality of mine. I never really believed it because I don&#39;t hold myself that highly. <br><br>However, now in hindsight, I realize just how much easier I had it than most back then during my school years. Everything was so easy for me that I literally didn&#39;t have to study, I could improvise and learn the topic at the test itself instead of preparing for the test. This worked even throughout high school and I was studying computer science. Sure, I didn&#39;t get the best grades, but I didn&#39;t have to worry about failing a test. But... my friends... ohh they had to study so much and even then they still ended up with the same grades as I did, a person who didn&#39;t study at all. So what did I do with all that free time? Just wasting my time with my hobbies, gaming primarily.<br><br>So my advice to young people, having experienced this journey, being smart is indeed a great gift but if you don&#39;t put it to use it doesn&#39;t matter and it will bite you back later. You will become complacent, heck, I&#39;d even say lazy and that habit is incredibly difficult to break. The few friends at school that did get the best grades wasn&#39;t just smart, they also put in the effort and the work.

We tend to seek rewards and avoid punishment. Ajzen, Higgins, Locke have alos built their theories on that for reinforced behavior,  the promotion of rewards or threat of punishment, as well als the alignment or conflicts of inner goals with external goals.<br>So lets break down whats missing: this video focuses (for simplification purposes) mostly on the reward side, as most of the body of knowledge does, mainly, because punishments induce stress and with that fear and many other complex negative responses, which makes predictions of behavior much more difficult than rewards. But the essence of punishment usually is: once you are punished or you feel punished or you feel threatened to be punished, you try to avoid it, entering a loop of using methods to build inner security which helps to avoiding punishment. <br>What this video tries to tell you is that in these situations you will likely simply follow the methods or habits that were reinforced during your upbringing as a longterm strategy and your five closest persons&#39; methods (or habits) as a short-term strategy to deal with these difficult situations and what would be best is: try to see the punishment as a reward and as a chance to evaluate your set of methods and actively chose to discard those that arent helpful in every single negative situation and learn from your own ambitions and from other peoples ambitions to constantly reinforce more beneficial and healthier methods, that will with consistency and continuity turn into routines, that counter the natural habits in each of these situations and will make you feel rewarded for every successul application of that new routine to foster and increase your mental growth.<br><br>Now i what else is missing? This has to do with self-control as described by Ouchi, self-control is usually enacted in situations where universal market rules, beaurocratic written rules and arbitrary group rules fail, and where the individual is forced to use self-control to achieve an inner goal that otherwise would lead to a goal conflict with external goals and hence to a punishment. The self-control helps to avoid punishment, hence self-interested behavior is reinforced in those systems that do not allow for an individual to competently achieve a goal alignment (inner with external goals) by his own means. Meaning, the more difficult situations we face within an arbitrary, strictly punishing and intransparent system, the more we think outside the systems boundaries and seek methods that help us grow outside our role inside the system: but only if we see this as a chance to grow, because if we dont, we enter a loop of fear which drives us to only see minimal security to survive within the system.<br><br>So try to see chances to grow, evaluate your habits, do something positive, learn from other people doing something positive, do it consistently and continuously and you will grow mentally into a better representation of yourself by the healthy routines you enact.", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:28:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u16b2\u16be\u16df\u16b2\u16b2 \u16cf\u16a2\u16b1\u16be\u16ab\u16da", "comment_text": "...ok but how did u know i play civ and browse reddit?", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:26:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Faris A", "comment_text": "I would say stop constantly looking at people and feeling you&#39;ve to do something to be at that level focus on yourself and realise what you need to do don&#39;t care about the time it&#39;ll take just be consistent and believe what you&#39;re doing will pile up to great things", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:23:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KKG C", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not sure if this is accurate, my grandma have Alzheimer, it&#39;s like she lost her &quot;planner&quot;, and her &quot;toddler&quot; just moves randomly on the existing roads, while the existing road constantly deteriorate.", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:13:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Weith", "comment_text": "The best habit I ever developed was keeping a journal on my phone", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:13:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "qe qe", "comment_text": "...Or you can just enjoy you lazy life and bad habits like i do ;D", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:12:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hassan Rabbi", "comment_text": "One of the best things of internet is Kurzgesagt &lt;3", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:12:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bharath racharla", "comment_text": "This video is basically a book called \u201cAtomic Habits\u201d by James Clear\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:08:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "neocow", "comment_text": "neurotypical people get to have habits lol", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:07:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wilson Flint", "comment_text": "Tonnes of cognitive and freudian psychology here, great video!!!", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:07:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "minecraft pro miner", "comment_text": "how to change your life?!<br>step 1: ofc touch grass<br>step 2: stop smoking<br>step 3: don&#39;t play games when u haven&#39;t touch a single piece of grass<br>step 4: get a father cuz ur fatherless<br>step 5: get a girl that will trasnform into a mother cuz u are parentsless<br>those are the top 5 thing u can do to f urself and to support urself as a human that travel miles away just to find care and intentions", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:04:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mata Valenzuela", "comment_text": "los amo", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:04:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aaa aaa", "comment_text": "Thanks<br>I&#39;m hope and try to do it", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T17:03:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "haphaeu", "comment_text": "Great video.

I had been trying to come up with methods to improve my efficiency towards completing my goals and change myself into my &#39;best&#39; version for a long time. (spoiler - still quite not there yet, but I&#39;ve taken some small steps towards realizing it). <br>I had been thinking a lot on this subject during the last 2 years; I&#39;m happy to say that slowly and painfully I came to realize the truths of the conclusions given in this video on my own.<br>That doesn&#39;t mean that I have learned nothing new from watching this video or that this video hasn&#39;t helped me. I learned a lot about routines and &#39;The Planner&#39; and habits and &#39;The Toddler&#39;. I now understand how triggers work. I will definitely use these new learnings to improve myself further. Also, it was very refreshing to see the ideas bubbling in my mind for over 2 years were depicted so beautifully and attractively. <br>I came to the same conclusions on my own on the following points depicted in the video: <br> (1) don&#39;t aim too high, but take small steps, (2) make tedious/repetitive task enjoyable by doing another simple task in parallel such as listen to music while studying, sing a song while riding bike to school, solve a sudoku puzzle while waiting in line,  listen to a podcast while exercising, etc. (3) starting something is easy, the difficult part is continuing to do it everyday, without fail - that is the main problem which can be tackled if you keep points 1 and 2 in mind and follow through.<br><br>Some other things I found out about my own psychology/behavioral mannerisms over the last 2 years were: <br>(1) I always need to hope/try to have fun while doing whatever task I need to complete. This is because after repeating a task thrice or more than that, I tend to get bored and find the monotony very discouraging. Hence, I need to find new ways to enjoy an activity to break that monotony.<br>(2) I often fail to complete even small goals which I had assigned to myself (like washing dishes after meal). This is creates a feeling of dissatisfaction in my mind which is extremely discouraging and causes me to be unwilling to complete more tasks from my routine. I often end up wasting the whole day because I didn&#39;t start good - thinking, that I&#39;ll complete everything tomorrow, that tomorrow will be perfect, which is almost never the case. This creates more of that discouraging feeling of dissatisfaction (with myself). And, then I end up wasting time on the internet because it is &#39;oh-so-soothing&#39; to my lazy mind.<br>(3) Ultimately, the only way to sustainably avoid/lessen the feeling of being dissatisfied with myself is to take small steps, regular and sincere steps, towards completing my routine which, I one day hope will become a habit of mine that comes naturally.<br><br>I have used these points to get in a better shape (lost 13kgs in the last two months) by exercising regularly. I feel like exercising has become a habit for me (maybe &#39;the Toddler&#39; has learned, I still sometimes feel the monotony while exercising, but I have some ideas on how to overcome it). What I now need to do is to study regularly as well as pursue my hobbies instead of wasting time on various online forums, addictive video games, binge watching videos, etc.<br><br>If ever you feel that a task is very hard, that you don&#39;t have the required will power, recall that there are millions of people who are not as fortunate as you, but they have to work hard without complaints at low waged and difficult conditions to make ends meet. <br>So, to people watching this video, the conclusions presented in this video are true and if a lazy person like me could follow through, then so can you! <br>Good luck. :D", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T08:37:26Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Judeca L", "comment_text": "Does kurzgesagt mean in a nutshell?

and\r<br>\r<br>WHEREAS, there is a growing amount of evidence that the People\u2019s Republic of China is sponsoring organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience-specifically certain ethnic minority and religious groups such as practitioners of Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa) as documented by independent, non-partisan organizations, Non Governmental Organizations, and tribunals such as the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC), The China Tribunal, and Freedom House;

Finally what worked for me was forcing the computer to shutdown at the time when I want to go to bed. This absolutely solved it for me.

Want to reduce junk food intake? Delete all phone contacts for fast food deliveries. Yes, you might google them again, but it will at least afford you more time to remember what you want and more opportunities to stop yourself.

If I need to work on computer, simply starting the program could be enough to keep me going. If I need to exercise, just getting up from sitting makes starting easier. If you&#39;re sitting, go get a glass of water. Now you are standing. Sitting down makes it a lot harder to start. Cleaning? What if I just clean this one small area? Organize all the shoes so they are not scattered around. But first get a glass of water.<br><br>Also one of the issues I&#39;ve always had is that I had a bad idea about efficiency. Instead of doing things as soon as they needed doing I postponed them so I could do a big thing at once. Instead of washing the dishes (didnt have dishwasher back then) straight after dinner I did the dishes like every 2 or 3 days while doing all other cleaning things too. Which meant I made a couple of 5 minute daily jobs into a 2 hour bi-weekly thing. Don&#39;t do that.<br><br>Doing things in big batches creates a horrible cycle where everything becomes a big task which makes it even harder to just start. It is also mentally draining as you always have some big thing waiting for you but you don&#39;t really know when you are going to do it. It makes it too easy to procrastinate. You feel guilty about not doing it now. And you feel tired and useless even when doing it because sometimes you have left so much undone that you can&#39;t finish it in one go. <br><br>So to me the two biggest things that I&#39;ve changed in my life is starting and doing things asap. Also sometimes you have to ask yourself am I doing something right now that actually matters. Like writing this comment? I don&#39;t think so.

You don\u2019t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can\u2019t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.  //////////////////////.........,,,,,,,,,,,,", "comment_date": "2022-06-08T02:49:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Giess", "comment_text": "No joke, I was playing Civilization 6 while watching this.

It reminds me of my counsellor encouraging me to stop saying &quot;i should do...&quot; and instead saying &quot;i could&quot;: So instead of militantly forcing yourself to do things (and getting stressed, overwhelmed, and burnt out worrying about the end goal), taking a more kind and open approach to tasks so you feel more inclined to make them a routine.

I also had to sleep later because of school. I struggled to get back into the \u201cearlier, better days,\u201d but by forcing myself to meet standards I clearly couldn\u2019t, I inevitably crashed and spent the entire month of May in a extremely depressive episode because I hated myself couldn\u2019t meet my expectations (plus burnout).

I kept doing extra efforts so with time it got easier and I became faster at doing it. During the first 6-7 years I basically lost 100lbs and became more healthy, and overall I was feeling better. I still do that same job, and it is still hard but I barely find it hard because my body is so used to it and I&#39;m actually feeling that satisfaction from doing it. More than that, after losing this much weight I also wanted to correct my old bad habits of eating bad stuff and too much of it too. and with time I actually started to prefer vegetables and fruits over  transformed food and even meet, (not saying it&#39;s bad or that I don&#39;t eat any, I do, but much less and I don&#39;t really miss it)  I managed to switch to healthier food and there too I  get satisfaction.

I hated reading until I went to university. Since then I started reading a little more and more every night, intsead of watching TV. The little reading became a lot, I&#39;ve became addicted to reading books and I read them faster and faster. Not only that, but I was able to write a thesis from a book I loved and I had unlocked access to so much new information that I&#39;m constantly filled with ideas that I want to share. This all led to me starting writing. At the end of high school, I struggled to write an essay and to reach the minium number of required words. Nowadays I can write a full blown dissertation from scratch in like a month. I also started writing short stories and so on. Also I fall asleep easier since I don&#39;t watch TV... <br><br>This sounds nice and all, but I also had many times when I didn&#39;t want to do these things. Sometimes you must force yourself to do it. The important thing is to keep the routine. Like it is possible that I will only read one page of a book on a certain day, but the important part is to pick up the book every single day. So it is indeed hard work, but you don&#39;t have to force yourself to do everything at once. You don&#39;t have to read 10 pages everyday because that&#39;s the quota, but you must always do the actions you want to make a habit.<br><br>Good luck to all of you!

You would be amazed at how many changes we attempt as a result of the &quot;influencers&quot; out there in the media world who work on our minds 24/7.  <br><br>Often those changes are urged by THEM because THEY will benefit from them financially.  They will use a variety of subtle psychological tactics to prompt people to continue trying to make very difficult changes even though the probability of success is low.  Why?  Because they are raking in the profits &quot;helping&quot; those struggling people to make the changes they have been brainwashed into thinking they MUST make if they are to finally become &quot;healthy, wealthy, and wise&quot; during the time that they are struggling to achieve them.  Whether one is actually successful or not in making the changes is really unimportant to those influencers because their only goal is THEIR profits.  <br><br>If some small percentage actually succeed in making the changes, that means that they are no longer struggling and no longer PAYING for the &quot;help&quot; to make the change.  That&#39;s bad for those capitalist influencers because it reduces their income.  However, they will often use the rare success stories for marketing purposes and to convince newbies how easy it is to make the changes after they get their help, of course.  Notice how you are always required to pay IN ADVANCE for the &quot;help&quot; before you get it and achieve any results rather than later AFTER and only if you actually benefited from the help and made the changes?  That&#39;s because these hucksters already know you probably won&#39;t succeed before they even sell you their &quot;help&quot;!<br><br>Sadly, a growing percentage of the world&#39;s economy is based on selling people all sorts of products and services that they really don&#39;t need and have to go into high interest debt to obtain.  But, the influences tell you that &quot;everyone is using them&quot; even though they may have just started their business a few months ago!  They are depending on the &quot;herd instinct&quot; principle where people don&#39;t want to be left behind while the rest of the world moves on.  You are given the subtle message in advertising that those people getting the new products and services are actually the most attractive, wise, and productive people.  That means those who opt not to get the advertised products and services won&#39;t achieve that status.  One must try to avoid these brainwashing tactics as much as possible.  <br><br>A good place to start is by avoiding listening to tv and radio ads.  That means prompt use of a remote control&#39;s mute button when they come on.  For the internet, make sure you download and install a good ad blocker.  Taking these measures should allow one to be virtually free of incoming ads so that his mind can begin to heal.  Fortunately, most people now know that close to 100% of the &quot;cold call&quot; telemarketing they get on their home and cell phones is from scammers in other countries and they immediately hang up on them or download and install software to block them.  Their only goal is to tease out information so they can make a buck selling it to criminals who commit &quot;identity theft&quot;.  The best way to deal with them is to immediately hang up on them and avoid any extended conversations with them.  Each year in the US, MILLIONS of people, mostly elderly trusting types, loose a lot of their savings to these scammers and are too embarrassed to report the crime.", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T21:48:00Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Athina Bevardos", "comment_text": "Reminds me of that line from BoJack Horseman<br>&quot;It gets easier.

It has 3 main components: the task tracker, the journal, and the to do list.<br><br>The Task Tracker is straight out of CGP Grey&#39;s video, and it while it&#39;s much more condensed, it seems similar to Kurzgesagt&#39;s habit journal.  I have a list of tasks to do most days that generally have a tier for minimum effort and a second tier for higher effort (things like &quot;5 minute walk/20 minute walk or workout session&quot; and &quot;Dishes and Laundry/30 minutes of other chores&quot; and for each day, I fill in half a square for the minimum effort and a full square for the more involved task.  This would work best for people who are motivated to see grids of things filled out.<br><br>The Journal bit is freeform writing about my day.  Things I got done, how physiotherapy is progressing, stuff happening with my friends, family, around the world.  For me it&#39;s very stream of consciousness, and definitely not meant to be read by anyone else.  The big value here is that it gets you to remember things that happened in the day.  Before starting the journal, I was in a mental state where I&#39;d glide through days totally in the moment and have basically no memory of what happened that week.  Which is not a fun way to live your life.  There&#39;s some gratitude journalling stuff in there, but...I find forcing &quot;I&#39;m grateful for X&quot; into every day&#39;s entry really....awkward and stilted even for myself.<br><br>The to do list comes right after each day&#39;s journal entry, in the same section, and it&#39;s 3-5 things that I want to work on that day.  For me, most of them have been housekeeping tasks, because I&#39;d fallen completely out of the habit of doing any form of housekeeping and was in dire need of cleaning things up piece by piece.  (Still working on that, it&#39;s a fairly big house for one person and I&#39;m not the kind of person who can just do a 3 hour housekeeping blitz, so progress is slow.)  The key point is that each entry is its own manageable task: &quot;clean desk&quot; rather than &quot;clean entire computer room,&quot; and no matter how many things you can think of that you have to do, the pencil drops after the 5th entry.  Then, the next day, you look at your to do list, see a manageable sized list of bite sized tasks, and it&#39;s not a big deal to just pick one and do it.  If you feel the need to make a massive and complete to do list with everything, go ahead and do so, and use that as a source of things to put in your daily list.  But the entire goal of this is to not overwhelm yourself with a massive list of things to do, so look at your daily list, not your master list, when you&#39;re actually looking to do things.<br><br>Finally, all of this only works with a promise you make to yourself: complete honesty.  No checking things off on the to do list before they&#39;re done.  No filling out boxes on the task tracker you haven&#39;t earned.  You don&#39;t have to go as far as being brutally honest in the journal entries, because it&#39;s way too easy to mask self-abuse as self-honesty.<br><br>Using this since late April, I went from procrastinating things I decided to do for months to feeling bad about procrastinating for a day or two.  I&#39;m exercising more, I&#39;m healthier, I finally went to a physiotherapist to see about my bad back (having been referred to a physiotherapist back in March 2020 the day before the lockdowns for the pandemic hit) and my back has gone from being in pain 80-90% of the time to <b>not</b> being in pain 80-90% of the time.  I feel more motivated, I&#39;m going through stuff that&#39;s just been sitting on shelves unused for years and getting rid of the things I don&#39;t need.  The difference is astonishing.  Whatever one would call this system I&#39;ve come up with, it&#39;s clearly the system that works for me.  <br><br>So yeah, if you&#39;re listless and unmotivated and gliding through life, try journaling.  I can&#39;t guarantee it will work for you as well as it worked for me.

They don\u2019t care about you.. they care about profits. But you need that system in order to live and eat and sleep comfortably. I\u2019m lucky and fortunate. My parents are not.

I&#39;ve done some of my own research on this topic because of my ADHD. Habits are much harder to form for anyone suffering from any kind of Executive Dysfunction. It&#39;s as if the jungle in your metaphor is suddenly plunged into the dark of night. There&#39;s no seeing the future or the past, those don&#39;t exist. The Wise Planner can only communicate via Ouija Board and that makes it a lot harder to make the Toddler, who controls almost everything, listen to him. With persistence the Toddler can be forced (a huge amount of effort that doesn&#39;t always work out) to change. Or sometimes they can be coaxed or tricked. Unfortunately for anyone with this problem, Triggers don&#39;t always work the same way for us. <br><br>Say I wanted to make a new trail. So my wise planner comes up with the plan for this trail. He even suggests that when blazing it, I can carry a light to see a bit ahead, a little plan and schedule. The Toddler, however, doesn&#39;t want to go because its much more comfortable where its at. It can, however, be lured onward by promises of end goals it can&#39;t see (it&#39;s dark in this ADHD forest. You don&#39;t get to see forward or back) or by smaller rewards placed along the way such as a cookie for every homework problem you do.<br><br>However... that&#39;s not the end of that. For the ADHD brain, the Toddler is constantly very very hungry for rewards. Chronically starving for them and will desperately cling to anything rewarding, even if its very bad or even upsetting (Unfortunately bad emotions can also trigger reward chemicals in the brain). If they don&#39;t feel they are getting enough reward for the effort being put into this new path, or they feel like it&#39;s taking too long... they might actually start ignoring the Wise Planner, turn around, and go straight back the other way whether we want them to or not. Putting an end to our plans of new paths.<br><br>If that were it, well... it would be more difficult, but still somewhat manageable as long as you work out a plan to properly reward the Toddler so it doesn&#39;t give up and leave. But there are more complications. The Wise Planner is still only communicating via Ouija Board, this makes it difficult for them to properly organize plans because they&#39;re having to tell the Toddler how to organize them, and the Toddler is easily overwhelmed because it doesn&#39;t know how to put things in order. What comes first, or what is most important, or what steps are needed in order to reach the goal are difficult... and it makes it even more difficult when you remember that they cannot see the end goal, because its dark.<br><br>Another hitch. The Jungle is full of Howler Monkeys. Making lots of noise, swinging about and shaking things, offering the toddler literally anything they can get their hands on whether it be a shiny pendant or a pinecone. And the Toddler... is really bad at filtering out these distractions. It keeps getting lured off the path by Howler Monkeys. Not only new paths you&#39;re trying to make, but even old paths you thought you knew. And sometimes, even when you have a great plan, the Toddler gets so distracted by all the fuss and mess the Monkeys are making that it completely forgets the plan or drops it and doesn&#39;t notice. Then your Toddler is lost in the Jungle, chasing distractions while the Wise Planner tries (and often fails) to get them back on track or to go back and pick up the plan.<br><br>It&#39;s still possible to get through it all, of course. But it&#39;s much much harder and unfortunately takes up a lot more energy than people who don&#39;t have to deal with ADHD (or anything that causes Executive Dysfunction).", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T20:30:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mon Puque", "comment_text": "Yup the first thing I told myself to improve my body was to build habits (I couldn&#39;t even do 1 damn pushup as a dude haha).

Here is the story how I overcame it. <br><br>Just a disclaimer this isn&#39;t a self help post or a sigma male grindset cringe fest, I don&#39;t actually know why I changed so rapidly so I&#39;m partly telling the story so maybe someone who reads it might have some answers. <br><br>So from the start I always had a terrible habit of walking to my local shop and spending at least \u00a310 or what would be around $15 I guess, every day without fail sometimes I would go twice if I was off work. The walk to the shop and back took me about half hour and was financially wreaking me, but it had become a daily ritual at this point. The things I were buying wasnt groceries to make good meals with either it was like chocolate, energy drinks, pizza etc. I tried many of times to just not go and sometimes I&#39;d managed a few days or so at a time but never for a long period. <br><br>On top of this I also impulse spent money I didn&#39;t have, the best example is when I was at college my laptop screen broke and I needed to do an assignment, today me would have just got the screen fixed and used the library computers to get the assignment done, what I did instead was pay \u00a370 to get the screen fixed and &#39;just in case it wasn&#39;t fixed in time&#39; I went and brought a \u00a3150 laptop to do one assignment on. I got the broken laptop back in time to complete the assignment in the end so a complete waste of money and this is just one of thousands of examples. <br><br>I also &#39;job hopped&#39; like mad, never staying at a job for more than 6 months and by the time I was 20 I had done like 13 different jobs (not an exaggeration it&#39;s probably more than that) at the time I put it down to just &#39;finding out what I wanted to do&#39; but I always felt in a rut, at a dead end or without any real direction in life. All the while I had these bad habits i was buying all the self help books on habit formation and personal finance some good books but not what I should have been spending money on at the time, and watching all the self help youtube videos I could. Nothing would stick.<br><br>I also went self employed fairly successfully but at the worst time possible, had about 1 year and 4 months before covid hit and I closed up shop. <br><br>Around this time I started working outdoors which I found out it&#39;s an absolute passion for me and I still work outdoors to this day but kind of seemed random, in all my job hopping I decided to give an outdoor one a go and happened to love it . <br><br>So my life was no car or liscence I just rode around on a 125cc moped even in winter (would not recommend, I slid on ice at 50mph) , no money month to month, In debt, bad habits making everything that much worse and feeling like I had no direction in life and nothing I read seemed to help. <br><br>Then I would say I &#39;stopped trying&#39; but I didn&#39;t just give up entirely. Now I had some idea of what I liked doing as a job I stayed working at that outside job I only changed jobs one more because a company offered me the same job with more pay and hours even through winter which is unheard of in the outdoor industry so the only job hop that didn&#39;t feel like I was running from somthing, (I&#39;m still at this job now). <br><br>It feels like what I stopped trying to do was solve everything at once and trying to focus on everything that was wrong, when I settled in I tried a few more times to stop going to the shop every day but again they failed. That is until without even trying I just slowly went less and less ( I wasn&#39;t self aware of this behaviour at the time) until I stopped going entirely and only went to a big Tesco that&#39;s the UKs Walmart I guess haha without the guns ofc, I then also started saving saving very aggressively or well paying of debt which is kind of like saving but starting in the negative, so aggressive that I would pay back a certain amount and somehow work out how I was going to survive the rest of the month but one way or another I did. <br><br>This brings me to today, once I started to feel the stress lifting of getting myself out of debt I did it intentionally and that just helped even more then my dad mentioned how he&#39;s glad I don&#39;t waste money on the shop anymore (this actually took me aback for a second because I didn&#39;t even notice I&#39;d managed to cut really strong bad habit out) I am now fully out of debt have my own car that I fully own (not financed) and a job that I enjoy. <br><br>What is perplexing me about this is that only very recently upon reflection I had seemingly managed to flip my life around and cut out bad habits without even trying (until very close towards the end) when I had tried countless of times before consciously without it ever working even when I wanted to improve really badly. Today im even more in the extreme not only do I not buy bad foods from the shop I don&#39;t buy them at all I can&#39;t remember what chocolate tastes like and I don&#39;t drink any caffeine. <br><br>Furthermore there wasn&#39;t some traumatic or inspiring or whatever whoowhooo moment that would explain this and as someone who&#39;s interested in human psychology (not to any professional extent just as a personal interest) I find this goes against everything I&#39;ve read about habit formation and psychology in general - at least (and this is important) to my knowledge and understanding of psychology, again not a professional at all. <br><br>Would anyone be able to contribute any ideas as to why this happened or know anyone who might? <br><br>Thank you for reading.", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T18:55:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mega mushroom", "comment_text": "As somebody that cant relate too this at all i just dont get it...", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T18:55:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Emmi Palli", "comment_text": "En taida", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T18:54:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The gameplay Memer", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt: change your habits and routines.<br>Me: *stops watching kurzgesagt", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T18:54:28Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Caetano Verde Selva", "comment_text": "Can you send a molecule video", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T18:54:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Commercio", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk&amp;t=10m47s\">10:47</a> Gratitude journaling!

For one thing, how do you maintain or continue building routines and habits if your context changes frequently (ex. people who move or travel often for work or school, or whose schedules have a lot of inconsistency)? Another thing that I thought about was from a TED talk by Tim Urban about procrastination. He talked about a mind character called the &quot;Instant Gratification Monkey&quot; who is somewhat similar to the Impulsive Toddler you mentioned in this video. Like the toddler, the monkey is impulsive and likes things that are easy. However, I think the monkey goes a step further because Urban said it takes over the &quot;steering wheel&quot; of the brain from the &quot;Rational Decision-Maker&quot; that normally controls things. The monkey tells us not to do productive things. So, I think it would work against the Wise Planner and the Impulsive Toddler by disrupting routines/habits and plans for hard things we don&#39;t usually do. Urban said the procrastinator&#39;s salvation is the &quot;Panic Monster&quot; who scares the Monkey away and lets the Rational Decision-Maker regain control. However, the Panic Monster keeps it tense enough that it finds a way to get things done in a timeframe that is not rational. The procrastinator&#39;s need for the Panic Monster creates a problem when there&#39;s no deadline to trigger its appearance. So, procrastinators who try to do things or start doing things without deadlines (ideally set by other people) struggle to do the things they want or need to do (ex. starting a business, writing a book/play, getting healthy). As a procrastinator, I can say this is certainly true for me. The Monkey reigns in my brain a little too often and if I don&#39;t have deadlines, it is very hard to have the Rational Decision-Maker/Wise Planner take the steering wheel back to figure out how to get things done, much less actually do them. Sorry, this comment kind of turned into a rant, but I am trying to understand how I can get my brain to follow the advice in your video.", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T18:25:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keith Mossey", "comment_text": "This whole channel is just so productive love it.", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T18:24:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Lopez Serret", "comment_text": "It is URGENT that you guys translate this to all languages!

Feel free to read it if you like \ud83d\udc4d<br><br><br>So around 4 months ago, I decided to break my lazy ass habits and wanted to start working out and studying Japanese. I am quite skinny and have a bad eating schedule, so I wanted to have a small step of change first, rather than a big leap, so my body will start to &quot;get used to it slowly&quot;. So I first set up a very small exercise routine consisting of 10 pushups a day and 1 minute plank everyday. Thats it. As time goes by, I add a few extra twists on it to make it more interesting and challenging, and also more productive as my body started to just do it. So far, of course there are some days that I skipped them, due to work or if I dont feel well. But so far it is doing great.<br><br>As for studying Japanese, its not quite successful yet, but lately I have been getting traction (albeit a bit), by changing my phone&#39;s langauge settings to Japanese, and just playing those &quot;funny anime clips compilations&quot; on youtube on the background while I work. It seems to have a positive outcome from it. <br><br>Thanks for reading this far.

Laziness is also a myth. <br><br>What drives us to act is not this concept of willpower that some people would have more or less of. It is our desire - the more meaningful the action is for us, the more we are driven to act.<br><br>The #1 root reason for a student not to do their homework is because they don&#39;t see the point. The <b>real</b> point behind the task. It probably has nothing to do with their idea of the job they&#39;re aiming for. Or they have no idea what they&#39;re gonna do after and are just there to pretend being &quot;active&quot;, because society deems it unacceptable not to be. Worse: the job they&#39;re aiming for may not excite them, they may just aim to please others or fit into a mold imposed by society, at the expense of their own desire, and thus, their own well-being.<br><br>I live in France. Here, and in many other countries, the educational system is as dysfunctional as you can imagine. Every student is bored in class, it&#39;s a gigantic waste of time given how little anyone learns there. But some work harder than others. Some are deemed &quot;lazy&quot; and some deemed &quot;assiduous&quot;. Why is that?<br><br>The theory I adhere to is that the &quot;lazy&quot; students see absolutely no point to the masquerade that school is - for good reason - and are thus incapable of summoning any energy to the task of studying. There is no meaning, and the meaning proposed by the institution is not enough for those students (such as: &quot;this is the order of the world since long before you were born, everyone has to do this, you need good grades to get into a good college to get a good job and have a good salary&quot;). They need something that&#39;s real to them, resonates deep within and this isn&#39;t it - they see the cracks.<br><br>The &quot;assiduous&quot; ones, although as bored as any other student, derive pleasure and meaning from fitting into the mold and being where they should be. They accept the meaning proposed by the institution, and thus are able to believe in the importance of the task, at least enough to do acceptably well (though nowhere near what they <b>could</b> do, if they were intensely passionnate about what they were doing). Not to say either is wrong or right, it&#39;s just two different approaches to life, meaning, authority, society.<br><br>That to me, and many other things (the observation that anyone who&#39;s really efficient at what they&#39;re doing is also passionnate about it) tells me that action (and thus, change) comes from desire, and that willpower is a myth. How this relates to the problematic of how to change, however... that&#39;s complex, but I&#39;d start at analyzing your desire to change (with the help of a professional, if possible). Where does that desire come from and is it really yours? Does it have real meaning, does it resonate? If not, how come you took it as your own, and how can you change it to better fit yourself? What else inhibits the desire, should it be genuinely yours? What fears and bad cognitive habits prevent you from achieving it?<br><br>The key is to understand how you function. Not that it&#39;s easy, but for me at least, change doesn&#39;t come without first completely understanding everything surrounding the issue. And then once you have understood, it is one tiny step at a time indeed, but it is <b>so much</b> easier. The next key is to set realistic expectations for yourself. Nobody changes overnight, it&#39;s all gradual.<br><br>I see all these tricks to change. Dividing actions, planning, trying to trick your brain so that you can build habits. It 100% works, for sure, but sometimes it doesn&#39;t, or some other times, you don&#39;t even want to get started doing it, or you get discouraged quickly. In those cases, what you need is to analyze your desire. In my own personal experience, tricks don&#39;t work. Really <b>badly</b> wanting to change for the right reasons, and curing negative feelings (culpability, shame...) by gaining an understanding of myself and my relation to others - <b>that</b> works, and then I intuitively make my own tricks, because there is a change in my mindset and it just works itself out, gradually.", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T17:50:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Funchal99", "comment_text": "Like Bojack Horseman said: &quot;it gets easier.

The decision to either act, or to let the moment pass, until the veil seals itself again and we once more are the slaves of our habits.<br><br>I don&#39;t believe in revolutions. They are too simple, too fiery, and they too often end with the opposite result of what was intended. But neither am I a cynic who has lost all of his faith in the world.

For example, learning German as a foreign language is not directly connected to exercising though one can argue that exercising will increase brain power which will help learning German. When such is the case, it is better to aim for only one &#39;habit set&#39; at a time. Once a new habit is set into your life, only then move onto your next one. And if you can&#39;t cultivate any habit at all, you should start with cleaning up your room, or your space in your living place in case you don&#39;t have a room.", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T17:15:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tomohawk Messy", "comment_text": "This is basically the concept behind a book called the chimp paradox.

Let me explain. I am 15 going on to 16, since the year started, the fact that I need to plan my future has been looming over my head. I know exactly what I need to do to change, but not how. I want to use my phone and the Internet like a resource rather than let it be a distraction. In that goal I first started with deleting my instagram account. I joined in 2019 and had many fond memories and chats. One of my friends became my friend over insta dms in 2020 and now I consider her to be like a younger sister. So it was really hard to quit insta and every time I opened the app, whatever resolve I had mustered crumbled immediately. So one day, with my resolve strong I quickly went ahead and did it. I just did not give my mind time to overthink, did not consider what I was sacrificing, I just did it while I had the strength to do so. Afterwards I began overthinking and it was terrible. I had the option to undo it before a deadline of a month and I considered it several times, but I told myself it was done and now it has been 4 months since I quit it. Something similar is the case for games on my phone and very recently(today) my account on two websites where I had very good friends. I am still considering whether I could have tried to make sure there is some way for us to keep in contact before I did so, but what is done is done. I am not sure if anyone will benefit from this, but on the off chance someone does, I am sharing it.", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T16:00:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kosymo", "comment_text": "Reddit isn&#39;t gonna be so happy about this video...", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T16:00:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "robauti", "comment_text": "im i the only one crying?", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T16:00:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Nelson", "comment_text": "Food for the algorithm", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T16:00:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leander De Craene", "comment_text": "Kurtgesagt once again dropping a banger of a video inspiring lots of people.", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T16:00:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ye eee", "comment_text": "My inner toddler killed my inner planner in the womb", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T15:59:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Corruptedgammingandstuff", "comment_text": "Props to the camera man", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T15:59:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harshit Khandelwal", "comment_text": "So this is it?

Stop having sugar wherever you are.<br>It&#39;s a cost benefit analysis: Going to the store and buying sugar takes 1) effort 2) money. In order to stop eating sugar you shouldn&#39;t stop trying to tell yourself not to eat the sweets at your home, but to <b>*not have*</b> any. Don&#39;t enter shops where you can buy them, and if you do - don&#39;t have excess cash on hand to buy them. That way when you&#39;re at home and you have a craving, the cost of going to the store and buying sweets will be too high for your brain. And you won&#39;t do it. Over time you will need it less.<br><br>Granted, this hasn&#39;t worked much for me with sugar (I still desire it, though I do eat it far less often so it has technically worked), but it has worked for work mentality. I don&#39;t have a Twitter, reddit, instagram, facebook (aside from work-related accounts); I don&#39;t have any new games, and the old ones net me far less positive value than they used to, so even if I do relapse into gaming it&#39;s only for a day or two on a weekend, cuz it&#39;s back to a game I&#39;ve played for hundreds of hours, so it can&#39;t hold me for long. I open Netflix very rarely, I don&#39;t go out.<br><br>This limited environment leaves me few options of stuff to do in my life and the cost of working becomes less, relatively speaking, to other actions. So I&#39;ve been doing it more often. To the point where now when I don&#39;t work I feel bad. Yes, workaholism has a heavy price tag.. but it was my goal and I&#39;m kind of happy to have partially achieved it.<br><br>It&#39;s about being able to focus on a singular thing and doing it. If you can&#39;t focus at all (like me), then sheer force of will to establish routines won&#39;t work alone. You need to also remove options that have far too great values.<br>10 Squats a day = +0.1 val<br>Eating a chocolate = +2.5 val<br>Playing a video game = +10 val<br>You can&#39;t ever start the squats if it&#39;s competing against such behemoths of value. Instead, you must slay them so it compares to:<br>10 Squats = +0.1 val<br>Looking at your bare wall = +0.2 val, but tapering to -0.2 quickly<br><br>Also... a darker factor I&#39;ve found to help me is survival. Necessity in terms of economic or emotional fears. You must increase the negative value of your current surrounding, mentally, so that you want to escape from it. <br>I&#39;m not sure how you do that though, I did it through political and economic realization and analysis, so as a byproduct so to speak. I hate employers and don&#39;t want to be employed which leaves me only the option of working on and for myself to free myself, economically speaking. So I am obligated to get better at my work or I&#39;ll starve / go be employed. Both of which I deem unacceptable and fear greatly (edit: maybe fear isn&#39;t the right word. The second one angers me. Fear could cause you to succumb to depression. Anger, if managed carefully can be a useful starter pack). So, survival is a hell of a driver. <br>I&#39;m not sure how you can fit that into your situation, but it might be useful info if you see some correlations.", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T15:21:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ismail bad boy", "comment_text": "good to be her", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T15:21:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke Dias", "comment_text": "Why do I feel afraid to watch this video?

Bourdieu defines habitus as: \u201ca subjective but not individual system of internalised structures, schemes of perception, conception, and action common to all members of the same group or class.\u201d What does he mean by &quot;common to the same group?&quot; Marx (and phenemology) covers a lot of this. For Marx, our habits turn into structures that control us (alienation); such habits, as phenomenologists point out is based in &quot;practical consciousness&quot; i.e. it&#39;s unthinking. We don;t have to reason our actions. HOWEVER, what&#39;s missing is the fact that our habits and preferences are governed by our social structures and by our archetypes (our culture). For example, I may want to exercise, but I live in a community that has been designed - because of economic contraint - around the car. I work long hours and use carbs to get through the day. I&#39;m therefore constrained by my ability to exercise, and my life generally may be constrained by time and responsibilities. This is what Marx means when he suggests structures control us, against our own wishes and desires. This is why we&#39;re alienated. This is always left out of the voluntarism of the US (the ideology that I can force through to change along &quot;a journey&quot;). Change is possible, but it means getting political - not focusing inward. Dealing with the external structures that impact upon your life. These may be job related, or civic or commercially related. By pressing for external change, you overcome the frustration of changing your own life. A habit journal is as useful as a mindfulness book, and a bunch of crayons.

One must recognize and accept the truth, trust one\u2019s deeper inclinations and in many cases give up a preferred advantage, relationship or situation. One must face the unknown and entertain new possibilities. This all requires courage. Yet, when change is required on a greater scale\u2014indeed when humanity itself is changing and you are in the center of this\u2014an even greater courage is required. It is built upon trust, recognition, preparation and compassion.<br>(...)<br>Perhaps you do not think of yourself as a courageous person, thinking that courage is something that some are endowed with and not others. But in truth, courage is something that everyone must forge and develop in his or her own experience. This happens through making difficult decisions. This also happens through making important mistakes, learning through these mistakes and taking the necessary steps to set things right.<br><br>This is what generates courage. Courage is the result here, though it can be the cause and the motivation for later action. In other words, you must generate courage. It is not something that is bestowed on some and not on others as people enter life. It is something that must be forged. Difficulty, adversity, changing circumstances, changing relationships and changing priorities all create the great opportunity for real courage to be cultivated and applied.&quot;<br><br><br>A quote from <b>Wisdom from the Greater Community, Book 2</b> \u00bb Chapter 19: Courage.
