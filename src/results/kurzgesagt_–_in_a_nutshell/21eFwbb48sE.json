Initial concepts of\u00a0wide area networking\u00a0originated in several computer science laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, and France.[1]\u00a0The U.S. Department of Defense awarded contracts as early as the 1960s, including for the development of the\u00a0ARPANET\u00a0project, directed by\u00a0Robert Taylor\u00a0and managed by\u00a0Lawrence Roberts. The first message was sent over the ARPANET in 1969 from computer science Professor\u00a0Leonard Kleinrock&#39;s laboratory at\u00a0University of California, Los Angeles\u00a0(UCLA) to the second network node at\u00a0Stanford Research Institute(SRI).<br><br>Packet switching\u00a0networks such as the\u00a0NPL network, ARPANET,\u00a0Merit Network,\u00a0CYCLADES, and\u00a0Telenet, were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of\u00a0communications protocols.[2]\u00a0Donald Davies\u00a0first demonstrated packet switching in 1967 at the\u00a0National Physics Laboratory(NPL) in the UK, which became a testbed for UK research for almost two decades.[3][4]\u00a0The ARPANET project led to the development of protocols for\u00a0internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks.<br><br>The\u00a0Internet protocol suite\u00a0(TCP/IP) was developed by\u00a0Robert E. Kahn\u00a0and\u00a0Vint Cerf\u00a0in the 1970s and became the standard networking protocol on the ARPANET, incorporating concepts from the French CYCLADES project directed by\u00a0Louis Pouzin. In the early 1980s the NSF funded the establishment for national supercomputing centers at several universities, and provided interconnectivity in 1986 with the\u00a0NSFNETproject, which also created network access to the\u00a0supercomputer\u00a0sites in the United States from research and education organizations. Commercial\u00a0Internet service providers\u00a0(ISPs) began to emerge in the very late 1980s. The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990. Limited private connections to parts of the Internet by officially commercial entities emerged in several American cities by late 1989 and 1990,[5]\u00a0and the NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic.<br><br>In the 1980s, research at CERN in Switzerland by British computer scientist\u00a0Tim Berners-Leeresulted in the\u00a0World Wide Web, linking hypertext documents into an information system, accessible from any node on the network.[6]\u00a0Since the mid-1990s, the Internet has had a revolutionary impact on culture, commerce, and technology, including the rise of near-instant communication by\u00a0electronic mail,\u00a0instant messaging,\u00a0voice over Internet Protocol\u00a0(VoIP) telephone calls,\u00a0two-way interactive video calls, and the\u00a0World Wide Web\u00a0with its\u00a0discussion forums,\u00a0blogs,\u00a0social networking, and\u00a0online shopping\u00a0sites. The research and education community continues to develop and use advanced networks such as\u00a0JANET\u00a0in the United Kingdom and\u00a0Internet2\u00a0in the United States. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1 Gbit/s, 10 Gbit/s, or more. The Internet&#39;s takeover of the global communication landscape was almost instant in historical terms: it only communicated 1% of the information flowing through two-way\u00a0telecommunications\u00a0networks in the year 1993, already 51% by 2000, and more than 97% of the telecommunicated information by 2007.[7]\u00a0Today the Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information, commerce, entertainment, and\u00a0social networking. However, the future of the global internet may be shaped by regional differences in the world.[8]", "comment_date": "2019-05-07T20:48:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Torres", "comment_text": "Awesome video!

(ex. 20 miles)  Instead of making the call directly, you could call a computer not long distance, half way to the destination (10 miles away),  and have it call into the long distance location for free (because it was local to that computer). Messaging systems, like arpanet, would utilitze this way of free calling through computer bulletin boards, and the hardware just became dedicated over time and through commercialization. With computers placed not too far apart, you could basically call anywhere for free... Wahlah! The internet... Basically came about to avoid the high price of long distance telephone calls... Larger companies would pay a lump sum to the phone company to have unlimited telephone access into another area where they might have another site  or headquarters and found it cheaper to relay messages by them being more compact than a voice transmission. This, along with consumer interests, invented the internet, but there&#39;s no real inventor, it naturally progressed to that stage by it evolving... Sure some companies invested more than others, but they didn&#39;t &#39;invent&#39; anything, it all came about to avoid long distance telephone fees... It then became commercialized, to many people&#39;s dismay, and now you pay for internet access through a &#39;provider&#39;... Which, used to be free just by placing a local telephone call... It was much slower (based off modem speeds), but was entirely free at that time...<br>I remember buying my first modem. It was 300 baud, and cost over $550.00.

Later in 1981 I was at Roscommon county college in Michigan and wanted to check classes in port huron MI for a comparrison so I asked the desk attendant and someone in the parking lot why they couldent do that and the internet was\u00a0 born\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-09-25T20:14:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Moore", "comment_text": "Ok<br>", "comment_date": "2014-09-25T18:11:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hugo -", "comment_text": "French again.", "comment_date": "2014-09-23T20:00:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clash", "comment_text": "The American government invented the internet, and a British guy &quot;invented&quot; the World Wide Web.

You can use the internet without the web, you cannot use the web without the internet. The internet is very clearly the more important invention.

This agency researched and developed technologies (Hardware, software, network topologies, data encryption, data formats such as data framing, etc.) inevitably leading to what was then known as DARPAnet. Yes, one of it&#39;s main purposes was to allow any data communications to be preserved and received by to its intended receiver in case any part of the data communication networks were attacked (including nuclear) during transmission. This was performed by packet switching and multiple broadcasting of the data packets (frames). Basically, break up the message, send it out to multiple computers (aka &quot;servers&quot;), and then reassemble the messages at the receiving end (drop any duplicate packets if already received.) As a high end scenario; A message is sent via 5 separate network lines via multiple channels (or servers if referring to the computers) (ex. &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, and &quot;E&quot;).Message sent to those 5 locations, servers A and C and D are blown up. Since B and E survived the attack. The message can be then rebuilt at the intended receiver. Mission accomplished. ARPA and DARPA inevitably were split into 2 separate US Gov&#39;t agencies, but were merged back together (and several name changes of the agency between ARPA and DARPA beginning with Bill Clinton). So, in essence, although preservation of data networks under ?nuclear attack&quot; was not a SOLE purpose of the then (D)ARPAnet, it was one of the MOTIVATIONS in which pushed DARPA&#39;s work in developing the network. The term &quot;internet&quot; was derived from (as mentioned in the video) Colleges and Universities to be able to share their info through the networks - but at that time it was a &quot;private&quot; network. It was not until the late 1980&#39;s when the network (internet) was opened up to public/commercial enterprises (hence the internet as we now know it today). Although the USA may not have been the sole &quot;inventor&quot; of the internet (and infrastructure), it certainly had very strong influence on how it developed.\u00a0<br>Good high level video, though.", "comment_date": "2014-04-13T04:48:44Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "S\u00f8ren Markov", "comment_text": "I love this channel!", "comment_date": "2014-04-13T03:23:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KrooN", "comment_text": "Porn :D", "comment_date": "2014-04-13T02:43:44Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Hassan Awal", "comment_text": "dope\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-04-13T02:30:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Cruz", "comment_text": "nicy...", "comment_date": "2014-04-13T01:27:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Martin", "comment_text": "Great video.", "comment_date": "2014-04-13T01:08:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cameron Burgess", "comment_text": " Extraordinary!", "comment_date": "2014-04-13T00:59:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Vollvik", "comment_text": "for.the.good.of.humanity", "comment_date": "2014-04-13T00:57:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Viktor Veljanovski", "comment_text": "The Internet is the thing that drivers humanity forward and it has not reached its potential yet.
