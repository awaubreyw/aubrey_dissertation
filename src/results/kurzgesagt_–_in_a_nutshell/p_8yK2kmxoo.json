All matter and particles in the universe seek to reach a state of Stability, or basically, the lowest form that they can take. That&#39;s why Atoms eventually &quot;Decay&quot; into smaller atoms, the &quot;Half-Life&quot; of an atom is this process, the process in which the Atom will decay into a more stable form or into it&#39;s subatomic pieces. If Strange Matter existed and it was the Lowest and Most Stable state of Matter possible, it&#39;s entirely plausible that other materials that make contact with it will spontaneous release extreme amounts of energy(since you can&#39;t just have crap ton of atoms break apart into quarks without some sort of consequence) and then also become Strange Matter. <br><br>Energy State&#39;s and the Need for the universe to be Stable and at it&#39;s Lowest Energy State has other implications. Like, in certain theories of Quantum Physics where the Higgs Field(Yes entire Fields such as the Gluon Field that allows Quarks to exist, seek to be at their lowest energy state as well.) is not at it&#39;s Lowest Energy State. What this would mean is that if at any point through Quantum Tunneling or some sort of incredible event that makes lots of Energy, the Higgs Field would jump down an energy state and as a result if a Fundamental Field of Nature jumps down an Energy State, the entire universe has to change with it. So, a sphere of all consuming destruction would expand out through space at the Speed of Light in an attempt to change everything to the same energy state as that one region of space. We wouldn&#39;t be able to see it coming. We would have no idea that this happened.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

And this is my saying or phrase of my inspiration, and it goes like this: Since the Internet became known for the domain or public use between the sky, the earth and the bottom of the ocean there is nothing hidden nor the aliens.

And finished the 2nd. World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth.", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T20:24:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Datubo Harry", "comment_text": "Make a video explaining the type of quarks", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T18:18:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Loveable Kat", "comment_text": "We  want  to  get  ride  of strange mater", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T13:18:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leigh Taylor", "comment_text": "So, I was also the most dangerous things in the known universe once?", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T08:18:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lefael", "comment_text": "Este video me da ansiedad", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T03:05:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Leonard Walletzk\u00fd", "comment_text": "Oversimplified: My history teacher<br>Kurzgesagt:My physics and chemistry teacher<br>Jazza: My art teacher<br>Ann Reardon: My cooking teacher", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T19:35:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xxxgoblinslayer69", "comment_text": "My friend is denser than a neutron star", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T16:41:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "magnvss", "comment_text": "Missed that episode of Stargate.

I think in our DNA lies the material to creating all life, as seen from our ability to reproduce, and with that DNA we can better understand how life can exist in different environments. But, one does wonder if this is all just a simulation. One cosmic joke after the other. I think in order to understand, we must learn, and in order to learn we need knowledge. To hold knowledge above all else means we would shed ourselves of mortality. Ideology is not science, it is a shared belief or one&#39;s own belief.

We discuss both theoretical and experimental reasons why each of these appears unlikely; in particular, we know of no plausible suggestion for why the third or especially the fourth might be true.

While it may exist in the cores of neutron stars, it has been shown that they aren&#39;t stable under more regular pressures such as the LHC where strange particles have briefly been created before decaying into other quarks and, of course, outer space.

From Murray Gell-Mann &quot;The Quark and the Jaguar&quot;: &quot;In 1963, when I assigned the name &quot;quark&quot; to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been &quot;kwork&quot;. Then, in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce, I came across the word &quot;quark&quot; in the phrase &quot;Three quarks for Muster Mark&quot;. Since &quot;quark&quot; (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with &quot;Mark&quot;, as well as &quot;bark&quot; and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as &quot;kwork&quot;. But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the &quot;portmanteau&quot; words in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar.

It wont and never will. if anything the moment its not under that much pressure from the neutron star it will explode converting into light and L matter. and even if it was stable, if it were to contact L matter, it would pass straight threw it due to the quarks not being bound together and producing a proper magnetic field(you know, the electric repulsion that stops to atoms from being in the same place.

Have no idea what I\u2019m talking about but hear me out <br><br>The universe is like numbers there is no start to numbers because you can\u2019t think of the smallest number because it goes on forever if you think  about it there is the same amount of numbers between 1 and 2 then there is between 1 and a trillion there was no start to the universe but there is no start or ending of anything in the universe it is just something our minds help us comprehend things like stars and planets are not entities within themselves but are made by the pre determined timeline to the universe. Like how 1 goes to 2 something has to happen causing this to happen just like how every number has to go the next number but it is an infinite sequence there is no beginning to numbers or end it just happens so everything doesn\u2019t just happen because it\u2019s not predetermined it is predetermined like how 1 goes to 2 and 3 goes to 4. So one thing happens in the universe at least one thing has to happen because of it could the smallest or biggest thing just like 1 just goes to 2 the universe flows the same way numbers are pre determined in a sense and the universe flows in the exact same way. But conscious beings in the universe have the ability to defy this pre determined timeline created by the universe. And us thinking everything is not pre determined is just sub consciously assumed. So the principle consciousness is based off of is in and of it self the definition of not being pre determined by universe. So consciousness is just basically stuff in the universe defying the ore determined timeline.

Its pretty much the one reason why the the distances of the Universe  are not increasing so much.

You say strangelets can cause the sun to become a strange star and earth would freeze to death. Before I can agree that this is possible, I&#39;ll have to ask you quite calmly to explain what happens to the energy released from the original 2 stars colliding? You claimed in this video it would spew out in all directions. If that is true, then the strangelets would inevitably bump into other particles of those two stars and convert the entire explosion into, dare I say it, a strange explosion. My argument is, if this stuff is contagious to matter, we&#39;d see its mass before it entered our solar system. Its mass would be huge, having consumed the majority of the original 2 stars which collided, along with space debris for millions of light years before it every came close to physically touching our sun. so, possible/notpossible? you tell me! i suspect strangelets are transformed under the conditions of the neutron star ONLY, which, after exploding, would no longer be applying its rules, and so these strangelets, as well as every other part of the cores of those stars, will transform again, likely no longer being strangelets. if the state of matter that is a strangelet is as ideal as you propose in this video, the entire universe would never have changed its matter to any other form yet we have countless forms of matter and so that suggests different geographical? areas inside the universe might have different &quot;ideal&quot; forms of matter. and so strangelet existing outside neutron star would then, what? evaporate due to hawking radiation? mutate/transform into a not-strangelet? whatever it used to be, perhaps? space dust or something? probably space dust. saying the only way to get rid of it would be to throw it into a black hole could not possibly be accurate because like i already said it&#39;s not already everywhere in the universe as this video suggests.", "comment_date": "2019-04-19T09:47:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NHT 41", "comment_text": "So..Tiberium ?", "comment_date": "2019-04-19T09:36:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric FlyingRaccoon", "comment_text": "Come on I was having a perfectly normal day and now I&#39;m scared to death.", "comment_date": "2019-04-19T09:36:20Z", "likes_count": 460}, {"comment_by": "shfma 5", "comment_text": "I need Arabic cc", "comment_date": "2019-04-19T09:32:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Betta Cup", "comment_text": "Can you make a video about \u201cwhat if The world  is corruption free\u201d, and what happen each country economy and peoples lovelihood.

Im thinking about that theory where you can reassemble a burnt piece of paper if you collect every single atom from it and what not. But if you take a burnt piece of paper, and separate the quarks and reassemble it into strange matter, wouldn&#39;t you be unable to ever turn something that turns other things into itself back into a piece of paper that does in fact not assimilate everything it touches? As I said, i dont fully understand, but this strikes me as something readers may want to look into as well. then again, we dont know how gravity works at such an intense scale, so perhaps the picture im missing is simply &quot;because gravity&quot; But even then, globs of neutron stars floating around randomly in space seems to conflict greatly with my way of thinking.", "comment_date": "2019-04-17T06:14:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mason Brewer", "comment_text": "Anyone else think of Kurt Vonnegut&#39;s &quot;Cat&#39;s Cradle&quot;?", "comment_date": "2019-04-17T06:05:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lma", "comment_text": "You know, i&#39;m kind of okay with becoming zombie star material.", "comment_date": "2019-04-17T06:03:22Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "StephAgosta", "comment_text": "Strange matter sounds like it&#39;d be perfect for a sci-fi weapon, with a little creative freedom to make it safe to contain under certain conditions.", "comment_date": "2019-04-17T06:02:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Loop Eater", "comment_text": "<b>what\u2019s inside left the chat</b>", "comment_date": "2019-04-17T05:35:40Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Camren Mugabe", "comment_text": "Interesting theory but unless proven then basically this becomes: Something Scientists made up.", "comment_date": "2019-04-17T05:31:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "local egoist", "comment_text": "No one", "comment_date": "2019-04-17T05:17:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke Grabo", "comment_text": "They always ask, &quot;What&#39;s the next video?&quot;<br>But not, &quot;How is the narrator?&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-04-17T05:14:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Madhava Jay", "comment_text": "Silly question, but why do the Quark Stars only contain Strange matter?

It may require only a magnetic field in space only experiment to prove if the Strange matter is actually dark matter in space.

How it will work is turning on one side of the most powerful magnetic charge on one side while the other side has less charge or turned off. It will have systems to measure the differences of central mass of the craft from electric charge right now vs overtime collecting matter through magnetic attraction. If we know the mass of electric charge now then over time if we wait for matter to be caught in the net of magnetic field we should be enable to catch this material depends on though how fast it could catch the substances over time or how long it&#39;ll take. Thus, we should then notice the central mass of the craft is increasing on one side of the spacecraft exponentially over time to be enable to calculate the mass of this stuff. However, this is only a hypothesis through research in chemistry from weak nuclear force and electric forces. Another issue is trying to get far away from other magnetic fields such as Earth will interfere it also, It may require very strong electric force to detect it.

Vacuum decay where a single energetic particle causes a light-speed expanding bubble of a universe with new rules along with the corresponding heat shield from all the free energy from transitioning to a lower energy state. And Strange matter which could convert anything it touches into itself, which is arguably even worse as it doesn\u2019t sound like it spews out more of itself so while it won\u2019t destroy the Universe through a chain reaction, it can be used by aliens to destroy any planet they so desire.

Vacuum decay, strangelets, and colliding with other universes are typically reductive conversations when trying to increase public interest except with those who enjoy conspiracy theories.", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T16:22:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marwan", "comment_text": "The video was so well done that I wasn&#39;t actually hear what the narrator were saying XD", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T16:22:51Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Baluyot, Kerrson E.", "comment_text": "Maybe it&#39;s no going to spread and it was the dark matter", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T16:22:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Om", "comment_text": "What if big bang theory turns out to be wrong?", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T16:22:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Will The Almighty Gamer", "comment_text": "It&#39;s always a better day when you guys upload \ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T16:22:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jo\u00e3o de Carvalho", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt loves dead stars and similar things.", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T16:22:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lightweaver", "comment_text": "Welp, now I have something else to worry about, thanks.", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T16:22:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ribbreaker -", "comment_text": "Literally every zombie virus ever", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T16:22:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffrey H", "comment_text": "Im too young for brilliant", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T16:22:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Island Princess", "comment_text": "Existential crisis yay!

First is that while strange matter is thermodynamically stable, the kinetics of quantum processes cause it to decay by emission of mesons and pions. So any strangelets in the universe that are small will have decayed into cosmic radiation and normal matter. Second that the rate of strange matter conversion is proportional to ke^-Ea/RT where Ea is the activation energy of the baryonic transiton to the strange flavor assuming rate laws of kinetics still apply for this state, small specks of matter would take trillions of years to make a dent in massive objects the size of the earth or  the sun.

I\u2019d love some feedback because I think I might be confused here.<br><br>What you\u2019re saying is basically that there are different types of quarks and larks, but since they are so small we can\u2019t identify them all, although we know the up and down ones are there. Theoretically, couldn\u2019t strange matter be recreated in a small chamber with some matter and a whole bunch of energy thrown at it? I get it\u2019s inefficient, but the pressure the chamber would provide against the growing mass, and soon we would get strange matter. Secondly, you are saying that with the addition of energy, quarks and larks create more of themselves, which means energy is turned into matter, which isn\u2019t possible as far as I know?<br><br>Now in terms of chemistry, we know atoms with 8 valent electrons are stable. Typically, with much more electrons and protons we get the result of complex atoms like radioactive isotopes. Strange matter Is supposedly the most stable harnessing strange quarks? I\u2019m guessing that it\u2019s not as apocalyptic as it\u2019s being made out to be, since atoms act with less stable ones, like fluorine and hydrogen, to create stability. Stable atoms are pretty much docile. If strange matter acts like a neutron, it should just be a heavier neutron right? It would just mean that instead of a neutron, this would be a heavier substitute.  strange matter flying around makes sense because some atoms don\u2019t need 1 strange matter instead of their neutrons because it would take a lot of energy to do that. Where is it gonna become like A fire and infect everything?there aren\u2019t any properties that suggest that all atoms need it naturally. <br><br>Finally, if atoms did need it and it spread, all the matter in space or in other planets would be strange. The Big Bang happened so long ago. Why didn\u2019t strange matter intervene then? Why didn\u2019t it infect everything. If strangelets are flying around for all those years, isn\u2019t something bound to hit a large mass like a planet or an asteroid and we would be able to see it?", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T14:20:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex H", "comment_text": "Thanks for the existential crisis, Kurzgesagt", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T14:20:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diego Designs", "comment_text": "Why do you have to have a double when you can be strange and destroy everything \ud83c\udf1d", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T14:20:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vars", "comment_text": "Oh goody some more potentially world ending circumstances for us to be terrified about.

And spinning neutron stars eject matter at their poles in jets as pulsars or magnetars so if the entire star was made of strange matter then it seems like we would have been able to detect that in the spectrum of their jets.<br><br>Also a quick search came up with some recent analyses that indicate that strange matter in neutron stars probably isn\u2019t a thing, instead the core is probably simply stable pairs of up and down quarks. This would make sense in that the LHC and cosmic rays already provide the energies we think would be enough to create free floating quarks and strangelets but to date cosmic rays haven\u2019t destroyed the Earth by creating infectious strangelets. So it does seem like free floating strangelets probably either aren\u2019t a physical reality or aren\u2019t infectious. That being said though the idea that dark matter might be non-infectious strange matter from the early universe and neutron stars is kind of cool. \ud83d\ude42", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T13:07:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shree", "comment_text": "The\u00a0protomolecule in green.", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T13:07:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "US", "comment_text": "Stragelets eat the aliens", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T13:07:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cahos Rahne Veloza", "comment_text": "Strangelove<br>Strange highs and strange lows<br>Strangelove<br>That&#39;s how my love goes<br>Strangelove<br>Will you give it to me?<br><br>Will you take the pain<br>I will give to you?<br>Again and again<br>And will you return it?", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T13:07:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "failbait backup", "comment_text": "U guys r the best", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T13:07:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Kraken", "comment_text": "Very weird.
