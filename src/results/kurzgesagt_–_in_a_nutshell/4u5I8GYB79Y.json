Could it be because he owns pharmacological patents, so riling people up and making them fear for their lives every time a virus is mentioned in the media they go into frenzy? \r<br>\r<br>I don&#39;t know and I&#39;m not going to sit here and tell you that billionaires are out to get you (because its obvious they love selling blood for money and power) but it seems all too comfortable to me. This channel feels like Bill Gates&#39;s personal news tube - every video is like an advertisement spot for one of Bill Gates ventures and if you don&#39;t believe me look at Bill Gates&#39;s investment portfolio... carbon capture technologies, geoengineering, vaccine patents, a boat load of renewable energy and so on.... Kurzgesagt loves pushing this idea that we can technology our way out of any problem, but its exactly technology that got us into this climate crisis.... well technology and the unsustainable practices of our current economic system. \r<br>\r<br>I wont tell you that vaccines are bad or that I have all the answers needed for you to repair the damage. I&#39;m not an oracle and I don&#39;t know how to reliably tackle our problems, I can only speculate... but I know we as mere citizens cannot trust any billionaire to fix these issues for us. Look at the way Bill Gates ran Microsoft and treated his competition... this is the sort of person that you want in charge of your planet and renewable technologies? A ruthless merciless monopolistic corporate baron who&#39;s on a personal vendetta against Polio despite Polio being virtually eradicated a long time ago... he&#39;s squandering the very few pennies he spends as altruism on a disease that no longer exists either for a personal vendetta or profit - and this is exactly what happens when we let one person with more money than you or I could accumulate in 10,000 lifetimes and an ego to match is given enough power to be influencing our world. \r<br>\r<br>Our health and our bodies are not billionaires playgrounds (usually it holds true that the best person for our health is our closest general practitioner - that doctor can see us, examine us, usually is familiar with us and our bodies and they can tell you everything you need to know - they&#39;re also much less influenced by political agenda like the ministers of health might be, though they are not immune aka some doctors peddling the drugs the pharmacological corporations approach them to sell, when a doctor has a choice of making 50,000 dollars or 500,000 dollars a year there is no choice - so vote for politicians who pay healthcare workers a sufficiently high wage, or if you&#39;re American then vote for politicians who will bring you public healthcare so your doctors will be less influenced by corporate profit), we should be setting up community based institutions lead by people who specialize in medicine spearhead the effort - such as public healthcare and publicly funded medical universities... though its so easy for a billionaire to approach a university and buy out a patent researched with public money unfortunately... did you know that the Covid vaccine was supposed to be patent free? available to use for anyone to help people recover from a pandemic, but guess who approached the university who made the vaccine... that&#39;s right Bill and Melinda Gates foundation demanded for the vaccine to be secret and patented because say it with me: Billionaires don&#39;t care about your life, they care about increasing their influence over the world so they can eventually run it like a private venture - they want to bring back the era of monarchies... will you let them? or will you do what our peasant ancestors did with their monarchs? \r<br>\r<br>Lets just say if our ancestors didn&#39;t rise up against the elites and didn&#39;t do what they did we wouldn&#39;t be typing on social media in a warm cozy apartment right now, we would be toiling in Bill Gates&#39;s factories and mines like the children and enslaved adults from developing countries do currently to provide us with these luxuries or lithium, silver and platinum for renewable energy machinery. Every single crumb of wealth and prosperity people have now had to be wrangled out of the wealthy elites that hoarded it, otherwise we would receive nothing - so don&#39;t give up your rights easily and do your research before you buy into someone trying to sell you a billionaires mindset. We toil, they take... we struggle and they hoard - it has always been this way, so don&#39;t make it easy for them to control you and take it from you. \r<br>\r<br>Toil less and care for your mind and body (and try to stay away from people and places who say they have a solution to all your problems like self help gurus or political and religious leaders with morally dubious agendas - just try to use critical thinking if possible) and if you must toil cause you&#39;re a workaholic then do it for the community, not for a corporation - I guarantee you where a corporation will break you, consume you and fire you the moment your usefulness expires a community will provide you with a meal. I guarantee you when a corporation gentrifies your entire neighborhood and doubles the price of rent in the span of 8 months the community will make its stand. Why do you think billionaires despise workers unions? because they&#39;re too dangerous to their crusade of becoming kings and queens again. These communities can be anything - it can be your friends, it can be your neighbors (be mindful not to become a NIMBY and do damage to your own community for the sake of your own profit), it can be something tangible like feeding and housing the homeless if your country is not Scandinavian and doesn&#39;t care that homeless and elderly people die (but please don&#39;t attach an agenda when you feed the homeless - they&#39;re already struggling and its not like giving them food or shelter is doing them a favor, no human should go without their basic needs met - so forcing them to adjust to our mindset when they cant refuse would be predatory) other communities are local governments and federal governments though these are difficult and dangerous - they can quickly become technocratic and overran by corruption form the same people they were meant to protect us against - all I can say is to try and become a leader of your community if that&#39;s what you yearn for (I know I don&#39;t) but be mindful its a thankless job - and for the love of all that is right when someone approaches you with treasure and trinkets to pass legislation remember why you entered these communities in the first place - to represent them, people trusted you and you should try and provide them with what they need, not sell them out to the upper classes and become another megaphone or billboard for them like... well.", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T10:18:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dd9453", "comment_text": "What are the obstacles to make bait-like vaccines for bats, the same one they use in Switzerland for wild foxes to prevent rabies virus?", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T10:00:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KelvinandPrincess Sackey", "comment_text": "talk about nuclear pasta", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T09:50:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Astro27", "comment_text": "Did anyone else notice that kurzgesagt is covering their Immune book slowly but surely on some of their videos?", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T09:47:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neutron GD", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u5I8GYB79Y&amp;t=5m08s\">5:08</a> RIP IMMUNE SYSTEM", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T09:38:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Perialis", "comment_text": "uno reverse card XD<br><br>im sorry sir, you have terminal brain cancer. it will become a tumor that will be devastating to your motor skills and,<br>what makes you sir. im sorry for your loss.<br><br><br><b>its ok man ill just make some microscopic uno reverse cards</b>", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T08:54:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leander ten Hoedt", "comment_text": "This virus is so fucking smart its so scary.

There is a myth I read that someone named a new virus that has spread besides Covid-19. I don&#39;t really care about the news, it doesn&#39;t interest me. Until the time of the pandemic, there was a doctor who was a bit insane, I said that there was a patient who had a hard cough and other symptoms. Then the patient went to the hospital and the doctor took him to the operating room and tried to save the patient&#39;s life. Too bad, he died afterwards because he was forced to take drugs that push him to death. There are also times when a doctor who is well known to the public dares to state that this Covid is exaggerating, it makes the doctors heat up. He was then imprisoned. One more story when my late aunt was sick for years, since 2020, she has gotten worse, has been going back and forth to the hospital.  Finally the doctor gave a choice that she wanted to be self-isolated or not? After waiting for hours, my aunt was finally made to return home. She breathed heavily in the midday heat. She was afraid to go to the hospital because if she went there, without a doubt the medical team would say she has Covid-19. How impressed I am with you.

It&#39;s exceptionally common, but people just don&#39;t run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.\r<br>\r<br>Let me paint you a picture.\r<br>\r<br>You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the &quot;rage&quot; stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.\r<br>\r<br>Except you&#39;re asleep, and he&#39;s a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don&#39;t even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.\r<br>\r<br>Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won&#39;t even tell you if you&#39;ve got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you&#39;ve ever been vaccinated.)\r<br>\r<br>You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.\r<br>\r<br>The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.\r<br>\r<br>It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?\r<br>\r<br>At this point, you&#39;re already dead. There is no cure.\r<br>\r<br>(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).\r<br>\r<br>There&#39;s no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.\r<br>\r<br>Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you&#39;re symptomatic, it&#39;s over. You&#39;re dead.\r<br>\r<br>So what does that look like?\r<br>\r<br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.\r<br>\r<br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.\r<br>\r<br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.\r<br>\r<br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.\r<br>\r<br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.\r<br>\r<br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.\r<br>\r<br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.\r<br>\r<br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.\r<br>\r<br>Then you die. Always, you die.\r<br>\r<br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.\r<br>\r<br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.\r<br>\r<br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me.", "comment_date": "2022-08-03T01:42:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M i \u0391 v\u2113\u03c3g g\u03c3 \u0442\u03c3 \u043c\u0443 \u00a2ha\u03b7\u03b7\u0454\u2113!", "comment_text": "It has been suggested that the vampire myth originated from people infected with rabies.

The only place they give post-exposure rabies shots is at the ER. Sure enough, he had to make multiple appointments and it was incredibly painful. He had to get 3 shots just at the exposure site on his hand, probably another 2-3 in his abdomen. Not fun, very painful, and expensive. But, I&#39;m so very glad that the treatment was readily available to him. He very well could have died without that treatment.

Yes, it sounds good in the video but it&#39;s not true. It has an almost 100% guarantee of death if it&#39;s not caught in time, but especially today it&#39;s not nearly as large of an issue (India and parts of Africa excluded due to the lack of available treatment and preventive care) due to vaccines and antibodies. The deadliest virus would change depending on what metric you choose to select it. Actual deaths? Death rate? Across time or just in the modern day? Do we include only humans in our choice or are we including diseases that also infect other animals as well? Even then, HIV for example (kills almost a million people every year) has only ever had three people been cured. Rabies on the other hand kills about 59,000 (which they rounded up in the video, I&#39;m guessing because 60k just sounds better) a year and has a vaccine that can be administered even after infection.<br><br>So while it&#39;s nice to simplify things, it shouldn&#39;t be done in a way that could misinform people.

It&#39;s exceptionally common, but people just don&#39;t run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.\r<br>\r<br>Let me paint you a picture.\r<br>\r<br>You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the &quot;rage&quot; stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.\r<br>\r<br>Except you&#39;re asleep, and he&#39;s a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don&#39;t even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.\r<br>\r<br>Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won&#39;t even tell you if you&#39;ve got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you&#39;ve ever been vaccinated.)\r<br>\r<br>You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.\r<br>\r<br>The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.\r<br>\r<br>It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?\r<br>\r<br>At this point, you&#39;re already dead. There is no cure.\r<br>\r<br>(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).\r<br>\r<br>There&#39;s no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.\r<br>\r<br>Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you&#39;re symptomatic, it&#39;s over. You&#39;re dead.\r<br>\r<br>So what does that look like?\r<br>\r<br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.\r<br>\r<br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.\r<br>\r<br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.\r<br>\r<br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.\r<br>\r<br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.\r<br>\r<br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.\r<br>\r<br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.\r<br>\r<br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.\r<br>\r<br>Then you die. Always, you die.\r<br>\r<br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.\r<br>\r<br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.\r<br>\r<br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me.

I think the part that made me the most mad was that the patient was still capable of saying some final words seconds before her death. That would be impossible. With the hydrophobia, encephalitis, and probable paralysis, there would be little chance you would even still be lucid let alone able to speak.

So it prevents them from drinking water by physically strangulating them (the oesophagus/food pipe) at even the MERE SUGGESTION Of drinking water. Say some brave ones try to drink adamantly anyway, it FORCES the water out the moment it reaches the throat by forcibly activating our GAG Reflex (cranial-facial afferent-efferent pathways I think? Jus the feel before we vomit basicslly) and  further tightening the chokehold on the throat muscles ensuring nothing gets in.<br>Once symptoms start they become more aggressive too. If we humans weren&#39;t so civilized or intellectual I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we felt the urge to bite(as is the case with mammals) given the increased salivary output with no way to swallow and aggression and hunger and  thirst coupled with pain and paradoxically hydrophobia...<br><br>It&#39;s terrible.

He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God. Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!<br><br>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9<br><br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. Place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick, place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name.

Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief.

One of the 18 died five years later, anyway. 4 had moderate damage like partial paralysis. 3 had mild side effects likes weakness, poorer coordination, or involuntary movements. Only two made a complete recovery with no noticeable symptoms. Also, only 2 of the 29 people who recovered weren&#39;t vaccinated. Most of the 29 cases&#39; vaccination failed. Out of the two complete recovery cases, one (17 yr old from Turkey) received one dose of a rabies vaccine post-exposure (you should get 4 doses plus immunoglobulin). The other case (6 yr old from USA) received a dose of a vaccine just two days before symptoms showed up (18 days after the bite), which is definitely too late. It&#39;s said that after 3 days, it&#39;s too late to get vaccinated and this is 6 times that, so it&#39;s unclear how much the vaccine helped. Neither of these patients were treated with the Milwaukee Protocol or Recife protocol since the American kid&#39;s case happened in 1970 (Milwaukee Protocol was first used in 2003) and the other kid&#39;s case was in Turkey in 2008, only 5 years after the Milwaukee protocol&#39;s first use in a different country.

It&#39;s exceptionally common, but people just don&#39;t run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.<br><br>Let me paint you a picture.<br><br>You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the &quot;rage&quot; stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.<br><br>Except you&#39;re asleep, and he&#39;s a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don&#39;t even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.<br><br>Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won&#39;t even tell you if you&#39;ve got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you&#39;ve ever been vaccinated.)<br><br>You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.<br><br>The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.<br><br>It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?<br><br>At this point, you&#39;re already dead. There is no cure.<br><br>(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).<br><br>There&#39;s no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.<br><br>Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you&#39;re symptomatic, it&#39;s over. You&#39;re dead.<br><br>So what does that look like?<br><br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.<br><br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.<br><br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.<br><br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.<br><br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.<br><br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.<br><br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.<br><br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.<br><br>Then you die. Always, you die.<br><br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.<br><br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me.

It&#39;s exceptionally common, but people just don&#39;t run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.<br>Let me paint you a picture.<br>You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the &quot;rage&quot; stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.<br>Except you&#39;re asleep, and he&#39;s a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don&#39;t even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.<br>Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won&#39;t even tell you if you&#39;ve got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you&#39;ve ever been vaccinated.)<br>You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.<br>The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.<br>It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?<br>At this point, you&#39;re already dead. There is no cure.<br>(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).<br>There&#39;s no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.<br>Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you&#39;re symptomatic, it&#39;s over. You&#39;re dead.<br>So what does that look like?<br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.<br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.<br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.<br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.<br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.<br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.<br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.<br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.<br>Then you die. Always, you die.<br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.<br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.<br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me. And it&#39;s fucking EVERYWHERE. (Source: Spent a lot of time working with rabies. Would still get my vaccinations if I could afford them.)", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:10:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Retarded Operator", "comment_text": "Immune System: Hey so uh ur making viruses<br>Cell: oh no<br>Immune System: hey, so uh Kill yourself now.<br>Cell: FOR THE BODY!<br><b>dies</b>", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:10:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "john smith", "comment_text": "thats nothing compared to the democrat virus taking down a whole nation.", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:09:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hamfish", "comment_text": "Great video as always, loved the thumbnail", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:07:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Official Channel", "comment_text": "This is why i dont pick up cute lil wild Bunnies", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:06:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Steven Cooper", "comment_text": "Great another thing for the technocratic globalists to use as a giant scare tactic in order to further their degree of control on society", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:06:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vargero", "comment_text": "That&#39;s crazy, to see that this thing is still roaming the earth sure is thought provoking...", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:06:44Z", "likes_count": 279}, {"comment_by": "Matias Almada", "comment_text": "Why was this video on 1.25 speed", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:04:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xXMUS1CB0XXx", "comment_text": "The Dynein Motor looks like a Walker from star wars ngl", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:04:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tovarisch Maus", "comment_text": "Honey wake up, Kurzgesagt uploaded a new video", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:03:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matias Almada", "comment_text": "Y\u2019all should\u2019ve researched how to pronounce rabies maybe", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:02:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Golem1903", "comment_text": "I&#39;m barely a quarter into the video, but you&#39;re telling me we have tiny AT-STs in our brain cells?", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T07:01:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emil Serdarevic", "comment_text": "Tnx bro", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T06:59:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Hazardous", "comment_text": "Cell: is infected<br><br>Immune system: kys", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T06:59:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheManHimself", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u5I8GYB79Y&amp;t=2m26s\">2:26</a> so you&#39;re telling me I have tiny AT-STs in my body \ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T06:56:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OriginalPiMan", "comment_text": "It&#39;s interesting to look at the countries that don&#39;t have rabies or even don&#39;t have any of the Lyssa viruses.<br>Much of Europe has wiped out rabies, and so have many island nations, if they ever had it at all.

You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do.

It&#39;s exceptionally common, but people just don&#39;t run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.\r<br>\r<br>Let me paint you a picture.\r<br>\r<br>You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the &quot;rage&quot; stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.\r<br>\r<br>Except you&#39;re asleep, and he&#39;s a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don&#39;t even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.\r<br>\r<br>Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won&#39;t even tell you if you&#39;ve got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you&#39;ve ever been vaccinated.)\r<br>\r<br>You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.\r<br>\r<br>The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.\r<br>\r<br>It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?\r<br>\r<br>At this point, you&#39;re already dead. There is no cure.\r<br>\r<br>(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).\r<br>\r<br>There&#39;s no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.\r<br>\r<br>Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you&#39;re symptomatic, it&#39;s over. You&#39;re dead.\r<br>\r<br>So what does that look like?\r<br>\r<br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.\r<br>\r<br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.\r<br>\r<br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.\r<br>\r<br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.\r<br>\r<br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.\r<br>\r<br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.\r<br>\r<br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.\r<br>\r<br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.\r<br>\r<br>Then you die. Always, you die.\r<br>\r<br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.\r<br>\r<br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.\r<br>\r<br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me.

It&#39;s exceptionally common, but people just don&#39;t run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.<br><br>Let me paint you a picture.<br><br>You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the &quot;rage&quot; stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.<br><br>Except you&#39;re asleep, and he&#39;s a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don&#39;t even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.<br><br>Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won&#39;t even tell you if you&#39;ve got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you&#39;ve ever been vaccinated.)<br><br>You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.<br><br>The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.<br><br>It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?<br><br>At this point, you&#39;re already dead. There is no cure.<br><br>(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).<br><br>There&#39;s no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.<br><br>Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you&#39;re symptomatic, it&#39;s over. You&#39;re dead.<br><br>So what does that look like?<br><br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.<br><br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.<br><br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.<br><br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.<br><br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.<br><br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.<br><br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.<br><br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.<br><br>Then you die. Always, you die.<br><br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.<br><br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me.

Skunks especially, and bats.<br><br>Let me paint you a picture.<br><br>You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the &quot;rage&quot; stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.<br><br>Except you&#39;re asleep, and he&#39;s a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don&#39;t even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.<br><br>Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won&#39;t even tell you if you&#39;ve got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you&#39;ve ever been vaccinated.)<br><br>You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.<br><br>The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.<br><br>It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?<br><br>At this point, you&#39;re already dead. There is no cure.<br><br>(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).<br><br>There&#39;s no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.<br><br>Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you&#39;re symptomatic, it&#39;s over. You&#39;re dead.<br><br>So what does that look like?<br><br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.<br><br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.<br><br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.<br><br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.<br><br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.<br><br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.<br><br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.<br><br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.<br><br>Then you die. Always, you die.<br><br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.<br><br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me.

Rather, the number of<br>deities in Israel was relatively typical for the region. Furthermore, as they did in the religions of surrounding states, some old Canaanite deities continued within an Israelite pantheon dominated by a national god. Like some of the Phoenician city-states and perhaps Edom, earliest Israel knew El, Baal, a new dynastic or national god, the divine council, a partial divinization of deceased<br>ancestors (Rephaim), and perhaps the cult of a goddess. Similarly, during the period of the Judges, Yahweh held hegemony over a complex religion that preserved some old Canaanite components through an identification with El,<br>a continuation of the concepts of the divine council and partially divinized ancestors, a coexistence with Baal, and perhaps an early toleration for Asherah and subsequent assimilation of her cult and symbol, the asherah.<br>This state of affairs was not to hold for the period of the monarchy.&quot; -The Early History of God by Mark S.

My dog got vaccinated in the morning around 11 am, everything seemed fine until later in the afternoon I noticed my dog&#39;s mood was a bit down, I told myself maybe he&#39;s bored...then around 7 pm he alarmed everyone in the house when he started to cry and run around. He cried very loudly as if it had intense pain inside, my dad and I tried to calm it down but our efforts were in vain, the dog kept running and crying until suddenly it fell paralyzed. At this moment it was very clear that the vaccine was the cause of that behaviour. Shortly after my dog woke up and ran inside the bathroom. We locked the door to prevent him from running around all the house again and because we were worried he might bite someone. After some minutes I went to see how he was as he seemed to have calmed down (I had the hope that he would recover since &quot;the worst already happened&quot;). There he was lying on the floor and foaming in the mouth, I kneeled down to keep him company, I was dubious at first but he never showed &quot;rage&quot; during all this time. He definitely showed fear and pain though, but now he was without strength, probably unable to move. He died around 8 pm.<br>Can you imagine the guilt and anger I felt with myself (and the guys that vaccinated him)  after basically killing my own dog. Maybe he was too young or maybe the dose was too strong, maybe both, who knows. But yeah my dog had a bad experience with that vaccine. Thankfully he never turned against me or my family and showed fear instead of rage. If he had bitten me when I tried to hold him and calm him down maybe I would not be writing this now.<br>I have two dogs now but after what happened to my previous one I&#39;d rather just hope they never get infected with rabies in the first place than contemplating the possibility of reliving that experience.<br>Life sucks harder when you try to do some good and it ends up being bad.", "comment_date": "2022-07-26T20:19:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ista Sollution", "comment_text": "Wild", "comment_date": "2022-07-26T20:18:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jotax94", "comment_text": "every time i got sad thoughts, i remember all the effort my little cells are putting to keeping me alive and i keep going too<br><br>&lt;3", "comment_date": "2022-07-26T20:18:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just a random gamer boi", "comment_text": "literally right after i got scratched by a cat", "comment_date": "2022-07-26T20:17:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suport\u00edk", "comment_text": "This is absolutely terrifying, i am scared just over the fact that i have a brain in my head, amazing video.", "comment_date": "2022-07-26T20:17:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Triairius", "comment_text": "This video has made me aware that there is a LOT about microbiology that I haven&#39;t learned.

It&#39;s exceptionally common, but people just don&#39;t run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.<br><br>Let me paint you a picture.<br><br>You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the &quot;rage&quot; stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.<br><br>Except you&#39;re asleep, and he&#39;s a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don&#39;t even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.<br><br>Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won&#39;t even tell you if you&#39;ve got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you&#39;ve ever been vaccinated.)<br><br>You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.<br><br>The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.<br><br>It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?<br><br>At this point, you&#39;re already dead. There is no cure.<br><br>(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).<br><br>There&#39;s no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.<br><br>Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you&#39;re symptomatic, it&#39;s over. You&#39;re dead.<br><br>So what does that look like?<br><br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.<br><br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.<br><br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.<br><br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.<br><br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.<br><br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.<br><br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.<br><br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.<br><br>Then you die. Always, you die.<br><br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.<br><br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me.

Second and FAR more important is that you are not allowed to just go down to the Tractor Supply Company and get a vaccine for $10 and administer it yourself.  No you are required by law to have a vet office administer the vaccine.  They in tern require a physical.  This makes that $10 now $150 or more... EVERY YEAR.  I&#39;m sorry but giving shots to animals is VERY easy.  To give a pet all it baby vaccines and rabies will set you back around $300-500... for about $20 in vaccines.

And that starts with clean air, water, high sources of nutrition, organic, non-genetically modified would be best preferred opposed to just a traditional good clean high-protein diet. Even further away from fast food, soda, comfort food and drinks that have very little nutritional value if any at all. Also  if you want to take it up a notch from there you become formally educated and participate in a workout regiment that specializes in overall functionality. These basic steps will give one the strongest most advanced immune system metabolism their body can produce. Allowing their bodies to be able to adjust adapt respond recover to any and all situations in the most efficient way.  The best way to deal with any injury, illness, disease, or sickness that may have already occurred within the body. Its with that same commitment to oneself. For part of the reason why so many American are easily infected. It is because they are soft, lazy, out of shape, over fed, undernourished, overworked, and underpaid weaklings  that have dirty low paying jobs which come from outdated power sources, inferior materials poisonous, toxic substances, pesticides, and chemicals that never change their killing composition. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Which means whether it is a solid or liquid burnt off into our airways atmosphere as a vapor is always going to be poisonous, debilitating, and deadly to the body. At the same time polluting, corrupting, and devastating to mother earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world. I may add no pun intended that there is no cash profit to be made in the destruction of the planet. Primarily due to those dirty low-paying jobs we are in the mist of environmental financial global collapse. Even worse for the last hundred and 50 years or so the mass majority of the population from coast-to-coast globally more so here in America have been living, dying off, and yielding the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested since the beginning of life only getting worse. This lack of comprehension conscious physical participation in solutions that lead to long term permanent types of progress may be genetically inherited or a simple generic synthetic learned behavior. Nowadays a side effect from global pollution. Quite possible for a person of today&#39;s population again more so here in America. Even more specifically Donald Trump and all the sellout suck up traitor to America trumpet blowers  to be a combination of all those worst-case scenarios combined is one.  And these facts are ignorant beyond retarded (no offense to any disabled people was intended.) Considering for the last 490 years give or take we have had the manpower woman influence to have created clean high-paying jobs from coast-to-coast globally which would constantly consistently be improving upon maintaining the quality of life to the highest degree possible.    \t\t\t\t This type of loyalty, devotion, and commitment to oneself and leadership.  would surely result in the mass majority of the population from coast to coast globally, naturally, gradually systematically almost effortlessly start becoming stronger, smarter,healthier, happier, better off physically mentally, and financially possibly spiritually. These points should be sincerely taken to heart considering the simple logic basic concept that if life is not free why the hell would death be any mother blanking cheaper? It&#39;s not, guaranteed. A question the common basic average man woman and child may be able to wonder is the spiritual cost to one&#39;s own soul and spirit when the freely live and die off having only used the smallest percentage of a fraction of the true potential they were first born with. Basically neglecting their own physical freedom throughout their life. Even worse than self neglect desperate stupidity. Has been exacerbated for the last hundred and 50 years by people constantly inhaling petrified death. Drinking using contaminated even treated water has over 125 different impurities. Eating consuming things that have very little nutritional value if any at all.   Using working with manufacturer mass producing products to the lowest standards of quality.  Versus the highest standards of quality which are organic, non genetically modified, biodegradable and earth friendly. And these points have been scientifically classified religiously verified as the only way to constantly consistently make physical mental financial spiritual progress in every moment of life.

You&#39;re dead.<br><br>So what does that look like?<br><br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.<br><br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.<br><br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.<br><br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.<br><br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.<br><br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.<br><br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.<br><br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.<br><br>Then you die. Always, you die.<br><br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.<br><br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me.

Understanding that vaccines as described, are good is what&#39;s important.<br>The definition being, a small dose of a disease is administered to your body so that it can learn to fight it and develop what is needed for it. Unless a disease changes, in the case of the flu. The reason for people being suspicious is that some people are untrustworthy, and can add extra variables into a vaccine. It would be smart to take advantage of a treatment that directly and openly infects a person, with people doing it willingly. The big thing these days is the Covid vaccine. The people administering it say it&#39;s okay, but other research shows it&#39;s genetically modifying. Rather than being said small dose of the disease.<br><br>This bit is my personal opinion. Covid in the past has only been shown to have the mortality rate people express, when joined with other factoring diseases, and variables like old age. While it&#39;s an aggressive virus, it&#39;s wildly unsuccessful in causing actual death. Although strangely enough, it seems to affect people differently at random. My uncle caught it and had a pretty bad time. Made a full recovery like nothing happened, don&#39;t worry. But then in others, the worst they&#39;ve had was it just being as bad as a cold. So my conclusion is that it&#39;s a disease that can be fought without a vaccine. It&#39;s extremely infectious, so we should respect it and take appropriate care of ourselves, but it&#39;s &#39;overhyped&#39;. Plus, sources from all over have so many conflicting things to say, so it&#39;s hard to know what to trust. So I say, trust your own judgment, while taking heed of what all sources say.

While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the &quot;rage&quot; stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.<br><br>Except you&#39;re asleep, and he&#39;s a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don&#39;t even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.<br><br>Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won&#39;t even tell you if you&#39;ve got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you&#39;ve ever been vaccinated.)<br><br>You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.<br><br>The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.<br><br>It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?<br><br>At this point, you&#39;re already dead. There is no cure.<br><br>(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done - see below).<br><br>There&#39;s no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.<br><br>Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you&#39;re symptomatic, it&#39;s over. You&#39;re dead.<br><br>So what does that look like?<br><br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.<br><br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.<br><br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.<br><br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.<br><br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.<br><br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.<br><br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.<br><br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.<br><br>Then you die. Always, you die.<br><br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.<br><br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me.

If you talk to a group of &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; and ask them about rabies, tetanus or any other vaccine, 97/100 will tell you they&#39;re fine with them, have taken them and have given them to their kids. This is because the people being called &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; these days are, for the most part, not anti-vaxx -- rather they&#39;re against infractions on bodily and medical autonomy or against medical procedures without informed consent. I&#39;d actually argue that the slight growth in actual anti-vaxxers is a direct reaction to the government and media relentlessly demonizing people who aren&#39;t actually anti-vax, which leads some people to have an overall distrust in our medical system, as well as the government and media.<br><br>So if you wanna call out real anti-vaxxers, I&#39;m 100% with you.

It&#39;s exceptionally common, but people just don&#39;t run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.<br><br>Let me paint you a picture.<br><br>You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the &quot;rage&quot; stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.<br><br>Except you&#39;re asleep, and he&#39;s a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don&#39;t even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.<br><br>Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won&#39;t even tell you if you&#39;ve got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you&#39;ve ever been vaccinated.)<br><br>You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.<br><br>The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.<br><br>It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?<br><br>At this point, you&#39;re already dead. There is no cure.<br><br>(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).<br><br>There&#39;s no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.<br><br>Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you&#39;re symptomatic, it&#39;s over. You&#39;re dead.<br><br>So what does that look like?<br><br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.<br><br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.<br><br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.<br><br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.<br><br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.<br><br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.<br><br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.<br><br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.<br><br>Then you die. Always, you die.<br><br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.<br><br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me. And it&#39;s fucking EVERYWHERE. (Source: Spent a lot of time working with rabies.

It&#39;s exceptionally common, but people just don&#39;t run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.<br><br>Let me paint you a picture.<br><br>You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the &quot;rage&quot; stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.<br><br>Except you&#39;re asleep, and he&#39;s a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don&#39;t even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.<br><br>Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won&#39;t even tell you if you&#39;ve got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you&#39;ve ever been vaccinated.)<br><br>You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.<br><br>The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.<br><br>It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?<br><br>At this point, you&#39;re already dead. There is no cure.<br><br>(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).<br><br>There&#39;s no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.<br><br>Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you&#39;re symptomatic, it&#39;s over. You&#39;re dead.<br><br>So what does that look like?<br><br>Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You&#39;re fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your &quot;pons&quot; is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.<br><br>Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn&#39;t occur to you that you don&#39;t know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.<br><br>As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it&#39;s a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they&#39;ll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.<br><br>You&#39;re twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what&#39;s going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It&#39;s around this time the hydrophobia starts.<br><br>You&#39;re horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can&#39;t drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You&#39;re thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that&#39;s futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.<br><br>You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you&#39;re having trouble remembering things, especially family.<br><br>You&#39;re alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you &quot;drink something&quot; and crying. And it&#39;s only been about a week since that little headache that you&#39;ve completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.<br><br>Eventually, you slip into the &quot;dumb rabies&quot; phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You&#39;re all but unaware of what&#39;s around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it&#39;s all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven&#39;t really slept for about 72 hours.<br><br>Then you die. Always, you die.<br><br>And there&#39;s not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.<br><br>So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me.
