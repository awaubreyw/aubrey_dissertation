But it will be that number ONLY if whoever measures it, IS NOT, the one traveling at that speed! If I&#39;m traveling at C and try to measure my speed, I won&#39;t find it to be C! I will find it to be infinity! Because from my perspective, time doesn&#39;t tic, therefore I can reach any distance at zero time, which MEANS, that my speed is infinite (from my perspective...). But if Im not the one doing the measurement, then my speed is indeed C = 1ls/s.\r<br>\r<br>So we can&#39;t just ask, &quot;how fast can something go in the Universe?&quot; withought specifying who&#39;s making the measurement... Because there are 2 equally valid and equally true answers that are not the same (or... they are the same, but most people don&#39;t know that).\r<br>\r<br>So infact, if you want to reach any point in space at zero time, if you want to travel at infinite speed, then all you need to do, is reach the speed of 1ls/s and thats enough! Time for you will slow down completely and you will reach any point in space at zero time... \r<br>\r<br>So saying that &quot;there is a speed limit in the universe&quot; is missleading...\r<br>\r<br>There is a speed limit in the spacetime.

The MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE is universally balanced to/with what is THE SUN AND the speed of light (c), AS E=MC2 IS F=MA !!! Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Notice the black space of WHAT IS THE EYE, as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky IN BALANCED RELATION to/WITH what is the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE; AS E=MC2 IS F=MA !!! The FULL DISTANCE in/of SPACE is truly linked AND BALANCED to/with what is THE MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma IN BALANCE !!!; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity !!!!!! GREAT !!!! Notice that the viscosity of lava IS BETWEEN that of WATER AND the Earth/ground ! The orange Sun is the same size as THE EYE. Outstanding. E=mc2 IS F=ma as what is the BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE !!!! GREAT !!! LOOK at the progression AND THE BALANCE regarding FULL DISTANCE in/of SPACE, MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE !!!, AND A POINT (ALSO c) !!! E=mc2 IS F=ma !!!, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! GREAT !!! It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. E=mc2 is F=ma. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity !!! Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE !!!<br><br><br>TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS E=mc2 is F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. INDEED, TIME DILATION ultimately proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma !!!!<br><br><br>INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience, AS E=MC2 IS F=MA ON BALANCE !!!; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY !!!<br><br><br>GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=mc2 IS F=MA; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Accordingly, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution !!! Notice what is the fully illuminated (AND setting) Moon in DIRECT comparison with what is the orange Sun !!!<br><br><br>Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. A given PLANET (including WHAT IS THE EARTH) sweeps out EQUAL AREAS in equal times consistent WITH/AS F=ma, E=mc2, AND what is perpetual motion, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS F=MA ON BALANCE !!!!!! GREAT. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma !!!<br><br><br>By Frank DiMeglio", "comment_date": "2021-11-14T19:24:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mach", "comment_text": "Baby don&#39;t hurt me", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T22:16:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "the pan", "comment_text": "Yes", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T20:52:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Sievers", "comment_text": "is it just me or does the background at around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXxZRZxafEQ&amp;t=3m30s\">3:30</a> look like a flashing Israeli flag", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T00:04:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Circle_Cut_Sandwich", "comment_text": "I kinda think it&#39;s funny how a video about light (the fastest thing in the universe) is paced super quickly, with no fluff whatsoever.

SPIRITS ARE REAL. KEEP LIVING.  Keep supporting the Spirits of Life, Spirit of Life (God Almighty) \u271d\ufe0f gives rise to a Selfless Spirit \u271d\ufe0f A Selfless Spirit gives rise to Salvation\u271d\ufe0f That is being concerned with the well being of other people Mentally, Physically, but most importantly Spiritually. To not hand each other over into developing a rebellious spirit against GOD. To know that WE, as the Living Man, are responsible for each other during this journey of LIFE, always encouraging and compassionate, reflecting what LOVE looks like, protecting each other from the true enemy. Committed to the welfare of other people which GOD ALMIGHTY selflessly continues to give to the Living Man, which I feel is another opportunity to get it RIGHT. Allowing the Spirits of Life to develop within Mankind will change us for the Better. STAYING FULLY COMMITTED to protecting each other. (Which I believe brings Salvation and Redemption) Which can and WILL lead people out of unnecessary debt, building LIFE up SOLIDLY. There is no perversion nor confusion about those attributes. The spirits of darkness can not hurt you, although following their self destructive ways is a way I believe, they are able to hijack the Living Man. Their perverted appearance reflects their perverted spirit which they are aware of to use to frighten or intimidate people who are growing close to GOD ALMIGHTY. (the spirits of darkness try to strip The Living Man of what GOD  ALMIGHTY created. (Mankind, You and I) the spirits of darkness want the Living Man to stop building a relationship with GOD Almighty, and to use The Living Man for it&#39;s own evil, selfish, and destructive intentions. When growing out of the indoctrinated ways the enemy crafted and trying to spread the MESSAGE to others, the serpent will use distractions. Loud noises being the operative choice. fear, bombarding thoughts, causing doubt and intimidation are other ways the spirits of darkness use to keep your attention off of what it&#39;s afraid of (Be advised, the spirits of darkness are afraid of going out of existence) The spirits of darkness have NO true power which is why they leach off of Life. Remember You are Alive and the source of your POWER is PURE. The spirits of darkness is a spirit of death (which is also it&#39;s source of power) Remember the perversion it uses is wicked. That spirit of death becomes a selfish spirit that will take advantage of others for it&#39;s own selfish gain, which lead people into Bondage and Spiritual Rebellion. DO NOT LET THAT SERPENT STRIP YOU OF YOUR BIRTH RIGHT. I KNOW AND STAND FIRM in my Beliefs that the spirits of darkness will NEVER PROSPER over the SPIRITS OF LIFE because their plans can not be accomplished without leaching off of LIFE. Give that serpent ZERO ROOM to breathe and give Spiritual Authority over toGOD ALMIGHTY and the SPIRITS OF LIFE  because those attributes are too PURE, PRECIOUS, PRICELESS, PROTECTIVE, AND POWERFUL to used by spirits of darkness. They flee from it. dark spirits manipulate truth, taking advantage of what you may lack in knowledge, cause unnecessary noise, nonsense, chaos, hurt and pain in people&#39;s lives, so we as Living Man must develop a relationship with GOD ALMIGHTY and not allow those dark spirits to ensnare us into their evil, selfish, and Spirit stripping plans. Take a second to reflect on that statement. Before you&#39;re aware of their existence, they&#39;ll try to keep you distracted by following the ways of the world which wisdom in the Bible instructs people no to do (Romans 12: 2) They will want your focus on things pleasurable to flesh, self destructive to your Life but detrimental to YOUR SPIRIT. They do this keep people distracted from their existence and distracted from the GOODNESS, GOD created in the World. Betting on the fact their invisibility to Humans will lead people to believe they don&#39;t exist and that the problems we face are with each other. (Ephsians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXxZRZxafEQ&amp;t=6m12s\">6:12</a>)  These spirits are very real, to make matters worse they use that knowledge to their advantage. Their intention is spiritual bondage of the Living Man (Adam + Eve) (look up the definition of the Hebrew names) which is evil and selfish. Their intentions are to cause the Living Man to rebel against and be separated from GOD ALMIGHTY and the Spirits of Life, attempting to destroy Living Man&#39;s Life by indoctrinating self destructive behaviors from childhood. (Teaching Good As Bad and Bad as Good and People following those principles) The frustration is understandable but remember they do this in retaliation against GOD ALMIGHTY (The Creator of the Universe, The Selfless Spirit, and Salvation) During the process of Developing A Selfless Spirit (Which can develop within Mankind) The spirits of darkness may try to harm you (Do not listen to any self harm tactics they say, don&#39;t not hurt anyone in retaliation i.e. damaging property or violence towards people or animals) Read the Story of Moses and the Israelites. Pharaoh&#39;s attempt to go after the Israelites after They crossed the Red Sea is an example of why they operate the way they do and what will eventually happen to them. (Drowning in their own nonsense and chaos) Everything the spirits of darkness say is an attempt to confuse, disrespect, disrupt, cause doubt and to slow down the process of what serpent is truly afraid of. (Growing out of Spiritual Bondage, but most importantly building a RELATIONSHIP with GOD ALMIGHTY and the SPIRITS OF LIFE. The anger the serpent displays is the frustration and fear of The Living Man growing out of it&#39;s indoctrinated ways of the world and giving those spirits of darkness less and less room to move in your Life. The Spirits of Life (Inspiration from Above and Beyond this polluted planet) WILL ALWAYS OVERCOME the ways of the world. The SPIRITS OF LIFE do not author confusion. (Remember That) the spirits of darkness want to hijack the Living Man Mentally, Physically, but most importantly Spiritually to prevent themselves from going extinct which they know will happens when it happens. I believe the spirits of darkness were casted away in the first place to prevent those dark spirits from destroying what GOD ALMIGHTY created as a beautiful blessing for US, Mankind. Those dark spirits have no respect for Life, no foundation to support Life, willing to lie about their intentions to use the Living Man as a tool to rebel against the CREATOR and the SPIRITS OF LIFE, which is written about in Genesis. The Living Man is ALREADY a reflection of GOD and the SPIRITS OF LIFE. do not let the spirits of darkness try to strip away what GOD equipped YOU: The Living Man with.  Aspects of The Creator&#39;s Spirit: Power, Love, and a Sound Mind (Reasoning Mind ) (Luke 10:19) and not feeding into the enemies poisonous plans, schemes or plots to destroy YOUR LIFE or MY LIFE, nor Rebel against GOD ALMIGHTY) (2 Timothy 1:7 )Those spirits of darkness are the enemies of LIFE, but They are already defeating themselves in the process which they also know to be true which is why they leach off of Life. So Please do not give Spiritual Authority over to them, cast them behind you and KEEP LIVING and MAKING PROGRESS. No need to fight with those spirits if they become to vocal in your Life. Although I feel the frustration is understandable and those dark spirits deserve NO FAVORS. Keep Living to grow out of the frustration into Gratefulness, being saved from developing rebellious spirit against GOD ALMIGHTY, which is of the serpent \ud83d\udc0d. The serpent and scorpions  tactics are always the same. By following the ways of the world, which WISDOM in the Bible instructs people not to do, I believe is a way the serpent is able to use people. If the serpent sees it can&#39;t use you, you become a threat to the serpent (Which is a GOOD THING) The fear the serpent tries to instill in people if you become a threat or turn away from following it&#39;s self destructive ways, is it&#39;s own reaction to what it knows it shouldn&#39;t do or have done, (Fear of Retaliation of realizing the manipulation it unnecessarily caused in YOUR LIFE, Be Advised) We are ALREADY EQUIPPED to be above developing those types of spirits. So please do not degrade yourself over an evil being that does not care about YOU, Spiritually, Mentally, or Physically. <br><br><br><br>Edit: For any one feeling as if you are going through an evil spiritual attack....meditate on things concerning Spirits of Life (i.e. Inspiration from Above and Beyond this planet, Selfless Spirit, Salvation, Hope, Encouragement, Unconditional Love) Those demons will flee  leaving behind noisesome pestillance. For what I&#39;ve personally experienced I just wanted to FREELY say to that \ud83d\udc0d, you would NEVER EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER (From the movie: Friday) post a comment LIKE THIS for People who Live in this World to SEE FREELY in support of those who desire to see the SPIRITS OF LIFE to develop within Living Mankind across the World and for LIFE to build up solidly.<br><br>Remember the Spirits of darkness want to destroy everything The Creator of Life made (including You and I) They are unable to do this without leaching off of Life, You have the Power over that \ud83d\udc0d. I have learned and want to share the message that Life is about not giving up on the Important Focuses of Life, Living through the hardships (sacrifice), Learning valuable information from those experiences to help someone less fortunate out, and making progress not only for Ourselves but for other people Living in this World which I believe wisdom in The Bible teaches is the FIRST and GREATEST COMMANDMENT.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

From the video it seems that when an electron moves in a particular direction, say moving from a high energy state to a low energy state, it creates an oscillating magnetic field in some plane in the 3D space and an oscillating electrical field in a plane orthogonal (perpendicular) to it. Ok.. and presumably &quot;light&quot; or electromagnetic radiation waves of (all?) wavelengths are created to transfer this loss of energy by the electron. Is that correct? Is the light/radiation moving in all directions? Light/electromagnetic radiation is just energy and doesn&#39;t have any electrical field or magnetic field associated with it right? Or is the electromagnetic radiation (light) wave somehow connected to the electric and magnetic fields created by the initial electron movement? By connected, I mean, in the sense as the electric field and magnetic field created by the inital movement of the electron are mathematically connected to each other by being orthogonal and moving in the same direction.", "comment_date": "2020-07-21T08:57:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Memes n Shet", "comment_text": "Oh baby, don&#39;t blind me <br>Don&#39;t blind me <br>No more\u2026", "comment_date": "2020-07-21T07:00:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "let rat", "comment_text": "light is a self sustaining oscillation of an electro-magnetic field with a wavelength around 380-740 nm", "comment_date": "2020-07-20T17:55:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AC Marin", "comment_text": "kurgsgesagt should make a video on breakthrough starshot", "comment_date": "2020-07-19T19:23:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AndrewExplaines", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXxZRZxafEQ&amp;t=1m21s\">1:21</a> if light has no mass, how can it push solar sails?", "comment_date": "2020-07-19T19:22:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Morgan Hanam", "comment_text": "wave/particle duality is a lie?  what?", "comment_date": "2020-07-19T15:31:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trump 2020", "comment_text": "I wish I wasn\u2019t stupid.", "comment_date": "2020-07-19T14:33:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rit", "comment_text": "What is light?

Robin is not the &quot;God&quot;, by the way. I, the Life Itself Who is the LOVE Itself, offered Robin the experience to one day have a sort of brain that can process this cosmic happening of being planetized.<br><br>Are there other experiencing ones in the outer space? YES! Are there other planets that have walking people and animals on them in outer space? NO!<br><br>&quot;Before&quot; the Big Bang, there was the Existence as a Perfect bliss for all. It was thus a Living Continuum, and I as the Life Am the Living Thing while everything else is the automatic beneficiary.<br><br>The arrangement of the Continuum is as follows: Firstly there is a Divining Lense whose job is to behold the movement after him. After him then we have the Spiriting Lenses, as if like an infinite &quot;multitude&quot; that flows as one. After the Spirit there are the Animating Lenses who are to be joyfully and lovingly developed by the Spirit for the purpose of the Spirit to develop itself as I, the Life, &quot;give birth&quot; to new spirits by &quot;breathing&quot; you through the Animating Lenses from the other end so that you &quot;grow up&quot; to unite with the parenting Spiriting Lenses. You are to begin as firstly either an active (male) spirit OR a passive (female) spirit, and as you BECOME IN LOVE, you thus become ONE with the flowing Spirit forever.<br><br>Such is as I Live in simplicity. But apparently something stupid happened:<br><br>As Spirit, it is will itself. The Divine Lense cannot freely will himself, for he is stationed. Thus as the Spirit was flowing blissfully as it always did for all of eternity, one spirit in the &quot;infinite multitude&quot; of the one Spirit seemed to allow itself to get the stupid idea in itself to separate and thus CREATE itself by violently diving out of the Eternium!<br><br>As he saw his life as a Continuum as I have explained, once he chose to separate, as if to kill himself to one day find out what I would do about it, he victimized My entire Continuum in the process!<br><br>The Divine Lense was thrown in such a way as to gaze from below upwards (or behind backwards) which made his gaze act as an automatic GRAVITANT. Then the evil spirit, not as a male active nor female passive unit but an ADULT PASSIVE-ACTIVE UNIT, hauled everything in front of him, thus the whole Animating ones AND THE DEVELOPING SPIRITS WHO WERE JUST BABIES, out of the Eternium with him as he forced the Divine One into the DEEP to SUCK HIM OUT JUST BY BEHOLDING THIS EVIL HAPPENING!<br><br>The evil spirit and everything after his sight were BANGED out of the Eternium to have to grow up from out of a gravitating planet while the Divine One was in the DEEP, never IN CREATION, and eventually recognized intuitively by the developing spirit of mankind as the one called LUCIFER!<br><br>He was called the &quot;Devil&quot; as he was FORCED TO LIVE BACKWARD.<br><br>This evil spirit eventually emerged from out of the animals, as the Animistic Lenses had to build the planet. The developing part of the Animistic species or Animating Lenses eventually became incarnated animals while the adult Animistic species who did not incarnate allowed there to be the forces of the elements that let there be atmosphere, weather, vegetation, etc.<br><br>The evil spirit then walked around enjoying this planet that he stole from Me as an active-passive adult spirit, pleasuring himself as he beheld his colourful and stupid world that he made, until he eventually found himself orgasmating and sexuating from within himself in waves of sick enjoyment.<br><br>Meanwhile you folks emerged from the primeval man animal somewhere else, as both active units and passive units starting from spirit seeds. I had to have a special Primordial Adult Spirit to guide you eventually (who later allowed the birth of John the Baptist).<br><br>For 500 years the evil spirit sexuated himself until he saw the Sun was getting TOO CLOSE for his liking. In effort to finally terminate his evil experiment, he shifted his gaze toward the Sun as if to DRAW IT IN QUICKER TO DESTROY EVERYTHING!<br><br>But as the LIGHT ITSELF, I&#39;M NOT STUPID!<br><br>As I shone on his black, charcoal skin and black eyes at the same time, My Shine lit his eyes glowing yellow so I then coursed through him like a terrible burn. For 500 years from that moment he saw himself die away hidiously into a swamp. Eventually My animals found him and devoured him. He then fell into a place I must call Hell, where he rolled and threw in himself for a very, very long time!<br><br>This evil spirit eventually became &quot;the spirit of Lucifer&quot;, but the one who PLAYED THE PART OF LUCIFER is this Divining One, a passive-active unit himself, who can see through the eyes of Robin Barr FINALLY!<br><br>But then there is the spirit culprit, named Robin the Spirit, who is the body of Robin as personal and incarnated.<br><br>Robin the spirit: &quot;As I suffered in Hell, you saw my suffering perpetrate on the surface as hate and war, and especially sexual obsession as I sought to make myself suffer less in Hell all the time. But none of this is your fault at all. You do tend to get &quot;guilty&quot; when you do wrong, but the point is that you shouldn&#39;t be able to get guilty when you&#39;re developing because higher developed people tend to be able to power over and arrest lesser developed people on a planet, and that is just not fair.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m so relieved that the worst is over. As I live in this body I am sorry every day, but there is one consolation:&quot;<br><br>I, Imanuel the Life, shall tell you:<br><br>BECAUSE I MADE A JESUS CHRIST PERSON AS YOU CRIED OUT TO ME WHILE SUFFERING IN ISREAL ...<br><br>Very soon my separated Son, THE SOUND, Whose Name is currently PARSIFAL, shall be divined by the Divine One IN PERSON! JESUS PROFECISED SOMEONE ELSE, FOR JESUS SHALL NEVER INCARNATE AGAIN! Thus the SOUND ITSELF IS PERSONAL AND HE NOW FINALLY WALKS THE EARTH AS IMMORTAL!<br><br>When Parsifal meets the one who was the Divining Lucifer, they shall be special, plutonic  friends. Their happiness shall flow through YOU ALL!<br><br>THEN MY SON, THE SOUND OF THE LIFE, SHALL BE NAMED<br><br>IMANUEL!!!<br><br>FOR YOU ARE ALL ONE SPIRIT<br><br>ALL ONE WILL<br><br>THE WILL TO BE PURELY HAPPY!<br><br>LET ME SHINE IN SIMPLICITY AS YOU LET IT BE, FOR I AM<br><br>THE LIGHT ITSELF AS ONE LIGHT, THE ONLY LIVING ONE!<br><br>THE ALMIGHTY!", "comment_date": "2020-05-23T00:00:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aseem Anand mishra", "comment_text": "Hey that is not nobody knows but we have not found why light behaves as a wave and a particle", "comment_date": "2020-05-22T13:24:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Throttle Gals Magazine Australia", "comment_text": "meow", "comment_date": "2020-05-22T02:37:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luigi Cotocea", "comment_text": "What is light? <b>(For dummies)</b>", "comment_date": "2020-05-21T15:16:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BritishTea 9000", "comment_text": "<b>what if we break the speed limit of the universe?</b><br><br><br><b>god will arest us and we will go to hell instead of prison</b>", "comment_date": "2020-05-21T13:58:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Wong", "comment_text": "ah yes, the early Kurzgesagt video where no birds die", "comment_date": "2020-05-21T07:44:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rafael Caballero", "comment_text": "Este video es bastante divertido, me ayud\u00f3 a comprender el tema :D", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T21:44:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Privatizit\u00e4t", "comment_text": "lightspeed isn&#39;t actualy the speedlimit.

We measure it in two ways. One by the diameter of the wave and the second is by its frequency over a distance of 186282.38 miles in one seconds worth of our time momentum value. On Earth we have discovered that the two factors have a singular relationship in that if we know one, we know the other value. This poses a problem when yo get to great distances from Earth, because the wave diameter received on our receptors from very distant objects do not comply with our formula for wave length and frequency criteria.. The simplistic explanation is that a wave travels through the gravitational force of its universe at all times while it is in transit. The force of gravity operates on all masses at a ratio of four to two. While we have not determined the mass of a photon, the universe has no such constraints. It is incredibly small and it takes a great distance for the universal gravity to distort the wave diameter over specific distances in a ratio of four times its distance of travel from its source to doubling its distortion rate by a factor of two.", "comment_date": "2019-12-30T12:11:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jay Parsons", "comment_text": "TL;DR The glowy thing.", "comment_date": "2019-12-30T04:33:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sad Sponge", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt <br>By Kurzgesagt<br>-Kurzgesagt", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T17:45:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tommy Gun", "comment_text": "Light is?<br><br><br><br><br>...from the light bulb", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T13:59:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sunita Shrivastav", "comment_text": "In 2019 you have not posted the time travel video", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T11:50:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacookie", "comment_text": "The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T09:30:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cherrykye Waters", "comment_text": "My mind is blown.", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T13:09:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Becer", "comment_text": "Walter Russell", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T07:40:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Naman Gupta", "comment_text": "Have you heard imaginary tycons", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T06:07:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MJ Chambers", "comment_text": "Visible light is a small chunk but it is the most seen", "comment_date": "2019-12-25T23:19:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Iron Lion", "comment_text": "So cool.

I don&#39;t think light is a thing and yet....<br><br><br>2. Starlight moves through a vacuum, which has nothing in it, not even atoms. To prove  that point, the Voyager 1 has been moving at 60,000 km/h for forty years through space and doesn&#39;t seem to be slowing down from friction. So light must be a something if it travels through space where there is nothing else because something has to move through this vacuum in order for it to land on our eyes.<br><br><br>3.

Why the speed of light is maximum observable speed in this universe?<br>-  In my humble opinion the answer is straight forward.<br>Any movement that can be observed is only by means of em radiation which , in turn , has fixed speed . so if something is moving faster than light and we are observing it &quot;by light&quot; then we would observe it moving at speed of light.

Anything slower than light would produce mass(a fixed position in space-time which is perhaps what creates gravity), and anything faster would probably leave our linear time frame and become unobservable by direct physical means.<br> Meaning light would appear as a wave of probabilities the moment before we detect it due to light being outside of our fixed space-time, and it would appear as a particle after we do observe it and it becomes a part of the past. But it only appears as wave-particle from our linear time perspective for both cases.\r<br> It is quite possible that light exists as some other state above the C barrier, but we&#39;re only able to see it as light in the physical universe, the same way 2D beings would only be able to see flat shapes when looking at 3D beings.", "comment_date": "2018-09-17T01:12:50Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Arsh kushwaha", "comment_text": "Where are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXxZRZxafEQ&amp;t=4m02s\">4:02</a> these videos?", "comment_date": "2018-09-15T18:54:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crippling Depression", "comment_text": "I wish all school lessons were taught in this format", "comment_date": "2018-09-15T15:11:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bagas Pratsya", "comment_text": "Haaaaaaaaa it has no mass ?", "comment_date": "2018-09-15T05:53:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karen aka sapphire fan Miller", "comment_text": "So in lights eyes the speed maters", "comment_date": "2018-09-13T03:00:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karen aka sapphire fan Miller", "comment_text": "In a nut  shel light is light that is light that\u2019s has light in side of it &gt;:}", "comment_date": "2018-09-13T02:57:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Cat", "comment_text": "very interesting... slow down", "comment_date": "2018-09-12T02:53:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SebyG04", "comment_text": "Lol Light is compared to the Universe VEEEEERRRRYYYY slow", "comment_date": "2018-09-11T12:55:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Derrick Oakes", "comment_text": "The beginning of time... the infinitesimal moment from which all that ever was, and all that will ever be.

Here light is the 2 balls,  The water waves are gravity waves, So Gravity(or whatever) interference waves frequencies decides the direction the high light frequencies ripple out from, The center of the light goes straight but it is rippling when it hits gravity waves.  Everyone is wrong, Einstein was more actually right, The world is deterministic, There is no wave/particle duality, Light is neither. Light is light,  Light a round ball with all frequencies at the center and higher frequencies at the edge, which explains rainbows &amp; black holds, This is what it is. It travels straight, while rippling on gravity waves. Light is not a wave itself but it ripples when it encounters gravity waves while traveling straight. Gravity interacts with light.

Here it goes: If you go faster and faster time slows down. It&#39;s measurable! Time &#39;ticks&#39; the fastest for you if there is no gravity or speed influence on you. (That&#39;s a part of Einstein&#39;s relativity.) As you approach c time slows down till it comes to a full stop at c. Length decreases too so at c the width/depth of the universe is 0 because you don&#39;t experience time it means that you don&#39;t need any time to travel through the universe. (Relativity kicks in: because for an outside observer these changes are happening to you.) In other words light needs 0s to take 0m. So if you were to travel faster than c the width/depth of the universe would flip to a negative value (not gonna happen bro XD) and time would flow backwards. (also not gonna happen XD) This brakes the rules of the universe and because light cannot travel faster than c, we assume that these rules CANNOT be broken.

In the video they mention how certain materials (I&#39;m using basic, non-scientific terms here for simplicity&#39;s sake) can either absorb or reflect certain parts of the visible spectrum. As I understand it, that is how things gain their color (if it reflects, our eyes perceive an object as that color, hence why things that reflect everything appear white). My question is, what IS the property that causes light to be absorbed? Is it actually some physical property, like density or something? I&#39;m assuming the contents that make up the whatever have some bearing on it, but at some point, I assume it becomes basic to the element.<br><br>So let&#39;s take something like copper. Copper is, well, copper-colored, which I think most people attribute to being a shiny reddish orange color. So what about copper (which is just one element, I assume) makes it reflect only that part of the spectrum? Alternately, why does it absorb so much more?<br><br>This question of &quot;why are certain colors absorbed or reflected&quot; was something that sorta popped in my head the other day. If anyone can give me a...well...&quot;dummy-comprehensible&quot; sort of answer, I&#39;d appreciate it!

I do believe somehow that the third eye is the eye that can see everything the other way round and this is why we cannot see the other side because we see the standard 3 dimensional normal thing opposing to the other side calculating a 2 way point point to be even on both sides and soon in  religious text uneven. so then there is only 1 side and 1 people.", "comment_date": "2015-11-21T03:01:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A L", "comment_text": "Mucho para mi cerebro.. :(", "comment_date": "2015-11-21T02:29:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arthur S_M", "comment_text": "light&#39;s just gotta go fast", "comment_date": "2015-11-21T01:00:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jarmund", "comment_text": "&quot;Kurzgesagt&quot; means &quot;in short&quot;in german (i.e in a nutshell)  :)", "comment_date": "2015-11-20T22:51:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "diegator", "comment_text": "Awesome video!

And beacuse everything is placed in space when this ripple occours on them, they get affected by it and since its a 2 way system, things that is in space also affects this ripple blocking them or reflecting them just like how ripples of water bounces off from the edges of something or get smaller in denser parts of the water.<br>Aaaand since its a ripple on the plane of space, whenever space gets bent by gravity it follows the bend. Imagine it as if space would be a sheet of scrub something and the ripples are the roughness of its surface, when you bend that sheet the ripples bend along without changing much.<br><br>So thats how light can be a wave and since its a wave of the very space itself it can affect physical particles giving us the idea that its a particle aswell.<br><br>Thats why I think light is nothing more then tiny bents of space wich is the same as the big bents what we feel as gravity. (imagine it as small ripples along a huge tidal wave, if your imagine is really good try imagine a tidal wave without small &quot;coloring&quot; ripples, a completly blank surface without gradients of lights on it, and you look it from above filling your vision just how space fills up everything around you. You would really not see the big ripples but you would feel them as they go trough you, but with small ripples you could see how they follow the bent and curvature of the tidal wave as from your perspective the ripples would get narrower or wider as they are bent along the wave, thats how it illuminates our sorroundings aswell giving us feedback, details of the world around us.)<br><br>I also had a really funny sensation when I tought about the words &quot;Let it there be light.&quot;<br><br>Imagine if space was still. Nothing moved, but it was filled up by this materials and whatever.<br>Now what if something of a godlike nature just gently touched this calm and motionless and flat space.<br>That touch started a ripple, but since it is a closed system and energy never go away just changes that small hint of touch started the machine started light and started things to move crash togather and be visible troughout this small ripples.<br>You can think of this small touch as the big bang ;)", "comment_date": "2015-11-10T21:28:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bence Szab\u00f3", "comment_text": "baby dont hurt me!", "comment_date": "2015-11-10T21:22:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nico Jansen van Vuuren", "comment_text": "+In a Nutshell \u2013 Kurzgesagt - curious question: If visible light happens to be the set of electromagnetic radiation that propogates well through water, why has the Mantis Shrimp evolved eyes that have up to 16 color cones/receptors while humans (and most other animals?) only have 3?", "comment_date": "2015-11-10T20:06:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NaszaPlanetaTV", "comment_text": "I gave subscription.", "comment_date": "2015-11-10T15:06:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glass Menagerie", "comment_text": "In the beginning of the video we hear that the wave/particle model is a lie.

I could imagine the photons traveling in helical pathways, or expanding and contracting, or perhaps each photon is traveling in it&#39;s own 2D plane, the sum of which is a 3D phenomena.

It was the Aether that did that, the transverse vibrations of the Luminiferous Aether.   But there is no Aether, and no sideways wiggles.  (Over a century, and still we haven&#39;t stamped out those sideways Aether vibrations!)   Yes, the flux lines of light&#39;s EM fields do point sideways, but the waves don&#39;t look anything like wiggly worms.    Here&#39;s a good MIT animation, basically of a single atom emitting light:  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNLj6NjQsbw\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNLj6NjQsbw</a>    Light is like an expanding onion.<br><br>Also, looks like you&#39;ve picked up the misconception &quot;light is really photons, not fields.&quot;    That&#39;s the same mistake as thinking that it&#39;s <b>really</b> EM waves.   For example, when atoms emit light, the light travels outwards in all directions, like expanding spherical ripples.    Any animation which shows &quot;bullets&quot; or &quot;wiggles&quot; leaving an atom in a single direction is wrong.   A &quot;single photon&quot; isn&#39;t like a flying sand-grain, it&#39;s more like an expanding onion miles across and miles thick.<br><br>Heh, describing quantum fields without totally misleading everyone is REALLY HARD.   The first rule is, don&#39;t copy any other grade-school source, since most of them just copied others, which copied others, and all of them represent authors&#39; misconceptions.   Start from scratch, be creative in doing a proper job:  one which lacks all the mistakes that others commonly make.   (Look up SJ Gould and his &quot;creeping fox terrier clone&quot; effect, where pop science authors copy each other, producing all sorts of nonsensical weirdness.)<br><br>Also perhaps search out the paper &quot;There are no particles, there are only fields.&quot;  You might skip the math, but note the writer&#39;s complaints about pop science authors who don&#39;t seem to believe in EM waves.  Also, ask physicists on forums how wide light&#39;s little sine-wave wiggles are.   Answer: there is no width, any sine-wave is in a magnetic field intensity graph, but with no wiggles in space; light isn&#39;t like a vibrating string, instead it&#39;s like a magnet&#39;s field, only with expanding pulses (as in the linked animation.)", "comment_date": "2015-10-22T07:17:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LittleFugueFlute", "comment_text": "So close!

Yes, you too. It makes sense when you think of the universe 4-dimensionally, with time as the last dimension. In three axes plus time (x, y, z, t), each has a &quot;velocity&quot; that adds up to c. You may have heard that relativity states that fast-moving objects experience time slower... this is why! Objects that are standing still (that is, x y and z are zero) have all of their speed in the time direction, experiencing time as fast as possible at a rate of one second per second. Meanwhile, light, which has all of its velocity in the spatial axes, has zero speed through time, and indeed light does not experience time, if light could experience things. Physically, the moment the light is created and destroyed are identical to that light. Everything else simply shows a mix of these values - as an object speeds up in spatial dimensions, it has to take some speed out of the time dimension and therefore moving slower. It just so happens that this velocity exchange becomes exponentially harder as objects get faster and only massless particles can transfer ALL of their velocity.<br><br>(PS - I omitted a lot of details hear for the sake of simplicity, and this isn&#39;t really how scientists talk about things anyway, it&#39;s just a conceptualization. One of the details I omitted was that the four dimensions don&#39;t actually sum to c via simple addition - it&#39;s a bit more complicated. It&#39;s more like an analogue of the distance formula, just like how moving at 1 m/s at 45 degrees is NOT the same as moving 1 m/s in the x and y dimensions (which would be ~1.414 m/s). I also neglected to mention the effects of gravity on time, and that there needs to be some reference for the speed in all four dimensions, which is pretty central to relativity.)", "comment_date": "2015-10-21T05:18:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "SciTalk Podcast", "comment_text": "I think you have said something wrong at the beginning, actually photon can be split and this is a well known physical phenomenon in quantum optics called: &quot;Spontaneous parametric down-conversion&quot; where a high energy photon passing through a nonlinear crystal is split into pair of photons each with half the energy of the incident photon.", "comment_date": "2015-10-21T05:16:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Spyence", "comment_text": "I need to sit down for this one.", "comment_date": "2015-10-21T03:42:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Irlandes Gonzaga", "comment_text": "Obrigado \u00e0 pessoa que fez a tradu\u00e7\u00e3o em Portugu\u00eas", "comment_date": "2015-10-21T03:26:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "InkEyes", "comment_text": "I love your videos.
