written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. It was serialized in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from 1987 to 2004, and was transferred to the monthly seinen manga magazine Ultra Jump in 2005. The series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the JoJo nickname; the eighth, JoJolion, began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure is Shueisha&#39;s second largest manga by volume count, with its chapters collected in 127 tank\u014dbon volumes as of April 2020.\r<br>A 13-episode original video animation series adapting the manga&#39;s third part, Stardust Crusaders, was produced by A.P.P.P. and released from 1993 to 2002. The studio later produced an anime film adapting the first part, Phantom Blood, which was released in theaters in Japan in 2007. In October 2012, an anime television series produced by David Production adapting Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency began broadcast on Tokyo MX. As of July 2019, the studio has produced four seasons adapting through the manga&#39;s fifth part, Golden Wind. A live-action film based on the fourth part, Diamond Is Unbreakable, was released in Japan in 2017.\r<br>JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure is well-known for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western popular music and fashion, and creative battles centered around Stands, psycho-spiritual manifestations with unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history, and it has spawned a media franchise including one-shot manga, light novels, and video games. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by Viz Media, which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.", "comment_date": "2020-10-18T15:22:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "The Discord Memer", "comment_text": "And now you make one vid every week and they are all fully animated I also want to know how many people work for this channel", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T03:23:20Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Zulfan Falah", "comment_text": "It&#39;s irony how this video is the least watches video in this channel", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T03:32:44Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Mahadev Kanodia", "comment_text": "Ah..
