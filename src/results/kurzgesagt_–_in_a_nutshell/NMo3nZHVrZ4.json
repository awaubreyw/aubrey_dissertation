About aid, China is implementing in some places the poverty alleviation program, that has been working inside China since Xi Jingping took power, and it works really well, because it is really able to empower people. Yes, I know a lot of you think bad of him, but try to ignore the whole anti China propaganda, because most of it is lie (like other lies that imperialist press created to justify USA interventions on countries). <br><br>The imperialist concept of aid is in fact stupid. It is just a bunch of overcomplicated measures that only have the objective to seem that we are doing something while we are doing nothing. Look at our streets. A lot of them are full of homeless people suffering from depression, alcoholism, addictions, etc. If we can&#39;t solve that, can we really solve the African problem?

An ordinary citizen of the western world wastes 1kg in 5kgs of food he/she has access to. Check the per capita carbon footprint of an ordinary American or European. In fact speaking of food, the so-called developing world, these very same poor people you accuse of overpopulation, produce more food than the world can consume, but unfortunately the farmers get ripped off and get near to nothing for their cocoa or bananas, and cant feed their families. These products are underprized so the largely western consumer can buy cheap, then throw into the bin. Simple as that. This whole overpopulation argument is rubbish. You get people living in a three bedroom house in some western capital, having four cars in his carpark, every friday morning throwing away a tonne of food, then turning around and accusing a family of five, sleeping in one mud hut, eating a total of half his family consumption, of overpopulation. Its a complete fraud. Then there is capitalism, poor countries are stuck in a vicious cycle of poverty in many cases because the international trade order is designed to keep them stuck in extractive economies for the benfit of the western economies. These are developmental problems not population problems per se. Check Africa&#39;s population density, stop obsessing about its size in simple terms.Then you make a philosophical error, you mistake population size and growths alongside weak economic growth, for having a causal relationship. Population growth has neither a negative nor a positive effect on poverty, it is economic development that has an impact. You can develop an economy even at a time of high population growth. In fact in my country Botswana, it was at the height of of its populaiton growth that it exprienced its greatest economic growth, how do you explain that? Simply because economic growth has nothing to do with populaiton growth. It is the developmental strategy that has a relationship with poverty and of course, the world economic rules which are stacked against developing countries. Including the sponsorship of idiotic leaders in developing countries, by economic interests of the west.

Storm clouds of higher charge send heat lightening and charge of higher electron charge move to clouds of lower electron charge to stabilize the electron balance in the atmosphere. We&#39;re energizing ground water tables with positive electron charge and telling storms not to come here, and with electron to magnetic earth ground charge a low depression stir where h20 reaches ground and which replenishes water like it should rarely happens, so it just evaps off, that&#39;s why lightening is more likely to hit the lone farm house rather than the neighborhood.

And with more jobs everywhere, everyone will have more for each other and dollars will go further everywhere. All the kids playing on dad&#39;s monopoly game will have a fun life and get back to serving one another. One kid will sell ice cream cones again because the other one is hired to paint houses, so he hires someone else to work on theirs, and people can build boats and people can go on boat rides again, with more people working more people can actually get a paid vacation and start saving for retirement (I&#39;ll take a retirement pll), but with everything shut down, it&#39;s a game of who wants to buy it all up for paper when it floods and collapses<br><br>Grow too much food so when the food truck is empty, it takes back the extra food with blemishes for fertilzer on indoor crops where there&#39;s no need for pestcde as there no bugs indoors, you can grow any crop with with above  or below ground (mirrored clay wall) vertical farms, magnifying glass panels at ground level, solar 24/7/365 growing seasons, indoor fresh water fish farms, indoor whaling, grow grass and put cows and chickens on it all year round (won&#39;t even stink up a metropolitan city in a high rise) plant dirt and grass and cows where torn down factories left concrete waste slabs) in a building grass can be grown in many floor to ceiling returnable plats on a conveyer, that&#39;s takes it up to the dairy floors for food where the cows eat it at 3&#39; above the floor, the floor has a squeegee system and the cows are herded from one half of the floor to the other for cleaning: an automated squeege cleans the floor and empties it into a special for drain: the cow manure goes back down in a pipe for fertilizer : ) the floor has a floor washer, like a car wash, but with clean spayed water on the floor and a squeegee system : ) So good<br><br> Salt water can be separated with oxygen being released like a rain forest to the outside air while the electricity generated disinfects waste water as it makes energy (NASA does this to make cabin oxygen while it releases everything else to space) Everyone uses a small steam distiller to disinfect and remove salt at the sink for drinking and cooking, everyone gets soft water to their house from the ocean, (already has natural salt in it) drag pipelines to every continent, more jobs, and divert river system maybe to deserts to take sea water rise from melting ice caps and maybe restock what used to be an ocean, natural sand filter at least, just don&#39;t put sharks in there and you can surf : )<br><br> NASA uses electrolysis to make cabin oxygen from water and they release the hydrogen gas to outer space, you could use the h as clean energy and release the oxygen to the planet as a rain forest, drag ocean soft water to municipalities, they use a small steam distiller at the sink for drinking water, everyone&#39;s off toilet to tap, and you use electrolysis to disinfect the waste water and make energy. You split the ocean stream for indoor fresh water and salt water fish farming. You build or convert 40 story buildings for indoor farming. Every acre under roof is an 80-120 acre farm, but instead of 12 hours of light, there&#39;s solar glass panels and you have 24 hours of light, 12 months of growing instead of 6, so maybe an 80 acre indoors is like 320. You grow too much food so the empty good truck picks up the blemished felt and vegetables for fertilizer. You can have a cow floor, a dairy farm and a chicken floor in what was an office building. One person drives an hour with gas and clogs tollways to drive to a city where someone else has to drive an hour to his town to work. Now they both work from home, they can get paid more and write off an office in their home, empty office building can be converted to indoor farms, and the sprinkler system can be used for irrigation. You can grow every crop in the world, everywhere, indoor, with every climate and 24/7/365 agriculture, and not even smell farm animals in a building <br><br>For what it costs to build housing here and grow food on welfare, we can pay people who want to go to another country and build indoor farms and drag ocean lines and build clean energy waste water stations.

High birth rates are a reaction to adverse conditions rather than a cause. Lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality incentivize having more children and having them earlier.<br>2.

Thus, a family planning program undertaken without an improvement to general infrastructure and quality of life will not resolve the conditions that make high birth rates advantageous.<br><br>This has an interesting implication: it would thus be possible for a development program that places too much emphasis on family planning, without addressing the social problems that encourage high birth rates, to be actively hazardous to a population.

Since then, a lot of the business done with African countries has been done corruptly - one elite hand washing the other.<br><br>Just as the venal impulses of the colonies were replaced with business by bribery, so the paternalistic/ benevolent aspect of the colony was replaced with aid. And aid has continued to have an element of being aid to the donor country (fair enough, since it&#39;s the donor country&#39;s money; but that&#39;s not the way it&#39;s sold by those doing PR for it). Aid often involves things like providing nice jobs for children of the donor country, sent to tell the natives how to do something (and maybe finish a postgrad degree in the process); then the youngster employed with the donor country&#39;s own money (fair enough) goes home at the end of the project, and effectively hands it over to some local elite - ultimately descended from that initial government the previous colonial power could &quot;do business with&quot;, back in the day, so the goals of management change (often toward diverting money wasted on the paternalistic aspects of the project to worthwhile things like the management&#39;s own family).<br><br>I&#39;m being perhaps a bit cynical, but only as a &quot;universal generalization&quot;. There are many cases in which scenarios like the above, and Worse, have been the lot of the people of Africa, more than anywhere else on Earth.<br><br>And whenever these messy parts of the whole picture start to show, and the blinkers are put on (because if you speak bluntly about things like this, you&#39;re a Bad Person), it just feeds back into one of the many vicious circles spinning around in Africa.<br><br>Yes, Africa is big, but there are some generalizations that have quite wide applicability.<br><br>Perhaps a better new way forward which would best help the people of Africa would be to withdraw aid from those countries that most clearly have &quot;owners&quot;, rather than governments (that serve), and to divert it exclusively to those countries that are doing well, fixing their own problems. Perhaps make this diversion of support conditional on something in the direction of open borders, so that well-functioning countries can become havens that the ordinary people from misgoverned countries could flee to without causing detrimental social upheavals.<br><br>And then the messiness returns. If you withdraw your subsidy of that misgoverned country&#39;s elite, you create a vacuum that your rivals can fill up. Your own interests are best served by ... &quot;governments you can do business with&quot; (in other words, bribe). Still, in its broader terms, a policy that favoured &quot;fundamental success&quot; (accountable governments with sound policies effectively implemented and protected from destructive influences like those who offer bribes) would surely be better than just seeking maximum diplomatic advantage?

You made the point that there are 3 main areas which can be addressed: 1) Education, 2) Infant / Child Mortality, and 3) Contraception [or, more generally, Family Planning.  But at the end of the video, you stated Ethiopia was the country with the largest population in this &#39;region&#39; - yet it had made quite a lot of progress recently.  However, you only highlighted this progress in regard to 2 of the 3 stated areas: 1) Education, and 2) Infant / Child Mortality.  If the 3rd constitutes some thorny issue such that you&#39;d rather avoid getting into specifics, then one is left to wonder 2 things: 1) Why mention it in the first place [at least, in regard to the subject of this video (Sub-Saharan Africa)], and 2) Don&#39;t things like having fewer children (due to improved child mortality rates), and having children later in life also constitute a form of &#39;contraception&#39; that could have safely been mentioned?  It should have also been worthy of mention that, once a higher level of education is attained, family planning does, in fact, become a viable option.  I feel you could have easily mentioned any or all of these points, quite safely.  In love, they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder.

I would go over it more but Isaac Arthur has done a pretty good job of introducing how the world has the potential to support 1 trillion people. I mean just think about it.

He liberalized the economy from an early stage with stable corporate and business taxes, bringing in foreign investment. He then used money from these ventures to strengthen the countries agriculture, and set organizations like Botswana Meat Commission. He negotiated contracts with foreign mining and drilling companies to set up joint ventures to bring in extra money. He used this surplus money to build schools, pave roads, and build hospitals to uplift the people of Botswana. He also didn\u2019t make the mistakes that the white minority and socialists regimes of Africa did. He didn\u2019t suppress talent based on race for the civil service, but didn\u2019t immediately indigenize the bureaucracy by throwing out competent bureaucrats because of race. His policies were so successful, that the government was running a budget surplus just one year into his second term in 1970.

The dumbass goverment wants to make almost the whole city center a walking only zone not one or two streets in it ALMOST THE WHOLE CITY CENTER. And the city is built that way so that everything is orianted around the center like if you close 1 or 2 streets in the center a big part of the city starts having traffic problems. Dumbass move 2 is that the ruling party wants to put a tram bridge in the middle of a park, A TRAM bridge in the middle of a PARK. That bridge is a important link between the 2 parts of the city. And the city needs like 3 or 4 more bridges connecting the two sides for good traffic flow and they want to put one important one in the middle of a park so caf\u00e9s have a better view ;-; .

My country still has a lot of problems. <br>Like land problems.<br>1. In 1971 we started our war for Independence. In that war a lot of people escaped to India. Some of them came back and some of them died and some never came back or some lost their land documents. That&#39;s why there are many Land&#39;s that are government land we&#39;re poor people are living and getting kicked out mostly my people who have political influence. Even I live in a land we&#39;re there is no documents of the owner so we need to go to court sometimes for this problem.<br>2. The young generation have huge problems. Even I have huge problems but they are uncommon and different one like bipolar disorder and etc. The young generation are obsessed with motorcycle especially the motorcycles shown in Bollywood movies. And they think themselves as Bollywood heroes. That is not a problem but the problem is the the things that they see in Bollywood movies and use in real life. An example. In a Bollywood movie I saw the protagonist trying to burn his body with gasoline ( don&#39;t remember how and why but he did it because he didn&#39;t get what he wanted ). This is a true story. I know a teenager who is 17 I think. Who tried to do the same thing. He is trying to burn his body with gasoline because his dad didn&#39;t get him his dream motorcycle with will cost and estimated 4000 - 5000 dollars. So he tried burning himself and his motorcycle ( witch was not his dream motorcycle ) but his father tried to stop him but got a kick in the chest bone and it broke. After that his father brought the motorcycle he wanted by giving his house to a pawn shop ( you know the shop were you sell many kinds of things or keep things for money and get it back later ). After buying the motorcycle he went on an joy ride with his best friend and had accident. He didn&#39;t suffer any injuries ( really he didn&#39;t even need a tape ). But his best friends nose completely broke and it seriously damaged his right eye and the Bones on his eye side. It is truly a miracle that he survived and told me about this accident and about his friend. Nearly 80% or more teenagers are obsessed with motorcycles.", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T03:26:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfadoc_", "comment_text": "Coronavirus is coming", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T02:08:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Realxy", "comment_text": "To all the Ethiopians watching this,  OHHH YA ETHIOPIA REPRESENT", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T01:47:37Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "R SouthAfrican", "comment_text": "The reasons are complicated and it is impossible to give a single answer here......

Like, why should anyone stick their finger in someone else&#39;s pie? It seemed implicit in passing that the colonial interventions in Africa made things worse, soooo why keep doing it? Why can&#39;t nations, cultures and people be allowed to figure it out on their own? Let things happen naturally. If Africa can&#39;t sustain 5B people, then it won&#39;t, if it can, it will. Why is it made to seem like more people born in Africa is bad on the face of it, or anywhere really? If we get too many people in any given place, things should naturally adjust. If Africa can&#39;t feed 5B people, then it won&#39;t happen. Sure maybe the idea of these charity drops of education, food, medicine and the like shared in this video seems noble...but it seems to have not really made any difference. Also I must stress how insideous it sounds to say that giving women education so that they won&#39;t have a family is. If that is the end goal of educating women, then your priorities are fucked up. You should want to get education to learn something, not shove it down another&#39;s throat to make them not want a family. Besides, you can have a family and go to school, wild idea I know.

Civil wars, government corruption, and the like don&#39;t explain the entirety of their situation. The same divergent evolution in humans that produced a variety of skin tones, eye shapes, hair textures, disease resistances, bone density, etc. also produced differences in the brain. There are bound to be differences in temperament, time preference, and intelligence.

There is an innate desire in all peoples to have things their way, to make their own destiny without a bunch of outsider busy-bodies telling them how to run their own affairs. An individual, and oftentimes even entire groups of people can decide that trading self-ownership for subservience, and some material gain is not worth it. Fortunately for the Subsaharan Africans, their lower average intelligence is not just a curse. In some cases it can be a boon. This will make it harder to sell them on antinatalism and other destructive &quot;big-brained&quot; ideas that have taken hold in other parts of the world.

It would be great if you could make a video on this topic. -Alex", "comment_date": "2019-12-18T03:49:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ste1fan1", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udd38Sub-Saharan region before colonization : Bunch of tribes with total population of 1milion<br>\ud83d\udd39Sub-Saharan region after colonization : Modern (but still poor) countries with total population of over 1bilion", "comment_date": "2019-12-18T03:36:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "gaymer", "comment_text": "Cl-Clippy?", "comment_date": "2019-12-18T03:34:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wow man 9999", "comment_text": "Isn&#39;t it a bit white supremacist to talk about ways to have less Africans in the world?", "comment_date": "2019-12-18T03:12:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jay F", "comment_text": "Who says &quot;development&quot; is what we need as humans?

Some people don&#39;t believe in it and instead become lazy and want everything for free without working. I am not trying to offend anyone, that is just my view from living in South Africa my whole life.<br><br>For example we have a lot of people who are not happy with the way our government leads our country , rightfully so. But then they just elect the same government party to lead , even though they only made things worse.<br>Others are also unhappy and expect it to change , but then they don&#39;t even go vote.<br><br>Back to education, we recently had a few strikes about education. Many people wanted new schools to be built and it is a good idea ,but  what do they do to show that they&#39;re unhappy about the current education status?<br>They burn down another 4 schools...<br><br>It&#39;s problems like these that make Africa the way it is today, people make rash decisions , uneducated decisions and suffer the consequences therefore.<br><br>Take for example the high birthrate - There are loads of informal settlements (plakkerskampe) here is ZA with a lot of people living in them. The easiest solution to get out of those settlements is to have a lot of children.<br>More children mean the chances are higher that at least one will succeed , get an education and make a living.<br><br>And even when that one succeeds , he/she has to care for their family (brothers ,sisters, parents, uncle) of at least 10 people or more. Making it impossible to achieve higher.<br><br>There are also people who own a large portion of the country , mainly farmers, who get murdered because of racism, lowering the amount of food the country can produce. <br><br>Something to add to racism , at least a quarter of the country&#39;s population want to murder eachother , because one race wants the other to give them back their land which was stolen (but actually bought) in colonial times and also go back to where they came from.<br><br>We also recently began having  something called &quot;load shedding&quot; , where we run without power for a few hours a day , because we put uneducated people at the lead of our power production, who made uneducated decisions and stole a massive amount of money from the country and in return cost it even more.<br><br>All of this applies to ZA , and might not apply to other African countries , many actually fight for their very existence because of poverty caused by the lack of education.<br><br>So to sum it up . The problem here in Africa is not stupid people it&#39;s the uneducated bad decisions , racism , corruption and horrible leaders caused by the lack of education.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T17:56:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Swann", "comment_text": "Whatever you pay your animators it isnt enough.

It is much more interesting to me to imagine a continent full of young educated people as the largest demographic. With modern technology it is totally feasible to educate the masses relatively inexpensively. I can imagine that feeding a large population would be tough, but not impossible. I have heard from some very smart sources, including African expats, that Africa doesn&#39;t have a food production issue it has a food distribution issue. In the video it frames the education of women as a means to an end instead of an end in itself.  Educate women because it is good in the now. Their children in turn, will be educated by them, and be good in the future. Even if the population growth rate doesn&#39;t decline in the predicted way, then very well because now there&#39;s a larger population of educated peoples. The utilitarian-esque view point that you have to maximize quality of life while also necessarily minimizing quantity of lives is silent on the very real possibility that you can maximize both to a point. Of course earth&#39;s resources are finite but it seems to me a little backwards to employ population control before attempting to optimize resource usages, including human resources. Basically, I&#39;m advocating for taking into account maximum population growth and planning to optimizing all those new people (aka new producers and consumers).

Appreciate the work you put on it.<br><br>Tyre continents of the would have showed time and again the same growth pattern. An initial population held back by limited economy focuses on a high birth rate for survival and growth. Eventually the economy stabilizes improving health and the living standards of the population. The ability to move from basic survival to triving lets the population turn to higher order needs like comfort and happiness which leads to reforms of older systems that were tolerated due to the need to survive. This eventually includes women who typically start out as..to be blunt..baby factories in the early days.<br><br> Better health leads to a baby boom as the large birth rate isn&#39;t countered by a large death rate. and more freedoms leads to the population choosing (or sadly being forced to) have less children.  The birth rate then drops. We&#39;re yet to see a country avoid this or reverse it even when the country tries to do so. <br><br>Colonization tended to add in infrastructure at the cost of freedom and economy. Thus countries that got the infrastructure and got out of colonization got to move on into jumpstarting their population trend.

Many things were similar to my home - the African people acted much like Canadian people, the cities looked very similar, many of their customs were similar. But one thing that was really shocking to me was the sexual culture.<br><br>Children became sexually active at strikingly young ages in Namibia. Some of the girls I talked to were only 10. It wasn&#39;t abnormal for 13-year-old girls to fall pregnant. When I spoke to these girls, it seemed as though sex was an expectation: &quot;I want to make my boyfriend happy, so we have sex.&quot; It was as if they feared their partners would leave them if they didn&#39;t become sexual. At the same time, awareness of contraception was not very high at all - a huge portion of the population had contracted and was dying from AIDS.<br><br>Many of these girls would have a child by 18 - for some, even more than one. The school drop-out rates were sky-high, especially for young girls. Graduating from elementary school was seen as a huge accomplishment for all genders. Rarely did any of the girls ever aspire towards a university education, and typically their life plan was to graduate from elementary, maybe attend high school, and then raise their children.<br><br>So, yes, overpopulation is a big problem in sub-Saharan Africa because it limits economical advancement and requires thin distribution of resources. But, we also need to recognize how overpopulation affects the youth - both boys and girls. Sure, overpopulation should be tackled for the sake of the countries&#39; economies, but it should especially be tackled so these young girls can have dreams outside of motherhood, so these young boys are raised in a culture that respects men and women equally.", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T16:48:10Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "LiquidOcelot1459", "comment_text": "Africa breeds em <br>Europe feeds em", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T16:46:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uc81c\ub85c\uc90c", "comment_text": "South Korea: We\u2019ve made it VERY WELL.

Music, sports and acting make no difference in the larger context and can be very well done without. <br><br>So how is it not scary that these people will be over 50% of the planet by the end of this century?", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T11:50:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmed BEN KHALIFA", "comment_text": "You should rather talk about Occupation in Africa ;)", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T11:48:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jenny GW", "comment_text": "Great video, very interesting and encouraging.", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T11:46:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sushrey", "comment_text": "To put all the sugar in this video to rest, Africa is still under psuedo-colonisation.

You blame colonial rule as one of the causes of Africa&#39;s continued high fertility and population growth in contrast to other continents. This is opposite to what the evidence shows. <br><br>The birthrate reduction and population growth slowdown has gone much better on the Indian subcontinent, where there was much longer colonial rule - 200 years, compared to 80 in subsaharan Africa. Also reduced much better in the Americas, where the societies were formed primarily by a colonial rule that started five hundred years ago and lasted 150-300 years; even in South America, it is down to basically replacement levels. The Arab  Islamic countries, where there was the least length or depth of colonial rule, has done second to worst, after subsaharan Africa, in reducing birthrates.

Prior to colonization and externally originating wars on the African continent, there was no such think as poverty. Yes there were entire regions living with very little, but they were not poor in the sense of suffering and sickness as they are now. Africa is in fact a very rich place, and it is well known that the majority of the worlds physical resources come from exactly this place. Then why is it still poor do you ask? Ask the post-coloneal/neo-coloneal powers who still have their grips over the African economy. Particularly West Africa.<br><br><br>As for the population of Africa growing, Africans like children. They love to marry, and love to see their families grow very large. That is the family plan. Feeding a large population is a matter of how much land they have access to, and the freedom to move among their own selves. You are completely correct in stating that the artificial borders instantiated by European colonialism has had absolutely zero benefit to the actual residents of the continent, and a massive benefit to those outside who made that sort of plan.<br><br><br>The very idea of overpopulation comes within the context of societies which are uncomfortable with large groups of persons around them. This is not the case with Africans and Indians and tropical regions. We like each other and are not afraid of a crowd. There is enough land space in these regions to supply everyone. What there will never be enough of is &quot;Government, Housing, Social Constructs&quot; and any other pretty control mechanisms coming from the great northern minds.

I am speaking from an outsider&#39;s perspective and only know so much about specific countries that exist in this region. But I would also point out another problem that stemmed from colonization is also tied to scientific advancements and religion. Spreading of religion and science is somewhat equivocated so a turn to viewing both as mysticism and colonialism is somewhat rampant. I remember on one visit to Nigeria, some people talked about witches as if they still existed. They also cling hard to some ideologies due to the pressure by the colonial times. One such practice in certain tribes is the view of people that are albino as having some form of luck and they might even slaughter them and proceed to eat them to gain their &quot;powers&quot;. But again this is not to say that these people are evil but just mentalities are just misplaced. This is also only of a specific tribe.

Before colonization, The Great Zimbabwe was the largest sub-Saharan structure ever built. That&#39;s the highest they achieved. Even after the discovery of the New World and the introduction of the cassava and other crops from the rest of the world, they still struggled to feed themselves. Even to this day! They perpetuate this cycle. Blaming anyone outside of Africa is no longer just ignorant at this point, it&#39;s an outright lie typically wielded to serve very specific political agendas. &quot;Africans are never responsible for themselves, they&#39;re poor victims of everything and everyone throughout all history.&quot; The reality is that we&#39;re not all equal any more than all varieties of any animal species is. The Africans struggle because they&#39;re the bottom of the human barrel. Shifting blame and making excuses to avoid the truth is precisely what builds actual racist resentment in the modern day.

The entire US population for example could fit in like, an area the size of new hampshire if that area was all about as dense as new york city. Resources like food and housing are largely built from renewable materials (give or take the limits of earth\u2019s ability to replenish its soil/trees/etc) so we don\u2019t actually have to be all that worried about running out of them. There\u2019s plenty to go around, the problem is in how it\u2019s distributed. <br>Look I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t the intention (or maybe it was idk) but it\u2019s extremely irresponsible to be pushing ideas like this, a lot of nazi and white supremacist ideology is rooted on false framings like overpopulation which can be debunked fairly easily as misunderstandings of what the earth and people are capable of. There aren\u2019t too many people and we\u2019re not anywhere close to wherever that limit would be if there even is one, which there may not be if we organized our resources well enough.

They introduced ultrasound machines that could determine the sex of the baby, but didn&#39;t use them for health reasons, they just scanned millions of poor peasants, and then they hung up posters prompting people to abort all female fetuses (often very violent words like &quot;if it&#39;s a girl, it doesn&#39;t matter if you have to beat it out, just get rid of it&quot;). This was massively effective because peasants in China marry off their girls to other families, so they always wish for boys becuase they need the help with their farming. Now they had a way to get rid of the girls, and of course the one-child policy only made it worse. China is still traumatized and have way way too many men.<br>So it&#39;s really important to be mindful, introducing ultrasound machines might sound nice, but if it&#39;s a culture were girls are a burden it&#39;s gonna lead to genocide. Contraceptives are useless without education, and vice versa.

I&#39;m not too sure about that... <br>While I totally agree that in some instances European powers did horroble things, like what Leopold of Belgium&#39;s private army did in Congo, though overall in most instances the colonization was, if not bloodless, kind of close to that, or at least without unnecessary atrocities, though I understand that this isn&#39;t a great way to summarize an extremely complex set of events that stretched through several centuries with several protagonists and in an area larger than Europe.<br>But what we can say seems fairly certain is what the data shows us: countries that have been colonized for the most time and most intensively, like South Africa and Equatorial Guinea, have had and have the largest and most stable economies, and, conversely, the opposite is true for countries like South Sudan, the D. R. of Congo and most other countries that are in the interior and thus were later contacted and that didn&#39;t manage to trasform themselves into a seemingly stable fiscal paradise like Rwanda, or countries like Mozambique, that had a communist revolution. <br>The thing is, it seems like many people there didn&#39;t and often still don&#39;t seem to share the values that we Westerners hold, that seem to be necessary to create a civilization that truly rises from the poverty typical of a pre industial nation, like individualism, democracy, capitalism... and while you could say that we could simply have left them alone, I&#39;m not sure they would have enjoyed it, and neither would we, as a bigger market is just better for everyone, as no, there is nothing that can point to the fact that had we left them alone, they would have developed like we did in an absolutely miraculous way, something that too many modern people take for granted, but it&#39;s much more probable that they would have stagnated like they always did and have done. <br>Does this make colonization ethical? I don&#39;t know, it depends on how you see it, I guess... <br>Did it make Africans worse off economically? Well, you could make a case for the ethnic tensions from within, but accondiscending to everyone&#39;s demands, nobody would be able to remember all these nations, for there are so many, and countries like Belgium and Luxembourg seem to be doing pretty well... thus, in general, no, if an African state crashed post independence the first cause you should point a finger to is, I&#39;d say, their corruption and their mistakes, and to me what has happened recently seems mostly like a watered down repetition of Africa&#39;s pre colonial history, from the Bantu expansion and tribal wars for slaves to Mugabe&#39;s Zimbabwe and the various civil wars. <br>Now, I know that not taking responsibilities is really tempting, not that that&#39;s what always happens, but those who look for scapegoats only create a rape and revenge narrative that is going to tear them apart in a climactic rise of genocidal hatred that has showed itself time and again in Nazi Germany just like before the Rwandan massacres.<br>Hope I have provided a not too simplified rant about a sentence in a video as I had nothing better to do being ill.

THe reason they aren&#39;t doing well is because of structural adjustment from the IMF and world bank.  Our world banks give loans to these poor countries for development projects to get a transnational corporation to invest in the country producing a product for western democracy consumers.  The workers in these countries get paid barely enough to eat and there are no environmental laws.  If a country that has taken loans wishes to spend more on healthcare or education they cannot.  Why?  Because of structural adjustment.  The IMF forbid under UN law to allow countries under development to manage their own spending.  We force them to privatize all segments of society.  Water no longer is free etc.  We create a capitalist society even the US and Europe would not tolerate.  All under the guise of developing these countries.  It&#39;s a scam and a lie to maintain NATO&#39;s power in the world.  With the USA running the entire show.  Who created the IMF and world bank?  The US.  Why?  They claimed to end world hunger and rebuild Europe after ww2.  What it turned into is a tool to make sure the US and other western european allies corporations make stupid amounts of money and defeat the commies during the cold war.

First of all the video was comparing Asian countries  (esp. Bangladesh) and Sub-saharan Africa, implying that the scale of population growth is somewhat comparable. This video failed to mention however, that SSA already went through a population increase outclassing any of the mentioned Asian countries. In Bangladesh for example, the population increased from 29M. in 1901 to 161M. in 2016 (increase of ~450%) whereas the population of Africa increased from 125M. in 1913 to 1321M. in 2018 (increase of &gt;900%). This population is then projected to increase further as mentioned in the video.<br><br><br>2. The role of colonialism and wars is used in this video to (partly) justify the different development of SSA in comparison to Asia. How exactly he justifies this is all but clear, since many of the Asian countries (including those he mentioned), were also colonized often to a far greater extent and for a much longer span of time (India, Bangladesh, the Philippines (video); Vietnam, Indonesia etc.) . Adding to that, countries like South Korea and Vietnam also went through crippling wars and still didn&#39;t end up like SSA. Then there is the argument of ethnic conflict in the often arbitrarily created colonial states. However many of the states in Asia also faced this problem (Indonesia, Malaysia, Indochina, the British Raj, the Philippines etc.).<br><br><br>3. The impact of reducing child mortality is used in this video as a reason for the decline of birthrates. While this may be true, this decline isn&#39;t the immidiate effect of it. The immidiate effect is a population boom , since more children survive until adulthood. The decline of birthrates, is then effect that can happen sooner or later and in the case of Africa it is clearly later. <br><br><br>4. Ignoring the aging population: While this video mentions that the population ages, it doesn&#39;t address the fact, that the population continues to grow, even if the fertility rate drops below replacement level.", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T16:56:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bunniebudget", "comment_text": "Eugenics Agenda 21 supported by Bill Gates.", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T16:55:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "QUAG", "comment_text": "When overpopulation in Africa is harder to explain than black holes...", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T16:55:48Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "TouchTheSky", "comment_text": "Just wanna say congrats to the level of beautiful animation that makes this content so great to watch all the time \u2665", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T16:55:48Z", "likes_count": 25}, {"comment_by": "JSUOAR", "comment_text": "More babies to suffer", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T16:55:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jade Orbigoso", "comment_text": "Thank for mentioning Philippines", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T16:55:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CMO Vlogs", "comment_text": "OK, so this is by far the worst video you&#39;ve produced Kurzgesagt coupled with such a sensitive topic, I would suggest this needs rework.

For example, if you&#39;ve seen the video where an female African student gets up during class and angrily proclaims about how teaching science is just another form of colonization I think you can see how that mindset is anything but positive. Again, nobody is defending the colonial era. A nation should be allowed to develop on it&#39;s own terms, but the idea that white people cause all of tbe problems in Africa in one way or another is absolute poison. I want Africa to succeed. I want it to be full of first world nations. I&#39;d rather an African&#39;s problem be obesity rather than starvation. We study history so we don&#39;t repeat the bad stuff, not to use it as an excuse or as a club with which to hit people we don&#39;t like.

This way you improve your kind.<br>example: There are birds here in The Netherlands that get a huge amount of children and then they all fly to Canada. Most of the time, less than a half of the birds survive the way to Canada, so they are stronger. This is so that they can improve themselves.<br>It would be normal for people that are in bad surroundings to bear more children, so that the best ones can improve the people of Africa. This is why most parents just get one or two children, while parents from the past got so much more! This is because these families now are in good and healthy surroundings, while in Africa, they don&#39;t have healthy water and enough resources, so they get more children so the best ones survive!<br><br>wow this is so long XD my bad", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T15:54:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nautical", "comment_text": "As a Bangladeshi with 2 siblings from 1990s and 2000s meanwhile my dad with 6 siblings and my mom with 5 siblings, that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMo3nZHVrZ4&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a> chart seems very applicable in my case lol.", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T15:54:14Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Farmer With A Shotgun", "comment_text": "The animation...<br><br><br><br>That&#39;s hot, that&#39;s hot", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T15:54:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Moore", "comment_text": "Doubling the population won&#39;t leave much room for elephants and lions and such...", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T15:53:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "immaZebrah", "comment_text": "hour long video? anyone got a problem with that? no? me either.", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T15:53:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kelly Nelson", "comment_text": "Nonsense", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T15:53:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Laros", "comment_text": "most of African people are careless about their children&#39;s future", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T15:53:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432", "comment_text": "lmao they have no food and they keep fricking", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T15:53:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "magnvss", "comment_text": "Another &quot;Thanos was right&quot; video?

In a wealthy country, where parents are expected to do things like pay for college, or at least try to help out, the difference between having a second kid and just having one is possibly more than $100,000 over the course of a lifetime, and households are likely never to increase their income from having a child, as the child moves out before contributing financially to the family.<br><br>The difference in wealth levels between the former European colonies in Africa and the former European colonies in Africa could be explained in part by property rights and free markets.

Imagine if Africa&#39;s population really did grow to the numbers speculated in the video. Let&#39;s be optimist and say that the population will reach around 2.6 billion. We&#39;ll ignore population growth in other countries and say that the world population reaches around 7.8+1.5=9.3 billion people. How do you think the global economy would work in this context? We are struggling to sustain a decent standard of living in the west. How do you think it&#39;ll be when there are an extra 1.5 billion people consuming resources on the planet. The standard of living has gone down in the past 2 generations in the west all the while countries like China are pumping toxic materials in the sea and air. If these countries reach a level of development and population similar to that of India or China they will most likely destroy the environment not only of Africa, but of the entire globe. Simply put, there are too many consumers on the planet. And no, it&#39;s not the west that&#39;s polluting, considering that a country like China which is well developed and contains about 17.7% of the world&#39;s population is responsible for 30% of carbon emissions worldwide. Countries like China, India, Bangladesh, etc. have no care for the environment and they will do as they please. The population of sub-Saharan Africa is perfectly fine as it is. Most cities there are already crowded enough and any more development would leave not enough land for food. Why should America or Europe be responsible for supplying an entire continent with food? Or taking in large numbers of immigrants who work for low pay which therefore leaves the native population unemployed? The best solution is to leave them alone.

I wouldn\u2019t exactly call having fresh drinking water, jobs and food suffering. I know you\u2019ve read up on all this but purposely twisted the truth and lied. Every place in Africa that Europeans built up became the only good places in Africa where people weren\u2019t starving. Zimbabwe was one of those areas. The white People built it up, educated the blacks but the Africans got angry because they thought they could run the same functioning society themselves so they killed, raped and tortured the whites. The system immediately collapsed and now they are begging white farmers to return so your point about them suffering under colonization is a flat out lie. They killed the white farmers who taught them to farm on a large scale. After the white farmers were killed instead of farming the land themselves the Africans tore the tractors apart and sold them for scrap metal lol. Of course they all started starving which is karma I guess and really showed them their place in this world and was a very low IQ move. We see the same thing happening in the west were blacks have grown complacent thinking whites are standing in their way of greatness even though they\u2019ve never proven they can run a functioning country let alone a small city on their own. Blacks born in white areas are 100 times better off than when they are born into areas where blacks are the majority yet they still believe they suffer and this is all over the world. Blacks have a better standard of living in a prison than they do living free in societies in Africa that they control. Think about that. People can\u2019t name on place where blacks are the majority and things are also good yet they still believe it\u2019s whites holding them back. White people seriously need to cut ties with blacks. Africans are a lost cause. Studies after studies have shown the average African American IQ is 83 and the average African IQ is 65. So there\u2019s your problem, and it\u2019s a problem money can\u2019t fix. Africa will never get better. It\u2019s easier to build a nation today than any other time in history yet they can\u2019t do it. White people had better functioning societies hundreds of years ago than Africans do now and Africans even have the benefit of using white inventions to build it. Whites built societies from nothing and had to use trial and error to protect it yet blacks can\u2019t even copy it. Natural selection will take care of over population. If a race can\u2019t even take care of themselves what\u2019s the point of nature allowing billions of them to reproduce. It seems like a disaster waiting to happen. If they don\u2019t have the IQ to cure diseases like Ebola maybe other people shouldn\u2019t be curing it for them. I think we should just let what happens happen instead of spending billions on a people who are ungrateful and jealous. Let them show us how great they are and let\u2019s leave them alone.", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T14:23:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheArbiter", "comment_text": "the video &quot;How geography doomed Africa&quot; might also be worth a look if you found this interesting", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T14:23:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isaac Myers", "comment_text": "I bet that if we mathematically spread the global population around evenly, in a mathematical way, we would feel alone at those distances.

Many old Africans desire back to the time of colonization because there was more stabile government, less corruption and better security.<br>Also the average IQ of Africans is 75, which makes it more difficult to increase the education level.<br>I am not for colonization and it did also had bad things (but mainly long ago) but a fact is that it did gave the African nations a better starting point compared to where they would have been without.

For example, Popular Republic of Congo (the smaller one) has a population of roughly 5 million people while being 342000 km^2, making it having a density of population of 15 inhabitants per km^2, which is extremely low !

Why are we making videos like this? This topic was a nightmare. How do you talk about a continent as diverse as Africa, to explain larger trends? Not only is there a wide variety of sources, experts disagree with each other on what they can predict about the future. So the time we took to rewrite this script over and over was insane. <br><br><br>Still, there is no chance this video won\u2019t make people angry, on all sides of this issue. Some may not agree with the conclusions we have come to. Some will think there are other aspects we could and should have mentioned. Or lament that we generalized too much. <br><br><br>But we had to generalize or this video would just have become a hour-long documentary. And we think the topic is too important to not discuss it.<br><br><br>So we read a lot and talked too many experts with very different opinions and interpretations. Also we tried to prepare our sources in a way that walks you through our thought process and helps you to make up your own mind.<br><br><br>This video was sponsored by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation as part of a Grant.
