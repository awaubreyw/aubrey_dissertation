As I got older, It is now obvious to me that this isn\u2019t true. Bees sting in self defense, and in doing so, often kill themselves. Recently, there has been so much buzz around the mass death of them. But many of us don\u2019t know why. Colony Collapse Disorder [CCD] is the destruction of bee colonies, through the bee workers abandoning bee hives and queens. This loss in bees is affecting agriculture, and the ecosystem. There are many culprits to this issue but we must find a solution quick. The truth is that we need bees, and we must protect and help them.\r<br>       <br>        Bees experience physical stress and sickness just like humans. Humans have dealt with and are currently dealing with illnesses. Bees are no different. The pollution that we produce is affecting bees as well. The list of suspects has \u201c...included viruses, such as the Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV); parasites, such as Varroa mites; insecticides; and even radiation-emitting cell phones\u201d (K. Poltorak). Things that harm us, harm bees and vice versa. Since bees experience physical pain like all living creatures, that means that if bees suffer, we will be soon to follow next. When researchers examined the bees in polluted areas, \u201c[t]heir exoskeletons were covered with particles of pollution\u2026  it was rich in heavy metal pollutants such as arsenic and lead, which are as toxic for insects as they are for humans\u201d (A. Hitchings). The exoskeletons of bees were more roughed and damaged compared to samples from non-polluted zones. This could be one of the causes for abnormal bee death, which is what leads to lower populations in Bee hives. Therefore, contributing to CCD. We must establish methods of stopping or reversing these harmful conditions affecting bees. By protecting bees, we are protecting ourselves. Our food and resources are all dependent on bees, and without them, chaos would ensue. \r<br>        <br>        Agricultural crops are killing bees. The human made pesticides that lurk in between the\r crop foliage is a major culprit. Humans are constantly spraying all kinds of chemicals on produce to keep them from being eaten by insects and pests. One of these being a branch of insecticide known as the Neonicotinoids. This pesticide kills harmful insects but along with it go all insects, including the good ones like bees. Through many studies, \u201c[t]he researchers came to the conclusion that the bees\u2026 prefer neonicotinoid-laced solutions\u2026 because the chemicals act on the bees&#39; brains\u2026 even when consuming the chemicals means the bees are more likely to die\u201d (L. Rieder). So this chemical not only kills bees, but also has an addiction principle added to it. Whenever bees go to pollinate our crops, we have these pesticides waiting for them. When they absorb these chemicals, they won\u2019t just do so and leave. They are likely to come back to these insecticides again raising their chances of death even more. This deadly cycle dwindles bee populations even more, increasing the spread of Colony Collapse Disorder. Without a form of pollination, these plants will suffer. If it kills bees, then without bee pollination, crop amounts will go down drastically, harming ourselves in the long run. <br><br>        <br>        Bees are integrated into multiple ecosystems. Without bees, other species would struggle to survive. Different animals rely on certain plants for food, and humans are no exception. We rely on them to \u201cpollinate 90 fruit, vegetable, spice, and nut crops. Apples, almonds, and allspice\u2026 \u201d (A. Hitchings). These are just to name the plants that humans have a common use for. Many of these plants and herbs are used to not only sustain our farm animals but wild animals as well. This goes up the food chain. For example, if deer eat blackberries and suddenly the quantity of berries goes down, then there will be less deer. If wolves primarily hunt deer, then there will be less deer for them to hunt, and the wolves will struggle as well. If bees stop pollinating even a group of herbs, then the effect will spread up all the way to the apex predator. Stopping CCD becomes a must to help save the environment, and ourselves from extinction. \r<br>        <br>        When I was a child, I visited a farm as a school field trip. That day I visited many bee hives and learned so much about bees. I saw all the farm animals and learned that these animals depend on the bees. From that day I overcame my fear of bees and learned to appreciate them. Bees do not only make honey. They pollinate crops for all the fruits and veggies we eat. Even farm animals eat part of those crops to produce the meat that many of us consume. We owe it to save them. To help bees and the environment, you can take simple steps. Do not litter, waste of any kind, is harmful. Instead of taking a car for close distance travel, walk there, or go on a bike ride for change. Also buying locally grown foods directly supports bees. Foods exported from a distance create more vehicle pollution, which can sicken and kill bees. Bees hold so much weight on their tiny little wings. If bees go, many species including humans will be soon to follow.", "comment_date": "2021-10-24T23:16:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Almondwater", "comment_text": "Ummm that\u2019s not true honey bees are not really native here and plus there\u2019s like 6000 bees out there right now who can get the job done the honey bees are the reason why the rest of the bees are dying out so please do some research on that before you go on and explain why the honey is \u2018important\u2019 because they are really not if the bees die off the other insects and other \u2018bees\u2019 out there can get the job done also sorry for being mean here it\u2019s a great video but it ticks me off becuase bees are not really important they are better off dead", "comment_date": "2021-10-23T16:22:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bruh", "comment_text": "Bees should save themselves too from not stinging humans", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T13:43:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jahus", "comment_text": "French channel, please!!

I think you all should do another video on bees, cause this one is not necessarily inaccurate, but does not address how important native bees are.

So, the notion that just honey bees contribute to 1/3 of food is disingenuous...native bees contribute heavily to soybean crops and many others. Love the work!

Like, I hate to break it to people but, and this is for Americans especially, honeybees ain\u2019t as important as wasps.<br>All the work a bee does? It\u2019d be for naught if it weren\u2019t for the organized murder wasps and hornets commit upon pest insects such as aphids, caterpillars, and for larger species of wasp even things like cicadas are on the menu, like how honeybees are mainly very good at pollinating due to their large hives, vespid hymenopterans are good at insectivory and even scavenging because they can hunt a large amount of prey over a large amount of land at once. This isn\u2019t even going into how wasps also dabble in the pollination business as well by drinking nectar and, indeed, getting covered with pollen.<br>The main reason I\u2019ve singled out American protection of honeybees is because of one simple fact:<br>They don\u2019t belong here, straight up<br>And before you say \u201cwell they haven\u2019t hurt the ecosystem in any way\u201d they very much have, they outcompete native species for nesting space (which is considered a factor in the demise of the Carolina parakeet even) and their hives practically breed insect diseases, which honeybees leave all over whatever they pollinate for the next sucker to pick up and die from. Most native plants do not even like honeybee pollination and the pollinators they did rely on such as bumblebees and carpenter bees are in decline, though other factors are involved the sudden widespread hymenopteran diseases are definitely a part of it. In fact, when people first said \u201csave the bees\u201d they hadn\u2019t even meant honeybees! Saving the bees was supposed to be directed at the many endangered solitary bees! Many of which are dying out due to competition from honeybees themselves! While Europe is less so to blame for liking honeybees due to the fact they really are native to there, the native wasps in Europe are also still important for keeping pest populations at acceptable levels.<br>Not to very much mention the recent murder hornet craze in America is also a reason to blame people because the reason very much boils down to people wanting something to let frustration out on + pre-existing wasp hate with a dash of honeybee-biased \u201csave the bees\u201d as well. Unfortunately the actual murder hornets within North America hadn\u2019t even reached the East coast and people were already smashing any large insect that didn\u2019t even look like a hornet.<br><br>In short, while honeybees disappearing may very much be a large issue considering the reliance on honeybee crops, the threat to them is a little over-hyped and their presence in North America is detrimental to the ecosystem outside of captive hives.

Must be terrifying to live in such fearful ignorance.<br><br>The truth is, commercial honey operations use methods that are stressful on bees, and make them more vulnerable to all the things described here. Left to their own devices, or cared for with less-invasive methods, bees do just fine.<br><br>Funny that DDT gets mentioned here, since it was only replaced with something allegedly worse based on fraudulent science from environmental activists causing hysteria over another extinction hoax. Rachel Carson&#39;s book that led to the DDT ban has been completely debunked, and even science at the time refuted all of her outlandish apocalyptic claims.<br><br>DDT saved half a billion lives from malaria in just a couple decades of use. It was safe for humans and the environment, but environmental hysteria forced development of alternatives, which the same environmentalists are now claiming, falsely, will lead to another mass extinction event, and put hundreds of millions of lives at risk from disease and starvation. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Environmentalists will not be happy until humans are extinct, or at least living in the stone age and at much lower population numbers.<br><br>Signed,<br>An Actual Beekeeper<br><br>P.S. I&#39;m no fan of commercial monoculture farming, and I actually own and run what you&#39;d probably call an organic farm (although the label is meaningless and I don&#39;t use it myself nor does any farmer I respect). There&#39;s plenty to criticize about modern agriculture practices. Using fearmongering and lies to push your agenda doesn&#39;t help anyone, though, and it completely destroys your credibility. People become numb to your apocalyptic predictions after you&#39;ve cried wolf enough times.<br><br>I like to lead by example, to develop and demonstrate actual viable alternatives that prove you can feed the world with some clever human planning and ecologically-sound practices. Ultimately it is the free market that will achieve the sort of ecological balance environmentalists <b>claim</b> to want to have, and do so without forcing humans to die off themselves, or to accept primitive living standards. I make a very nice income without the use of artificial pesticides, and feed a lot of people very good healthy food with my land. What it takes is some careful planning, human brainpower, and quite frankly a minimum of government intervention so I have the ability to experiment freely. When you start mandating things, however noble your intentions, you destroy the creative process that allows for better solutions to come along.

They take pollen from plants and keep others down while others leave pollen for others. Ants, beetles, butterflies, moths and native bees are pollinators too. When the honey bee came to America with the english was America deprived of plants and vegetation? No! They literally keep the  other pollinators down buy letting them have less opspring.

Honeybees aren&#39;t native to America. They are an invasive species that were smuggled (if that&#39;s the right term) into America in 1622, not because of their ability to pollinate, but their ability to make honey. This means that nature is more than capable of stabilizing and even flourishing without bees. Also there are already organisms to pollinate plants for people. It&#39;s just sometimes, you won&#39;t see too many of them because they crowd out all the other local pollinators. They even kill them by spilling pathogens on them. So in conclusion, we don&#39;t really need bees. Bonus argument: I didn&#39;t use this because this usually happens due to people being foolish. Also some people are allergic to bees.

Also, while in some areas honey bees have taken over the niches of wild solitary bees, there are also examples of harmonious coexistence - in Panama for example both some of the local orchid bees and Africanized honey bees pollinate the same flowers, but instead of this having led to competition it has resulted in the local flora reproducing more than ever and in population increases for both wild and honey bees!

The best part, however, is that wasps can solve a few of the problems affecting bees. Their larvae don&#39;t eat honey. Instead, adult wasps capture and kill several bugs to feed larvae, including aphids, caterpillars, and other garden pests; as well as mosquitos, certain mites and othe parasites. They increase the available nectar, and they decrease the number of parasites and the need for pesticides that kill bees. And paper wasps are chill and prefer to keep to themselves. Unlike bees, wasps don&#39;t form huge armies. They&#39;re pretty relaxed, and only one or two workers go out at a time. This means that they are unlikely to fight with bees.

Most of you must know this thing. First of all pollination is a process by which pollen grains from another of a flower is attached to stigma of another or the same flower by the action of air or animals. The whole process of pollination and reproduction of flower ~<br><br>The anther of a flower contains tiny particals called pollen grains inside them. When these pollen grains come out of anther, these pollen grains stick to stigma of the same plant or another plant by the action of air or animal. Let&#39;s take an example of bees. Bees sit of flower to suck nectar. At this time, the pollen grains stick to their legs and fall into another flower&#39;s stigma or the same one. The pollen grains make a narrow pasage through style to reach the ovule which is present inside ovary. The ovule and pollen grains together form zygote. The ovule becomes the seed and the ovary becomes the fruit. This is the whole process of reproduction and pollination. Thank you for reading this......

Monsanto&#39;s GMO seeds have five times the neonicotinoids normally acquired by spraying, built right into them. They were, of course, tested safe for bees, but the research was not long term enough to discover that the honey made from these crops, while not sufficiently poisonous to kill the bees directly, sterilized drones.<br><br>The majority of colony collapses in the US observe a pattern, not where the hive is slowly weakened by neonicotinoids and parasites, but instead where there is a sudden collapse, caused by a lack of fertile drones, leading to the absence of a fertilized queen.<br><br>While GMOs, even under the current population levels, are a requirement for continued human survival,  allowing the patenting of genes leads to crooked business practice such as this, where the companies have a profit motive to dismantle regulatory bodies, risking catastrophic environmental damage and the integrity of the food supply itself. If gene patenting were illegal, the only research profit motive remaining would be the desire to increase crop yields, and since only the agricultural industry itself would fund that, it&#39;d be much more hesitant to prematurely apply changes to its own product that may, in the long run, destroy it. Unlike Monsanto, which does not rely directly on the product they are altering, they couldn&#39;t take the money and run in case of such disasters.

In many places of the world European honeybee is an exotic and invasive species, their importance to humans doesn&#39;t change the fact that they can wreck environmental havoc on native species (out competing them for food, spreading disease etc.).

If they loose half of there colonies, they just replace them with new ones. And this is pretty easy, things like splitting a hive can accomplish it, somethings they have to buy packaged bees.

Talking about neonics and pesticides with respect to CCD is really opening a can of worms.  Any sane person can probably reach the relatively safe conclusion that pesticides in general are not healthy for bees, and neonics are certainly no exception to that general maxim, but reaching any conclusion more specific than the vague notion that they apply some amount of negative pressure to bee populations is dangerous.  Unfortunately, this is a subject that has been infected with bad science from one very specific and particular individual - Chengsheng Lu of Harvard University.  Without getting too far into the weeds, suffice it to say that Lu is a dedicated ideologue who has spent his entire career carrying out motivated, activist science (and those two words are bad when you put them together - science needs to be conducted from a point of objectivity - &quot;what is happening that explains this observation?&quot; - and not from one of advocacy - &quot;this observation is clear evidence that XXXX is happening!&quot;) in some sort of bizarre personal jihad against non-organic pesticides.  He&#39;s a crank with a megaphone and his insistence on charging out to the front of the crowd and cheerleading this particular subject is damaging in basically every conceivable way.<br><br>The complicating factor here is that pesticides are necessary, full stop.  Without pesticides, we can&#39;t have agriculture on the scale that we need to feed people.  It&#39;s just not possible.  The question we have to at least try to answer is how far we can relax our pesticide usage - a discussion that Lu is not helping, and neither is the alarmism in this video.  Bees are insects, insects are pests, and agriculture on a scale capable of feeding seven billion people requires the elimination of pests.  Bees WILL get caught in the crossfire to some extent.  Changing from neonics to something else is not terribly likely to help them in the long term - whatever substance we settle on will still be deleterious to bees to some extent.  Let&#39;s not pretend that the rise of neonics in the market is the result of some shadowy conspiracy of a bunch of weirdos in suits who just hate bees - they&#39;re used as widely as they are because they&#39;re cheap and effective.<br><br>Un/Fortunately, CCD is almost certainly not A thing.  That&#39;s not the way that extinction pressure seems to work in nature, so far as we are able to observe.  Parasites certainly play a substantial role and there&#39;s little reason to believe that we would lose anything by destroying them, so fighting those should probably be first on the agenda.  Finding an alternative pesticide that&#39;s less deleterious to bees (or making the bees less vulnerable to the pesticide) is another area where there&#39;s stuff we can do.  Most likely we&#39;re going to have to do all of those things to make any sort of a difference.", "comment_date": "2017-04-14T01:32:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kenzerbolt", "comment_text": "but... teh beez", "comment_date": "2017-04-13T23:26:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zach Little", "comment_text": "I&#39;m gonna kill myself srew life", "comment_date": "2017-04-13T22:53:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JurisKankalis", "comment_text": "great vid. and a terrible process. thanks for spreading the word!", "comment_date": "2017-04-13T19:11:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rachel Hughes", "comment_text": "so what about all the other forms of pollination aside from bees?", "comment_date": "2017-04-13T13:46:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "climate engineering is killing the eco system", "comment_text": "chemtrails killing bees. these sun dimming programs called SRM geoengineering (solar radiation mgt or climate engineering) is very real. and less sunlight means more mold and bacteria", "comment_date": "2017-04-11T16:08:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Themanofnovideos", "comment_text": "what if we just changed bees and made them immune to pesticides??????", "comment_date": "2017-04-11T14:10:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HailSatanxox", "comment_text": "O_O", "comment_date": "2017-04-11T09:47:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Genisay", "comment_text": "Our poor bees.

The pesticides, economic zoning and monocular were meant to increase productivity, and I&#39;m sure they did for a while, however this leads to highly increased concentrations of pesticides in these zones, which then leads to what is becoming dead zones. Funny enough the quest for maximum productivity will soon produce no food at all.<br><br>People need to stop worshiping money, we do not need it as much as we need food, and for that we need bees. Bees&gt;Money.<br><br>The modern systems are wrong on so many lvls, what we really need to return to is the style of sporadically placed farms found in &quot;under developed&quot; countries due to no economic regions at all, however in lieu of that, we could possibly go to the organic style of pesticide free farming found in France and Russia, where the bumble bees are common, and the earth yields more per acre than the poisoned ground of the US.<br><br>I believe the parasites are a bit of a red herring, the theory I find most credible is the one where the bees who go out to get the nectar for the honey are killed before they return, lesser number do return, but do not keep up with the hive production, so a larger number of embryos will die do to disease because that stage of the hive will be very slow in production, leaving the embryos exposed to parasites for much longer periods of time. With an ever diminishing number of workers collecting nectar, inevitable it spells the end of the hive.<br><br>The whole GMO, Monsanto business model is going to wipe most of us out if we let it persist. Since I get no economic gains from their existence, I hope very much they go away very very quickly. The poison on much of the earths farmland is now due to their poisons unable to grow any other plants, and the yields of the existing plants is diminishing. How deep does the poison go now? We might be able to dig it up, turn the soil and start planting normal again, but for how long ?

Honeybees are a big business in the USA but they&#39;re also <b>invasive</b> to North America. Their existence threatens the existence of native pollinators and even of native plant species. <br>&quot;one out of three meals eaten by humans is made possible by honeybees&quot; <br>that&#39;s frankly false. One out of every three meals eaten by humans is made possible by <b>POLLINATORS</b> but honeybees are not the only pollinator and are in fact unable to pollinate many plants native to North America. Many native North American plants require buzz pollination which honeybees can&#39;t do. Bumblebees can. Bumblebees have less to eat with all these European honeybees going around stealing their food. There are many non-honeybee pollinators includes other bees, wasps, ants, beetles, moths, and even some birds. Furthermore, crop yields are better from human pollination than they are from honeybee pollination.<br><br>The reason we all hear all this nonsense about saving honeybees in the US is because it&#39;s a fifteen BILLION dollar industry. Companies like Monsanto ship honeybees around the country charging for their services and then harvesting and selling the honey that results. Even liberal estimates put only 15% of honeybees in the US being wild while the rest are owned and shipped around like that. <br><br>In conclusion: screw the honeybee (in the US). It&#39;s just greedy companies trying to hire bee labor because it&#39;s cheaper than human labor and produces honey.

Saturn used to rule this earth in ancient times and with it&#39;s Birkeland current (Jacob&#39;s Ladder in the Bible) it enveloped the earth.

Saturn has been destroyed and that happened about the same time of the bee die off, also the same time as chemtrails started showing up in the skies. It keep the earth locked in linear time and the worship of Saturn as it is pointed out many times was forbidden of God. When God became so enraged, he put a curse on the inhabitants of earth to be locked in to the linear time as also pointed out in the Holy book. GMO&#39;s have been planned for a long time as well as the chemtrails and the LHC at Cern Switzerland. Those &quot;priests&quot; that studied the Bible for years and years know the secrets and know how to decrypt the encoded messages in the Bible. When it is said to put the old wine into a new vessel or put on the new man as nothing of the old goes forward, it states that for a reason as we are all locked into the Saturn machine of old. We are all corrupt because we were living in the Saturn matrix and nothing or nobody will go forward into the new that is of Saturn or worships Saturn. That was the ritual that was done at the twin tower collapse in Manhattan, the death of Osama bin Laden and the building of the New world trade center in Manhattan, the new world airport in Denver etc. The old covenant that was made to make America the most richest and powerful of nations was the done by the high ranking freemasons like Washington. They had been planning the destruction of the towers for many years as they knew in Revelation\u00a010 \u00a0in the Bible that there &quot;would be time no more&quot;. What did Obama say in a speech years ago??? YOU FOLKS HAVEN&#39;T BEEN READING THE BIBLE!!! Everything that is going on right now with the large hadron collider at Cern, Switzerland and the quantum computer, the switch over to digital from analog, the introduction of RFID chips, smart meters, mass video surveillance, cell phone towers everywhere GMO&#39;s,\u00a0and chemtrails\u00a0is all the result of what happened to Saturn\u00a0and the capstone being placed on their NWO.

And it&#39;s hardly an open and shut case as to why this happens...(Which means CCD probably accounted for WAY LESS of the die off than the mite losses did, which spiked in 04, before CCD was a thing). <br><br><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-entine/post_8761_b_6323626.html\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-entine/post_8761_b_6323626.html</a><br><br>Plenty of research, NOT funded by the chemical companies, pokes holes in blaming it on pesticides. The fact is, globally, bees are still on the rise; the presence of CCD in the U.S. and the EU could actually be because a combination of the new mite, with us using bees more thanks to a larger crop industry (Adding stress to their environment) combined with the extra viral and bacterial agents introduced by the new mite.<br><br>I&#39;m actually really surprised you glossed over the mite as &quot;something they could handle!&quot; Listen, in the end, I don&#39;t know if the pesticides are contributing the CCD--what I do know is 1.) This isn&#39;t as dire as it sounds, population levels have been increasing slowly for the last decade. Yes it&#39;s a problem, but life as we know it is not in danger any time soon, the EPA and other environmental agencies are conducting long term studies for a reason, we shouldn&#39;t panic and make dumb choices. 2.) This video really attempts to pin point the problem, when in fact no one really knows yet. And this isn&#39;t some global warming denliasm or something--many scientists and even environmental agencies are hotly debating this (But I did like the intimation that anyone who disagrees is an agent of the evil chemical companies--you know, because it&#39;s not a rational concern that the lab tests which &quot;prove&quot; the pesticide is a problem required the bees to be freaking doused with it, while in a field setting the PPM they&#39;d be exposed to would be MUCH MUCH lower. Nooo, you&#39;d have to work for those companies to think that--lol)<br><br>Politics and sensationalism in a complex issue like this can be...bad. For example, Europe is still having CCD happen, despite banning the product in question. And this year they are looking at 20% lower yields on crops, which can have a disastrous effect on humans--despite the fact that their bee populations had been level for a freaking decade before deciding to ban this substance. (IE illustrating this was a political, not rational choice.)", "comment_date": "2015-07-12T23:00:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simak Santana", "comment_text": "i just see a lot more butterflys and my flowers are fine", "comment_date": "2015-07-12T22:20:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kris Martin", "comment_text": "No, I am kinda freaking out.

Most bee ecologists I have read seem to doubt the claim that neonics are to blame. More often than not they will say that it MAY be a contributing FACTOR, not that it is the cause.<br>Perhaps it would be wise to not comment on something so complicated if you aren&#39;t a bee ecologist or are not equipped to critically review all of the data on this. \u00a0I understand the importance of informing people and compelling them to take action, but if you are wrong you are needlessly burdening the regulatory systems and further discrediting any serious environmental protection movement.<br>It is like crying wolf. \u00a0Every time the public gets outraged about something based on little information and the public is wrong, people have good reason to doubt environmental movements in general. \u00a0Do you think climate change denial would be possible if it weren&#39;t for environmental activists having been demonstrably wrong so often in the past?<br>Before you comment, here are a few points I have to make to avoid the predictable:<br>1.

Beekeepers use manmade honeycomb as a foundation for their honey bee hives. The honeycomb pattern is too big for the bees. A bigger cell produces a bigger bee. If a bee grows up in a larger cell, it&#39;s trachea and thorax are larger. If it&#39;s trachea is too big, acarpis becomes a problem. If it&#39;s thorax is too big, female egg-laying varroa mites have an opportunity to hide between the wings where the bee can&#39;t shake them off. Bees are smart enough to shake varroa off outside the hive, but they can&#39;t if the bee is too big. Also, when the cell is too big, varroa mites thrive off of excess body mass the bee-larva develops because of the excess food in it&#39;s surroundings as it grows. To add insult to injury, there are many insecticides used in beekeeping that have insecticide contaminated the wax. Never buy wax from countries where these insecticides are still legal. (USA) And especially don&#39;t use manmade foundatation honeycomb made from it.<br>-Stop buying package bees and queens from overseas. Instead, breed your own queens. Beekeepers buy queens from overseas instead of raising their own. These queens are usually inbred because breeders tend to cull queens. It also means that the bees may not survive a winter in the new climate. They aren&#39;t bred to be good at adapting to new climates, they&#39;re bred for honey production local to the place where they were bred.<br>-Stop using queen excluders. Beekeepers use what&#39;s called a &quot;Queen Excluder&quot; in their hives. When honeybees climb through these, their wings get shredded up over time. A bee \u00a0with prematurely shredded wings prematurely dies.<br>-Let them have flowers. It&#39;s a food desert out there. Many farmers mow around their fields without consideration for the bees. Sometimes farming communities mow everything at the same time. That&#39;s bad too. Bees need the nectar from the wildflowers in the ditches and fields, so don&#39;t mow them.<br>-Give them mycelium. There are fewer and fewer sources of mycelium available to bees because of deforestation and our need for lumber. Mycelium is health food for bees. It boosts their immune systems and is a preventative for viral infections and chemical contamination. If you lived off of just veggies and no fungi or meat, you&#39;d be lethargic too. Bees need edible mushrooms and mycelium in their diets like they have in nature.<br>-Stop using neonics.
