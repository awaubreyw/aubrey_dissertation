As well as this, more land concerned means having to adapt to the climate, and that means more genetic diversity.

The split in loyalty could leave them vulnerable to Invicta once again.<br>If Europe and Japan fall, that would be catastrophic.

When we came back about 45 mins later there was a covering of dead ants on our whole job site like a layer of black and red hail stones but no clue who won or what area they were even fighting over. It made us think that was probably how animal populations felt whenever they find themselves in a battle zone of ours..........they just leave and come back when the fighters are done killing each other and just hope you can pick back up where you left off.

Once all outposts are captured, they can attack the main base where one player can become the Queen who has special abilites and more health.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

They will consume your body and you will be converted to millions of fire ants.", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T16:12:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jan Harvey Gomez", "comment_text": "Plot Twist: Chimera Ants Exist", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T14:14:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shoyo Hinata", "comment_text": "Is this Hunter x Hunter&#39;s chimera ants?", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T13:14:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u2022 Jasa \u2022", "comment_text": "This would be an intresting video game tho", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T11:39:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "oyens", "comment_text": "Imagine if they evolve and they have a hive mind and can communicate worldwide", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T09:48:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Milk", "comment_text": "I love ants \u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T05:21:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uc5d8\ub9ac\uc2dc\uc544", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know why this ants fightings are more interested than the human&#39;s.", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T04:09:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zion Seng", "comment_text": "I only have lame black ants with no special stingers or anything like that ):", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T02:23:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433", "comment_text": "ants:in a few million years we will take over the world <br><br><br>rising water levels: no", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T02:08:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rce", "comment_text": "westcoast ants lmao", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T01:17:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheRocketSlime", "comment_text": "The answer is simple we need to breed an army of ant eaters and let them loose upon the world", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T23:30:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Where's the Freedom?", "comment_text": "We need to mass-breed anteaters", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T22:11:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Big Shahzaib", "comment_text": "The most deadliest thing is phages they are billions of them on us right now and millions on our eyes are literally everywhere were Life forms exist they kill bacteria and their number is Larger than all other lifeforms combined including bacteria.", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T20:44:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Devashish Pardesi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqECNYmM23A&amp;t=5m30s\">5:30</a> reminded me of the honey badger.<br>Argentine ants don&#39;t care, argentine ants don&#39;t give a shit.", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T20:24:37Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "ChillMac", "comment_text": "The ants when they go back to their homeland. \u201cRemember me?\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T18:37:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Michell Palacios", "comment_text": "BATTLEFIELD: MODERN WARFARE ANTS", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T17:32:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Santino Grosz", "comment_text": "I&#39;m proud of the ants of My nation.", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T17:11:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Iffah Nurdian", "comment_text": "My exact reason why my garden and front is paved", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T16:52:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AlexCapDeFier", "comment_text": "I want a game like this", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T12:59:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unity Step By Step", "comment_text": "i love your vidios they are insparonatiol", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T11:44:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Matias Terradas", "comment_text": "Well, finally argentina is first in something", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T05:18:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eatornator3000", "comment_text": "kurzgesgat 2019: &quot;ants are more numerous and landscapechanging than humans&quot;<br><br>kursgesgat 2020: &quot;to ants, we are so complex and powerful, we may as well be gods&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T01:36:18Z", "likes_count": 88}, {"comment_by": "Nicole", "comment_text": "I just imagine all this intense war happening while there&#39;s just that random kid with a magnifying glass burning them for fun", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T01:10:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nick Martin", "comment_text": "I&#39;m dying to see more ant videos from you guys.", "comment_date": "2020-08-21T21:21:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drum-ma$ta\u706b\u4e8b", "comment_text": "Bro, we need a netflix series about ant wars.", "comment_date": "2020-08-21T17:40:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dalmatiaball", "comment_text": "ngl thats epic", "comment_date": "2020-08-21T17:23:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xenqii", "comment_text": "when&#39;s the any history test again? i really liked this revision rest ^_^", "comment_date": "2020-08-21T16:31:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SCARRIOR", "comment_text": "Pfft and they say Humans are the only racists.

Even as a little kid I could see the Argentine ants slowly taking over and I hated it because I found them so uninteresting and whenever I saw them doing battle with other ants, I would always help the other ants, lol. Regardless of my help, in a mater of a few years all you saw were Argentine ants and it&#39;s basically been like that up until about 5 or 6 years ago. Now the indigenous fire ants are making a big comeback and I actually see more of them than Argentine ants where I live. It used to be whenever there were ants in the house, they were always Argentine ants, but for the first time, now any ants we get in the house are what I call micro ants.

Backyard: Argentine ants have been there for years, as long as I can remember. <br>Front yard: fire ants show up and kick out all other ants. A year later the Argentine ants come back to reclaim the front yard. And my front yard is a planter, then concrete path, and then the drive way, then the sidewalk, than a strip of grass. These fire ants had taken everything and had satellite nests everywhere. Then here the Argentine ants come and start to invade. The front lines were brutal bodies stacked on either side and 5-4 legged and veterans were seen for months after the war ended. And moves back and forth for much of the first war. Eventually the fire ants were pushed back to the edge of the planter. But alas, they gathered thier might and just went ham on those Argentine ants and pushed them out of thier territory back to the fence separating my front and back yard. The Argentine ants came back however. And this time they won. Frontlines back and forth for a good couple of weeks. Until the fire ants had been exhausted. Pushed out of thier 1 of 4 main nests, this one was isolated and the other 3 were much farther. 1 was abandoned due to lack of ants because they were being massacred by the sheer number of Argentine ants.

The question that I had was, how is it possible that this mutation occured in all the colonies on a continent at once?<br>This video made me think it must be a founder effect. As the video correctly explained, there was little genetic variance in the founding population, since it consisted of very few queens. Had one of the queens this mutation, would the mutation fixate pretty easily.<br>Hence, even if the ants&#39; mutation rate stayed the same (bc why would it change), and they developed into genetically different groups with different odors, it wouldn&#39;t matter anymore bc they have no recognition of body odor anymore. Hence, even though they are variable, they don&#39;t fight eachother.<br><br><br><br>Pretty neat.

You ever notice how the same side effects from an ant colony moving in are the same for a new town or city being built? Endangering certain species of animals and/or plantlife, and just generally disturbing the natural land. That\u2019s what hive minds do.

Better known as coal, oil and gas the chemical industry. Which now that Donald Trump has been bought off and paid out by lifting sanctions and deregulating! Putting Caps ON restricting what the EPA FDA drug and food ministration, health and human services environmentalists can present to the public. Our air ,water ,landscapes ,working and living environments are going to be facing oil spills, gas leaks, toxins being burnt off in to our airways) much more frequent with less consequence which is going to result in, cause environmental financial global collapse. Combined with all the health risks that have already been established from business being conducted in this, low-quality outdated manner, by top scientists leading physician specialist the EPA,FDA, drug and food ministration Surgeon General&#39;s warnings. They say not to use a generator inside your house or car garage for carbon monoxide poisoning is a leading cause of death! So very soon you will have pipelines from coast-to-coast burning off this petrified death! It is basically bringing the generator inside our house. The oldest trick the Republicans have been using preventing these programs from doing their job is by defunding them. It&#39;s what happened the whole time during Obama&#39;s presidency it is irritating negligent that Democrats are not bringing these points out sharing these facts would Americans. Talk about play hardball! Talk about pro-life ,women&#39;s rights and gay-rights. How about the right to clean air, water, high nutritional value foods. Democrats are only bringing up social classification rights. There not hitting the fundamental rights which is air water, foods, landscapes ,working, living environment and every day home products being made with advanced materials resources substances, that are stronger, lighter more versatile easier to work with+ plus the + these products can freely be used manufactured mass-produced as much is the people need or want without leaving any excess poisonous waste behind. Democrats are pushing how important it is that women have the right for a abortion. Will do the fathers have the right to make sure the kids have clean air, water and high nutritional value foods available 24 seven. As ignorant as the Democrats are behaving right now, the Republicans are celebrating being vindictive. By doing everything they can to keep the majority of the population of Americans) overwork, underpaid, out of shape, sick weak ,desperate ,overfed&#39; undernourished&#39; with them dirty low-paying jobs, that come from outdated! Power sources) inferior materials, poisonous, toxic substances, pesticides ,chemicals that never change their killing composition. Which means whether it is a solid liquid or burnt off into our airways atmosphere as a vapor is always going to be poisonous debilitating deadly to the body at the same time polluting corrupting devastating to mother Earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world.    In layman&#39;s terms you cannot promote life by doing business with material resources substances that have been scientifically classified religiously verified as specified death or worse. Which all stem from coal oil gas the chemical industry.  There is no profit to be made in the demise of the planet.  Thanks to dirty low-paying jobs we are facing financial global collapse.  S.R.F.

When it gets 100 degrees Fahrenheit they will swarm crossing the public streets to invade your property and establish three farms in one cool night. Ant bait is good to only hold them off and discover where they are coming from.  The record was five ounces of ant bait in one night across my street. You might discover a farm close by but it is not the big one. Bifenthrin is excellent for instant control outdoors. Finopril is superior. It was not until I followed thier trail into the wilderness that control went up 1000X.  There was a trillion of them and now only a billion and they tend to not cross the street now. There are a few trees in the dried out wilderness that they depend on and I spray the base of the trees cutting them off of thier main supply and then spray some main intersections where they make a trail to escape to my property.  Using ant bait will help to see all the main trails they make. They make trails on the shaded side of the morning sun such as next to a wall but they will then go to the corners of the property which could be a main area to block them with Bifenthrin.  Also just last year a new micro-ant, under 2mm, is out there but it&#39;s so small that It does not seem to be doing anything disturbing.  I still don&#39;t want Argentine ants on my lemon tree because they will spread more around the area where I have edible plants. I believe Argentine ants will establish farms with the roots of your favored plants and slow down the plant. If ants (black) attack your avocado tree you have to make a moat around the tree and fill with water until they decide to leave fast.", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T22:12:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "michael hammond", "comment_text": "Vegans: eating other living things is wrong<br>Ant: hold still for a sec", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T22:10:51Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "Kiabeta", "comment_text": "Megalocolony<br><br><br><br><br><br>Ok I&#39;m leaving just popped in to say this", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T22:10:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ti\u021b\u0103 Junior-Radu (Senaris)", "comment_text": "Nobody:<br>Ant Queen: I AM THE SWARM", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T22:09:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fooly Cooly", "comment_text": "I would pay for this to be a game", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T22:07:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N-Word Aficianado", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sure all those people in Alabama are happy to deal with Fire Ants instead of the tiny Argentine Ants.", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T22:05:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ed Rowbottom", "comment_text": "Love how it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqECNYmM23A&amp;t=9m23s\">9:23</a> long, meaning its about content not ad revenue", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T22:03:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John Kisaragi", "comment_text": "Humans: &quot;we are at the top of the food chain&quot;<br>Ants: &quot;Hey Meruem, they said they&#39;re at the top lol&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T22:03:22Z", "likes_count": 267}, {"comment_by": "operation B.E.N", "comment_text": "ants are pissed", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T22:03:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Hard Problem", "comment_text": "As beautiful as the animation is, I can&#39;t help but wish for actual footage of epic ant battles.", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T22:02:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "phazedscrubs", "comment_text": "Looks like the insect meta is at war again (like if you get my reference)", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T21:59:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OXIPOPABLE", "comment_text": "Thanos:I have killed millions of species and conquered many lands.<br><br>Ants: hold my supra colony", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T21:59:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "One Hunter", "comment_text": "no spanish sub?", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T21:57:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicholas Nguyen", "comment_text": "So Argentine ants are The Borg?", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T21:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Piotr Szewczuk", "comment_text": "I came here for the knowledge in the video, stayed here because of the memes in the comments.", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T21:54:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin Menditeguy", "comment_text": "\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T21:53:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Stejac", "comment_text": "never realized how sick an ant warfare video game would be", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T21:53:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr.Blast__27", "comment_text": "Xd", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T21:52:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BAS GUAPO", "comment_text": "You know when ur bored when u watch a whole video about ants", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T21:50:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Snairster", "comment_text": "I wish my team in battlefield would act like this.", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T21:50:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jenna .H", "comment_text": "world war III:<br>the ants:\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\udc1c", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T21:49:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bruce Parker", "comment_text": "Ants:we won\u2019t let these f*ckers take this land !

This specie is of a dark black colour, it&#39;s like three or four times bigger than the Red Fire Ant, its bite doesn&#39;t hurt at all, and it has its colony on trees or in the roof of houses.

Here in central california the Argentine ants have ruled for years kicking out many species until there are only about 21 species left only 1 species of camponotus  which used to be the most numerous species here. But since the Argentine ants arrived here the main 3 species that live here are Tapinoma sessile, Argentine ants (cant think of scientific name of the top of my head), and tetramorium immigrans  which Kurzgesagt should do a video on because they are some of the most aggressive ants in the world wageing huge above ground wars against other colonies of the same species. If you live in north America or Europe you have probably seen one of these wars because it is a blackish reddish mask of fighting ants usually on a side walk.  But anyways there was a numerous, aggressive, and amazing species here before the Argentine ants arrived called Pheidole California. This species as of all other species of known Pheidole has majors with very dispassionate heads. Even with this advantage the Pheidole here were pushed back. But recently due to growing Tapinoma Sesselie  , and tetramorium immigrans species here the Argentine ants have been pushed back by these resisting species and have made room for the Pheidole. This last summer for the first time in many years the pheidole queens having snuptual flights have reached my area and have established colonies.   Also if you want to see fighting tetramorium just search tetramorium war on the Internet. Also currently I am going down to the bay area of California to go buy a colony of Solenopsis xyloni a species of fire ant I want a colony of. Also if you are interested in keeping ants or just watching them as I assume most of you are go watch ants canada and ants Australia on YouTube they both have many tutorials on how to keep ants as well as just videos in general.
