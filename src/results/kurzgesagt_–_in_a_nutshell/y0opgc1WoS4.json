If you don&#39;t get measles you will get something else. Because health works like that. Diseeases are not something that we can overcome or fight against. The amounts of diseases and sick people havent change since we have the holy science of vaccination.

For example, a woman had a not too serious case of the measles when she was a child, got on with life pretty well and was on a path to success; at 24 she began to notice problems with her cognition - vision impairments, jittery movements, memory loss and depression. Turns out she had developed SSPE. The outlook for SSPE is pretty grim, and it is a 100% fatal. It\u2019s a chronic illness which is that kind of has similar effects to dementia, and people who are diagnosed usually always die 1-3 years after they are diagnosed.<br><br>Basically what I am saying is, get your fucking kids vaccinated. The risks of the measles outweighs the risks of an allergic reaction which can be treated and cured in hospital - SSPE cannot be reversed, cannot be cured and it is a very hard condition to slow progression.

Separate vaccines are not offered. Here&#39;s why:<br><br><br><br><br><br>Rubella is usually relatively mild, and in children, it typically clears up without any serious problems. As a result, if separate vaccines were offered instead of the combined MMR, there would be a danger that some parents would get their children vaccinated against measles and mumps but not rubella. If a pregnant woman catches rubella, there is a very significant risk of serious fetal defects occurring, known as congenital rubella syndrome. This can include problems such as blindness, deafness, cataracts, heart problems, learning difficulties, sometimes even an outright miscarriage or stillbirth. The risk to public health that could be brought about by inadequate rubella vaccination would be immeasurable, and running this risk by offering separate vaccines would not be worth it.", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T19:38:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aesk01 Playz", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0opgc1WoS4&amp;t=1m09s\">1:09</a> TIME TRAVLING PHONE ROOM EASTER EGG", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T16:34:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alexboychato Gamer", "comment_text": "Bacteria and measles huh the brains of the immune system now have to go to the other lymph node to activate the Other heavy weapons such as B cells and anti body\u2019s.", "comment_date": "2020-05-30T19:12:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hans Roberts", "comment_text": "I&#39;m so happy I got the proper vaccinations early enough:)", "comment_date": "2020-05-30T16:55:31Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "John Dave Aba\u00f1o", "comment_text": "We shall get what is rightfully ours such as exterminating the virus", "comment_date": "2020-05-30T01:39:23Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Aria \u2d30\u2d54\u2d62\u2d30", "comment_text": "You still want to not vaccinate your kid?", "comment_date": "2020-05-29T13:45:39Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mariannie Mandi", "comment_text": "My dream that im the killer t cell lol", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T23:22:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GugMorningMrsWoosta", "comment_text": "24 and McLovin it", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T15:39:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Mercedes", "comment_text": "Okay but who here watches cells at work on Netflix,  poor Miss Macrophage \ud83e\udd7a", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T06:23:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "myselft \u2022 36 years ago", "comment_text": "Why does it feel like I&#39;m playing this is 1.25 times speed", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T02:39:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "surfinmuso", "comment_text": "\u201cHave we traded harmless transient childhood diseases for a lifetime of incurable chronic illness?&#39;.

Why dont you vaccinate yourself too? Vaccines are not dangerous, here, let me explain how vaccines work: If you talk about it is made out of fetus and animal DNA it is true but harmless, what happens is, they get the disease from a infected animal, its a animal fetus infected not a aborted baby, and the disease gets your DNA so when you get it, it comes from a animal DNA THAT DOES NOTHING FOR YOUR BODY, about the chemicals, it is not filled with toxins, there is only 3 or less, it <b>HAD</b> mercury years ago, but in a tiny piece of it that din&#39;t cause any harm. but now it has just 000.03% of aluminum that we get from food but a vaccine have less. (But food is natural vaccines not) Boy, the nutrients go directly at your blood, your immunity can just take care of bacteria and small toxins, but they dont go to your brain. They are simply destroyed. And the vaccines have 000.00?% Of aluminum to make your skin get a little painful calling the white blood cells to check it and they learn how to combat it.

To say autism does not happen as a result of MMR is denying the truth and makes a lot of people very angry because they are not being heard - I believe they call it Gas lighting. \u00a0\u00a0I am not an Anti-vaxer or Pro-vaxer. I am supporter to bring back single Measles Vacines for toddlers - 2 to 4 years olds.  My understanding is we had a single measles vaccine in 1998 in New Zealand which was done away with to create the MMR program.  Dr Andrew Wakefield who did studies to show a link between MMR (Measles, Mumps &amp; Rubella injected together) confronted the Establishment of Pharmaceuticals head on and got his doctorate taken away for his efforts. I think of very large fragile egos when things like that happen. \u00a0\u00a0All immune systems of toddlers are not equal &amp; there are no pre-tests by nurses to see if there could possibly be a vulnerability. Dr Andrew Wakefield&#39;s goal was to break up the program so it would help parents with concerns about autism.  Autism really is a life sentence and it should be feared. Just saying there is no link does not make the link go away.  Break up the program! - Measles, Mumps &amp; Rubella vaccines all given separately &amp; given in a way that vulnerable toddlers can deal with. How many billions of dollars would the Pharmaceuticals really lose in doing this? \u00a0Is it that impossible to adjust a program?

Every single disease that vaccines have been credited with stopping or reducing was already declining precipitously before the vaccines were introduced.<br><br>\rAll one has to do to verify the overblown credit taken by vaccines is to simply look at the timelines and charts for infectious disease data. What they clearly show is that the trends for all infectious diseases were heading towards zero or very few infections prior to the introduction of the vaccines for those diseases. And here is what should be the clincher: Three diseases which were on a similar decline to measles and other vaccinated diseases in the U.S. and the UK have also largely disappeared despite never having had a vaccination developed for them. Those three diseases are: scurvy, typhoid fever and scarlet fever.<br><br>\rIt was not medicine, but rather improved sanitation and nutrition which were most responsible for the reduction in infectious diseases. In other words, what reduced diseases were such things as indoor plumbing and toilets, hot water and sterilization, regular baths and hand washing and better access to healthy food. (Sadly, our foods have become less healthy over the past few decades due to Big Food adulterating our foods with harmful additives and processing out much of the nutrition). That is why we see so much disease today in under-developed countries which have poor sanitation, including open latrines and lack of potable water, and poor nutrition.", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T02:20:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary Faulkner", "comment_text": "First of all, unlike Ebola \u2013 which can have a fatality rate as high as 50 per cent or more \u2013 measles have steadily become less virulent and today only about 1 in 1000 measles infections results in death. That means that the present \u201coutbreak\u201d would have to grow over 6 times as large before the odds are that there would be a single death.\r<br>\rAbout 155 cases of measles nationwide in a population of 320 Million people works out to odds of less than 1 in 2 million of catching measles. Of course those odds would be higher in areas where measles are present, but still very long odds and the odds would be virtually zero where there are no measles.<br><br>\rDo you really want to subject your child or yourself to the neurotoxins, mutagens, live viruses and other vile ingredients in vaccines for a less than 1 in 2 Million chance of exposure? Because the undeniable fact is that vaccines are dangerous. They can cause permanent damage and they can be fatal. The Dangers of the Measles Vaccines and Other Vaccines<br>\rPro-vaxxers, as vaccine proponents are often called, like to point out that the idea that measles vaccines cause autism has been debunked \u2013 regardless of evidence and Vaccine Court payouts to the contrary. Whether there is a link between measles vaccines and autism or not, getting caught up in that argument can be a trap for the \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d because it diverts attention from the very real dangers of measles vaccines and other vaccines.<br><br>\rIt is indisputable that vaccinations can harm you in many ways besides autism. That is why the government\u2019s vaccine compensation program has paid out about 3 Billion dollars to vaccine victims, despite all the obstacles designed into the program to hinder filing claims and getting paid. And, as mentioned above, vaccines can indeed be fatal. Take the measles vaccine for example: During the past 10 years, there have been 108 deaths attributed to the vaccine and likely many more that were falsely attributed to other causes. A search for measles deaths during that same time period turns up only 4 deaths attributed to measles.<br><br>\rLike virtually all vaccines, the measles vaccination is less than 100% effective \u2013 as evidenced by the fact that some of the measles cases are occurring in vaccinated children. There is another unpleasant truth about the measles vaccine which medicine does not want you to know: vaccinated children can spread measles \u2013 as shown by documents from the CDC, the WHO and Merck Pharmaceuticals,", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T01:41:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stacy Family", "comment_text": "We need a virus DNA/RNA intercepter.

I Havent even had a headache not even the tiniest of headaches. And it&#39;s because i eat well. A organic life style with organic food and cleaning products and organic hygiene products. I dont even exercise. Your all idiots wanting an easy answer. Vaccines are an easy answer that hurts millions of people. Creating allergies, and brain damage, autism, gender dysphoria, mentally challenged, if not in you maybe you next born child cause you got a flu shot or vaccine a couple weeks to a month before you got pregnant. All so you can have the quick fix. A harmful fix that takes care of a problem that would  take care of itself naturally if you would just stop eating crap food and using poisonous cleaning and hygiene products.

In fact, measles used to be a pretty common medical issue that might have been annoying but certainly wasn\u2019t life-threatening, much like chicken pox. It typically starts with a high fever and is marked by a cough, red eyes, a runny nose, and those tiny red spots you might already be familiar with that start at the head before spreading to cover the whole body. Like many common illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia and other serious problems in rare cases.

In an episode entitled, \u201cGranting Immunity\u201d that first aired in 2015, an outbreak starts at a local high school, and it\u2019s traced to a mother who runs a lifestyle website promoting herbal treatments.

Every day, it looks more and more like profits are the real culprit here.<br><br>People in older generations will tell you that when they found out kids in the neighborhood had measles, many parents would send their own children to play with them so they\u2019d all get sick at once to get it over with and acquire immunity to it.

The first being that it says there is no benefit to contracting measles. This is missleading.  If you contract measles naturally you have a life long immunity to the virus, whereas if you get a vaccine you will have to keep getting the vaccine for the rest of your life, as it provides no long term immunity.  One would argue that this is even more dangerous than contracting it naturally, as the typical age of contraction is at childhood, when the body is best equiped to fight off the virus. Contrast that with the fact that the older you are the harder it is to fight off measles, evident by the higher death toll of elderly verses pre-adulece and you would quickly realize this very self evident fact.  Note that people don&#39;t die from measles, but from the symptoms there of.  This being the case, the logical conclusion is that natural contraction coupled with treating of the symptoms is the best case scenario....

why do we waste time with this democratic falsehoods, its just mob rule at the end of the day and the majority says VACCINATE, so why are we even talking? its not like we really care, its why we call them child killers and advocate hate against anti-vaxxers in the first place.<br><br>so just force the child killers already to vaccinate and declare the constitution and bill of rights obsolete and declare the USA a official dictatorship, so we dont have to waste a 10-20 years before it finally becomes mandatory anyways.<br><br>then we can get rid of all those guns as well, while were at it, no more pretending these people have a right to anything, after all they were going to loose all their guns in the end, city by city, state by state, we have been rolling out un-constitutional laws year after year and the majority hasnt stopped it, so its clear what the majority wants, it wants the constitution abolished, because these laws by default are un-constitutional as is trying to force anti-vaxxers to vax, so why are we still pretending to be the bastions of freedom were not!<br><br>we as hell dont advocate it when it comes to what we want as majority, otherwise this whole vaccine debate, wouldnt be a debate, its only a debate if were pro-dictatorship, so why dont we just push for a dictatorship, problem solved, were basically one already anyways and it would clear up so many of these debates.<br><br>this is country is mob ruled after all, why do we need to as a majority pretend that we care about minority opinion, when we dont want to and push for mandatory laws anyways, we want a dictatorship!.<br><br>so why are we even waiting for the next election? the current president should just make everything mandatory, problem solved! we should just make our voices heard, we want a the USA to be officially acknowledged as a dictatorship.<br><br>then all us pro-vaxxers can get on with our lives, caring about ourselves and we wont have to waste time pretending to care about anyone else.<br><br>no more pretending wars are for freedom etc, we can just say it how it is, we want you oil, we want your shit, because it makes our lives more better and we dont care if you have to die in the process, including YOUR kids, because they arent ours.<br><br>as for all those other nations out there, well your all basically the same as the USA as well, mob rule, so there really isnt any excuse for any nation to be left out.<br><br>if you care about your kids, you know what to do, advocate for a official declaration of dictatorship now!", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T06:30:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A K Wyld", "comment_text": "Or a funnier way to explain the body works<br>An anime called Cells At Work", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T06:20:03Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Cronch", "comment_text": "<b>hello anti-vaxxers</b>", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T04:22:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "can he do tricks?", "comment_text": "thank u thomas the sound was very good and made my ears feel :)", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T01:00:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kalvin lewis", "comment_text": "Vaccines contain enough mercury to make you gay.", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T01:00:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Mullis", "comment_text": "That&#39;s easy, vaccinate.", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T00:51:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dumb Comment", "comment_text": "Stupidest people can be found in the US.

Simple, that before the introduction of wide spread vaccinations, there were far more children dying than there are now... and then almost suddenly the number of children deaths drop dramatically after the dates when many vaccines were developed for many diseases.  True, we can&#39;t be sure that all of the children deaths were the result of these diseases as there are many other ways for children to die, but we will still see an impressive drop in the number of dead children after the date the vaccinations became common so we can assume that fewer children died as a result of those diseases.  We can assume this for the simple reason that the other causes of child deaths haven&#39;t been nearly as common as death from disease and that the causes of those other deaths hasn&#39;t really been affected by much.  The same number of children die from accidents now as generally they did before the introduction of diseases... with minor fluctuations from various sources that makes it easier to prevent such things.  The same is true of other causes of child deaths... their numbers tended to be fairly low to begin with and haven&#39;t changed as much as the number of child deaths due to diseases since the introduction of vaccines.<br><br>Of course, with the number of parents that are choosing not to vaccinate their children and the resurgence of the various diseases that were kept in check by vaccinations, we are likely to see a sudden upswing in the number of child graves in cemeteries... which just further points to one simple and undeniable fact:  VACCINES SAVE LIVES!", "comment_date": "2019-02-05T06:20:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ghost of Valor", "comment_text": "Can you do an episode on autoimmune diseases?", "comment_date": "2019-02-04T21:06:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ghost of Valor", "comment_text": "Vaccinate!

First off, it does not. It harms the immune system, leaving it weak and vulnerable to millions of other infections.

Also to take note that over 250,000 SIDS deaths were reported between 12 month to 3 years of age in 2014. This is arrogant and disgusting representation of true measles. Of the pnuemonia related deaths due to measles 84% were vaccinated. People seriously need to be very discriminatory of the numbers used in this video, it is blatantly false and seriously over reaching as nearly 1000 studies in medical journals have asserted that measles does in fact boost your immune system and protect the brain when caught wild. However measles vaccine contain adjuvants like polysorbate 20, 80 which carry pathogens across the blood brain barrier causing encephalopathy and demyelinating  disorders...fact checks can be found easily by research!

We need to think like Jonas Salk, who created a vaccine that was ACTUALLY safe and effective. If only manufacturers would stop putting in dangerous chemicals, the vaccine would be perfectly fine. Some people will react great to the vaccine, but because of the foreign substances, other people may have adverse reactions. Looking through the comments, I see people saying that unvaccinated individuals are uneducated, but that is simply not true. They are just getting their information from the wrong source. If you don&#39;t vaccinate, you need better reasoning than a Facebook post saying a celebrity is not vaccinating their children.There are plenty accurate studies on the effects of vaccines, but people are too lazy to take the time to read them.

I&#39;m a single father and my son has had every single vaccination that&#39;s been offered. He&#39;s also on the autism spectrum...but he was before he was vaccinated too. And having a child who is autistic isn&#39;t a terrible thing. He&#39;s brought more happiness and joy to my life than anything ever has. I wouldn&#39;t trade it for the world.

You are exposed to harmful bacteria every single day of your life and it is thanks to catching mild-ass illnesses like measles, chickenpox, and the common cold that you are able to kick the much more serious things you could be catching. This is precisely why they say you need to catch chickenpox as a kid instead of an adult, because your immune system is in the middle of development and will kick the illness in a handful of days, whereas an adult and their fully-developed immune system with no experience with this bacteria will land in the damn hospital.

If it does not and infects itself with the disease the consequences are most likely hard to treat and cause death. A child infected with such a disease is able to fight it back, having a better chance of survival then a grown up. If not: Natural selection.

Sure, you&#39;re immune system is pretty good and if you do get sick you can usually fight it off.

Usually that would be okay because if everyone is vaccinated against diseases that can kill babies if they catch it, there is an extremely decreased chance for the diseases to be around for the baby to catch so they are safe until they can be vaccinated.

This thinking existed for over 70 years. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given. What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. In essence, at least 50% or more of the population was unprotected for decades.<br>If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95%. Yet, we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50% or less of the population having vaccine protection. That is, herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades and no resurgent epidemics have occurred.<br>Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations.\u201d", "comment_date": "2015-07-23T23:49:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Starius2", "comment_text": "I like how you didnt talk about how even vaccinated folk can spread the virus.", "comment_date": "2015-07-23T22:29:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jay Cakes", "comment_text": "i want someone to make a strategy game where you are the immune systym", "comment_date": "2015-07-23T15:47:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "The Nathanator", "comment_text": "Or you can just get the MMR jab.
