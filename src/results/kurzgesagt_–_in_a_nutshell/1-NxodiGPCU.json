So, when looking at a giant virus, it needs to be assumed to have exponentially more genes than we can see at a glance.<br><br>As a side note: although humans use start and stop codons, humans also use a system of methylation to turn on and off parts of genes to thus change their expression. This mechanism, rather than random mutation, is the driving force of most animals we have observed. The Galapagos Finch, for example, evolved a variety of diets and Beak types to suit the different Island environments, but these are all epigenetically controlled rather than the result of mutation.

The flu for example. Even though with enough evidence through time we are able to state that the flu can be of slight  concern, it is not enough to mandate the vaccine for it. Not to mention the vaccine itself has actually proven itself to be statistically ineffective in a sense that makes it&#39;s promoters seem lacking in knowledge of viruses.

Gave me a bit more insight about viruses and I didn&#39;t think a micro organism could have an immune system in itself . The thought of a large virus, not even a single celled organism, having the capability of using CRISPR basically and ridding itself ridding itself of other virusphages (virus virus-hunters) is just amazing and shows the potential for microbacterial evolution. From my current knowledge, I would think it&#39;s safe to say that for billions of years microorganisms used to be simpler.. maybe there used to be some pretty complex ones that rose up and went extinct, but I think that the variety of microbacteria now and seeming how long theyve been around they might have more evolutionary potential on their own being single celled. And they might have a bigger part to play with multicelled organisms than we thought. The potential is limitless basically. Single celled organisms might win one day simply because we take much longer to evolve because of our reproduction rate and lifespan (speaking for all multicelled organisms). They could evolve in some very peculiar ways I now realize from this.

Hello YouTube comments I&#39;m from Bosnia and Herzegovina so my writing in English will be bad. I know that this is not a place to ask for help but I feel like I don&#39;t have other choice. Let me explain, I&#39;m born here in Bosnia in 1992 in a middle of war. In that war my family lost alot and I was 60 days old when I lost my father. So growing without a man to explain you alot of thing&#39;s which mother can&#39;t was harsh especially in this country where everyone is corrupt. But I did it. I think that I have grown in a solid man. After scool I got a solid job got a wife and we got 2 beautiful boys. So I had to take a loan to buy a home for us to live in and it was fine until October 2018 when I was diagnosed with diabetes then alot of changes I had to make in my life so I could be healthy and support my family. With diabetes came another sicnes I don&#39;t how to call it in English (I have to much fat in blood) and thanks God insuline is free here in Bosnia so it was not a big deal I had to spend only about 17 dollars on some pills every 15 days. Now in 2021 I got 3 heart attacks no one does not know how I made it alive but I did. The reason for heart failure is diabetis it stuck some veins and heart could not pump blood. Now the reason why I&#39;m writing all of this is with all of this and alot of things happening to me in my journey tru life I&#39;m in depression I have no idea what to do and how to help my family. I don&#39;t see an exit and I don&#39;t want to beg on the streets and my Country does not give a damn about me and 95% of other people here. The reason I&#39;m searching for help is because wih heart like mine and diabetes I can&#39;t work and bring money home. We stil have 9 years of loan left. Since I&#39;m not working now and I have to give 380 km to bank and my wife makes 500 km evry month then the medications are 120 km for me. We cannot afford nothing more. And we need to pay bills and bring food home. The reason I&#39;m gona ask you guys to somehow help me if possible are the kids i can&#39;t explain how hard I&#39;m feeling because I can&#39;t afford nothing to them and one of them will need to go in school next year. And I can&#39;t afford him a damn pen. I don&#39;t know what to do so I came here to ask for help. Thanks.

Sounds like a little bit of bias going on there, trying to make life special. From my perspective it&#39;s very simple, anything that takes material from it&#39;s surroundings in order to make more of itself should qualify as life. In that sense everything is alive as atoms take parts of other atoms to make more of themselves, so does molecules, and space dust become stars, so it&#39;s the same all the way up. A chemical reaction, that&#39;s all life really is. We just have this idea that life should be special stuck in our heads, but it&#39;s really not, it&#39;s just a chemical process that is better at sustaining itself than other chemical reactions. It&#39;s like fire, it&#39;ll convert (eat) whatever it can to sustain itself and grow. When there is nothing more it can eat it&#39;ll die. Just energy moving around converting into other forms, solids, liquids, gases, and pure energy, light, heat, kinetic energy, sound, etc. Life is no different, we just want it to be because we have language and thoughts and consciousness and stuff. But for all we know consciousness could exist in everything, we just can&#39;t ask a rock if it&#39;s aware of its existence. And our language and thinking are just chemical processes, processes we&#39;re not even very good at controlling. At the end of the day, after all the philosophy and science and everything, we&#39;re still just trying to survive and multiply. Society wouldn&#39;t even exist if it didn&#39;t serve this goal. So the basis for everything humans have ever created, including language, has just been to perform the same simple task those possibly &quot;dead&quot; viruses do, to survive and multiply. And even multiplying is just a survival mechanism, so at the end of the day it&#39;s all just survival. And survival just means moving towards things that will let you continue to exist as you are now, and away from things that will alter your current existence. Something that is impossible because we just like everything else changes all the time, but we do it anyway because we&#39;re just a chemical reaction. Maybe we should stop obsessing over what life is and just realize that everything is alive, would resolve a lot of noise in our brains.", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T07:13:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tankaiteik0505 tankaiteik0505", "comment_text": "<b>e</b>", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T07:06:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spy ninjas fan", "comment_text": "EXUSE me there only 8 billion ppl in the world", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T06:33:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Ann the Nytowl", "comment_text": "Wow, viruses that hunt viruses?

It is your own degraded immune system that may over react and cause you to have a fever, runny nose etc. when an accumulation of any pathogen is not being clean out by your system as it does every day. This over reaction (illnesses) is always caused by either a lack of nutrition or by poisoning. The virus made famous by Hollywood, the Ebola was actually caused by someone dumping formaldehyde into the Ebola River in Africa. AIDS was not caused by the HIV nonsense, rather is the the gay community&#39;s overuse of narcotics during the 1980&#39;s especially &quot;popers&quot; aka Amyl Nitrate. But what cause the mass deaths was Fauci encouraging the use of AZT as a possible &quot;&quot;cure&quot;&quot; when in fact that was what really killed millions worldwide. When you lack sunlight in the autumn and winter months, you may get the cold or flu. But none of these or any illness has anything to do with a germ or virus. Again, you are either lacking a nutrition e.g. D3, or you have been poisoned either over years or within a short time. The video above, in other words is pure ... BULLSHIT!

So what if the natural selection mutations are caused by Giruses? It&#39;s rewriting genes, therefore it is possible to spread that gene to the next generation of a species, and suddenly Darwin&#39;s theory makes more sense. They jerk with evolution, as said.

Whole humanity is practically a onslaught of themselves, and without it we wouldnt even have mudhuts, we wouldnt even have caves, we wouldnt even be human or the thing before it. All progression is done on filtration on beings, where in a batch of people, there are people who are more productive, more dumber or smarter, more sportive, and their enviroments and current conflicts filtrate them, wars have made possible that the dumber root of our familly got wiped out, and it took thousands of years to do that, untill some idiots opened all the gates, and pretend that we all evolve equally, and think that one person in a different place and scenario will somehow telepathically transfer their breakthrough and Development and general conclusions of a happening they werent at to every other human being. Kurzgesagt is partly an opinion channel its not science, they try to represent modern science by picking stuff from news they find but they have their own stupid convictions about how things are and say stupid things time to time and im getting sick of it. Have 2 robots, the other robot dents it head, missing the data that he should be friendly to the other robot and starts to bump or attack/absorb the other robot instead for its nutritions, viewed deficiencies are not always a bad thing, its a way to evolve and take different turns and split from a group. DNA gets bombarded by all sorts of enviroments and radiation, so from time to time there is a part that breaks of or is not correctly sorted, causing differences.

Your whole lineage is practically a millions of years old unended killingspree that goes to the first seed of DNA origin, everyday your plate is filled with dead(or alive) material, even plants aren&#39;t a lifeless bunch of rocks. All creatures on earth have the same parents if you go far enough back in time, yet all evolved into killing another. All animals except from primitive organisms that live from pure natural elements and sunlight, live from destroying other life forms or feasting on their remains, even plants have DNA just like humans, and they also eventually splitted of from us. Eventually a lifeform splitted, and went to a different territory with different enviroment only to returned changed and adapted, it eventually grew so differently, that the one that first attacked the other would gain the upper hand as it was much faster taking resources from another organism than producing it yourself, virus is just like that and us, it splits of from the branch of life and starts attacking creatures around it to procreate and feast on their deaths. Humans have also sided against each other, and its normal within the animal kingdom to even make fights with your own brothers, seperation happens within your own familly. your brothers children will look different from yours, and in the countless future wars to come, people will see advantages and take them, just as live does it around them. life itself is one perpetual war against itself.", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T23:30:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leita_ Gaming", "comment_text": "Hm.. well I know a lot of viruses that shouldn\u2019t exist.", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T23:29:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Ku\u010dera", "comment_text": "No, no it doesnt", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T23:25:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Brown", "comment_text": "So basically even viruses have food chain? the world is very weird.", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T23:23:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bluey", "comment_text": "wow... this channel keeps contradicting itself so much.

Rickettsia represents a very early and primitive stage of virus evolution where the organism is still a relatively complex bacterium, giruses are the middle point where they have begun decreasing in size and losing most non-parasitic function, but are still several hundred nm or even a micrometre in size and contain leftover garbage genes from their days as metabolically active cells, and the majority of modern viruses are the end point of virus evolution, where all non-parasitic function is completely lost and the virus itself is reduced to a tiny collection of a few genes involved in taking over cells and making more of itself. Bacteria like rickettsia are probably some tens of millions of years old, giruses several hundred million or up to a billion years old, and modern viruses are probably descended from primitive hyperparasitic bacteria like modern rickettsia that lived billions of years ago.<br><br>In all honesty I&#39;m fairly disappointed with this video. It is more appropriate and in line with Occam&#39;s razor to suggest that the genes found in giruses for things such as metabolic activity are simply leftover garbage genes from an earlier stage in evolution, than to say that they have been &#39;sharing&#39; DNA with organisms for billions of years and they have influenced evolution. That requires more steps and there&#39;s no evidence to support those extra steps, hence the simpler conclusion is preferred. It&#39;s not incorrect that viruses share DNA with cellular organisms and affect their evolution, in fact we know that this happens with bacteriophages and retroviruses, but those mechanisms are very well-studied. Giruses on the other hand have no evidence to suggest they interact with the cells they infect like this, or that they have existed for billions of years. Amoeba have &#39;only&#39; existed for about 1.5 billion years, which puts an upper limit on modern giruses, and there is no evidence that they have ever infected another organism. As I have said, it is simpler to argue that giruses are just viruses in an earlier stage of evolution and the large sizes and leftover genes are just that, leftovers from previous stages.", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T11:51:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u9727\u98a8\u96f6", "comment_text": "&quot;Using the victim up from the inside, until it&#39;s filled up&quot;<br>\uf633", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T11:48:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SpookyNooky", "comment_text": "Biologist here.<br>Viruses are NOT living beings.<br>Viruses are particles.<br>If viruses are living beings, then cars are as well.", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T11:46:00Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "rain3906", "comment_text": "they&#39;re actually the beings that lived before us who grew so advanced that they made themselves microscopic and these giruses are just ships \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T11:45:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Caio Miguel", "comment_text": "That mouse scene is gonna come back to haunt me", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T11:43:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "A School Boy", "comment_text": "now think big , what if we injected virophages into covid 19 victims", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T11:42:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "tarlea marnham", "comment_text": "Can you do what if corona started with you?", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T11:40:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben M", "comment_text": "What is Life?

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019.", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T03:18:48Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Rocco Patalagsa", "comment_text": "Not yet but I have to work", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T03:18:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laslow", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NxodiGPCU&amp;t=6m10s\">6:10</a> yo is that the lil gal from that Mario RPG?", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T03:18:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AMAZ!NG MUSIC", "comment_text": "God bless everyone who sees this.

Science supports a Creator, we are incredibly complex and all of it needs to be in place for life to even work. And life forms need each other to exist. Delicate echo systems need to be in place for any species to survive. Why should apple trees feed us? What \u201cevolutionary\u201d advantage does that have? How should evolution decide that tree frogs should have suction cups, where does it get the information of how the laws of physics allow that process? The Creator of the physical world gave it laws to follow and none of those laws allow for matter to assemble itself into such complex machinery as ourselves. He invented matter with life as the end goal but not so it could arise on its own. He shaped matter into a chemical/physical balance of orchestrated timing and beauty that goes on every moment of our existence and we\u2019re all so blessed to even exist, yet we don\u2019t seem to even notice God\u2019s Glory in everything He has created. And it\u2019s just a shame, because life is amazing, but we ruin it with our selfish pride, wanting everything for ourselves and not bothering with others. Don\u2019t you see the constant evil that has consumed our planet, perversions of God\u2019s created order are happening at every moment in an increasingly exponential rate. The damn will burst and the end will come, your evils will be turned back on yourselves. Repent and believe Jesus died for your sins and God raised Him from the dead just as He will do for you, if you believe.

Do you believe this? I say this because most of our choices were shaped by what others told us, especially our parents. The satanists, buddhist, muslims and traditionalists are following their god mainly because men told them it\u2019s the right god to serve. And you know that all these gods can not all be right because most of their beliefs contradict one another. All these gods can\u2019t be the true god. All of them cannot give hope of a splendid life after death. There can only be one governor in a state any other governor is an impostor. There has to be one that\u2019s right and the other wrong.<br>So my question, how are you sure beyond any form of doubt that the god (man) you\u2019re following is the right man? This question led me to study various spiritual leaders to know the right one among them.<br>I found that \u2026 Buddha once told his followers to \u201cseek for the truth\u201d. Confucius also said \u201cI am not the way\u201d. Mohammed also said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going after death\u201d. But I found a man that said \u201cI am the way, the truth and life. No one goes to the father except through me\u201d. He\u2019s the only man to ever say this and PROVE IT with not with mere words from mouth but with infallible proofs.<br>This man also said, he will take his followers to Paradise. Even while he was dying he told a theif that believed in him that \u201ctoday, you\u2019ll be with me in Paradise\u201d. He said \u201che will raise anyone that believes in him up at the last day\u201d. And he proved this by rising up from the dead and ascending to heaven physically.<br>He gave his followers hope of Joyful life after death in heaven. This man is the only man in human history to resurrect from the dead all by himself. A man that tried it D\u2019Lawrence was struck dead by thunder. This man lived a perfect life while in earth. He never sinned, never hurt or kill anyone. He did only good while he was on earth. Even the dating system of our world is splitted into two (BC and AD) because of him. BC means before Christ and AD signifies After Christ birth. We are in 2021 because it is 2021 years after Jesus\u2019 death.<br>This man is Jesus Christ. He died for you on the cross so he can take away your sin and give you life. Just as fruits have to die so that the seed in them can have life and spring forth. He died for you so you can have life and rise up after your death into the eternal glory he has prepared for you.<br>He stands at the door of your heart knocking open your heart to him. He loves you so much, he want to be your lord and supply you all you need for life. He wants to floud the chambers of you heart with peace and Joy that only him and nothing else can give. Don\u2019t deny yourself of this free gift of Christ. Accept him into your life as your master and he will give you rest.<br>Say these words to make him your lord. \u201cLord Jesus, I renounce the fake gods I\u2019ve been following. I cancel every evil covenant I\u2019ve been involve in. I repent of my evil and sinful ways. I accept you and my lord. I make you my lord.

During the Sui Dynasty, for example, five plague gods were seen above the capital city in 592. A major plague then broke out that year, causing a high number of deaths. The Emperor of Wendi, a strong believer of Buddhism, ordered more temples to be built and encouraged his subjects to strengthen faith in and worship the divine.\r<br>\r<br>Such a tradition continued to recent China. Xuyun (1840 \u2013 1959), one of the most renowned monks in recent Chinese history, had lived through five emperors in the Qing Dynasty until communist China.\r<br>\r<br>During the war with Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900, Emperor Guangxu together with Empress Dowager Cixi fled to Xi\u2019an of Shaanxi Province in August, and Xuyun was invited to join. It was summer and plague broke out, leaving many people dying, with rotting corpses throughout the city. In addition to advising the emperor to call on the wealthy for donations as a remedy, Xuyun also vowed to pray at Wolong Temple for mercy from the divine to end the plague.\r<br>\r<br>Nearly 1,000 monks joined the event and Xuyun led nine of them to continue praying at a ten-yard high platform. Seven days into the ceremony, snow fell. Other monks returned to inside the temple, with only Xuyun remaining at the platform. He continued meditating, praying for additional snow to alleviate the damage caused by the drought and plague in the region. More snow arrived, and everywhere was covered with snow. Impressed by the miracle and sincerity, Empress Dowager Cixi came kneeling down on the snow in front of the platform to thank Xuyun.\r<br>\r<br>But all the divine culture was wiped out after the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took power in 1949. In early 1951, for example, officials in Hunan Province required all nuns to get married in days, while young monks were forced to join the army. Xuyun, already over 110 at the time, was targeted as a counter-revolutionist. When the Buddhism Association of China was established in 1952 and CCP officials promoted monks and nuns to get married and stop their vegetarian diets, Xuyun attempted to intervene. As a result, he was detained with no food, water, or access to a bathroom. Military police officers also beat him and broke his ribs.", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T22:40:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Levi McGlinchey", "comment_text": "Elephant sized ducks you say...", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T22:39:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seraaron", "comment_text": "This is absolutely fucking wild", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T22:38:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aymen Saadoon", "comment_text": "We have 7 billion how do trillions die", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T22:38:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hello Google", "comment_text": "Trust power don&#39;t trust them either our water and drinking water there putting salt in it that actually takes out the oxygen our water taste&#39;s like salt in it", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T22:37:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jamesthe1 \u03a3\u03c4", "comment_text": "I feel like viruses are not alive, and are merely failed cells (if life existed through spontaneous-ness).

All we are are machines, made primarily up of organic molecules, that can adapt to stimuli better than the rest of these organic machines. So if we are machines, what is our purpose, well, we don&#39;t have one, we don&#39;t have any meaning or purpose at all, of course we don&#39;t, but we think we do, so instead of going down that rabbit hole, let&#39;s look at this logically. What is life&#39;s purpose, well the answer is simple, &#39;to continue&#39;, right, what does every single organic machine (excluding certain lab-made proto-machines) have in common, *continuation*. Yes. Continuation of some sort, drawing in energy from the environment, reducing the entropy of ones self while increasing the entropy in the outside world. Life, if it does indeed have a definitive purpose as a machine created by chance and accidents and various random processes, was made to preserve energy. You see evolution isnt specific to life,even the universe goes through a form evolution, not in it&#39;s rules, but rather it&#39;s substance, things get more and more complex because complex things maintain energy better. First you had quarks, then baryons and other subatomic particles, such as muons, then you had atoms, then they gathered into stars, and more complex atoms were made, and these atoms began to join together and you had molecules, and then you had planets made from various molecules, and in certain conditions these planets began to create organic molecules, and then these organic molecules began to form new more complex units, proteins, and these proteins eventually began life, so even the universe rails against entropy, of course that too is probably just an accident, since, in all honesty, it&#39;s hard to believe that anything is pushing the universe into compliance of some agenda.&quot;<br><b>goes on to ramble about other stuff</b><br>&quot;well anyway, life is simply a vessel for energy and machine for continuation, I don&#39;t think we need to turn it into a special club based on specific attributes, or the lack thereof.&quot;-unknown", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T19:15:27Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Nate Adam", "comment_text": "when did you get so clickbait with your titles ?", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T19:13:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Parker Stevens", "comment_text": "NIIICE 16 MILLION SUBS", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T19:11:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "naldo_", "comment_text": "aliens", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T19:10:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "santnav", "comment_text": "After covid, every virus becomes so important \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T19:09:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dj khaled alt account", "comment_text": "Not too fond of your dutch accent.", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T19:08:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dreamynights", "comment_text": "Maybe viruses are the markers for evolution and possibly contribute to how species from different parts of the world sometimes develop to have a similar trait.

Which is it?   Hope is both will AND ambition.   These two concepts are mutually exclusive.    They cannot have no will or ambition, and also have hope.    While I clearly understand the need for semi-ambiguous descriptors within this \u201cexplanation\u201d, the words used are an example of an affront to logic, facts, and the very foundation of educational knowledge.     I also understand figurative versus literal, and do fully grasp the difficulty in defining what allows a virus to self-perpetuate, yet, words which self-negate serve not just to confuse the viewer, but to mislead the viewer as to the evolutionary aspects of viral mutation and proliferation.      These things are all but undefinable, and their sustained attacks on all earthly life forms could at some point seem to be otherworldly, which could in turn lead to farcical explanations for their existence.    Our universal lack of knowledge on the topic of viral proliferation is both stunningly unsettling and dismissively apathetic.   Since we don\u2019t understand, we try not to care, yet both of these traits are the very weapons threatening mankind, indeed all life on Earth.    How do we fight an enemy both undefined as an entity and having no understood mechanism of intent, purpose, desire, need, or satiation?       How indeed.     With feeble stabs at viral defense, and misguided attempts to protect the victims of the viral attack, both of which often resulting in yet more viral proliferation.   But one thing is very certain in the war against destructive viral loads;   that isolation of a given group of humans for a duration significantly longer than the known span of viral sustenance will definitively and absolutely eradicate this enemy.    It requires a constant succession of fresh hosts to proliferate.   If any virus is denied ANY chance of encountering a \u201cnew\u201d host, it\u2019s existing host will either expire, which will end he proliferation of the virus, or the host  will conquer and defeat the viral adversary through evolved self-defense mechanisms, which are in themselves yet to be fully understood by science.    We can beat this viral foe.  Yet we aren\u2019t sure how.    But I offer my hypothesis which is self-evidently factual.    If we can isolate ourselves, we can isolate each viral load, thus isolating any chance of the virus \u201csurviving\u201d beyond its current host, thusly ending its cycle of destruction, if, and only if, we can remain isolated for a longer duration than the virus can exist within our bodies.    Vaccinations, herd immunity, and other hapless defensive strategies simply HOLD the virus at bay temporarily, wherein it will quickly evolve into a yet unknown enemy, much like the Trojan Horse of lore, and continue its path of destruction endlessly.   It is indeed an enemy, inhuman, undefined, but an enemy nonetheless.   How does a defender eradicate its aggressor permanently?    Remove its sustenance, wherein this example, it\u2019s sustenance is a new host over some period of time.   With this knowledge, or even an educated idea of its longevity, we can outlast the enemy, and witness its total destruction, simply by not traveling, or more importantly, by not allowing ANY CHANCE of spreading the virus to a new host.   It\u2019s very simple in idea, very complete in result, but very complex in execution, requiring a strictness of plan never before seen in human endeavor, yet required here to end this nightmare.    We MUST implement a system of sustained isolation of well planned and documented groups with supplies needed being supplied with an ultra strict set of guidelines to prevent its spread in a most absolute way.  We can\u2019t simply implement what we know, because we don\u2019t know much.   If we know it is spread a certain way, defend that way many times over.    If we think we know how long it can last and spread in via a host, triple that duration to be sure.    For example, if we know it can be spread through touch or airborne ways, any deliveries of supplies must be done with a full hazmat suit which is then \u201ccleaned\u201d with methodology absolutely known to destroy any and all viruses.    And if we think we know the \u201cgestation period\u201d of the virus, triple that time at the very least to ensure an absolute eradication of the virus within an individual.       While these tactics may seem absurd, they are actually barely removed from the lockdowns we witnessed within the last two years.  If anything, we were on the right path, as proven by the reduction of cases, but it has to be even more strict, more absolute, and more documented for any chance of real success.   With this tactic, we won\u2019t just keep these viruses at bay and learn how to survive them, we can eradicate them.  We will starve them out.    Group by group by group.    Now, getting 7.5 billion people to implement this strategy is going to be even more difficult than surviving the virus itself.   Oh humans, who knew that our liberties would one day be our undoing?

I&#39;m sure this is obvious to most watching a Kurzgesagt video, but the debate reflects more on the arbitrary nature of the constructs we use to define and organize phylogenetic relationships than their true nature. It&#39;s the same reason we find it almost impossible to define life beyond a collection of related bullet points or determine the point of speciation. Depending on how you want to define &quot;species,&quot; Neanderthals could be considered as a subspecies of our own species <i>Homo sapiens</i> or its own distinct one. We know they certainly produce viable, fertile offspring, yet there are separate species today, like polar and brown bears, that everyone agrees are divergent enough physiologically and ecologically to be classified as two distinct species. Nonetheless, they diverged much more recently than Neanderthals did from our own species and can also produce fertile offspring. To decide to combine the two bear species would eliminate what valuable role the current terms have and make it difficult to discuss the obvious distinctions between them. The classification of &quot;species&quot; is a practical one and the degree to which it&#39;s valuable when distinguishing between two groups of animal doesn&#39;t perfectly overlap within the genetic differences between those groups. The edge cases between relatively similar groups of animals is an indication that it&#39;s an arbitrary system created by humans, but one that is made to serve a purpose <i>for us.</i> It&#39;s the same case for viruses. Organisms are unbelievably complex, self-sustaining chemical reactions utilizing feedback loops between products and reactants, many of which are macromolecules. Where the sub-reactions of dead compounds end and the symphony of &quot;life&quot; emerges is a product of our attempt to classify rather than a genuine cut-off point. The horizontal distinctions between types, as well as the vertical hierarchies of complexity, of life are separated by spectra (at least when the fossil record is taken into account). In terms of the vertical spectra: why consider a eukaryotic organism and individual rather than a community of symbiotic cells?How much specialization and permanence within groups of cooperative cells constitutes a multicellular organism? Viruses are toward the opposite end of that particular spectra: between what we call &quot;pre-biotic chemistry&quot; and &quot;life.&quot; Is it a &quot;dead&quot; macromolecule along a metabolic pathway that should include the infected cell, making that cyclical process an organism? When does a chain or collection of dead things become living? We associate &quot;dead&quot; with inanimate objects, but aren&#39;t we just extremely complex objects? And these distinctions are going to become even fuzzier the more we learn about the origin of life.", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T02:39:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Walker", "comment_text": "The &quot;umbrella&quot; term (no pun intended) that some researchers in the biosciences have come up with for all entities that contain genetic code, protein chains, and function to reproduce whether through cell (bio-organism) propagation, or viral replication is known as REPLICATORS.

Other bacteria picked up those strands of dna entirely by accident which caused them to replicate the genes and over millions of copies they eventually mutated and evolved to incorportate things like an outer shell to protect the dna strand, specialized membranes to  target specific cells, etc. through natural selection. The viral dna that was more capable of spreading to other cells was more likely to reproduce and it&#39;s copies spread more than other strands without those advantages.

Basically just a small strand that somehow got lose/cut off and is lonely molecule. Most of these strands breaks up after time for being out in the open, but a very small amount might have the luck of entering a living thing again, like a cell that will then read that strands information and produce more of it if it contains such info. And so it continues and a niche is filled. I think Asimov considered a lonely strand like this life, although most scientists didn&#39;t, but I could remember it wrong.

It&#39;s not even something we teach our kids.  But it&#39;s certainly true.  I think that if we ever find life on another world (or in space, etc.), it&#39;s unlikely to fall neatly into our mental boxes.  We need to learn how to expect the unexpected.  If we think of life more along the lines of coding (genes) and processes (like say, fire or rust), then we come up with a very different picture.  I&#39;m not saying rust is alive, by the way, but rather that life is chemistry, which is based on physics.  There&#39;s no magic involved.

The question of a virus being alive or dead is akin to &quot;how long is a piece of string?&quot; to me. Maybe there is no answer and there is no line between life and death. Death for people in the past is a situation that can be fixed today, and I&#39;m sure what is considered death for us today will be a minor situation in the hospitals of the future. Who is to say what is alive or dead when this demonstrates we can barely even classify what either of those states mean anyway? in this situation the line between the two states is so blurred. It is undeniable that life and death exist, but I think it is also quite possible that it is not a binary state, but instead a spectrum. For instance, I&#39;d say a lone carbon particle is more dead than a virus, but it&#39;s not as if a carbon particle does nothing at all either unless it&#39;s at absolute zero.

The reason viruses are excluded is usually because they don&#39;t have their own metabolism, but when thinking about animals I don&#39;t think they have a complete metabolism either: Vitamins are molecules that are absolutely necessary for the metabolism of an animal that they can&#39;t produce themselves. This is because those molecules are so common in their food that it&#39;s not really needed - food takes care of those. But that means animals outsource part of their essential metabolism to plants (or other animals if they&#39;re carnivores). How is this metabolism argument a problem for viruses but not for animals? \r<br>Life in general is adapted to its environment and this environment is filled with other forms of life, so it&#39;s no surprise that there are interdependences - life is a system of interdependent organisms and I&#39;ll advocate that viruses are part of this system any day.

The best example provided in this video, virusses. Neither truly alive, but also not truly dead. How?<br>Perhaps the simplest solution lies in the fact that we believe &#39;alive&#39; and &#39;dead&#39; are the ONLY states for all matter in existence.<br>These newly discovered Girusses, and along with them the Virophages, proof the existence of some form of micro-foodchain. Predator and prey, in a sense. So, you&#39;d call them alive, right? Yet the Girusses their similarities to ordinary virusses means that there are considerable roadblocks that can truly confirm this theory.<br><br>But what if they are neither? Not alive, nor dead, but in a state of being that so far is only possible on a micro scale. Undead, perhaps? Not-alive? Either way, it lies beyond our proper definition, one that we have yet to understand.<br>To claim that there even exists such a state of being, outside the two we are so familiar with, is of course not easily said or done. But, just in case, I&#39;ll leave it here for others to ponder on.
