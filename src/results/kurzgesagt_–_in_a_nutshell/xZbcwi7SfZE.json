World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity; Similar is the case of money stolen by a thief who hides the ill-gotten money and then misuses it or commits more misdeeds; \u201cwho does not owe it does not fear it\u201d. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies.

This is because of a few reasons:<br>1. Development for drugs takes many decades, especially for an antibiotic, as we must find a broad spectrum (which are relatively hard) to match the current antibiotics today. - Tbh, my opinion here.<br>2. For many years, we did not do any research, as companies did not realise the gravity of antibiotic resistance. They basically thought this is the end of bacterial infections. And did not invest in further research. <br>3. Even when companies do invest in research now, the drug soon becomes futile due to resistance (decades of research and money vs 5 yrs on the market). The company cannot even get the cash it invested back after its on the market. Basically, it&#39;s just not profitable. <br><br>Antibiotics are, again, in my opinion, an old technology that is not specialised enough. As my lecturer for microbiomes said, &quot;It&#39;s like killing an ant with a hammer.&quot; From what I learn, (which honestly isn&#39;t much) bacteriophages and synthetic biology sound to be the best bet against bacterial infections. <br>Sorry, if my explanations are a bit dodgy :P", "comment_date": "2019-05-10T10:32:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kitten Paws", "comment_text": "<b>not because your cold is annoying</b> isnt the cold caused by a virus not a bacteria? so wouldnt antibiotics not work on the cold?", "comment_date": "2019-05-10T10:13:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elle Beers", "comment_text": "What\u2019s the best way to survive as a bacteria?<br><br>Becoming a Harry Potter fan for some absolute reason", "comment_date": "2019-05-09T04:51:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "esbastow", "comment_text": "Get yur T4-47&#39;s troops we got a war to fight.", "comment_date": "2019-05-07T11:20:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lee taylor", "comment_text": "I agree, this sounds like plague ink", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T12:51:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lee taylor", "comment_text": "That is a Harry Potter bacteria", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T12:49:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aiman Syahmi Dzulkhairy", "comment_text": "What about using bacteriophage?

So it will become resistant to current antibiotics and science will develop some new ones to counter it either until the bug is fully wiped out or until humanity runs out of resources to do so.

In order to gain advantage in one area, energy must be given over to that and thus advantage in a different area must be lost. The only way to avoid this is to increase energy intake which in itself also causes problems in other ways, but many species, like bacteria, are too far into nitch categories to be able to really do this.

A bug that could kill hundreds of millions of people? Well, it is happening right now&gt;. We are in the process of creating a super bacterium. <br>Bacteria are among the oldest living things on this planet. The smallest thing we still consider life, they are masters of survival and can be found everywhere. Most bacteria are harmless to us. Your body hosts trillions of them, and they help you to survive. But others can invade your body, spread quickly, and kill you. <br>Millions of people used to die as result of bacterial infections. Until we developed a superweapon- antibiotics. Together with vaccinations, antibiotics revolutionized medicine and saved millions of lives. <br>Antibiotics kill the vast majority of susceptible bacteria fairly quickly, leaving only a small group of survivors that our immune system then deals with easily. How do antibiotics do this? Imagine a bacterium as a very complex machine with thousands of complex processes going on that keep it alive and active. Antibiotics disrupt this complex machinery, for example, by interfering with its metabolism, slowing down their growth significantly, so they are less of a threat. Other antibiotics attack DNA and prevent it from being replicated, which stops bacteria from multiplying, ultimately killing them. Or by simply ripping the outer layer of bacteria to shreds, so that their insides spill out and they die quickly. All of this without bothering body cells. But now, evolution is making things more complicated. By pure random chance, a small minority of the bacteria invading your body might have evolved a way to protect themselves. For example, by intercepting the antibiotics and changing the molecule so it becomes harmless. Or by investing energy in pumps that eject the antibiotics before they can do damage. A few immune bacteria are not that big of a deal, because the immune system can take care of them. But if they escape, they might spread their immunity.<br>How can bacteria spread immunity? First of all, bacteria have two kinds of DNA: the chromosome and small free-floating parts called plasmids, meaning they can hug each other and exchange those plasmids to exchange useful abilities. This way, immunity can be spread quickly through a population. Or, in a process called transformation, bacteria can harvest dead bacteria and collect DNA pieces. This even works between different bacteria species and can lead to superbugs, bacteria that are immune to multiple antibiotics. <br>A variety of superbugs already exist in the world. Especially hospitals are the perfect breeding ground for them. Humans have short memories. The horros of the pre-antibiotic era have been forgotten. Today, we treat this powerful medicine as a commodity instead of as the game-changing achievement of science that it is. This has led to a strange disconnect: hundreds of millions of people still don\u2019t have access to antibiotics in developing countries, while in other parts of the world antibiotics are prescribed too freely and taken without care. Antibiotic should be a last-resort drug, not something you take because your cold is annoying. Antoher serious problem is antibiotic use in meat production. At any particular point in time, humanity holds between 20 and 30 billion animal as livestock. To make meat cheaper, many animals are held in horrible conditions, in very tight spaces, and in unhygienic conditions, the perfect breeding ground for disease. So many animals are given antibiotics to kill as many bacteria as possible and prevnt them from getting sick. Because a cheeseburger has to cost a dollar. Unsurprisingly, as a result of this system, we have created more and more bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. To counteract this, we use a different antibiotics and we have another secret weapon: there are specific antibiotics that are used to wipe out bacteria that have developed resistance. There are stict rules for using these to avoid the creation of a superbacterium or so we thought. In late 2015, scary news arrived from china, resistance against colistin, a last-ditch antibiotic, had been discovered. Colistin is an old drug and was rarely used, because it can damage the liver.  So there was little resistance against it, which made it a great antibiotic of last resort for certain complex infections that occur in hospitals to fight bacteria that have become immune to a whole bunch of other drugs. So this mean bacteria resistance to colistin is very, very bad news. It might destroy a last line of defense and lead to a whole lot of dead people. <br>How could this happen? Millions of animals in Chinese pig farms have been given colistin for years. Resistant bacteria developed, spreading first from animal to animal, and then to human without being noticed. On a average day, there are over 100,000 flights on earth, kind of connecting every human on the planet.

I mean, aside from the fact that the person doing the research would die making it without proper protection and still would likely die if it got into the wild. <br><br>On the bright side, CRISPR is being used to created modified T-cells - some of which to target cancer cells, but I read a bit about people looking into it&#39;s use as an antibiotic. Even in the total absence of usable antibiotics, if we can create T-cells that fight every virus or bacteria that shouldn&#39;t be an issue.<br><br>Then again, an evil scientist trying to doom the world with a super plague could use that process to modify their own T cells to make themselves immune, and if the plague is fast enough it would pretty much wipe out the majority of humanity before someone else could isolate it and create a cure assuming anyone does so at all. Of course, that would be a little more specialized than the few hundred dollars it would take to create something that would also kill the scientist.<br><br>Humans have used biological warfare even before humans had the ability to make things like that, so it&#39;s not an unrealistic scenario. Humans even decided to bring a plague back to life after exterminating it&#39;s entire species, and you can actually download viral or bacterial DNA from such plagues, have a lap build it for you, and mail it to a residential address.

Goodluck&quot;  The other and MUCH bigger problem other then stupid people is that Making Antibiotics is not as easy as this video thinks it is. Yes new Antibiotics can be developed, but why would a company bankrupt themself on purpose? R&amp;D for Antibiotics is quite hard, You want a compound that A can be Patented (one distinct molecule) easy to synthesize and of NO RISK to people taking it. Then you need to test. This testing will devour Insane amounts of money AGAIN. the whole process of developing and releasing a new antibiotic costs approx 3-10 BILLION USD (YES!) Impossible for a startup and unjustifiable for a Big company on the stockmarket. Since a new effective antibiotic will be as said before be classified as &quot;Last resort&quot; there is very little demand and thanks to expiring patents its just not making money. So thats why we are FUCKED...did i say we? Well, i have a neat lab where i can grow Phage rather easily.
