Even when red dwarfs die, new ones are being created so do not think life will end in 10-15 trillion years. Gravity will pull in more gas, exploding stars will generate still more and as we drift thru space, the possibilities are endless. Who&#39;s to say that long after earth is a dead world, our solar system won&#39;t drift thru a hydrogen cloud somewhere in our &#39;s or another galaxy&#39;s area and have enough gas drawn into Jupiter for it to become a red dwarf? Besides, most likely, having a star is not required for life to survive. What about the moons revolving around our solar system with liquid ocean&#39;s beneath them? Many of these have liquid oceans not because of its location in relation to our sun but because of the tidal pressures from gravity from their larger planets. And...if they have the right kind of atmosphere, it could probably retain enough heat to not even freeze the surface. Personally, even including the expansion or the theory of the big freeze that some think await us eventually, I do not see the end coming. Look how we have evolved in just over the last few thousand years: Earth is a little more than 4 billion years old and yet the universe is a little less than 14 billion years of age. Thats almost a 10 billion year difference. Given that we are average in our universe, that means the first civilization was probably started about 6 billion years before us, give or take. Imagine what we might develop if we survive another 4 billion years. I have no doubt we could manipulate matter and gravity by then...perhaps converting dark matter to matter and creating our own hydrogen. For all we know, that is exactly why we exist: Some smart alien seeded our solar system to make a soft spot for life to land.", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T02:41:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cacodemon", "comment_text": "dwarf lol", "comment_date": "2022-02-10T04:11:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jerry Yang", "comment_text": "they did it again, they insulted the brow dwarves!", "comment_date": "2022-02-10T02:27:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jaehaerys", "comment_text": "But the closest red dwarf is more than 4 light years away!", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T09:19:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Etele", "comment_text": "Amazing!", "comment_date": "2022-02-08T22:02:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lancer HO HO HO ", "comment_text": "Proper classic my guy.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

Longer term you would have at least 2 drums inside such a structure spinning in opposite directions so the rotation does not create toque which could flip the drum.<br>-<br>So you could just turn the hole structure so it had less area was revealed to the sun, or have gaint cooling fins facing away from the star, secondly if you REALLY wanted to live on a planet you could just reflect light down with mirrors onto the dark side of the planet, again you are arriving from space and the last thing you would do is colonise the planet, you would set up your space infrastructure first like orbital rings, mass drivers, asteroid mining facilities etc. So making a giant mirror that can dynamically change it&#39;s reflectivity based on the stars output isn&#39;t actually as big of a job a you might think it was. All you would need to do is make it out of a lot of smaller mirrors which can rotate quickly.<br>-<br>Although in ~10k years I don&#39;t know why you are not starting just stripping stars down for their mass and throwing that into kugelblitz black holes to get your energy rather than relying on stars which only tun 5% of rest mass into energy, instead you can get 100%, and if you want something that is Star like just using a few kugelblitz black holes to heat up a shell which can re-emit the energy in the wavelength you want... as black holes give off x-rays to gamma rays, so you don&#39;t want to use the &quot;light&quot; directly.<br>-<br>but that means you are not losing mass to solar wind, although you would need to create a solar system covering magnetic field to protect you from interstellar radiation, but you could just have a giant lump of iron in the middle of you artificial star which as long as you didn&#39;t apply the heat evenly would convect and create a magnetic field, which would trap charges particles.<br>-<br>Although you may just leave a red dwarfs going just to turn Hydrogen into Tritium, Deuterium and He3 so then you can fuse them into heavier elements until you can&#39;t get any more energy out, at which point you would use a gaint particle accelerator to create even heavier elements. Because fusing protium\u00a0is a pain in the ass and you would almost certainly leave that to stars if you wanted to make heavier elements or if you want energy, just throw it into a kugelblitz black hole.", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T23:50:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Etheoma", "comment_text": "Na, I don&#39;t think Red Dwarfs will be our final solution, as even a black dwarf has a stupid amount of mass, which if you have kugelblitz black holes you can turn that mass into energy with 100% efficiency, even if you just use a regular black hole you can just throw the mass from the white dwarf into it and gain energy from it falling in, which I believe is about 60% efficient.", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T23:21:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Constanza Medel", "comment_text": "Canal culiao weno", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T21:10:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ludo", "comment_text": "anyone get the little prince reference at the start and end of the video", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T10:51:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SirJellyfish", "comment_text": "Sorry but humans will probably die WAY before we have to rely on red dwarfs *cough cough covid-19", "comment_date": "2020-06-17T16:23:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Previous", "comment_text": "The little prince reference!", "comment_date": "2020-06-17T14:16:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gordon Goodman", "comment_text": "If a red dwarf is our last hope, we are fooked.

We have only yet existed as modern humans for only a few thousand years (200Ky anatomically, but likely &lt;70Ky intellectually). After much less than one million years, humanity will have evolved and changed into species that would no longer be considered homo sapiens sapiens \u2013 the you and me beings as we are now all over the world. After millions of years, any descendants of humans would be unrecognizable as humans. And, that is IF we survive that long. Natural extinction-level mega-catastrophes are bound to happen by then, and \u2013 even more likely \u2013 our own man-made planet-wide disasters are likely to throw us back into a stone-age existence much sooner, like within hundreds or thousands of years.* To talk about what humanity will do when the sun extinguishes in billions of years is preposterous! Discussions of what we can do when the universe approaches heat death in trillions of years... well, that is just an unfathomable time span, indistinguishable from eternity to us humans. Let&#39;s face it \u2013 it is not just your life that is but a mere instant of cosmic time, but the entire existence of the human race is much less than a blink in the cosmos. <br><br>* Don&#39;t count on humans persisting by finding safe harbor within other worlds. Though we are on track to sending humans to other planets and moons within our solar system, since faster-than-light travel is not physically possible, we are not likely to colonize beyond our own solar system. Human colonies and outposts outside of Earth will require the most sophisticated technology for life support, making them way more fragile than life on Earth, since any critical failure will spell doom. Reaching another star system would be a voyage of multiple generations, during which the pioneers would be highly vulnerable and helpless. Plus we can&#39;t be certain that the target destination is hospitable enough, nor would it be feasible to change destinations mid-course. Then there&#39;s the limitation that terraforming another planet would take dozens if not hundreds of human lifespans, and even by then the target planet would not be as livable as the Earth we have evolved within. Sorry \u2013 I&#39;d love to be more optimistic, but these are the realities. <br><br>Notwithstanding the anthropocentric pandering, Kurzgesagt rocks!

The universe is not eternal. even the most massive objects, black holes with billions of times the mass of our sun evaporate over time (10^92 - 10^93 years). After that there is nothing, no energy produced and thus no life. Without life, time has no meaning. the universe will span on to infinity with no change and nothing happening. It will be dead, done, with nothing. Existentially distressing I know, but do not despair. The sooner we unite as a species, the sooner we understand it all.

To me, it seems like this would have a lot of potential as an &#39;ideal&#39; colonist setting, if longevity is our concern (a sun that won&#39;t get too hot as ours will in a billion years, or, if fossil fuel burning continues at its present levels unchecked, a few hundred).", "comment_date": "2016-04-06T03:43:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JohnSalamii", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-VPyLaJFM&amp;t=1m41s\">1:41</a> so cute\ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2016-04-05T19:38:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JohnSalamii", "comment_text": "Siriusly, Universe is 13.8 billion year old, but red dwarfs are can Live 10 trillion years!

We evolved into a species that need the energy of the sun to survive. (duh). We humans need a planet that resembles earth in many ways. <br><br>This makes me wonder. If animals evolved to live and survive on earth in different habitats, don&#39;t you think that life could be possible on other planets? (if we evolved... so did other species...)<br><br>Think about it. Our planet has water, plants and animals. We cannot survive without the Sun or water. without that there will be no food.<br><br>My theory is that other life forms evolved to suit their planets. We should stop looking for life on planets that resemble earth and start searching elsewhere. <br><br>I don&#39;t believe that we will ever find life on planets that resemble earth... that would make no sense. <br><br>People don&#39;t have to agree with me or anything, this is just what I think. <br><br>let&#39;s use an example.<br>We need a planet that is close to earths size. not too close or too far from the sun.

If a Black Dwarf could exist, and it became that cold. At one point wouldn&#39;t it be so cold that it wouldn&#39;t destory anything that came close to it? But would it still be liquid? It would it be more like a Gass planet or what ever? Just being a cloud trapped in the shape of a star or what not? Could you fly into it and survive? Could you hover just above it and survive? Could you go trough it? These are questions i have.... HAHA! I tried looking around a little Online but i didn&#39;t find anything that actually answered my question. It&#39;s funny how there are all these fact videos and fact sites but they never take those silly little questions and give them a decent answer. xD I know since the Universe is supposedly &#39;&#39;too young&#39;&#39; to have any Black Dwarf around these are questions that can&#39;t be answered as a fact. Wich is why everyting anyone could say is just speculation. But my question is rather a &#39;&#39;Does the speculation make it possible for the possible black dwarf to be so cold or what ever that you could float on it? Lond on it? or go trough it without dying or sufering?&#39;&#39;. I ask the important questions! Imagine being able to float on something that once used to be a star. That would be just fucking awesome.... But seeing as The Big Bang Theory is just that, a theory.... <br><br>That also opens the doors for the Universe being an Infinity old. That theory has never been proven wrong. But scientist hate the word infinity because that&#39;s not something they can calculate because even if you take Infinity minus 100 Billion it&#39;s still Infinity. It&#39;s no less.... And no matter how much you add to it it&#39;s not any more. Infinity is just that... Infinity. So if the Universe is infinite old, then a Black Dwarf could exist. But seeing as they are black and tiny they would be very hard to spot. It&#39;s a Black dot floating around in black space. It would only be visible as it travels infront of something visible. But seeing as Space is so huge picking up that kinda motion would be hard now wouldn&#39;t it? I&#39;d asume so... Because seeing a Star move infornt of another star isn&#39;t really something we can se because even tough they are moving fast they are so far apart that for us to see motion we would have to watch for millions of years just to see some minor changes. From a star being on the right side of another star to being on the left side.... That would take a long time. So the whole Black Dwarf theory is not yet proven because they don&#39;t think the Universe is old enough... <br><br>Or rather because the Universe is to God damn big to prove the first theory to prove another theory that in turn proves a third theory that rpoves half a million other theories. HAHA! Most of the Universe is one giant theory.... Because most of it we can&#39;t see or feel or know because.... Well, we don&#39;t even know how much we see. How much of what we see is actually there. And.... Mind blowing. Try thinking about the entire Universe. Ahaha, You can&#39;t. You can try but you can&#39;t. Human minds are rather limited in that sense. The things on earth can be mind blowing. The entire Universe wich we don&#39;t even know how big it is... Well, that&#39;s just not a thing we&#39;re able to do at the moment. That&#39;s why i love the Universe.... It&#39;s the one thing anyone with half a brain can argue on. I mean there is no one that can say for sure that there are no pink unicorns that shit ice cream because no one has seen all of the Universe. Not anyone alive now atleast. Naturally it all depends on how you see now. Is now now? Or is now future or past or present in the.... Ok, i&#39;ll quit. The thing is, this makes sense because it doesn&#39;t make any sense. That&#39;s just the Universe. You can speculate and all this shit. But the Universe is not bound by any human made laws. The Universe is bound by The Universe. It is it&#39;s own law..... <br><br>And we haven&#39;t even started understanding it&#39;s laws. We just think we have a few ideas of how some aspects work in the Part of the Universe we know exist. What is beyond that is another story. Beyond space as we know it it might actually blow from all sides. Or it might be pink. YOU DON&#39;T KNOW!

Moving on now. If you don&#39;t accept it, you won&#39;t get the next part.&quot; The way that &#39;In a Nutshell&#39; is communicating science is the same way that religion has gone about spreading spiritual belief systems since the dark ages: Say what YOU believe with total conviction, drop the mic, and walk out.

If you comfort yourself in the darkness of night with the warm cuddly blanket of nihilism, that&#39;s fine. But when you stand up and claim the role of educator, and then you sell your personal beliefs as scientific fact, without a caveat or a &quot;maybe,&quot; or the hint of a suggestion that there are other possibilities... You do a disservice to the role you took, and to every person who comes to you seeking answers.<br><br>It&#39;s not an unfair or glaringly wrong conclusion to extrapolate the laws of thermodynamics and the measured expansion of the universe to imply that heat-death is where its all heading, but given the extreme brevity of humanity&#39;s observations of the universe, as well as -- ya&#39; know: the fact that anything exists in the first place...

The matter-of-fact way that this channel has, many times implied or outright stated that &quot;things are like this and there is no competing theory,&quot; influences minds. I&#39;ve seen it in your comment section; Seen young people asking, &quot;Is this really true?!&quot; and commenting &quot;Wow, it&#39;s bleak to think that...&quot; about things you present as absolutes that the scientific community knows are very much in question, require further study, and are up for debate.<br><br>These videos and this channel&#39;s statements are not irrefutably right. The many alternate possibilities you ignore are equally, not irrefutably right. They are merely the known possibilities. And it is the responsibility of anyone who climbs up the soapbox to act as educator - especially in the name of science - to make clear the difference between opinion and hypothesis; hypothesis and theory; theory and fact. This channel too often skips the middle two and presents the author&#39;s opinion as absolute truth.<br><br>Please review your practices.
