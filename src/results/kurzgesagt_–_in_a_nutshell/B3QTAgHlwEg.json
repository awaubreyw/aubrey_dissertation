Whether you will go there and 2. If you find you&#39;re not on your way there, I&#39;ll tell you how to get there.<br><br>Only two kinds of people get to Heaven: perfect people, and forgiven sinners.<br><br>What is perfect? Well, not stealing regardless of how insignificant it may seem, not saying a single evil word against anyone - not to mention God sees our thought life. And like a judge in court, a penalty has to be paid when evil is done and laws are broken (e.g. if a murderer was let off in court there would be uproar so how much more God)?<br><br>In short - we arent perfect, at all. And rather than Heaven, God, if giving us justice, will have to make us pay for our crimes by death and eternal damnation in an everlasting fire and torment. THAT\u2019s how much God hates sin.<br><br>BUT:<br>There is a way that we can be saved. AND completely forgiven. Jesus - the Son of God - came down to live a perfect life without sin, conquering all evil and the devil&#39;s sinful, lustful traps that so easily ensnare us. Jesus overcame all of that, and was then sentenced to death on a cross.<br><br>While on the cross, God poured out the anger and wrath of sin on His Son - Jesus took OUR fine of damnation in our place. That\u2019s how much He loves us. Unbearable pain and being separated from God. EVERY single evil thought, word or deed that doesnt line up with God&#39; perfection, every sin you ever have/will commit knowingly or unknowingly, Jesus took the complete, undiluted wrath for. <br><br>And, like a fine in court, Jesus paying for it means that we can go free. Not just free, but we can experience God&#39;s love and be completely forgiven and saved from Hell as all punishment was carried on the cross and crucified there for all who believe. Instead, we can live immortally and eternally in Heaven.<br><br>After His death, Jesus rose again on the third day, demonstrating His sovereignty and power and victory over not just the sins of this life, but DEATH.<br><br>GOD HAS VICTORY OVER DEATH.<br><br>Soon Jesus will return and those who died believing in Him will RISE from their graves and go to Heaven, and those who rejected His salvation, message and teachings will suffer Hell to pay their deserved fines for all eternity without a second chance.<br><br>This is your chance now.<br><br>He wants you to repent (turn away from your sin and pursue God&#39;s perfect intent for your life, striving in the opposite direction). <br><br>It\u2019s not only about escaping damnation, it\u2019s entering God\u2019s healing as well. God has a plan for your life, a plan that involves you being recreated into His perfect moral image AGAIN as we were before the sin in the garden. He loves you and wants to cleanse you - He will give you the strength. Now we can walk in His strength, experiencing His love, being taught what it means to be part of His family and too be given victory over sin and death. <br><br>He wants you to have faith in Him, letting Him take the wheel of your life (dont forget, when you&#39;re doing God&#39;s will you&#39;re following perfect love - following Him you can be certain that you are never doing the wrong thing- imagine how cleansing that feels).<br><br>What if I still sin when Ive accepted Christ&#39;s death and resurrection on my behalf?<br><br>Thats why Christ died. For your SIN. When God looks at you, striving towards Him or even falling, He sees the righteous life of Christ covering you you in place of your current, sinful reality. For those who strive to turn from sin, regardless of the pitfalls, God sees Jesus&#39;s life in place of your inability, and His blood so that yours will never have to be shed for your sin.<br><br>Religion = rules to be saved <br><br>The gospel = Christ saved us already we just have to believe it by faith alone in Christ alone. If you lack faith (as I did before), pray. He will make it strong in time. Trust Him as you would trust those close to you. He created you and knows you inside out. <br><br>Sound opposite? Thanks to our natural sinful nature, it likely does, but God knows our weakness and struggles and pitfalls with sin. THAT&#39;S why He wrestled (and won against) every temptation YOU ever faced. Just pray to God, tell Him you are struggling and are unsure - God can and will work with even the slightest desire within you to follow Him and be free from sin.<br>Ask Him to make you willing - if you are willing to be made willing, pray for it, simply shut your eyes and talk to Him.<br><br>When Satan knows people have left His camp, He won\u2019t take it lying down, He often tries harder with more trials and temptations. But Satan cannot do anything beyond what God permits, He will only allow things that will strengthen you or bring you closer to Him if you cling to Him and trust in the promises of His word.<br><br>Where do I start to learn about God&#39;s plan and His promises to me? Well, these Bible relate directly to Christ&#39;s life and our redemption, check out Matthew (or Luke if you want a more detailed account). Do it in stages and try and imagine the events and miracles as they really happened - the Bible is a true account after all.<br><br>And when and note it says WHEN, you struggle and fall on this lifelong process, know you can pray for forgiveness, dust yourself off again and get up because Jesus already bore our guilt and shame. remember that Jesus is the ultimate foundation, the reason we are given Heaven in the first place. <br><br>If you lack faith (as i did for a long time) pray. He desires to give strength and faith to His children in time when they ask Him.<br><br>If you want to let Jesus into your life, even to help you to take the first step, then read through this prayer here to get the gist of it and then just say it - trust God and give it all to Him because He has the - perfect - master plan. If you take a step - just a step - towards Him, He will take a step towards you.<br><br>NOTE: YOU ARE NEVER TOO SINFUL THAT GOD CANNOT BRING YOU BACK HOME.<br><br>Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and there is nothing that I can do to save myself. I confess my complete helplessness to forgive my own sin or to work my way to heaven. <br>At this moment I trust Christ alone as the One who bore my sin when He died on the cross. I believe that He did all that will ever be necessary for me to stand in your holy presence. I thank you that Christ was raised from the dead as a guarantee of my own resurrection. <br>As best as I can, I now transfer my trust to Him. <br>I am grateful that He has promised to receive me despite my many sins and failures. Father, I take you at your word. <br>I thank you that I can face anything now that you are my Savior. <br>Thank you for the assurance that you will walk with me through the deep valley. Thank you for hearing this prayer.<br>In Jesus\u2019 Name,  <br>Amen", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T13:35:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RAFAEL M.

Their only weakness is their soft body which make them vulnerable to the bites of other Ants and also to the chemical attack by other Ants. And in my case, the weaver Ants I had been following were completed replaced by the Yellow Crazy Ants. It surprised me as I could not believe that Yellow Crazy ant could stand against these larger sized aggressive ants, that is until I saw the Yellow Crazy Ants attack the Weaver ants who were carrying dead Camponotus major towards their nest.

THESE UNIVERSES HAVE BIG BANGS IN THEM TOO AND SO ON....... . THESE PROCESS WAS STOPPED WHEN THE LAST UNIVERSE WAS TOO SMALL AND DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY AN SPACE FOR FORMING THE BIG BANG WAS IMPOSSIBLE. THE LAST UNIVERSE IS OUR UNIVERSE.

The game would have different game modes where every player plays as an insect in a shooter style game.

The ants would mainly melee but you could also spit acid.<br><br>Another game mode would be bees vs wasps. I would try to keep the game as realistic as possible, but obviously I&#39;d have to take some liberties to make the game more fun and playable. And don&#39;t worry, there wouldn&#39;t be any spiders.<br><br>Imagine the attacking team has to take over outposts (slowly capturing them when there are no enemy ants in the area). Once all outposts are captured, they can attack the main base where one player can become the Queen who has special abilites and more health. Destroying larvae would reduce the enemy team&#39;s reinforcements (like Battlefront 2017) and you win by either killing the queen, destroying the enemy base, or wiping out every enemy ant. 100 vs 100.<br><br>When you first start the game, the very first thing you saw would be an option; PG Mode, or True Nature Mode.<br><br>PG Mode would make the game more PG.<br><br>True Nature Mode would allow blood, dismemberment, and brutal takedowns and death animations.", "comment_date": "2020-09-02T23:28:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raafael", "comment_text": "finally sub", "comment_date": "2020-09-02T23:20:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MJRainH2o", "comment_text": "I heard &quot;and as we all know empires always...&quot; and i was like &quot;empires always fall!&quot; Then you said &quot;never have enough&quot; and got dissapointed", "comment_date": "2020-09-02T23:06:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Shiman", "comment_text": "Aren&#39;t all the ants (except the queen) male?

(they&#39;d use pheromones amongst themselves) The ants in question would be at least cat-sized so as to be able to fight human armies and hold their territory, and perhaps they would have mega cities in a magical forest with trees hundreds of meters tall and be often in conflict with local wood elven tribes that no longer have enough game to hunt because of the ever-expanding city states. <br><br>I can even imagine the main character as a prospective young queen-ant narrowly escaping the Palace after a coup by one of her sisters, fleeing with just a few loyal servants outside of the forest-City, and then embarking on a long journey to reclaim her throne that would take her through the territory of hostile Wood-elves, dwarven mountain cities and human kingdoms and/or empires. The main character would be an ant raised in a collectivist gynarchic culture, so even though she, as a royal of her nation, would be well-educated in history, politics and foreign cultures and customs, her interactions with human societies and her alien perspectives and thought-monologues could be amazing to write, especially if she were to make close friends and gather a party of humanoid allies eventually. <br><br>It&#39;s just an idea that struck me when kurzgesagt made the comparison with high elves, but as an anthropology major I really find the idea of human and ant societies interacting directly and having a shared history (riddled with wars, fear and negative stereotypes) fascinating!

The Tribulations are coming very soon! Jesus will be returning near the end of the tribulations! Repent now! Turn away from your sins and follow Jesus Christ who died for your sins!

Many nations are going to form an alliance and attack Israel. There are going to be famines and tons of extreme destructive weather and sickness. The world is going to follow the New World Order in which everyone is united under one government and it will be an evil one. They will pretend to be peaceful and loving, but when the time comes they will tear the world apart and start killing everyone.\r<br>&quot;For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\r<br>(Matthew 24:7 King James Version)&quot;\r<br>&quot;And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.\r<br>(Luke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3QTAgHlwEg&amp;t=21m11s\">21:11</a> King James Version)&quot;\r<br>&quot;And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke\r<br>(Joel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3QTAgHlwEg&amp;t=2m30s\">2:30</a> King James Version)&quot;\r<br>.\r<br>You are all sinners, just like me!

Just like how humans aspire to conquer other planets and eventually other star systems, those ants didn&#39;t stop with one tree. Their expansionist nature made them bridge trees using branches and leaves. Their  territory spans over one thousand square meters.<br><br>And war, being the fundamental part to this expansionist nature, is inevitable most of the time.

Ask for forgiveness and to be given the gift of salvation and to be sealed by the Holy Spirit. REPENT!\r<br>.\r<br>Then continue to walk in His light, and hold His hand and let Him guide you through life and protect you. No one can take you out of His hand.\r<br>&quot;28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.\r<br>\r<br>29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father&#39;s hand.\r<br>\r<br>30 I and my Father are one.\r<br>(John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3QTAgHlwEg&amp;t=10m28s\">10:28</a>-30 King James Version)&quot;\r<br>.\r<br>&quot;40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.\r<br>(John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3QTAgHlwEg&amp;t=6m40s\">6:40</a> King James Version)&quot;\r<br>.\r<br>Thanks be to God forever and ever!\r<br>Glory be to God forever and ever!\r<br>God bless you!\r God bless President Trump!\r<br>Amen.", "comment_date": "2020-08-31T04:41:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Maxine Finn Foxen", "comment_text": "Wow!

IT&#39;S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES\r<br>ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK &#39;READ MORE&#39;)\r<br>\r<br>There are some things that you should know:\r<br>\r<br>1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:\r<br>\r<br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3QTAgHlwEg&amp;t=3m23s\">3:23</a> &quot;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3QTAgHlwEg&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a> &quot;As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:&quot;\r<br>\r<br>It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.\r<br>\r<br>2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:\r<br>\r<br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3QTAgHlwEg&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a> &quot;For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Ro 5:8 &quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It&#39;s the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That\u2019s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won&#39;t go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won\u2019t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.\r<br>\r<br>3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).\r<br>\r<br>Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.\r<br>\r<br> Heb <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3QTAgHlwEg&amp;t=9m22s\">9:22</a> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.\r<br>\r<br>You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him. \r<br>\r<br>Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.\r<br>\r<br>Ro 10:9,10;13 &quot;that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:\r<br>\r<br>\u201dDear Lord Jesus I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I repent and turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism..", "comment_date": "2020-08-31T00:09:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dornatum", "comment_text": "We need this kingdom of ants in Silksong", "comment_date": "2020-08-31T00:09:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Help me reach 1k subs Before 2021", "comment_text": "literally 99.9% of people wont see this but god bless you and have a wonderful day ps i am trying to reach 100 subs by the end of the year thanks", "comment_date": "2020-08-31T00:09:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Goose Egg", "comment_text": "Notice the ape in the trees in the intro", "comment_date": "2020-08-31T00:09:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uac9c\ud3ad", "comment_text": "\uc57d12000\ub4f1...\u314b\u314b\u314b", "comment_date": "2020-08-31T00:09:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "unchartedexe", "comment_text": "This is the most beautiful video yet!", "comment_date": "2020-08-31T00:08:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Billy Mack Reds", "comment_text": "Amazing.

For more than a decade the queen of the weaver ants has sat immobile in her chambers within her nest. She is the master of her children by the merit of luck and and the master of thousand trees by the might of her inexhaustible armies. She is a swollen creature, writing with the growth of a hundred eggs at a time. She is the lord of her colony, for whom a thousand insects are sacrificed every day, so that she will never die of starvation.<br>Yet even in her stagnant state, the queen of the weaver ants continues her endless vigil. Countless ants cross the life-infested mess of the canopy, guided only by their own chemical secretions. Vast armies give battle in her name on uncounted plants. Greatest amongst them are the super majors, unusually large ants whose roles are the most hazardous.

It is characterized by all prey that is captured or found being carried back to the nest for consumption, either in part or in full. The alternative of moving brood to the food site is logistically unfeasible due to widespread resource dispersal which would require brood to spread out in order to feed. However, some species which live within polydomous nests, as well as Oecophylla longinoda, have managed to solve this problem by virtue of their polydomy. In most species, however, widespread brood dispersal for feeding would require more guards that are, as well, widespread from the colony in order to protect all feeding brood equally. To add to this, when left outside, brood are prone to death either by environmental factors or predation.<br><br>The mandibular glands used to secrete these pheromones are likely the mos primitive site of pheromone production in ants, though it&#39;s still usual in Ponerinae and some Myrmecinae. However, Crematogaster inflata is an exception as it produces such from enlarged metapleural glands which are located at the backend of the mesosoma, analogous to a human chest. Dolichoderinae, Nothomyrmecia, and Aneuictus simoni produce it using their anal glands. Formicine ants, though, use their mandibular glands which produce a substance that then gets secretions of venom and a set of secretions from the Dufour&#39;s gland added to it. The release of this pheromone is met with special postures and behavior wherein the worker bends its gaster forward between its legs and sprays the product of both glands. Oecophylla, Crematogaster, and some other Myrmecinae as well as all Dolichoderinae lift their gaster up over their thorax and the secretion acts as both a pheromone and a predatory repellent.<br><br>Many pheromones expressed by ants are a mix of several substances with variation in the mix possibly being a way to differentiate between signals, between or within the same species, to produce variations in response. Within Oecophylla there is also a blend in pheromone components beween populations as well as members of the same population. The secretions of certain components is affected by age, with different components having different effects. This could be related to the fact that ants engage in centrifugal temporal polyethism wherein their role changes based on age.<br><br>Not much is currently known about the rates of extinction among ants, especially regarding how they vary in space. However, it is known that Myrmeciinae, Oecophylla, and several other genera have gone extinct from the northern hemisphere which is in line with colder climates having higher rates of extinction.

Humans are the only creatures to have created castles, due to our superior intellect and opposable thumbs, allowing us to grip tools required for making castles. Castles have only ever been found within human civilisations from the latest of human history. Ants on the other hand could not create a large building, typically of the medieval period, fortified against attack with thick walls, battlements, towers, and in many cases a moat, due to them having such an inferior intellect to humans as well as not having enough strength to carry the tools and materials required to create a castle, and don&#39;t even get me started on the use that a castle would have for an ant (very minimal).<br><br>I would like to see Kuzgesagt remove this statement from the video as it is misleading.
