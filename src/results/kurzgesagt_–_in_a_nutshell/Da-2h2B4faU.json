And gravity is also not understood (see cosmology, see dark matter, see not understood coicidences like the &quot;flatness&quot;). Not even electrodynamics is able to describe the dynamic of charged point particles. We have to first clear up the physics which has been done after Newton, until we are ready to go on. Taking the standard model as starting point is already bad. The standard model is obviously not a very fundamental model. Because it has way too many parameters.

not just with reason it\u2019s for everything if you have a scale there will be an infinite number of points no matter the unit you use to travel what is something made out of what contains it what happens next what happened before etc infinite is in nature the reason why equations break with it is because we are using a piece of it it\u2019s like trying to finish a puzzle with only 20 pieces the first part about an infinite scale I call the infinite zoom principle and the 2nd part about infinite nature I call the panfinite nature principle these three principles alone mean that a true theory of everything is impossible we would have to understand an infinite number of things which is obviously impossible (unless we are talking about a technological singularity) yeah I\u2019ve

God spoke and it was, and it was good. But the more I learn about these new theories, it\u2019s amazing how far we have come. In particular I\u2019m fascinated with light. Light is both a wave and a particle. According to Einstein\u2019s photoelectric experiment, light particles (photons), which have no mass, can collide with an electron and cause a change in the electron\u2019s kinetic energy. Light is also a wave so it can fill an entire dark room with its brilliance, if it were only a particle, it could only hit what is directly in front of it. Lastly, light may be the only thing that could have existed at the beginning of the universe because it has no mass. All other forces of nature, gravity, weak force, strong force, they all fall apart because there is no space in the beginning and there is no mass. Gravity is an attractive force between two objects with mass that are between two points, but if there is no mass or distance, then gravity cannot exist, according to the Big Bang theory. <br><br>What I find most striking is the creation account of the Bible mentions that the first thing God created is light. \u201cLet there be light\u201d. <br><br>Light is also something God uses to describe his people. \u201cYou are the light of the world\u201d. \u201cAnd let your light shine upon others\u201d \u201cthe darkness has not overcome it\u201d. <br><br>I love my physics professor, he taught me a lot like stuff above.  :).

Not to mention that we are just simple parts of the universe trying to understand itself which doesn\u2019t make much sense, and consciousness is mainly just neurons firing and chemical reactions in the brain but we somehow manage to realize what our realization is by realizing it, and in my opinion consciousness and life don\u2019t coincide with science simply because if we really are made of these little atoms that make bigger things that make cells then can cells really be considered alive, is a star alive for being able to produce materials that are used to make other stars, is chemistry and chemical reactions just live but in a grand scale of all matter. And then if all this manages to be true how is consciousness considered a special thing, but to be fair it could all be a simulation, or we are all alone and making up a dream, WHO KNOWS this is where science breaks down, these theories in science that can\u2019t use science to understand them, we can\u2019t measure how our consciousness works and if we are alive or a \u201cbeing\u201d in the universe it just doesn\u2019t work together and another thing out perception of the universe is completely based on our senses and our small primate brains, and our human experiences, there could be tons of forces that don\u2019t act on us but we simply don\u2019t have the senses to detect them, we think we have these complete puzzles put together but in reality most of the puzzle is invisible and in other universes or dimensions, or is made of stuff we can\u2019t interact with bla bla bla, just saying science to me seems like our way to comfort the scary thoughts we have about things we don\u2019t know, we can test these things and get the same results like we have theories for how things happen but you could cut paper into a shape with a knife and say that knife+paper=certain shape, but (I don\u2019t want to even say \u201creality\u201d cause that\u2019s a whole mess of its own) in reality you can cut the paper with scissors, or use a box cutter, or even just rip it really really carefully and get that shape, we have no way of trying every single possible outcome of every possible thing that\u2019s possible, and what if really the scissors and knife were just the tools that we were ALLOWED when outside that box of our dimension there\u2019s really exponentially infinite more possibilities but existential crisis\u2019 over thanks for reading and  sorry for the headache and just remember that this entire thing is literally just a bunch of lines and dots that you\u2019re perceiving by pixels on this phone changing and then photons bouncing off the phone and going into you\u2019re eyes which tell you\u2019re brain something that it can try to comprehend, even thought the brain is just a bunch of tissues which are made of tons of cells which are made of dead things that can\u2019t think", "comment_date": "2022-05-08T09:30:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GoogleCat426", "comment_text": "ahh, that explains why I&#39;ve heard some people say that there are 10 dimensions and some only 4.", "comment_date": "2022-05-08T08:19:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ohits Bre", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t understand\u2026\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T07:53:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LifeOnMars", "comment_text": "I really like science, but the stuff we learn in school is so boring.

I was bad at math and got poor grades, the shame and guilt killed all my motivation to do science then and pursue answers because school made me believe I was just too stupid for all this science stuff, and science is for big-brained people. Now that I&#39;m old, working a normal job etc, I believe that science is the pursuit of truth and I want to try again even if I&#39;m small brained.

(if we can even call it a particle) instead of finding a particle and then trying to find the particle that makes up that particle? I think it makes more sense to think that this particle could not interact with the universe, because it would be very small, and would have positive energy, so, as every particle has an anti-particle, there would also be a particle opposite to this one, that is, a negative particle, if they have different values, they will feel strongly attracted to each other, forming larger particles, and if they were equal they repel each other, generating energy....

So whos to say that there isn&#39;t another universe where <b>I</b> specifically don&#39;t exist but my identity does? say if there were some guy completely different from me physically.. for example named Lee and he was an African American from Ohio with a relatively different upbringing. If he moved or ended up in my place of residence at a certain time around the point in my life where I picked up certain notions of self identification, and say he met everyone that I&#39;ve met throughout my life which in turn taught him the same life lessons, and he also picked up my same lifestyle as well from being molded into me.... in essence he is that universes version of me and in some truth is me just as much as I&#39;m just another version of him..... <br><br>or to separate myself from the theory and put it into a real world concept I guess. There&#39;s probably a universe out there where there&#39;s not an Albert Einstein that existed to discover and look into the relativity of time. Or say if the American settlers were to never settle in north America or even discover it... how would the American region look if it was only inhabited by the natives even until this day. or what if another group of powers would&#39;ve won one of the world wars? what if there was an Armageddon event that actually occurred in 2012 or what if it already happened? <br><br>to put it simply, everything is or isn&#39;t what it is based off of what cause it to be similar to other things of its nature, and at all times there&#39;s a universe were something identical but slightly different exists in turn causing other occurrences to be different.. and that goes for people, places, ideologies, sciences, and data. I mean shit there could be a multiverse where other universes &quot;don&#39;t exist&quot; and aren&#39;t perceived. and tbh sometimes I feel like I live in that one based off of how other people talk about it lmaoooo \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T08:07:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muhammad Nurhamdani", "comment_text": "Funny how this got recommend after I watch Spider-Man No Way Home", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T07:59:31Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Nate", "comment_text": "String theory....multi-dimensional reality....and matter displacement...all real", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T18:14:33Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Pedro Rodrigues", "comment_text": "Like if you\u2019re here because of Spider-Man!", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T14:13:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sparky", "comment_text": "When he said there\u2019s 10 dimensions I was like\u2026.

It doesn&#39;t mean the fish exists outside of their effects, but they experience life so differently from us they&#39;re incapable of understanding how those effects work or even that they exist. Gravity feels different in water than in air but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not gravity. Because we can experience it both ways we can understand that, but the fish (even if brainy) doesn&#39;t have that luxury. It has senses developed for the environment it evolved in. Even organisms that once had fully functional eyes lose that functionality once they start evolving in deep caves because every ability carries a cost and that cost is not worth paying once you don&#39;t need that function.

It\u2019s a little lengthy but I guarantee you\u2019ll be able to understand it (I hope)<br><br>Once upon a time we thought the smallest, most fundamental thing that makes up everything, was the atom. We now know that you can get smaller (and more fundamental if you will) than that. <br><br>It turns out that the atom is made up of 3 particles: Proton, Neutron, and the electron. For awhile, we thought that was as small as you could go. But we now know that the Proton and Neutron are made up of smaller particles called Quarks (we\u2019re pretty sure that the electron is fundamental and nothing makes up the Electron other than energy\u2026<br><br>So now we ask ourselves, what is more fundamental than a Quark? What is smaller? In other words, what makes a Quark? Is it another particle that\u2019s even smaller? We don\u2019t know. This is where String Theory comes in.<br><br>String Theory suggests that it does get smaller. The tiniest, most fundamental building blocks of matter and the universe are tiny strings. Little filaments of energy that vibrate and dance around (as seen at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=5m01s\">5:01</a>). And every fundamental sub atomic particle in the universe was made by these vibrating strings. If a string vibrates this way, then an electron is made. If it vibrates another way, then a Quark is made. If it vibrates in another way, then a neutrino pops out\u2026 so on and so on<br><br>It also turns out that the math behind String Theory tells us that our Universe has 10 dimensions instead of just the 4 that we know. 9 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal dimension (AKA time). When these strings vibrate, they aren\u2019t just vibrating in our 3 dimensions (up/down, left/right, forward/backward). Instead they are vibrating in 9 different dimensions. I dare not try to explain this further<br><br>SIDE NOTE: There seems to be confusion as to whether String Theory suggests that there are 10 or 11 dimensions. It depends on if you are talking about \u201cclassic\u201d String Theory or a similar version of String Theory called \u201cM-Theory\u201d One of them typically states 10, the other 11. It also depends on the source you look at. Some sources use those two theories interchangeably. It\u2019s all kinda confusing<br><br>To also add one more thing that is very important\u2026.<br><br>The thing scientists are most interested about concerning String Theory is less of anything I mentioned above but instead something called  \u201cQuantum Gravity\u201d<br><br>Einstein\u2019s Theory of General Relativity is extremely accurate and has been one of the most useful tools for understanding the universe around us. But it only answers problems for all the large scale things in the universe: Gravity, Black Holes, Time, Light etc\u2026<br><br>The other side of the coin is Quantum Mechanics. Which deals with all of the smallest things in the universe: Atoms, subatomic particles, a whole bunch of other behaviors and phenomena at very tiny scales, etc\u2026<br><br>Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are the two most accurate and all-encompassing branches of science known to Man. However, they don\u2019t work together. Quantum Mechanics doesn\u2019t work with large scale stuff and Relativity doesn\u2019t work at Quantum levels. So you might think that one of them obviously has to be wrong then. But they aren\u2019t. Again, there is no problem scientists have ever thrown at these two fields that doesn\u2019t get solved, except when you try to marry the two together. Bringing the two together successfully is something called \u201cQuantum Gravity\u201d. If we can figure out Quantum Gravity, that will probably be the biggest discovery ever made in history. At least one of them. It would help us solve everything (loosely speaking). There is nothing more mouth-watering to scientists than Quantum Gravity.<br><br>It just so happens that if String Theory is true and we can figure it out, it would solve for this Quantum Gravity problem. That\u2019s mostly why String Theory is so enticing to scientists. More so than the other cool stuff I mentioned a bit earlier. It would win whoever figured it out a lifetime of Nobel Prizes! (I\u2019m being a bit dramatic of course, but you get the idea! lol)<br><br>Keep in mind, when ST was first proposed, scientists were watering at the mouth. But even to this day there is no real proof/evidence that these Strings exist. And because of that, ST is kinda becoming a joke. Day by day, ST is taken less seriously than before and a lot of physicists (like Brian Green) essentially get told to move on and forget it (roughly speaking). Other than some fancy mathematics, there hasn\u2019t really been anything to show us that it is real<br><br>EDIT: I keep adding on to this. Hopefully this is the last addition. String Theory is also known as \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d for obvious reasons. Also, earlier I mentioned that Quarks are the smallest particles that we know of. But I kinda made it sound like there was only one type of Quark. Let me clarify and mention that there are 6 types of Quarks that exist in the universe: Up, Down, Top, Bottom, Strange, and Charm Quarks<br><br>Protons are made out of two types: 2x Up Quarks and 1x Down Quark<br><br>Neutrons are the opposite: 2x Down Quarks and 1x Up Quark<br><br>EDIT AGAIN: Earlier I said that the electron is essentially just made up of energy. To clarify, more accurately speaking, it\u2019s a negative electrical charge that exists as a cloud of probability in certain orbitals around the nucleus. Ya it\u2019s kinda confusing. The Bohr model of the electron was that the electron was a point particle that orbited the nucleus in discreet orbital shells. This is the classical simplified model that we\u2019ve all learned in school. Quantum mechanics gave us a more accurate understanding that tells us that model is inaccurate and it instead works the confusing way I explained a few sentences ago. The point is that no one has ever seen an electron and we are pretty sure nothing smaller makes up one<br><br>EDIT AGAIN: There\u2019s a few other juicy answers I gave down in the replies when someone asked me a follow up question\u2026 if you\u2019re interested<br><br>NOTE: If you need clarification on what I meant by\u2026.<br>\u201cHowever, they don\u2019t work together.

Anything to exist in the physical world needs hight (y), length (x) and width (z), which are unseparable and considerd as first dimension which is SPACE. <br><br>When we have a space, next question is what is in that space!, that is the next dimension of existence, which a physical material with which it is made-up of. For the convenience to express this dimension let&#39;s call this as EARTH (Physical object with a known mass, hight, length  and width).<br><br>Okay, now we have a physical object covering certain space, The next question you can ask is what are the properties of this object. Those are the next three dimensions of existence. Let&#39;s elaborate each of them, any object has its own electric charge, which we commonly say temperature of an object, referred as FIRE, third dimension. And the fire dimension of an object influences next two dimensions which are AIR and WATER. Don&#39;t take them literally,  dimension AIR basically represents the flow of energies within the physical object and the transaction of energies in and out of that object. The WATER dimension is the representation of the arrangement of individual atoms and their fluidity within their physical form. <br><br><br><br>The next level to this (only for those who can perceive this!) When we say space!, space can not exist without time, for instance if we define two points in a space, to travel from point A to point B you need a certain time to cover that distance. If no distance, means no time, means no existence of space-time. Therefore,  in the physical existence there is space, that&#39;s why there is time. <br><br>Next layer to that (caution! Only for seekers of ultimate truth of existence). Time can exist only in circles, that&#39;s the reason the whole visible universe looks moving in spiral shape and expanding endlessly. Because that&#39;s the transition between non existence (form less nothingness - that which is not) to existence (a form - that which is) happens in the singularity and then which expands outword, that&#39;s where the theory of relativity and time dilation comes, but not how they explained!.  Just imagine a circle drawn on a paper,  the central point of that circle is the singularity where there is no time and space exists, because in that point there is no distance to travel, so no time! And now check the outer line of that circle,   fir instance! to travel 30\u00b0 you need to travel a long distance so need more time, but to travel the same distance of 30\u00b0 close to the central point of the circle you need to travel less distance means less time. That&#39;s how the time difference works and that&#39;s how these is no time exists at the centre.

For instance, a life long blind person can understand that sighted can see shapes, that same blind person can\u2019t understand color. They can have the emotions attributed to color described to them, or the physical reactions of color in terms of thermal reaction experienced by wearing a dark shirt and a light shirt in the same temperature under the same sun, but their only means to find that sunlight is in a passive means of seeking the warmth radiating in the similar enough area that the direct photons also interact with. So, creating a theory explaining everything when everything can\u2019t exist within the reality of the theory proves the theory can not be proven nor disprove.

It sees concentration of particles that form these objects, and with particles it deals, any term in physics associated with matter/energy is meaningless or does not exist on quantum level including (mass,force,time,energy,...etc) so in this case any physical laws that include these terms does not apply on quantum level. We need to find the aspects that play role and the physical laws that govern them on inertia scale ,and they are thousands if not millions, the mathematical equations are few kilometers long,you call uber to correct something at the other side of it. We can understand quantum physic better if we use the term (behavior of particles of the universe) , there are nothing such as particles, there are only particles of the universe and the universe forces particles to behave on a certain way in certain conditions and one of these behaviors is gravity, gravity is behavior of particles, dark matter is behavior of particles , Why Oxygen is a gas and iron is solid metal is behavior of particles , Why photons penetrate glass and reflected on other media is behaviors of particles ,any chemical process or reaction is behavior of particles. Why some elements mix with each other and some not is behaviours of particles, Movement in space is behavior of particles, the electrical charge (- and +) are behavior of particles (so they are  not properties of particles),double slit experiment is behavior of particles, the Gyroscope is behavior of particles, the speed of light is behavior of particles, and ALL fundamental forces humans know are actually behavior of particles ,particles change their behavior accordingly with the circumstances surrounding them\r<br>\r<br>The existence of black holes is still to be investigated ,but for the moment let&#39;s assume there is black hole in the center of each galaxy, the galactical behavior is totally different than the behavior of mass on smaller scale like planets orbiting stars and solar systems which controlled by what we know as gravity ,on galactical scale it is totally different (no matter if they are close or far from the center of the galaxy) , where the stars far from the center of the galaxy orbit faster than the stars close to the center of the galaxy ,The only explanation for this is that the behavior of particles is a function of distance (or space)\r<br>let&#39;s take 2 magnets north and south and put them close to each other ,their particles will change behavior and pull each other and if we move them away from each other their particles behavior start to change, and the attraction force starts to weaken so space in fact change the behaviors of particles, the same applies for matter that circle the galaxy ,the space is much greater of matter in galaxies than space between the mass on solar systems ,that is why particles on galactical level behave differently. This was explained by scientists by the effect of dark matter\r<br>So for all what mentioned above the origin of the universe was not the big bang but when particles started to get their properties and behaviors and atoms started to bond together and take shape to form matter and its companion energy ,the universe was different to what we see now ,The properties and behaviours of particle are ever changing ,and continue to do so for ever. Entropy is a good example for this. \r<br>The issue with big bang theory is that it turned many aspects of the universe to constants, and we know very well that nothing in the universe is constant everything is changing all the time (including properties and behaviors of particles ) and everything is moving in space, and nothing is stand still. We have expansion of the universe and we have a big bang ,we just need to fill the gap between them and we have a theory of creation. \r<br>The behaviors of particles in your body is reacting to ,the particles surrounding them ,the particles of the planet you are on, the particles of the solar system your planet in, the particles of galaxy your solar system part of, and particles of all galaxies in the universe, particles have multy behaviors at the same time. So if we remove all galaxies in the universe ,and only remain you and the most distance galaxy then the particles of your body will behave according with this galaxy. \r<br>The change in properties and behaviors of particles over de course of time was not equal or at the same rate everywhere in the universe, some regions didn&#39;t develop matter yet or developed to different properties \r<br>We can say that vacuum is existence, or part of existence ,and what applies on everything exists in the universe applies also on vacuum, but humans observe vacuum from their perspective in matter/energy level , if we want to know and identify vacuum from perspective of quantum level then it will be something totally different ,if we say vacuum is absence of particles (and I mean everything we call particle, even fundamental particles) then still vacuum is influenced by the same aspects of the universe that influent all particles and give particles their properties and behaviors, so vacuum in a way or another does carry the properties and behavior by the influence of the aspects of the universe and because vacuum fill the gap between particles (at least what we know till now) then vacuum play major role in &quot;communication&quot; between the aspects of the universe and particle. was the early universe only vacuum ,then particles started to emerge? Humans are limited to their senses and brain ability  and accuracy of their equipment&#39;s so there are lot of aspects in the universe human cannot interact with for example multi dimensions so it will take some time to know what vacuum consist of and its behaviors and properties \r<br>So any thing happening around us could be and must be explained on behavior of particles on subatomic level,the big masses matter on any size are eventually composite of particles..and the behaviour of their particles gives the big masses their behaviors and actions in space \r<br>It is certain that all particles have no mass,mass only starts to build when atoms start to bond and make matter ,so anything more that 2 atoms have mass..mass is something associated with matter/energy level ,it is nonsens that some think that the mass of big bodies is the summation of the masses of its particles ,\r<br>Where are the boundaries?,when we are going to apply the quantum physics rules and when we are going to apply classical physics,explanning this is very long task ,but there is one principle here is that the formation of atoms from Hydrogen till atoms of heavy element all subject to quantum level and mainly ruled by behaviours of particles any thing comes after is subject for matter/energy level still we need to take into account that the bonds between atoms of the same elment,or the bonds between atoms of different elements are directly concidered as behaviours of particles,if we understand this it will lead us to know how all elements and anything matter or energy formed and have its own charastaristices and properties and their transformation froma stat to another and from sort element to another by fusion ,decay ,radiation or what ever process .\r<br>Are life and biological realm a product or a consequence of behaviour of particles on subatomic level ,the answer is yes,The ingredients in humans body or any living body even small tiny single cell creatures are all made from the same elements that every thing in the universe is made off,the difference is that they have life,or what we call it life.\r<br>So what kind and what percentage of each element available on a planet that have the right environment to support life would create what kind of biological world..?\r<br>We see this very clear on differences between plants ,animals,humans and the biological world as a whole  on each continent on earth it self,and it is an example how behaviours of particles follow a certain path when it goes higher in complexity level.", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T13:53:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frank DiMeglio", "comment_text": "Brian Greene money \ud83d\udcb0is knowingly and deceitfully lying about physics.", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T12:58:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Frank DiMeglio", "comment_text": "THE CLEAR MATHEMATICAL PROOF OF HOW AND WHY E=MC2 IS NECESSARILY F=MA:<br><br>Invisible AND VISIBLE SPACE in fundamental equilibrium AND BALANCE IS the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE, AS E=mc2 is DIRECTLY AND FUNDAMENTALLY DERIVED FROM F=ma; AS time DILATION proves that ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

The observer effect states that any time a system is observed, its state inevitably changes. For example, when ascertaining the position of an object using our vision, photons have to bounce off the object into our eyes, so its position is not the same as it had been before the observation occurred. This phenomenon, however, has nothing to do with the uncertainty principle, since the uncertainty in the position and the momentum of a quantum object exists all the time, regardless of the presence of an observer. We can basically say that even the object itself does not &quot;know&quot; its own position and momentum simultaneously.

F=ma AND E=mc2 prove that GRAVITY IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY, AS ALL of SPACE is NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL (IN BALANCE); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Einstein&#39;s equations are, in fact, NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL (IN BALANCE). The known MATHEMATICAL unification of Einstein&#39;s equations regarding gravity and Maxwell&#39;s equations regarding electromagnetism (given the ADDITION of a fourth spatial dimension) again proves that GRAVITY IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY.

ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Notice the PROVEN progression AND the CLEAR RELATION that involves what is THE SUN, the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE (including THE PLANET that is the Earth), AND what is THEN the SPEED OF LIGHT (c, a POINT). INDEED, a PHOTON may be placed at the center of THE SUN (as a POINT, of course); as the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the SPEED OF LIGHT; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. It is proven. It ALL makes perfect sense. E=mc2 is DIRECTLY AND FUNDAMENTALLY DERIVED FROM F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. BOTH equations CLEARLY do apply to AND describe what is THE SUN. THINK about it ALL. Great.

E=mc2 is DIRECTLY AND FUNDAMENTALLY DERIVED FROM F=ma. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. FACT. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ACCORDINGLY, the rotation of the Moon MATCHES it&#39;s revolution. AGAIN, IT IS PROVEN. It ALL makes perfect sense. Balance and completeness go hand in hand.<br><br>THE EYE IS THE BODY. The FLAT, SETTING, AND ORANGE SUN (WITH the SPACE around it THEN going invisible AND VISIBLE) IS the same size as THE EYE. The BALANCE of being AND EXPERIENCE is essential. Carefully consider how the telescopic/astronomical observations are POSSIBLE. THINK about what are the supergiant stars. Moreover, stellar clustering proves that ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Galaxies are stars together AND stars as POINTS (on balance). ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY !!!! Notice the semi-spherical, BLUE, QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL, translucent SKY in relation to what is the BLUE EARTH. OVERLAY the EYE in RELATION to what is THE EARTH. The extension of what is proportional or BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL SPACE is the ultimate proof that ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, as ALL of SPACE is NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL (IN BALANCE); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The Moon DOES have the same shape or curvature as the EARTH/GROUND (given a clear horizon, of course), AND the COMPOSITION of lunar rocks IS practically IDENTICAL to that of Earth rocks.

So, It is now abundantly and quite clear that Einstein never nearly understood gravity AND physics/physical experience. (Obviously, E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma.) Sir Isaac Newton now ranks second.<br><br>Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.<br><br>In fact, the ROTATION of the moon does MATCH it&#39;s REVOLUTION. ACCORDINGLY, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. SO, a given planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times; AND this is THEN consistent WITH F=ma, E=mc2, AND what is perpetual motion; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Therefore, GRAVITATIONAL force/energy is proportional to (or balanced with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as gravity is electromagnetism/energy. So, &quot;mass&quot;/energy involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance consistent WITH what is BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL force/energy; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. It ALL makes perfect sense. E=mc2 IS F=ma. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. (&quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=mc2 IS F=ma.) It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.

This may be a gross misinterpretation of things, but it might explain why waves collapse into particles when observed. If consciousness is a dimension of space time, it could account for the behavior of soap bubble universes. If hyperspace already possesses a dimension of consciousness, it might have a parent child relationship to bubble universes that also posses the same basic dimension. Which might also explain explain how our universe came to be. Two universes make the active \u201cdecision\u201d to reproduce. So, they would hypothetically brush up against each other, and the friction of the two membranes forms another baby universe which grows or \u201cexpands\u201d from the left over matter of the collision. In such a case it might also explain the forces that give rise to supervoids. Hypothetically, in this case, the supervoids might be gashes from previous attempts by our universe to \u201cmate\u201d with other bubble universes. The result would be a new universe with somewhat different properties, albeit physical laws or chemical reactions that would behave not unlike mutations do in the service of natural selection. If the universe could mate and reproduce that might mean that everything is in a way \u201calive\u201d, able metabolize, reproduce, and make choices, and that consciousness would be the primary dimension that gives rise to reality and not the other way around.

Interesting fact if you store a bunch of info on a disk or computer chip does it increase it&#39;s weight? No. Just like we constantly learn and store information does that increase our weight? No. So whatever the person is inside this carbon body the real you the guy inside there is not made of mass. And if you aren&#39;t made of mass you aren&#39;t inside time. Because time world&#39;s by Mass, by acceleration, by gravity. Time is not constant we already tested this with atomic clocks on different sides of the world basically the rate at which time went by changed very very very very slightly but still a slight change is a change none the less. Meaning time is not constant so if you travelled to the nearest star and back you&#39;d be a couple years younger than those around you. It&#39;s difficult to explain so I&#39;ll just leave it at that. But it has to do with acceleration or light-years light speed. So basically whoever you are in there, you my friend are eternal. Outside of time it&#39;s not a lot of time it&#39;s simply timeless. Forever. Scary stuff. You don&#39;t have to worry about being eternal but where you spend eternity. Physicists figured out we shouldn&#39;t exists because at the &quot;big bang&quot; equal amounts of anti-matter and matter exploded. Proven by math btw because math like morals are absolute. And since anti-matter when explodes destroys everything based on math, we shouldn&#39;t exist. So pretty much like coding in a computer using zeros and ones look how intricate we can make virtual world&#39;s. So DNA is a intricate code the most intricate code ever comprised of 4 digits A-C-T-G instead of computer code being 2 digits. So we are inside a reality of simulation. How can you tell that you aren&#39;t? Now for an atheist you can&#39;t. But someone who puts their pride aside, and realizes that maybe there is something far more intelligent then us that put us here and good luck understanding the one that made you. So someone made us in this simulation? Answer a eternal creator, why? Because all you have to ask is who created the creator that created the simulation you are in? All you do is move the goalpost. Eventually you will get to the uncaused first cause that&#39;s Yahweh that&#39;s God. But people have a problem believing this because, well basically they don&#39;t like the idea of something more than them that holds them accountable. And in essence if you aren&#39;t held accountable to anything of higher power than us then you play &quot;God&quot;. Sin is the malware virus corrupting the DNA code in the computer, justice is the protection software And Christ is the savior to pull you out of this dieing reality. That&#39;s why Christ is God in the flesh who took your place dieing for you even though you wronged him. Because he loves you. Christ being perfect DNA without sin is detected then by the &quot;software protection&quot; or absolute justice. We know there is absolute justice because of absolute morals. If nothing created everything then you shouldnt even be able to reason you&#39;d just be random chemical combustions in your head. There would be no truth is that true? &quot;There is no truth&quot; if it&#39;s true then there is truth if not then there is truth its self defeating. Christ is the truth. &quot;Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,&quot; Romans 1:22 good luck understanding your creator he&#39;s infinite if he answered all your whys you&#39;d only have more why&#39;s. Infinite vs finite? Who do you trust? Btw the Bible is trustworthy because it&#39;s comprised of 66 books and 40 authors who never knew eachother spanning thousands of years apart who somehow together made a perfect story of a loving Creator, foreshadowing a Messiah to redeem man over 300 times in the Bible all hundreds of years before he showed up. Basically if the Bible keeps predicting the future it&#39;s because whoever is inspiring the writers is outside of time. Also it&#39;s the most sold collection of books in the world, and is the most solid standing book of all time with no many copies and findings like the dead sea scrolls in 1947 proving it never changed.", "comment_date": "2021-03-01T03:23:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ro Man", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=1m43s\">1:43</a>.

Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot;.<br>BUT, mercy said &quot;I dont want to give them what they deserve. I don&#39;t want them to be cut off from Me. I love them despite all they have done/will do against Me. I want to give My children another chance. I want them to come home and live in My love again&quot;. <br><br>And love said &quot;Jesus, God&#39;s Son, came down as a Man, our representative, suffering every temptation, pain and struggle we have ever faced, yet without sin. He took all our sins (past/present/ even future) to the cross and then crucified EVERY ONE on our behalf. Justice was paid on the cross so that we can be free from Hell&#39;s punishment, experience Gods mercy of forgiveness of sin and live in His love. If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (turn away from our sin and pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life.<br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it.<br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through Him (not ourselves as it&#39;s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to obey His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and ask Him to help us in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will. <br><br>NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus.

The more massive the objects are, the more stretched strings are tied on, so the more gravity (or force) it has! Picture it like this, 0 is object type 1, o is object type two, the - is the string tied to them, and the symbols &lt;, &lt;&lt;, &gt;, and &gt;&gt; represent the direction of gravity being pulled and the amount of force the gravity is using. Here is a representation of different forces of gravity coming from objects with different mass: 0&lt;&lt;=&gt;&gt;0, o&lt;-&gt;o, 0&lt;&lt;=&gt;o. If you still don&#39;t get it, tie your shoes together with your shoelaces. The shoelaces are attached to your shoes, so they are holding the shoes together. The more available room on the shoes, the more strings you can fit on, and the more strings there are, the harder it is to pull them apart. One more way you could look at this is a rubber band attached to your hands. Your hands are pulled apart, and the rubber band is extended. The rubber band is pulling your hands together, and if you stop trying to keep your hands apart, your hands will come together. The only difference is that the further extended a rubber band is, the harder it pulls. So to fix this, I thought that these &quot;rubber bands&quot; get weaker the more you use them, as if stretching them out. The further an object is from it&#39;s parental body (the object that gravity is pulling it towards), the weaker the connection is, and the closer it is, the more strength the string regains!

Science helps us in knowing the nature of reality if it gets its full theory correct on the true nature of reality  but spirituality is about realising the nature of reality. &quot;If knowing the reality as it is is the ultimate goal of science, realising in essence that we r pure energy is the first step of spirituality. &quot; <br>Our words, logic, thoughts, experiments, and whatever cannot define the true nature of reality.

If we r able to unknow everything, then only there&#39;s a chance to know or realize everything.

A cause that does not have rule over the whole universe can govern nothing at all in respect of dominicality and creativity; it cannot make a single particle heed it. <br><br><br>The Flashes Collection", "comment_date": "2020-08-28T21:18:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Teeja Raina", "comment_text": "Light is NOT electromagnetic only ....especially in case of sun it is made of quanta........not waves", "comment_date": "2020-08-28T17:23:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nelson Swanberg", "comment_text": "Mass curving spime and spime telling mass how to move assumes spime is continuous.

I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA nicolas maduro moros who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including nicolas maduro moros-Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden. And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T21:02:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pedro goduto zambelli", "comment_text": "Hello and happy day: I leave to my followers several famous phrases or sayings of the scientist Nikolas Tesla: 1) The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will progress more in a decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence . 2) The individual is ephemeral, races and nations come and go, but man remains. 3) What one man calls God, another calls the laws of physics. And this is my saying or phrase of my inspiration, and it goes like this: Since the Internet became known for the domain or public use between the sky, the earth and the bottom of the ocean there is nothing hidden nor the aliens.

We can see an atom is divisible to the point of a quark but man animal and all that is of the universe is a complex physiology.\u00a0<br>Easiest to explain if God is the universe then we are the physiology. My theory shows how I understand this, how each division of race,language,physical appearance ,soul, ethics,intention however is the reality. If you fake being nice then you are surrounding yourself with fake being nice. If you are genuine regardless of what you think you are surrounded by genuine even though they may not think so just as you don&#39;t think so. We are part of the equation. Man tends to look outwardly instead of at their intention.", "comment_date": "2020-06-15T15:04:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "guangmin liu", "comment_text": "is it smaller than a plank", "comment_date": "2020-06-15T14:48:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tobiasisatmjnair", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=7m06s\">7:06</a>", "comment_date": "2020-06-15T08:42:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Ander", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=2m34s\">2:34</a> grist?", "comment_date": "2020-06-15T06:00:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mossawir Ahmed", "comment_text": "Long story short &quot;WE DON&#39;T KNOW THE TRUE NATURE OF REALITY!&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-06-15T01:07:29Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Prince00Thieves", "comment_text": "2+2=4 quick maths!", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T19:10:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moikel", "comment_text": "Light waves be looking like sperm cells", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T14:43:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pheonix the skywing", "comment_text": "String theory is the smallest thing in the universe", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T09:04:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Personal", "comment_text": "Who else play this videos while falling asleep?", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T00:46:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KaneLLo'", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=6m27s\">6:27</a> : &quot;And the maths in string theory work out&quot;<br>Meanwhile on the board in the background -&gt; \u03b6(-1)= - (1/12)<br>That means that the sum of 0+1+2+3+4+.... has the value of -(1/12)<br>So imagine you add up all the positive integer numbers until infinity...Your sum now, can be replaced by a negative fraction number! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 <br>Mindblowing", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T18:06:03Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Pushpraj Poonia", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=2m15s\">2:15</a> I&#39;d disagree with the fact that more wavelengths means more energy rather it should be more frequency means more energy", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T10:05:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "smolkos", "comment_text": "\u0422\u043e \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b \u043e \u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043d \u0438\u0437 &quot;\u0422\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T09:16:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pat Swayze", "comment_text": "So what do they mesure??

While lucifer who plays off the lower nature of things and takes all is death. Anything lower that God eternal would not sustain nor have being created, not have created all being. Many evil things were made legal already at this time through only few short years and have become normalized or woven into language, culture, or whatever may influence us or persuade us into following the nature of things or the evil one who lays claim upon such death and hell. It&#39;s just hidden under the guise of left and right to legalize more things till it&#39;s egypt again, so that&#39;s why we must be careful of things we make any sort of agreement by word or by contract and must have the Armour of God on at all times so we can discern right from wrong as-well as see it coming and reveal it to others that are sleeping still. They are asleep because there eyes are closed to the sea of law which is in everything for the purpose of Gods creation and plan of happiness and growth for us. Many cannot perceive the ruling and the reign of the devil as many have given power to him through his deceptive ways of making people think he&#39;s God or that they may have a chance at surpassing him or God. They can&#39;t see God&#39;s love for us nor his reign or his claim to heavenly things and his people, it&#39;s been flipped around, perverted, inverted leaving many to miss the gates which are straight and narrow.<br><br><br>Everybody is born with the light of Christ which we can discern right from wrong by the way he influences us to feel, hence when we accept the holy ghost we can have that strengthened as we accept influence from the Lord Creator of all. He loves us so and suffers that we return to him, such is so even that we may choose to accept his will or not being given our own freewill. If this is concerning I would consider that you pray respectfully on it. Such communication with the Lord is setup in a personal manner because he loves us and wishes personal communication that we may speak with him and not that of a lower state of being, giving us truthful and proper influence guiding us to choose the right option as we repent and progress. He has done this because of our lower state of being, which all being is lower than the Lord that sustains eternally and created all. Such direct personal communication and proper guidance from the Lord of Hosts eternal is necessary as we host as the world provides no light in so that everyone would be blind to such goodness that is the Lord and light Jesus Christ who made the ultimate traction, the atonement and gave us the words of eternal life. Learning to follow commandments and being baptized cleansed outwardly and cleansed inwardly with the holy ghost. One may hear him clearly if he speaks or influences by feelings of the mind or gut, in the manner of foresight he already knows all and the outcome of the choices we make, as we are here to learn and progress not continuing in error. That little voice will become clear as you develop your relationship with the Lord. Do not make the grave error of denying the holy ghost or the lords influence as it is constructed that you may make your own choices but the lord will not dwell with you if you choose evil exposing yourself to much greater evils and devices of the evil one. Must wear the Armour of God at all times although he holds us up Jesus Christ saves us from our sins not in them. There are grave dangers and loss of blessings and peace of mind from disobedience and all will fault and error much in the ways of evil because of our lower state than God. Hence the importance of the Holy Ghost as the third part of the holy trinity.<br><br><br>Concerning what love or essentially long suffering, faith and what comes thereafter is, as love is God, hence the first commandment to love God with all our heart mind soul and body because good is and comes from him and only the Lord of Hosts Eternal. Hence why we are sustained and are here on his creation earth, as is his plan of true happiness that we will repent and find salvation to return back to live with our Lord and creator having experienced mortality as part of our eternal progression Moses 1: 39. Following the influence of the light or Christ some might call a (conscience) but is the divine influence from God which is a gift without it would be blind slavery into the endless hell fire of the pits as the hearts of men have no bounds because of our lower state than the only eternal Lord whom sustains forever. Such is evidence of creation as the Lord of Hosts divided the tiny eternal bits of intelligence and gave them law. Life itself would not sustain without set law, it would be wildy obscured as the divided and conquered kingdom of the evil one, and would not even come to be in existence much less sustain if set intelligence did come to be on its own it would destroy itself. The Lord offers us salvation from such endless hell fire by his only begotten son who paid the ultimate price, as all is transaction. Such price was paid to loosen all that bounds us including contracts and the bonds of death itself being able to return back to our father the true Lord of Hosts eternal. Having faith in Jesus Christ is essential because he paid set price and brought us the words of eternal life. Only faith in Jesus Christ King of Kings is salvation because he is perfect in the eyes of the Lord and loves the father understanding the importance of and following his every command. Jesus Christ is the only one who can wield the double edged sword that is the word of God, which hangs above us and slices every which way leaving none unscathed except Jesus Christ. Whom when he returns all will see wield set sword and bring forth truth undeniable upon evil like a night turning to day at a much faster pace. The price of Salvation was already laid out and paid for us, you may ask him yourself by addressing him, dear heavenly father and then close with in the name of Jesus Christ. Respectfully your relationship will grow as you come realize that he is right there and your faith and understanding of where good comes from and the eternal aspect of creation you will grow a stronger testimony that Jesus Christ is the Light, the only begotten of the Creator Lord of Hosts Eternal.<br><br><br>Because a person watches several ads on TV then thinks they made a choice to buy whatever product that they are all of a sudden not brainwashed.

You, a being of ultimate, infinite perception, can understand infinite everythings perfectly. However, as soon as you understand one reality, it&#39;s like you finished a video game, you&#39;re bored, you move on, creating and learning infinitely more unending realities for infinity, if for no reason than to keep yourself entertained. But eventually, any reality with limits is just as boring as the last, like playing a chess against unending opponents, it&#39;s still chess. So, with nothing left to do, you combine all your realities at the edges, fitting them together into one giant quilt of universes, all just barely interacting with each other at the edges.<br><br>However, it&#39;s still not enough to entertain you forever, and you realize that the only way to keep yourself entertained forever, is with a universe that doesn&#39;t end. It HAS no limits, you sow in loopholes to every rule, everything becomes possible in any universe if you know how, which, as an infinite God, you do. You end up designing a reality with no true limits: infinitely large; no matter how fast you move across it, it keeps going. Infinitely tiny; no matter how close you look at it, it keeps going. There&#39;s finally an infinite amount of things to do, so even an infinite God is forever entertained, and happy.<br><br>Now finally, imagine that, in this infinite, unendingly everything omni-reality of an unending universe, a planet called &quot;Earth&quot; is made. Creatures grow and die, and evolve, etc. Then one day, an odd hairless monkey that walks erect becomes sentient. On a continent later known as Africa, human consciousness appears. And this odd ape is confused; it&#39;s species keeps discovering more and more reality, and every time all the answers seem to be there, something screws it up. Edge of the world? It doesn&#39;t have one, it&#39;s round. Sound barrier? Breakable. Space? Traversable. The atom? Splitable.

If there was a way to show people what exists, then they\u2019d totally believe it most likely.<br><br>I\u2019m pretty young, and I\u2019m not that smart. But  what if that the universe and matter and ynow everything, was all created by so much nothingness, that it became something. This is of course an undeveloped idea,  without really any proof to it. But you magnetic forces exist, and 2 Negative things will propel each other? Ynow basic Magnetics. Why do things have positive or negative charges? Since gravity is a force, and white holes are pushing energy away?  What if the Big Bang was made of literally nothing. No atoms, no nothing. And the universe was so small, that it was just the nothing forcing itself into becoming something? Because if you push on something like a glass wall, it won\u2019t  break unless something makes hard impact, or it\u2019s edges are connected in place. In Theory, if nothing did nothing, it was still doing something. So what if nothing doing nothing made all of ten atoms and whatnot that we know of today? Even though there\u2019s no air in a vacuum sealed container, if you leave it Long enough.. it\u2019ll still have force when you open it. But what if you keep taking all the air out, when there\u2019s nothing there to take?  It\u2019ll probably break right?<br><br>So what if there was so much nothing that it basically broke itself by doing nothing. Now go easy on me, I\u2019m only 12. And I was using my imagination to type this out.  I\u2019d like to hear what you think about It, even though it isn\u2019t real. I don\u2019t know a whole lot about quantum physics, or anything like that. But I jsut thought I should put it out hear, so u can what some feedback. I\u2019d also be interested in hearing some of your theories maybe. This is more like a creation of the universe thing tho, so I guess i didn\u2019t really do anything when I said this.. so I think I just went on a typing rampage. <br><br>Oh well, take this and pls don\u2019t be mean", "comment_date": "2019-11-19T20:36:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=3m03s\">3:03</a> - wait what?

Moreover, he wrote: &quot;Awesome !&quot; and &quot;Absolutely right.&quot;<br><br>Excellent !!!<br>It&#39;s all clearly correct.<br><br>THE TRULY SUPERIOR UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS/PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE:<br><br>E=mc2 is DIRECTLY AND FUNDAMENTALLY DERIVED from F=ma. Carefully consider what is THE SUN. The Sun is E=mc2. The Sun is ALSO F=ma. This explains the PERPETUAL MOTION of the Sun, AS gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!! ACCORDINGLY, GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. (Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) ALL of SPACE is NECESSARILY electromagnetic/gravitational (IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This is, IN FACT, proven by F=ma AND E=mc2. (BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand.) So, consider what is c (A POINT, A PHOTON). A PHOTON may be placed at the center of THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), as the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the SPEED OF LIGHT; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY.<br><br>The BALANCE of being AND EXPERIENCE is essential. Dreams balance being AND EXPERIENCE. In dreams, it is you AND other than you are IN BALANCE. Indeed, there is no outsmarting the GENIUS of dreams. Dream experience is/involves true/real QUANTUM GRAVITY. MOST IMPORTANTLY, in dreams, BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE is invisible AND VISIBLE IN BALANCE. (THE EYE IS THE BODY.) Dreams make thought MORE LIKE sensory experience in general, thereby improving upon memory AND UNDERSTANDING. INDEED, the ability of THOUGHT to DESCRIBE OR RECONFIGURE sensory experience is ULTIMATELY dependent upon the extent to which THOUGHT IS SIMILAR TO sensory experience. MOREOVER, it is ALSO a very great truth that THE SELF represents, FORMS, and experiences a COMPREHENSIVE approximation of experience in general by combining conscious and unconscious experience. (THOUGHTS ARE INVISIBLE.) Dream experience is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand.

I reached my limit with barely understanding quantum physics (I can grab the basics, not much more). I see string theory as, as you said, it is about dimensions. What we understand as reality is only where everything clicks in a way that we see as solid. The truth is this, our reality is almost what reality collectively agrees upon as a shared experience if that makes any sense to you. We are nothing more than a shared convergence of dimensions, a shadow of what reality really is and powerless to be anything but that. Our reality to the multiverse once we understand how virtually fictional we are can only be artistically shown as a fictional character &quot;breaking the 4th wall&quot; in the entertainment medium. And the problem with physics, math, science, etc is that we can only work by applying our &quot;solid&quot; ways to something that is obviously fluidic or semi-fluidic. That is the reason for the apparent chaos. Then again, I am pretty much an idiot on this subject.

The purpose for their creation is rather briefly to be assembled in existence and acquire the desired form, so that these may be noted, their images preserved, their meanings known, and their results recorded. This is so that, for example, everlasting spectacles might be wrought for the people of eternity, and that they might serve other purposes in the realm of eternity. You will understand that things have been created for eternity, not for annihilation; and as for apparent annihilation, it has the sense of a completion of duty and a release from service, for every transient thing advances to annihilation with one aspect, but remains eternally with numerous other aspects.<br>   Look, for example, at the flower, a word of God&#39;s power; for a short time it smiles and looks at us, and then hides behind the veil of annihilation. It departs just like a word leaving your mouth. But it does so entrusting thousands of its fellows to men&#39;s ears. It leaves behind meanings in men&#39;s minds as numerous as those minds. The flower, too, expressing its meaning and thus fulfilling its function, goes and departs. But it goes leaving its apparent form in the memory of everything that sees it, its inner essence in every seed. It is as if each memory and seed were a camera to record the adornment of the flower, or a means for its perpetuation. If such be the case with an object at the simplest level of life, it can be readily understood how closely tied to eternity is man, the highest form of life and the possessor of an eternal soul. Again, from the fact that the laws <del>each resembling a spirit</del> according to which large flowering and fruit bearing plants are formed and the representations of their forms are preserved and perpetuated in most regular fashion in tiny seeds throughout tempestuous changes - from this fact it can be easily understood how closely tied and related to eternity is the spirit of man, which possesses an extremely exalted and comprehensive nature, and which although clothed in a body, is a conscious and luminous law issuing from the divine command.<br>Sixth Principle: <br>   You will also understand that man has not been left to graze at will, with a halter loosely tied around his neck; on the contrary, the forms of all his deeds are recorded and registered, and the results of all his acts are preserved for the day when he shall be called to account.<br>Risale-i Nur Collection Words 86 - Bedi\u00fczzaman Said Nursi", "comment_date": "2019-09-12T03:59:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MEHAZ", "comment_text": "As may be established empirically, matter is not essential so that existence may be made subject to it, and be dependent on it. Rather, matter subsists through a meaning, and that meaning is life, it is spirit.<br>   Also, as may be established through observation, matter is not the thing served so that everything may be ascribed to it. It is rather the servant; it renders service to the process of the perfection of a truth. And that truth is life. And the fundament of that truth is spirit.<br>   Also, as is self-evident, matter is not dominant so that recourse may be made to it or perfections sought from it. Rather, it is dominated; it looks to the decree of some fundament, it is in motion in the way that that decree dictates. And that fundament is life, it is spirit, it is consciousness.<br>   Also, as is necessary, matter is not the kernel, it is not the fundament, it is not a settled abode so that events and perfections may be affixed to it or constructed on it. Rather, it is a shell prepared to be split, rent, dissolved; it is a husk, it is froth, it is a form.<br>   Consider the following: a creature so minute it can only be seen with a microscope has such acute senses it can hear its friend&#39;s voice, and see its sustenance; it has extremely sensitive and sharp senses. This demonstrates that the effects of life increase and the light of the spirit intensifies in proportion to the reducing and refining of matter. It is as though the more matter is refined and the more we become distanced from our material existences, the closer we draw to the world of the spirit, the world of life, and the world of consciousness; and the more intensely the heat of the spirit and the light of life are manifested.<br>   Is it therefore at all possible that there should be this many distillations of life, consciousness, and spirit within this veil of materiality, and that the inner world which is beyond this veil should not be full of conscious beings and beings with spirits? Is it at all possible that the sources of these numberless distillations, flashes, and fruits of meaning, spirit, life and the truth apparent in this material existence in the Manifest World should be ascribed only to matter and the motion of matter, and be explained by it? God forbid! Absolutely not! These innumerable distillations and flashes demonstrate that this material and manifest world is but a lace veil strewn over the inner and spirit worlds.<br>Risale-i Nur Collection Words - 526", "comment_date": "2019-09-12T03:59:27Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Devin Ortiz", "comment_text": "I think the only way we will truly find out what is out there in space, is when our human bodies expire.", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T23:57:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SM3", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=5m28s\">5:28</a> <b>best joke ever</b>", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T22:25:25Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Intellix", "comment_text": "Actually, I was thinking about the elemental particles that we&#39;re not supposed to see.<br>I&#39;m not a scinentist or anything, but I wonder what would hapen if we could force these particles to generate their own light, like, by heating them or something", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T15:38:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarwagya Prasad", "comment_text": "this editor is THE best editor in ted", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T13:46:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fares Jounes", "comment_text": "Anyone coming from big bang theory..sheldon..???", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T13:22:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saf DZ", "comment_text": "You lost me at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=0m00s\">0:00</a>", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T12:21:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "connor jossevel", "comment_text": "The true nature is God", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T05:32:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "coledb", "comment_text": "i still don&#39;t get it frick", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T03:46:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "james fuqua", "comment_text": "The English accent makes me believe whatever I hear!", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T01:29:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George Burton", "comment_text": "Actually 2+2 is not 4 if using base 3", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T16:42:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Herbert Casais", "comment_text": "Pucci: Do you belive in gravity ?", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T14:48:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GetFox", "comment_text": "can we get a 1 hour of 0s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=3m31s\">3:31</a>", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T14:31:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "River Towner", "comment_text": "Hello Graphic Artists....Don&#39;t use too many colors....it can&#39;t let you focus on one thing you want to see in these ver fast and cartoonish presentations...Thanks!!", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T14:18:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spanish BBall athlete", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=3m33s\">3:33</a>", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T13:32:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rendi 457", "comment_text": "me:&quot; wakes up&quot;<br>everybody else at the reality simulation center of Nebula :&quot; .0. &quot;", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T12:52:59Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Alex Pop", "comment_text": "maybe I don&#39;t get this right due to language, but, doesn&#39;t accurate up to 0.000000000002% actually mean not accurate at all? errors up to 0.00..2% means high accuracy", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T09:31:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nam Duchatelet", "comment_text": "I just want to say that, despite the cartoonish style and the jokes, this was a surprisingly elegant presentation!", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T04:33:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miguel Luis", "comment_text": "Everytime I think I understand something...

I\u2019m not criticizing the theory, or saying there isn\u2019t evidence. I\u2019m pointing out what most people pass over as an \u201cunimportant\u201d detail, as a critique of a widespread, severe cultural problem simply exhibited in this moment, anything with the label \u201cscience\u201d slapped on it is taken with zealous blind faith by masses who consider themselves wise after listening to it even though in almost everything most people call science these days there are tons of holes filled with faith via the appeal to authority tactic (shamelessly flaunted at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=4m45s\">4:45</a>) too many are sssooo susceptible to. Listen to everything, but question everything, and a true skeptic\u2019s radar should go off anytime someone says \u201cjust is\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s just a fact\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s undebatable\u201d, etc. Explanations are always owed in teaching. Oversimplifications are better than omissions. I\u2019m not harshly criticizing the makers of this video. Just trying to point out this extremely common pattern to hopefully cause a few people to start thinking a bit more skeptically toward blind faith, regardless of whether it\u2019s used by people calling it religion, politics, science, or anything else. A bunch of people believing the same thing blindly doesn\u2019t make it more true than one person believing it. And the worshippers of anything labeled \u201cscience\u201d always overlook the irony of things like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=1m05s\">1:05</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a> here. Even when acknowledging that past \u201cknowledge\u201d was false, science-worshippers fail to acknowledge that people can be wrong again. It\u2019s always definitively said that we \u201ccan\u2019t divide <i>__</i> anymore. It\u2019s the smallest thing in existence.\u201d and then it gets divided, and more, and more, but each time people are just as arrogantly sure, \u201cthis is the smallest thing now. It\u2019s a fact.\u201d \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I know at least 99% of people on this channel will misconstrue what I\u2019m saying and miss my points. Science is great when honest. This seems like a decent video. Just wish blind faith would stop being a constant necessity to complete every \u201cscientific\u201d explanation of anything on the internet and that people would stop totally accepting it with said blind faith without so much as a degree of reservation that maybe that current theories are just as capable of being wrong as all past ones. Wish people\u2019d figure out that no, nobody knows everything and we never will. Keep trying, sure. But stay humble. Hope even 1 person sees my point. Don\u2019t bother trying to start a fight.

It&#39;s a reasonable assumption, on the part of the ignorant, that a particle occupies a point in space. I&#39;m well aware this must be wrong, but you&#39;ve done nothing to explain why that is. You go on to tell me that if you just imagine a string, rather than a point, you get lots of particles, and that includes gravity. You might as well tell me that if I divide my arse by my elbow I get cornflakes. I had no idea gravity was a particle, and I&#39;ve no clue what you&#39;re talking about.

Oh, and there are <i>Five</i> dimensions. one temporal, and <i>Four</i> spatial. it goes from point to line to square to cube to whatever we call a 4-d cube, and it can&#39;t go any further.

The yogis have always talked of extra dimensions that can be experienced but are not in the sensory, so called \u2018objective\u2019 realm. As per the yogis -This whole creation is just a vibration, albeit of different frequencies ranging from gross to such subtle ness that it is beyond matter, they call this \u2018Naada Brahma\u2019 or the cosmic vibration that condenses to form matter at a gross level and yet also exists in subtle suprasensory states. Just as we have ice and then water (different states of condensed heaviness existing together) and also water vapour or water in its subtlest state of gas that is non cognizant to our physical senses, but can be condensed into reality as liquid water or ice. The string folks also say the same - this whole creation is \u2018just a vibration\u2019, the strings are nothing but vibrations of different frequencies, gross and subtle. Dark matter and Dark energy are something that exist all around us and they are completely unknown to us. In fact they are so dense that Brian Greene\u2019s likened physical 4% matter to the holes in Swiss cheese where the cheese does not exist ( dark matter and energy are the crucible of physical matter that we know and are made up of). Now Shiva, is known as \u2018that which is not\u2019, or the one who transcends this physical creation but is the basis of it. Shiva is also the dark one.<br>The ancients and the yogis talk of \u2018Maya\u2019 - which is an illusion. Thus this reality that we perceive as real is non existent. The very act of interaction with this creation (even looking at it with our eyes) actually causes the collapse of the electrons probability wave function by an act of measurement ie as simple a thing as looking at this creation. This causes it to then take a certain fixed position for us to perceive it and thus the matter around us on a extrapolated larger scale. This is Maya, to perceive things the way they are not in reality. To add to this are the consciousness and cognitive neuroscientists like Donald Hoffman, who are saying that the reality that actually exists is very different from the way  we perceive the world as an objective reality. So actually we project the reality out there, again to add to this is the \u2018holographic universe\u2019 where the universe is projected out there are a hologram and perceived by us. Some things interesting in this vein of thought are echoed by Leonard Susskind, in his talks on the universe as a hologram.<br>Fundamentally, the yogis said that, not only is this world an illusion or Maya\u2019 but it also does not exist. Einstein has put forth <del>\u2018Space and time do not exist\u2019, Brian has covered this beautifully in the \u2018Fabric of the cosmos\u2019</del> \u2018the illusion of time\u2019. So when there is no space and no time there is only \u2018Now\u2019 and that is why those who have realized this non-dual state of this creation talk of \u2018the power of now\u2019 or \u2018there is eternity in a moment and that moment is now\u2019.<br>Science will get there as it is on the right track, but to prove 11 dimensions, 7 more than the 4 of space and time is still not possible. They are using the wrong tools to get to the correct goal.<br><br>Trying to connect the dots here. It is possible to perceive with the meditative mind that can either still the mind or distance itself from the physical nature of the body and the mind itself by creating a space between oneself and the world around.<br>If anyone has read so far, my sincere thanks to their patience \ud83d\ude0a.

Sometimes unusual math is needed to replace parts of math that don&#39;t seem to work.  Substitutions or more complex math is often used.  String theory is one of those things, to get past a math roadblock.  It could be true and it might not be.  This doesn&#39;t say if it&#39;s true or not.  <br><br><br>To me as an average star gazer who is not up on all the math to really show a proof of why it&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s simply an attempt to try to explain smaller and smaller realities that puzzle other versions of math, by doing a trick.  It&#39;s trying to do an &quot;engineering calculation&quot; or an approach which is good enough for the data observed, and this is observed through a whole host of other theories which are accepted.  And it tries to go down far enough, even further than what we&#39;ve observed and add small granular detail to say, &quot;there now that is good enough.&quot;  It tries to be good enough to solve a problem, but it may lack detailed granularity required to do so.  I personally feel it doesn&#39;t really solve a problem, but shifts it further down the line.  So my opinion is it fails actually and just pushed the nature of a real problem and real sets of problems further down the road.  It&#39;s kind of like kicking the can down the road so far you can&#39;t see it as a problem.  But later perhaps you will find the problem is still there.<br><br><br>This involves the tension between trying to know by math what is out there with intuition and math to project math and predict, which often happens with theory, and actually having a limited set of observations (RULE 2 of physics) which confirms it.  It&#39;s a constant tension between the proposed solution and the observed solution.   This happens a lot in physics and is a constant problem.  Once it&#39;s verified very well and not much can be found to break a theory, then it&#39;s accepted.  Many in the field of physics think it solved the problem (at least precise enough, as an engineering solution) to work.  This would include Hawking whose objections they were trying to overcome.  <br><br><br>I personally think that string theory pulled the wool over the eyes of Hawking and he didn&#39;t for some reason see it or worry about it.  It was precise enough to do the job.  But didn&#39;t really solve the ultimate problem they were hoping to solve.   <br><br><br>One has to realize this stuff is often including a lot of math data that has to be viewed and thought of with hundreds and thousands of scientists over many years.  That&#39;s to much detail to go into in a short video and videos which show today&#39;s solutions may later be revised if a new better theory comes along.   The better theories either add to good foundational knowledge or replace them.  If they replace them, they are seen as more amazing, because they replace false conceptions.  If they add to them they are thought of as an incremental change.

Lets say we zoom into atoms and quarks and we find the lowest possible form of existence(strings). The thing is if you combine something with that same something it doesn&#39;t become anything new just more of that something. So if you take a drop of water and combine it with more drops of water you just get more water and nothing new. Another example is the human body, you cannot take just a heart and combine it with more hearts to form a body, you need multiple organs. Also the atom, it consists of electrons, neutrons and protons. That being said my thought is that inside quarks there are strings and also such things as anti-strings. The anti-strings &quot;mix&quot; with strings to form a higher level of mixture aka. quarks. But the quark needs to have some sort of a membrane to hold strings and anti-strings so I&#39;m guessing that each previous level(strings) has to have it&#39;s coordinates and size coded inside of them so that it can tell the next level(quarks) how big of a cabin(membrane) it needs to be stored. For something to exist it&#39;s edges have to be stored in a higher dimension, so for 2d objects to exist they need to have certain coordinates and reserve a spot in a 3d dimension(membrane). So, we can put a smaller paper on top of a bigger paper but the largest object, in this case, the larger paper will always end up having it&#39;s edges in the 3rd dimension to exist.  Anyways back to strings and anti-strings, so the anti-strings and strings repel each other and that is why strings are not a straight line but rather always curved on one side(wave). And the frequency of the motion(wavelength) of these strings and anti-strings order the matters energy level which cannot be destroyed as thought by newton. This could also be the reason how magnetism works but then again why do strings and anti-strings repel each other? Maybe it&#39;s because the universe is formed on forces that counter each other. Day and night. Good and bad. Light and darkness. Idk, this is all just simple work of my imagination because it goes wild when I lay in bed.

Recently, when I listened to a result of a Quantum experiment about the Photons that was conducted by Geneva University, about the un delayed transmission of signals or waves between two photons placed 18 km away from each other, I noticed that it was not found how there could be a faster speed than the speed of light, or maybe we could say that there was no time factor in a certain format. This reminded me of the Idea of Nicola Tesla about the Matrix, and by that we remembered the verses from Qur&#39;An Al Kareem, actually the first ever revelation that were later of completed as Soorah Al&#39;Alag (Chapter 96) first 5 Verses if I am not mistaken, they are as following: <br>In the Name of Al RAHMAN<br>1. Recite in the name of your Lord who created -<br>2. Created man from a clinging substance.<br>3. Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous -<br>4. Who taught by the pen - (The Word Pen in Arabic is Galam)<br>5. Taught man that which he knew not. <br>So we started to think what is meant by Pen, because Gur&#39;An is simple but not a primitive Book and leaves nothing without precise explanation. Therefore we searched the other Chapters (Soorah) and came across with Chapter 68, which is called Al-Qalam or &quot;The Pen&quot;. And just now, while we  were writing this comment we searched the web so see if that Chapter was third or fourth revelation, as we were not so sure, but we found out that it was the second revelation, so ALLAH provided to the Prophet Mohammad (Salla ALLAH u Aleyhi Wa Selleme) the Explanation of Al-Galam right away, So let us see what the Chapter says.<br>Numerically it is now chapter 68 of the Gur&#39;An Al Kareem, but as per revelation, it is the second <br>Soorah Al-Qalam or &quot;The Pen&quot;<br>In the Name of Al RAHMAN<br>1. Nun. By the pen and what they inscribe,<br>2. You are not, [O Muhammad], by the favor of your Lord, a madman.<br>3. And indeed, for you is a reward uninterrupted.<br>4. And indeed, you are of a great moral character.<br>5. So you will see and they will see<br>6. Which of you is the afflicted<br>One may think that what is the point and why shall one read these verses talking about Science? <br>It is due to the above mentioned verse that the Chapter starts with one single Letter Nun, which is not precisely explained so far in the past 14 centuries of existence of that Particular Book, or if it was, but it wasn&#39;t made public.<br><br>It is a long story and we can discuss this or share some views over this topics if there is an interest from any side or any person that is really dedicated or devoted to the One and to finding the True Story of the Mankind and what we are to achieve in this Trial version of the Life in this Matrix.<br><br>We apologize if by any means we have touched or offended any of your personal views.<br><br>As for string Theory, there is another verse in Qur&#39;An Al Kareem in Chapter 38 Suad (Letter Saad), verse 38,<br><br>38.

The actual uncertainty is that, if we try to measure the momentum of any elementary particle more accurately, the lesser accuracy in determining its position. And the vice-versa. But the reason is as explained in the video. That when we try to see/feel the elementary particle using higher energy waves, to measure it&#39;s mass (or momentum), we tend to disturb it&#39;s position like @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU&amp;t=2m10s\">2:10</a>, but if we try to measure it&#39;s position using may be lower energy waves, which doesn&#39;t much disturb the position, we fail to see/feel the particle to accurately measure it&#39;s momentum/mass bcz the wave just passes over the particle without even feeling it, like @1.52. <br>In much simpler words, we can measure the momentum/mass of any physical particle only if we can feel it. But these elementary particle are so so so very small, that if we try to feel it (using high frequency waves) we&#39;ll just disturb their position.

It creates matter within itself and uses black holes as a means of containing those galaxies which feed the white holes so that the universe may then take the converted energy and create more gaseous reactions in a never ending cycle. The real question is why does it do this, and what is the actual mechanism which drives this expansion.<br><br>Also something to note, for my theory to work, white holes would need to function and act more like a cosmic storm than a stationary device.

Smaller/fast EM waves have more fluctuations or polarizing transverse, thus making the energy they can contain more compressed. But 1 watt of IR is the same energy as 1 watt x-ray accept bigger.  Smaller EM fields that contain smaller waves at the right range can detect relatively sized things. Radar can detect things the size of which they are as smaller waves can as well on a molecular level. Then the other misconception of higher energy in smaller EM waves also pump up medium in phosphorescence and florescence, but only due to the fact that the waves are in the same relative size for the electron to absorb the energy and be pushed out of a stable valence band such as ionizing UV light, where in mostly visible band light is either absorbed and re-emitted or converted into thermal energy and causing either long wave IR photon ejection or a higher molecular speed/temperature.  Gravity is no longer the mystery we thought of. It is thought of to be a wave and we have picked up signals using lasers but the real source of gravity is more alike a coupling AC field in a high-energy state, this is why it&#39;s attributed to mass so much. Mass is a higher energy system in a self contained reference and the Lorentz transformation equations state where there is an electric charge moving a magnetic charge must also be there, and we see those roles played in every force. Gravitational forces can be attributed to the charge of the moving systems in atomic and sub-atomic moving self contained systems. The reason why it&#39;s so very relatively weak is it&#39;s not a longitudinal or traverse wave in space but a stupidly fast AC coupling effect, it&#39;s a lot like how magnets work, but instead of having electrons moving an a polarized order and propagating out a compound field that is polarized as a semi-static field it&#39;s the &quot; particles &quot; self references field. Same effect is seen where a high voltage AC source can still couple to and attract objects. It&#39;s just not as strong as a static electric field and unlike a static field an AC field ALWAYS attracts. The whole uncertainty principle becomes useless and non-supportive once you can understand it&#39;s function, which is simply a state of this is the max tolerance of interaction we have achieve when trying to answer things like why a laser diverges. Which when you think of it is much easier explained when you realize the relative photon friction in the center vs the outside space is vastly different as in the center of the beam everything around it is already moving at light speed prospectively. This also breaks down in the laws of deep space but that&#39;s another topic. Another misconception is that relativity was formed on &quot; space time &quot; and that it&#39;s one thing and ties to quantum physics. But Einstein formulated relativity based on Newtonian physics, which applies the concept work= force/time, and then imposed the differences between how effective a system of motion at both macroscopic and microscopic would be changed whether subjugated to an area of intense gravitation flux, which because it&#39;s works on capacitive coupling and slows down the effected system. The energy in the system is linked to the relative pull and since it&#39;s all based on atomic/subatomic motions is highly linked to mass. String theory is just trying to answer that vibration effect but it comes nowhere close to the real answers of the universe because it&#39;s pretty much based on electromagnetic fields whether traverse,longitudinal,or self-contained references of motion. It&#39;s just 3 dimensions not spooky human math theories.

Like the old phrase &quot;the map is not the territory&quot;, string theory is just a way to help mathematicians try and make sense of the impossible. It&#39;s not the true nature of reality and as the guy said its not even testable and therefore by definition is unscientific. Go figure. <br><br>One point which intrigues me: why do theoretical physicists need to have a theory of everything? Why not two? The universe appears to present itself as a duality however you look at it (particle/wave being one example) and this, to me at least, may imply that the underlying essence is fundamentally unknowable in an objective scientific sense. You can see/measure it in one of two different ways and, like an optical illusion, even flip your perspective back and forth between the two but you you just can&#39;t see both simultaneously (like uncertainty principle)<br><br>I wonder if the same is true of Relativity and the Standard Model. They&#39;re not mutually exclusive after all but perhaps they support and engender each other in some essential way. Buggered if I know. It&#39;s more philosophy than science at this point but at least the philosophers had a headstart on the problem. <br><br>It reminds me of a Taoist story defining yin/yang (ie particle/wave or anything else you care to name) as perceivable aspects arising from a fundamentally unknowable &quot;creative process&quot; - which they just called the Tao and we call the Big Bang/Universe. I don&#39;t have a problem with that - the universe is pretty weird and maybe that&#39;s the way it works. If so, then could it be possible for physicists to view the Standard Model and Relativity as complementary yin/yang-style models of reality (which work and are testable!) in our 4 dimensions? It&#39;s probably as wrong as anything else but at least it negates the fiction of 10,11, 27 or 2 to-the-power-of 500 invented dimensions to satisfy the math.

But\u00a0if you use\u00a0logic, the bible was designed for man at a very low level of education. What if earth was always a nursery for heaven. Raising\u00a0sentient beings since they can not just create them. They must be raised in a Avatar body on earth and we have always been his children! You know hate the flesh! And sins are things that are not Honorable.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Take a Alzheimer patient for example. What if all that is happening is, his soul is in heaven and can no longer connect with his\u00a0body on earth? The avatar body goes on everyday but the soul that made him, him, is still in heaven just waiting for his body to die so he can be born again in heaven. Or someone that has a idiotic memory just has a perfect connection with his soul. That would mean we are all raised here to gain wisdom and honor till we die and are born again in heaven with this knowledge.\u00a0What about REM sleep? What if it is a maintenance done in heaven to reset us for a new day? I myself have seen all this in my dreams and thoughts.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wonder then if God is why so many\u00a0movies are just a different version of the &quot;MATRIX&quot;.\u00a0If you watch simulation hypothesis on YouTube you will see how science believes we are living in a simulation. Plus i believe\u00a0the\u00a0power behind this simulation is in the hidden dimension&#39;s\u00a0of string theory. With common sense you can see how this all works. It is simple, we was born to populate heaven if we live worthy in his nursery. Then what happens to those that don&#39;t play nice. They don&#39;t get in and those that kill in his name, in a nursery for heaven? Must be punished! The lesson is, nobody is hiding any thought or action from him and nobody will be able to lie at the gate, nobody! And everyone goes to threw the gate, everyone.\u00a0And now we are educated enough to understand we are promised eternal life if we are worthy. So who believes we was meant for more than our time in his nursery? And\u00a0 it&#39;s been a 13.7 billion year project to do it. Kinda puts a grip on eternity. So who&#39;s on board with Avatar Theory or are you OK with your time you get in the nursery! Please pass this on to everyone you know and search your hearts with logic and you will see Eden is possible on earth when all are educated enough to understand the true meaning of life.", "comment_date": "2018-06-01T18:53:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Emmillyy", "comment_text": "String theory has recently been proven to be wrong cus we found it that life in the past is creating us just as we are making the past now just as the future is making us now just as the future is making the pastZz", "comment_date": "2018-06-01T17:01:46Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "jan schilling", "comment_text": "Nice youtube channel !<br>Just kidding...<br><br><br><br><b>Best youtube channel EVER!!!</b>", "comment_date": "2018-06-01T15:20:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jan schilling", "comment_text": "<b>the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell</b>", "comment_date": "2018-06-01T15:18:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Copper Pumpkin", "comment_text": "What if there are 10 dementons ,we just don&#39;t have the right method to observe them all, we will never know until we do it.", "comment_date": "2018-06-01T13:12:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Natano Saltero", "comment_text": "the only way to be legit in quantum mechanics is sport a super cool tardy grade to the graphics.

The two concepts are not exactly the same, but the observer effect provides an intuitive physical interpretation of the uncertainty principle---in fact Heisenberg himself used it as a physical justification of his principle. A more precise way to introduce Heisenberg&#39;s principle is to see that very small objects, such as elementary particles, behave like waves: a famous experiment in quantum mechanics shows that electrons going past an obstacle &quot;diffract&quot;, i.e. they go around the obstacle. This is similar to how sound waves behave: if you sit in theater behind a column, you can still hear the music. The uncertainty principle is then a mathematical consequence of this wave description, or in more mathematical terms of the fact that &quot;quantum observable do not commute&quot;. In this sense it is not a principle in itself, but a consequence of the axioms of quantum mechanics; yet, given its historical importance in the development of quantum mechanics and the fact that it is a basic feature of quantum mechanical effects, physicists think of it as a founding principle of quantum physics. It is indeed correct that, while the observer effect gives an intuitive way to justify Heisenberg&#39;s principle, nowadays physicists distinguish between the two, and they have been working hard to better understand their subtle differences.", "comment_date": "2018-05-10T21:29:07Z", "likes_count": 39}, {"comment_by": "Rossana Alvarado", "comment_text": "all we know is that we don&#39;t know", "comment_date": "2018-05-10T15:05:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Math Trip", "comment_text": "which software you are using??", "comment_date": "2018-05-10T11:57:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sandra", "comment_text": "S", "comment_date": "2018-05-10T11:56:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bleflar", "comment_text": "And i thought string theory is about cat altering reality by pulling strings of universe wool.", "comment_date": "2018-05-10T10:18:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yash Sharma", "comment_text": "You gonna save my collage fee (just kidding)And Few more study after collage because U r not teaching in free as well as In Understandable way with a Wow Animation \ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25 Thankyou", "comment_date": "2018-05-10T09:39:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vanillacokejunky", "comment_text": "wow zelda reference", "comment_date": "2018-05-10T01:17:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "jamal yousef", "comment_text": "2 plus 2 is 4 minus one thats three quick mafs", "comment_date": "2018-05-09T17:56:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "causality is my god", "comment_text": "what are the strings made of?", "comment_date": "2018-05-09T16:28:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Med ali ghodhbani", "comment_text": "&quot;The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is illusion of knowledge&quot;, SH, and they say we will leave the universe using string theory or we will teleport.", "comment_date": "2018-05-09T15:34:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Heu Valadao", "comment_text": "Got faith?", "comment_date": "2018-05-09T02:48:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aksel tafenau", "comment_text": "2+2 is 4 -1 that&#39;s 3 quick mafs", "comment_date": "2018-05-08T16:01:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blue Miaou", "comment_text": "i hope this theory is true for some reason", "comment_date": "2018-05-08T16:01:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manish Mishra", "comment_text": "why birds?", "comment_date": "2018-05-08T02:28:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0648\u062f", "comment_text": "Wonderful video.

The strength of this reaction is limited because the instant the reaction takes place, the events that caused it no longer exist, making the reaction &#39;impossible&#39;. Since the two energies cannot escape their mutually attractive properties the reaction will then occur again in almost the same instant, setting up a &#39;pulse&#39; between reaction and no reaction. Depending on circumstances and environment, this &#39;light&#39; neutron may form a hydrogen atom or absorb additional strings forming heavier neutrons.<br>The video cites the irrefutable math that 2+2=4. This is wrong! If you add 1+ particle to a 1- particle, you get 1 neutral, or 0, particle, so 1+1=1. Of the possibilities that 2+2=4, there is also a possibility that 2+2=1 particle  with 2 times the mass of the 1+1=1 particle.", "comment_date": "2018-04-20T04:04:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uae40\ubb38\uae38", "comment_text": "The question is how can we be sure that the string theory is a well made wooden boat which could lead us to making a giant ship(TOE)?

I currently live in Arkansas, USA. This year I will be 24 years old. I have something very interesting I want to share. I feel it is needed. I do not know where to really share this so here I am. <br>So for a while now, most of my life, I&#39;ve had these dreams where I travel to another world or universe. Basically I call it traveling the astral realms. I feel my soul and physical body separate to its smallest levels and when I get to this destination I come back together but in a different molecular level. I am able to fly and have contact with other higher conscious beings and also I talk and visit with people who look just like some people I know In this world, but maybe a few small differences. Same goes with some places I go when I travel. They look similar to the places in this world but a little different. My theory is I&#39;m traveling into a parallel universe among other dimensions. I have grown very powerful in my abilities and awareness now since I have traveled among these places countless of times throughout my lifetime. Now this is no lie. I&#39;m not making any of this up. I have another theory that I can fly in these places because of the anti gravity that is there and my energy that is there combining creating my ability to fly. Now I&#39;m no genius or anything but I do feel I have a higher consciousness than most. So some of my wording my not be all the way correct but bare with me please like I said I&#39;m no genius. I hope you or someone out there responds to my message. This is real.<br>Oh I forgot to mention that the flying can vary in different ways. Sometimes it&#39;s like hovering. Other times if the gravitational partials are fast enough in the area or where a portal is opened I can travel faster than light. When this happened I can feel my body pulling apart to its smallest molecular level and I feel an immense pull and see bright light all around. Then suddenly as fast as it began I feel my body rush back together. When the pulling and desperation is happening I can feel the dimensions or space around me pulling closer together letting me travel to where I want to go. Sometimes the feeling is so intense it&#39;s like being reborn almost that&#39;s the best way I can describe it.", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T01:48:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremy", "comment_text": "My brain is now soup.", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T01:17:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheDreadHeadCowgirl", "comment_text": "String theory is the name of my school!", "comment_date": "2018-03-18T01:14:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L\u00e9anne Roger", "comment_text": "Can you please do a video about Stephen W.

I think the basis of quantum mechanics is that certain properties of physics are quantized, the rest of quantum physics comes from that notion.  Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle is a property derived from certain wave attributes of quantum particles, it is not an axiom upon which the basis of quantum physics is derived<br><br>String theory was not a product of the question: \u201cwhat is more complex than particles?\u201d, and stating such is awfully misleading and even dismissive imo.  It is funny, because the romantization of string theory\u2019s origin usually makes me role my eyes, about how some grad student flips through a math book and discovers archaic math... everyone knows the story.  Certainly that popular story is overly embellished, but your version is almost callously dismissive<br><br>Also, science does not use experiments to \u201cprove\u201d theories, I am bit shocked at a producer known for its great videos, but this statement that string theory has not been proven with any experiment is \u201cnot even wrong\u201d it\u2019s completely off mark.  String theory has not been falsified by any experiment, in fact string theory cannot even propose an experiment within our current ability to test.  This is the biggest criticism i have seen against string theory, the fact that it presents no falsifiable hypothesis leads many to believe it is NOT science at all.<br><br>I mean no ill will, and i enjoy your videos immensely, and frankly i was quite surprised to hear these statement from your video.

They&#39;re not the same, and they quantify different case scenarios.  Heisenberg quantifies an inverse scalar of measurement: knowing more about an item&#39;s momentum means knowing less about its specific location, and vice-versa.  This has nothing to do with observing it, and more to do with how we are able to interpret that observation.  The Observation Effect, on the other hand, has almost nothing to do with uncertainty, and everything to do with adding something &quot;extra&quot; to an otherwise closed system.<br><br>Let&#39;s use an example of a guy, walking down the sidewalk for example:<br><br>If you&#39;re on the street corner, watching him walk down the sidewalk, you can either &quot;freeze&quot; time with a photo and tell me EXACTLY where he is, at that given/frozen time, or you can measure his speed/momentum at a litany of various locations.  But measuring his momentum, in fluid time makes the ability to tell me EXACTLY where he is, at any/all of the given instances he has momentum, nearly impossible... imagine trying to yell out coordinates as he&#39;s running by at 5MPH.  It&#39;s a scalar event, so the closer you are to either momentum or position, the further away you are from the other.  This is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.<br><br>Now, let&#39;s say that this guy has a GPS speedometer on his wristwatch, and you yell at him to ask him approximately where it says he is and how fast he&#39;s moving.  He is going to slow down, probably look at you, look at his watch, and tell you that information.  The fact that you have interfered with his walk/jog has changed his position, momentum, and overall existence.  You have &quot;added something&quot; to the otherwise closed system of a guy walking down a sidewalk... now the system is a guy walking down a sidewalk, interacting with your questions.  This is the Observation Effect.<br><br>As stated in the video, by &quot;looking&quot; at a subatomic particle by using wavelengths that contain more energy than light, we&#39;re adding more energy to the otherwise closed system that is the subatomic particle.  So, whereas the particle may have been sitting there, minding its own business, it is now excited that you&#39;re asking it to check its GPS wristwatch.  The particle cannot be observed in its &quot;natural habitat&quot; without changing that habitat.

The two concepts are not exactly the same, but the observer effect provides an intuitive physical interpretation of the uncertainty principle---in fact Heisenberg himself used it as a physical justification of his principle. A more precise way to introduce Heisenberg&#39;s principle is to see that very small objects, such as elementary particles, behave like waves: a famous experiment in quantum mechanics shows that electrons going past an obstacle &quot;diffract&quot;, i.e. they go around the obstacle. This is similar to how sound waves behave: if you sit in theater behind a column, you can still hear the music. The uncertainty principle is then a mathematical consequence of this wave description, or in more mathematical terms of the fact that &quot;quantum observable do not commute&quot;. In this sense it is not a principle in itself, but a consequence of the axioms of quantum mechanics; yet, given its historical importance in the development of quantum mechanics and the fact that it is a basic feature of quantum mechanical effects, physicists think of it as a founding principle of quantum physics. It is indeed correct that, while the observer effect gives an intuitive way to justify Heisenberg&#39;s principle, nowadays physicists distinguish between the two, and they have been working hard to better understand their subtle differences.", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T12:38:28Z", "likes_count": 3697}, {"comment_by": "nudnyczlek", "comment_text": "i understood nothing, but it was cool 8 minutes", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T12:38:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L.

The current theory about black hole singularities is that the singularity is a pinpoint tear in our dimension which sucks and converts all matter into a 2 dimensional universe. If that&#39;s true then we can never know the true nature of subatomic particles or energy because subatomic particles and energy as we know it only exist the way that they do in our 3rd dimensional state.

When I was 17, having been raised to understand that \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in a building, to believe in God\u201d, I decided that \u201cGod is Energy, after all, It\u2019s everywhere\u201d. Now, some five plus decades later, scientists in the field of \u201cQuantum Physics/Mechanics\u201d, with \u201cString Theory\u201d, have postulated that there indeed may be vibrating \u201cStrings\u201d of energy everywhere. Not only in interstellar, but intergalactic space as well. The other half of my postulation rests on the question: \u201cWhat is thought?\u201d. In it\u2019s purest form, it is merely an inexplicable bit of energy. If that is also true, then that, I believe, coupled with string theory, is the mind of God. How presumptuous is mankind to believe he can truly understand the mind, let alone interpret the will of God. If I may quote the Bard\u2019s Puck: \u201cWhat fools these mortals be\u201d. Beyond that, you may ask: \u201cDoes he believe there is a God?\u201d Yes, I do. Well then, \u201cDoes he believe Jesus (of Nazareth) is the Son of God?\u201d Again. Yes, I do, as is every (hu)man a child of God. Well. How then does he explain all the different names of God and ways of worshiping Him? As Tom Sullivan (when he was still broadcasting on the radio from Sacramento) once related, he has an Egyptian friend who noted: \u201cThere is only One God, but many different ways of worshiping Him\u201d. \u201cIntelligent Design\u201d came up and how silly it is (for believing in unprovable precepts such as \u201cGods Hand Created the Heavens and the Earth\u201d, which is based on unprovable, blind Faith). And this from the same crowd who believe (as do I) that the universe was created from a \u201cCosmic Egg\u201d that came from they know not where, yet just was (but wasn\u2019t for very long), that suddenly went (\u201dBig) Bang!\u201d and voila! We are (eventually) born. No \u201cLeaps of Faith\u201d there. Nope, none at all. Oh yes, their \u201cResurrection Theology?\u201d \u201cEntropy!\u201d That\u2019s where the energy of the \u201cBig Bang\u201d eventually \u201cruns out of steam\u201d, if you will, and everything collapses back in on itself and, \u201cGuess What?\u201d, it starts all over again - maybe. And they talk about \u201cA Leap of Faith?\u201d indeed. \u201cWhat Fools We Mortals Be?\u201d \u201cYou Betcha!\u201d\u00a0<br>\u00a0 [The Reply to the &quot;Tolerance-Challenged&quot; Atheists follows]: It is strange to me that so many pass through this mortal coil with blinders on. What is as plain as the nose on my face (and a proud proboscis it is indeed) is that I\u2019m merely trying to point out that because I was raised to believe that \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in a building to believe in God\u201d (even though my middle name comes from the French for Christmas because my parents met singing carols on a Christmas Eve), \u201cThe only thing I have against \u2018Organized Religion\u2019 is that it\u2019s so \u2018Organized\u2019 \u201d (and you can quote me on that). Because my father had a beautiful baritone and was always in great demand to sing at various congregations, I would sometimes go with him to rehearsals and got to see the good church folk without their \u201cSunday\u201d, or \u201cChurch Face\u201d on. Which means I came to the realization that almost all overtly religious people were all coming from the viewpoint that only their particular interpretations were the \u201cOne, True Way\u201d regardless of what those otherwise perfectly good \u201cChurch Folk\u201d down the street, and around the corner believed. (Sort o\u2019 like Northern Ireland, or, and more immediately, the \u201cReligion of Peace\u201d vs. the rest of humanity today.)\u00a0<br>\u00a0 As to the science and cosmology of discovering not only the \u201chow\u201d, but, and to me the equally important of \u201cwhy\u201d the universe works: In my late adolescence and early teens, I was reading Bertrand Russell and Fred Hoyle amongst several others and was opening a wider view of man\u2019s place in the universe in myself. It was a time when discoveries seemed to be coming at a furious pace: \u201cBig Bang, \u201cNo Bang\u201d, \u201cSteady State\u201d, oops, \u201cBig Bang\u201d again, \u201cEntropy\u201d, et cetera \u2026 . Then came Sputnik and the Space Race was on. Then came the questions: \u201cWhat is God?\u201d, followed by, \u201cWhere is Heaven?\u201d; then: \u201cHow big and how old is the universe and how long will it last?\u201d. To me, it was a logical conclusion to meld the two. Everyone praises Einstein\u2019s genius (especially for his era), yet gloss over his spirituality. Especially in his later years.* It strikes me odd that so many, the \u201cLearned\u201d of our day pooh, pooh the very concept of something greater than themselves. Usually they pause for the briefest of moments, drawing a deep breath of, of something they cannot see (yes, yes, yes, I know it can be felt, measured, etc.), letting out the weariest of sighs, and then proceed to talk down to the rest of we mere mortals, explaining how what they cannot prove nor explain fully and completely is \u201cThe One True Way\u201d to look at the universe.\u00a0<br>\u00a0 We of today look back several centuries and chuckle at the learned fools of the day who were fervently arguing about \u201cHow many Angels can dance on the head of a pin?\u201d. Who indeed can predict how the learned of a few centuries hence will view us? In other words, everyone has blinders. It\u2019s up to each individual to open his own eyes and see. Curiosity, after all, is in Man\u2019s Nature. Whether it\u2019s the scientist or the hunter, we all want to know \u201cWhat\u2019s on the other side\u201d. \u00a0We should never stop asking. We should never stop searching. Most importantly, we should realize that we will never find all the answers because there\u2019ll always be another question to answer, another hill to climb and another river to cross.\u00a0<br>\u00a0* Well, since I wrote the forgoing, it appears that the &quot;Big Bang&quot; is once again relegated to the trash bin of formerly iron clad &quot;Scientific Consensus&quot;. [Or has it been resurrected again? I&#39;m going to start calling it the &quot;Chuckie of the Universe.&quot;]\u00a0<br>\u00a0** Sir Fredrick Hoyle\u2019s \u201cSteady State Theory\u201d, by the way, postulated that stars (and, by extension, galaxies) simply \u201cAppeared\u201d to fill the void left between them by a steadily expanding universe. I.e.: \u201cThink of a balloon\u2019s surface with dots on it. As it expands, the distance between the dots grows further and further apart. I believe that new ones simply appear to fill the void between them\u201d; (May I suggest Googling: [BBC Universe - Steady State theory challenged the Big Bang]).\u00a0<br>\u00a0 By the way: \u201cIntelligent Design&quot; doesn\u2019t challenge the \u201cHow\u201d of the universe, just the \u201cWhy\u201d.\u00a0<br>\u00a0 \u00a0<b>*</b> At the time of writing these words, I was not aware of the exact quotes. Here is an excerpt from a Time Magazine article dated: Thursday, April 05, 2007. Quote: &quot; ... Einstein did, however, retain from his childhood religious phase a profound faith in, and reverence for, the harmony and beauty of what he called the mind of God as it was expressed in the creation of the universe and its laws. Around the time he turned 50, he began to articulate more clearly--in various essays, interviews and letters--his deepening appreciation of his belief in God, although a rather impersonal version of one. One particular evening in 1929, the year he turned 50, captures Einstein&#39;s middle-age deistic faith. He and his wife were at a dinner party in Berlin when a guest expressed a belief in astrology. Einstein ridiculed the notion as pure superstition. Another guest stepped in and similarly disparaged religion. Belief in God, he insisted, was likewise a superstition.&quot; \u00a0<br>\u00a0&quot;At this point the host tried to silence him by invoking the fact that even Einstein harbored religious beliefs. &quot;It isn&#39;t possible!&quot; the skeptical guest said, turning to Einstein to ask if he was, in fact, religious. &quot;Yes, you can call it that,&quot; Einstein replied calmly. &quot;Try and penetrate with our limited means the secrets of nature and you will find that, behind all the discernible laws and connections, there remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion. To that extent I am, in fact, religious. ... .&quot; \u00a0<br>\u00a0 As a dear, but now departed, friend used to say: &quot;Great minds travel in the same rut&quot;.

Jesus is the way, the truth and the Life. If you want to know the truth, you have to know Jesus.  I wanted to know the truth, so I asked the Lord to show me the truth about creation and he showed me. If you divide matter, you eventually come to invisible particles. There are two types of indivisible particles, 1. light particles 2. inert particles. These two particles, when joined together, are the building blocks of physical matter.  Light particles are living particles that vibrate. They are indivisible, because there is nothing smaller to divided them nor will they divide themselves because they want to live. The material of light is fluid. It has peaks that jut out from the center in one direction and on the opposite side a valley is created and when the peak reaches its maximum height it starts to collapse and the valley on the opposite side begins to form a peak. The oscillation between peaks and valleys creates vibrations, which we think of as energy. Energy is vibration. Vibrations are musical. Not all light particles are the same size. The smaller the particle, the lower the vibration. The smallest particles vibrate at only one note on the musical scale. Bigger particles can vibrate at more than one note. The biggest light particles can vibrate in all notes in all musical scales. Sound is musical vibration that we can hear. Sight is musical vibration we can see. But, there are higher and lower musical vibrations that we can neither see nor hear with our physical eyes and ears. Light particles interact with other light particles of the same harmonic frequencies and they can form strings, or cluster, or webs, or chains and according to the frequencies, they take on many different geometric forms.

I&#39;ve heard it described poorly before but this takes the cake. It has nothing to do with our inability to measure how elementary particles look. To grossly oversimplify it, quantum superposition says that in the quantum world, things like position and momentum are not constant at any given time. Electrons are in multiple places at once, quarks have several different speeds at the same time, etc. While it&#39;s impossible to, for example, determine where an electron will be at a given time, you can model where that electron is most likely to be with a lot of scary looking math. Same goes for momentum. However, as your ability to predict momentum increases, your ability to predict the position decreases and vice versa. This has NOTHING to do with our inability to observe and measure the particles, that&#39;s simply how things are in the quantum world. And it can be represented with the equation delta(x) * delta(p) is greater than or equal to planck&#39;s constant over 2, where delta x would be the change in position and delta p would be the change in momentum. Variations of the uncertainty principle are also used a lot in quantum field theory. For example, one specific variation says that no quantum field is every truly equal to 0, there&#39;s always some activity going on in every field, which helps explain virtual particles. Anyways, back to my point. I said earlier that because things like electrons have to be measured in fields of probability, that&#39;s why the model of an atom commonly seen in school textbooks is inaccurate, or rather, incomplete. Electrons don&#39;t orbit or follow certain paths, or anything like that. They&#39;re better described with the uncertainty principle, and you can only make a guess on where an electron will most likely be at any given time when observed as well as what speed it&#39;s going at. And the better you can predict one of those 2 factors, the less you can predict the other. That&#39;s what the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is about. It has nothing to do with our inability to measure things, and more about the nature of the quantum world, even tho it&#39;s pretty unintuitive to try and wrap your head around the concept. That&#39;s quantum mechanics for you. The uncertainty principle is an absolutely huge part of quantum field theory that&#39;s poorly understood by most people already, and it doesn&#39;t help that such a big channel covered it so poorly and inaccurately.

Now granted i know some people might say you cant create or destroy matter, but if we are going on the theory of 1 of something combined / aka added to another of the same thing you are simotaniously destroying 2 objects to make 1 whole that denotes in our math as 2, but is probably actuslly less than 2.

In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.

Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.<br>2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it&#39;s the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too.  It occurs at the outer end of the inner arc of the horseshoe magnet.).<br>3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.<br>4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.<br>5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.<br><br>FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:<br>6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.<br>7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron&#39;s moving magnetic field.<br>8. There are probably no such thing as &quot;gluons&quot; in actual reality.<br>9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.<br>10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.<br>11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.<br>12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.<br><br>THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:<br>13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is &quot;gravity&quot;.  It&#39;s the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, &quot;gravity&quot; flips and EM goes to minimum, then &quot;gravity&quot; flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it&#39;s maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.<br>14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling &#39;gem&#39; photon) is the energy unit in this universe.<br>15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.<br>16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.<br>17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.<br>18. Everything is basically &quot;light&quot; (photons) in a universe entirely filled with &quot;light&quot; (photons).<br><br>THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:<br>19. When the electron with it&#39;s associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it&#39;s associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.<br>20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.<br>21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.<br><br>NOTES:<br>22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center&#39;s black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.<br>25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren&#39;t acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.<br>26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?<br><br>DISCLAIMER:<br>27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong. It would have to be proved or disproved to know for more certainty.<br><br><i>___________________________________________________________________________________________</i><br><br>Here is the test for the &#39;gravity&#39; portion of my TOE idea.  I do not have the necessary resources to do the test but maybe you or someone else reading this does, will do the test, then tell the world what is found out either way.<br><br>a. Imagine a 12 hour clock.<br>b. Put a magnetic field across from the 3 to 9 o&#39;clock positions.<br>c. Put an electric field across from the 6 to 12 o&#39;clock positions.<br>(The magnetic field and electric field would be 90 degrees to each other and should be polarized so as to complement each other.)<br>d. Shoot a high powered laser through the center of the clock at 90 degrees to the em fields.<br>e. Do this with the em fields on and off.<br>(The em fields could be varied in size, strength, density and depth.  The intent would be to energy frequency match the laser and em fields for optimal results.)<br>f. Look for any gravitational / anti-gravitational effects.<br>(Including the utilization of ferro cells so as to be able to actually see the energy field movements.)<br><br>(An alternative to the above would be to shoot 3 high powered lasers, or a single high powered laser split into 3 beams, each adjustable to achieve the above set up, all focused upon a single point in space.)<br><br>&#39;If&#39; effects are noted, &#39;then&#39; further research could be done.<br>&#39;If&#39; effects are not noted, &#39;then&#39; my latest TOE idea is wrong.  But still, we would know what &#39;gravity&#39; was not, which is still something in the scientific world.

It&#39;s actually shocking how well done many of the visualizations are. Well done Kurzgesagt artists!<br><br>Despite this, the inaccuracy and oversimplification of the underlying physics is a bit frustrating (one example, as pointed out by many comments, is how horribly misrepresented the uncertainty principle is). Spreading misinformation under the guise of &quot;making it understandable by the layman&quot; does not hint at the profound nature of QFT, GR, or string theory. While many of these ideas are challenging to discuss in the time frame of a video, concepts such as compactification of dimensions would be very easy to show (especially considering the artist&#39;s talents) and would explain more as to why string theory needs extra dimensions. In such an example, Kurzgesagt instead implies that the extra dimensions are just extra problems we need to make away with in the future. This is blatantly incorrect and almost insulting to what many scientists have dedicated their lives to. I recognize I am overly critical, but comments such as &quot;seeing is touching&quot; are amazing and allow the viewer to really consider what an act of observing is and think very deeply on the incredible nature of our reality (I imagined touching with light rays rather than with my hands or sound, which is kind of beautiful). Therefore, any incorrect statements have the potential to mislead daydreamers into wrong assumptions that will be difficult for them to break in the future. When introducing someone to a new concept, extreme care should be used since any biases a viewer develops from that initial learning will propagate to future understandings of the work.<br><br>&quot;What is more complex than a point? A line.&quot; This is a great example of what I am against, here a child might think they are beyond string theory if they imply, hey, I know things more complex than a line. My solution would be to explain very briefly why point particles break down and why we need strings, rather than just saying oh yeah that&#39;s a cooler way to represent things. Physics is a hard science, we dismantle why models don&#39;t work. This analytical technique is why we have gotten so far so fast.<br><br>While I will continue actively supporting this channel and its wonderful work, I just wish more care is used in future videos on representing such abstract but heavily studied phenomena.<br>Sorry for the rant, I&#39;ve just been feeling down lately.", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T16:01:16Z", "likes_count": 69}, {"comment_by": "Harsh Sharma", "comment_text": "Happy Holi and dhuleti", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T16:01:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ahmad Meshkaf", "comment_text": "The video that i was waiting for...thank you Kurzegesagt Team", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T16:01:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Talha Shahid", "comment_text": "Nice video really.

It describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.<br><br>String theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics. String theory has been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics, early universe cosmology, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics, and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of its details.", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T15:09:31Z", "likes_count": 28}, {"comment_by": "ExMythos", "comment_text": "Everything beyond electrons, protons and neutrons seems really hard to understand to me \ud83d\ude10", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T15:09:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emon Khan", "comment_text": "We have to find it out.

While it&#39;s true to a certain extent that an observation will always have an uncertainty attached to it and making an observation will change the state of the system, the HUP goes to a deeper level. The HUP states that there are certain observations/measurements that are incompatible with one another, and making one of them interferes with the uncertainty of the other.<br><br>The easiest and most taught example is the measurement of the position and momentum of a particle. The HUP allows you to make a super-precise measurement of the position, however, if you do so you&#39;ll inevitably lose much precision in the momentum. This is not related to how me make measurements, but it&#39;s a fundamental property of the universe: because of the wave-like behavior of particles, there will always be an uncertainty relation, regardless of how advanced our means of measurement are (a very good explanation is provided by Three Blue One Brown&#39;s Fourier Transform episodes).<br><br>I know it&#39;s a bit nit-picking, but it&#39;s the subtlety of the HUP that makes it fascinating. =)<br>And by the way: the effect shown in the video is called the &quot;observer effect&quot;, and it already happens in classical physics, so it&#39;s not a quantum-only effect.<br><br>\u00a0Great video as always!", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T14:36:00Z", "likes_count": 156}, {"comment_by": "Flapjackbatter", "comment_text": "You are confusing the uncertianty principle with observer effect.<br>Edit: I see I&#39;m not the only one to point that out.", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T14:35:49Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Nintendo-ds14 :D", "comment_text": ":O", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T14:35:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Klavier's Anthology", "comment_text": "best animated self-explanatory video about physics (though you skipped the entire, 11 dimensions part *M-Theory*) but ...

Furthermore it is never questioned what an object itself is, which by definition is merely an conceptual collection of properties that our mind generates. This should indicate to us that our interpretation of the nature of reality might be deeply flawed, it is Naive Realism. We attribute properties of mind to the properties of reality. We assume that objects exists because objects are a part of how our mind generates subjective reality.<br>We also rarely consider the deeply contradicting concept of reality itself. The concept of reality, by it&#39;s nature, points to something beyond conceptualization, but it does not recognize that itself is nothing but a concept. Reality, just like any other idea, is a conceptualization. It is a fundamental notion that governs our mind and it functions, yet it is very rarely questioned by the subject itself. In other words, the subject generates his entire subjective reality, including all concepts of &quot;objective&quot; reality, without noticing that the notion of objectivity by itself is completely subjectively generated. Without the subject, our idea of reality would not exist, that means that objects would not exist. The mind does not recognize that because it attributes properties like truth to certain concepts within the mind structure.<br>The mind is not only a problem solving machine, it is also a problem creating machine. This is very important to recognize, because the mind is not investigating the true nature of reality at any point, what it really is doing is investigating the true nature of it&#39;s own creation, but it is never, or only very rarely, investigating the nature of itself.<br>To investigate the nature of reality, the mind must investigate the nature of itself, because the mind generates all of subjective reality, including the notion of objective reality. Thus, we cannot derive the true nature of reality from any notions of objective reality, we can only investigate subjective reality. The investigation itself is subjective, because without subject there could be no investigation. Objects are equally subjective because without the subject the objects would not exist, simply because all notions of objects are created by subjects.<br>From the subjects point of view there is nothing but it&#39;s own subjective reality, all of reality is the subjects reality, reality itself is subjective, whatever is beyond the subjective is beyond the subjective, there is no notion, no anything, that could describe reality in any way, not because the description is flawed, but because description is not reality. Reality is no concept, thus no concept can ever describe it. Concepts seem to merely be able to describe motion, nothing beyond that. Math is nothing but the description of motion, so is physics, chemistry, biology and all other science. The mind cannot grasp anything beyond that, and it creates the deeply flawed notion that there is nothing beyond it, when itself is clearly everything but notion.<br><br>Further investigation of this matter will conclude that consciousness is the nature of reality, and that consciousness is nothing but the potential of all possibilities. It is nothingness, and nothingness is the potential of absolutely everything. That is how far concepts can get us to the nature of reality, and it is not even remotely close to what there truly is.", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T14:27:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pure Vessel", "comment_text": "QUACK QUACK", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T14:27:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Swain", "comment_text": "Awesome video!
