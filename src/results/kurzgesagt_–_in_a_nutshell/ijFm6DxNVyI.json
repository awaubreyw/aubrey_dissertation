But not as you&#39;d imagine a loop, more like the big bang energy wave is a sphere creating life until there is everything there could possibly be and once that has happened, the vaccum decay ( INVERTED SPHERE INSIDE THE THE SPEHRE FROM BEFORE ) starts and everything that could have possibly been is starting to UNEXIST.

One cubic centimeter is about the size of a sugar cube, and space is very big. Most of that energy will be dissipated into n-dimensional space. Only a tiny fraction of it will actually enter 3-dimensional space. When the light from the rip reaches the earth, it will be brighter than the sun and if you&#39;re outside when the light from the rip becomes visible, in under one minute, fully dressed, you will be badly sunburned through your clothing. Humans will cry out to the mountains, &quot;Fall on us and hide us, because the anger of God is upon us, and we can&#39;t stand it!&quot; A thousand or so years later the destruction itself will reach the Earth, and in 1/1,000,000,000,000 of a second the Earth and all space around it will be annihilated. The heavens will be thrown out like a worn-out garment, and no place will they be found. If space itself ceases to exist, there will be no place at all for anything.", "comment_date": "2021-01-14T08:02:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "reapertale ?", "comment_text": "Aww the bird papa died :(", "comment_date": "2021-01-13T17:40:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter M", "comment_text": "What if we\u2019re living in a post vacuum decay universe?", "comment_date": "2021-01-12T12:59:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sukh Srivastav", "comment_text": "this is fine", "comment_date": "2021-01-11T20:05:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clich\u00e9 Productions", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijFm6DxNVyI&amp;t=0m10s\">0:10</a> they did not make a stranger things reference...<br>THEY DID NOT-", "comment_date": "2021-01-10T22:43:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Maria Sindatry", "comment_text": "You took sooooo long to talk about vacuum decay and then you just say &quot;it might be wrong.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-01-10T22:17:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aldialml", "comment_text": "I was like oh shit and at the end like ok it&#39;s fine.", "comment_date": "2021-01-10T21:00:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gianmarco Carnevale", "comment_text": "I love the particles with pillow and blanket.", "comment_date": "2021-01-10T14:36:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christof Meckel", "comment_text": "Hey, there is no reason not to subscribe to these guys.

This is their conclusion: &quot;The possibility that we are living in a false vacuum has never been a cheering one to contemplate. Vacuum decay is the ultimate ecological catastrophe; in the new vacuum there are new constants of nature; after vacuum decay, not only is life as we know it impossible, so is chemistry as we know it. However, one could always draw stoic comfort from the possibility that perhaps in the course of time the new vacuum would sustain, if not life as we know it, at least some structures capable of knowing joy.

That, of course, would be the case if you ignore friction, but even so, potential energy would be nonexistent at the bottom of that hill, rise as the ball starts up the other side of the valley, &amp; fluctuate like that back and forth in the valley until friction brings it to the eventual resting &quot;ground state.&quot;<br>In summary, I just feel like the graphic could have been more accurately done regarding the level of potential energy.

There are characters called elementals who work together to control the workings of the universe or the workings of the minds of animals or humans. The two main elementals are called Time and Lawmaker. Lawmaker represents strong force, weak force, electromagnetic force (I think) and gravity. So this video got me thinking that if an event like the one mentioned in the video happened in the story, a new Lawmaker would have to be created along with lots of other elementals, which could be a real threat in the story. The story doesn&#39;t follow science exactly how it works, since that would make it a bit less fun, but I really like adding those types of things in what I write. I just wrote the most random thing so don&#39;t pay attention to this comment. I stayed up until 4 AM and woke up at 9 AM and wasn&#39;t aloud to have a nap then drunk two cups of coffee within ten minutes and I think I will regret this comment later.

Waiting to hear the fantastic story of the birth of this idea:<br><br>Besides, haven&#39;t most concepts of quantum tunneling been done? The scientific community have done a lot of quantum tunneling exercises with such technologies as X-Rays, microwaves, radio waves 1, particle physics and such. This feeble attempt to name a concept that someone else (I, Sherman W. Braithwaite) came with, is plagiarism. Besides, from all the examples that I have mentioned of quantum tunneling, your attempt to name a specific concept making it dominant of the term quantum tunneling is as feeble as that of the attempt to rename as per concepts based upon a principle I came up with referring to them as ideas called Independent Nodes, and Independent Resistances; Someone basically went over my head and tried to rename it Quantum Entanglement (Radio Waves Theories), whereas Quantum Entanglement was already defined in the early stages of radio waves 1, and radio waves 2 definitions. Quantum Entanglement are simply any form of radio waves. Who care if it didn&#39;t reach fruition. The point is, a concept of general radio waves 1, and radio waves 2, were defined from the start. People are just too sill to have realized that because the concept came from early theories of radio waves 1 and 2. Anyhow, Independent Nodes, and Resistances are basically a concept leading to a specific form of energy not based upon being Quantum Entanglement because that concept was already defined in the early stages of radio waves, when no one made radio waves happened. I admit I didn&#39;t know that at the time, but with simple deduction, I realized the concept some thief decided to use to undermine my work. Here we have it again, someone still trying to undermine my research by talking about an already existing principle, existing in many forms. The new form (&#39;A Medium where a SPECIFIC form of energy is applied?&#39;) of quantum tunneling (Applied Radio Waves) it would seem was so intriguing that theft/plagiarism occurred.
