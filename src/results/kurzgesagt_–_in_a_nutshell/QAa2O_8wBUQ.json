However, if this is known, then we should be able to detect/and or measure it accurately concurring to the expansion of the universe. If we have already done this and we cannot detect anything, we are left with only theories. Which kind of well sucks..., and can be positive or negative. I understand that the universe is rapidly expanding disregardless of time (trillions of years). How is it that we cannot detect something that is not there? Rate of expansion should equal the amount of the four forces in a series of math.<br><br>There has to be an equation, therefore there should at least an explanation on how space is created out of nothing. If zero is equal to zero than we have zero. I understand that more matter or space means more expansion. But where is this formula? If our universe is obviously expanding then it has to be filled...If something is filled than our only answer is particles thaf we cannot detect. I apologize if I sound rude.

Gravity attempts to pull us in, but when we go fast enough to beat the pull, it acts as a speed boost. So, the release is us going past the gravitational bond, and maybe the reason expansion is speeding up is because space is overcoming the pull of gravity, which gives it a boost. Like on one of those inflatable courses where you get hooked up to a bungee, and if you pulled hard enough to break the bungee, you will be shot forward. If that happens in space, there isn&#39;t anything to stop you from flying forward at that boosted speed, and if the gravitational bond was being broken over and over as the expansion increases more and more then the speed would continue to increase. Another thing with that, if the universe isn&#39;t infinite, and is in the shape of a sphere, then maybe the big crunch, or possibly the &quot;big bang&quot;  is the universe, that is expanding (equally?)  in all directions is the expanding matter meeting up and colliding at faster than the speed of light, and in the case of the big bang hypothesis, meeting at a single point effectively recreating the big bang.

So, it\u2019s a type of centrifugal force or spinning force as the biggest oldest items are the furthest out, and the entirety of the universe is spinning just like a wheel , only it spins wider.. if we try to freeze the expansion and then head out at light speed, we\u2019d find ourselves curving and shooting off in the wrong direction after a while?

Or can you? <br><br>The concept of space forced me outside of what I know and into my power. It puts you in \u2018God\u2019 mode when you see the bigger picture. It\u2019s beneficial to have the ability put yourself outside of what your defining and accept what we think we know as a possibility. It\u2019s also beneficial to know that we know nothing. If there is nothing outside of what we know, this would indicate \u2018God\u2019 consciousness as something contained within nothing. Do we perceive that in order for something to exist it has to be contained in some physical boundary because we are in our own bodies? Does nothing have to exist outside of us, can\u2019t it all be one? Did something create from nothing? Is this apparent nothing (dark matter and dark energy) that exists around us actually just potential? Does this nothing exist purely for us to expand into? Can you expand into something that\u2019s already there? Do we already exist in the nothing? If nothingness already exists as something, does it become visible when we evolve into it? Or are we simply just becoming aware of it or remembering something that exists? Do we already know the answers, we just don\u2019t like it? Are we spiritual are we physical? There are people who say when you know, you know. How? Coincidences happen. Patterns happen. Cycles happen. Nothing is guaranteed to stay the same. The universe didn\u2019t stay the same. <br><br>Acceptance of what is, is the hardest part of evolution of the human mind, because we can never know for certain. Evolution of the universe is pretty simple because it already knows the assignment. <br><br>How can we as human ever know something for certain? Presumably when we die and in those few minutes where everything shuts down, we could possibly create what we believe, or we not. That\u2019s the only time we can be certain is that spilt second of being in between conscious and not conscious is the only time we will ever know. Is it worth the risk of wishing to know?<br><br>Even when you consider the gas that compressed to form the Big Bang, the electrons, neutrons and protons, that were created from \u2018nothing\u2019 as we know it, became conscious of itself in a state of nothingness around it. Or did it? Where did consciousness begin? Was the nothing before something conscious? Is dark matter  or energy our collective conscious? Is dark matter and energy our spirit, pushing the universe to expand, create and evolve? Does the brain and human body exist to carry consciousness? To focus it? Without the brain would the energy that existed before, create a single path of nothingness? Was it conscious? Did it have to create something or was it pure chance? Presumably it was just a single state, before anything existed, maybe not. Did it split off into different states? Why? What\u2019s the point in something existing? <br><br>If something does already exist outside of what we know, how do we know it existed before we knew it? <br><br>The real question to me is why does \u2018nothing\u2019 have to exist, for something to exist? Why did \u2018nothing\u2019 have to create something? Why did it have to do anything at all? What\u2019s the point? Why do we perceive nothing as nothing? To itself it is something, we just don\u2019t know what it is. Einstein was a genius, he created something from nothing, from his perception and his ability to express what was previously undefined. It gave us a starting point to define other undefined things. He doesn\u2019t always have to be correct and I think he understood that. <br><br>Also, Dark matter or energy might not be invisible to everything just us. We are catching up on billions or years of evolution at rapid speed. It\u2019s ok to not know.<br><br>Time is a by product of motion, without motion time wouldn\u2019t exist and vice versa, without time and motion, we wouldn\u2019t evolve everything would be static. If everything were static the universe wouldn\u2019t expand. Motion accelerates evolution, such as the universe is expanding and our minds expand with it. The universe expands quicker because our minds expand quicker, from our perception. Which is all we can perceive as when we learn something new it becomes part of our experience. Our experience and knowledge is bias towards survival. <br><br>People say \u2018everything is relative\u2019. I don\u2019t believe everything, at a fundamental state, is relative in and of itself, it just is what it is. A bottle of water is still a bottle of water no matter how you look at it. A cup is a cup. Wether it\u2019s a big cup or a small cup doesn\u2019t really matter. Our opinions and thoughts don\u2019t matter. <br><br>Everything appears to have a cycle. Cycles of the universe appear to be endless and of different lengths. Does this mean that we as humans have an endless cycle of life and death? For this to be true, everything else would have to have an endless cycle, which we know stars do not. But the energy of that stars carries on until I\u2019m changes state to something not visible. Dark matter and energy maybe? <br><br>Things are only relative to our perception and senses. To itself, it just is what it is. The universe reflects back to you what you want to see. Just because more than one person agrees with you, doesn\u2019t make it true. We are creating a backstory by retrofitting it. We can create whatever we want. Are we creating the right story though? Is this what we want? How big does the Universe have to get for us to understand that it doesn\u2019t want us to know\u2026 yet or maybe ever. Just have faith that it\u2019s going to be ok. Find your peace, that\u2019s all you really can do. Go within and control your inner universe. <br><br>\u2018Don\u2019t worry about what\u2019s behind you, focus on what\u2019s in front\u2019 Brian Andrew Harvey my Grandad \ud83d\udc95", "comment_date": "2022-01-17T01:48:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sahil Yadav", "comment_text": "&quot;What is dark energy?&quot;<br>Kurzgesagt: It is something that is isn&#39;t", "comment_date": "2022-01-14T09:35:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blaine Fiasco", "comment_text": "Those 3 things you know are pretty vague and general.", "comment_date": "2022-01-14T02:26:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AlexGaming", "comment_text": "\u201dDark matter is not made up of black holes.\u201d<br><b>Makes a video 5 years later saying that it is very possible that it could be mini-black holes</b>", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T19:12:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dave", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ&amp;t=1m37s\">1:37</a>, do you mean dark matter, rather than dark energy?", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T05:35:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rebel Radio", "comment_text": "We&#39;ll just wait for another Einstein to be born in the future.", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T02:32:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffrey Smith", "comment_text": "Physicists continue to hunt for the building blocks of the Universe no matter how many Waves that the universe says otherwise.<br><br>But the baby&#39;s insist on having blocks to build with in music class. <br>Still beating the drum of particle based reality with a table leg. <br><br>Changing reality is as easy as changing metaphors from cubits to qubits. <br>Image is reality.

Scientists want to enter into other dimensions.  We are not meant to enter into these other dimensions.  I am not saying we can&#39;t.  I am saying we shouldn&#39;t.  Why do they perform rituals while they are trying to discover why the earth came into being?  They can not accept that God created the universe.  That would explain everything.  But no, they spend enormous amounts of money trying to create the big bang.  They want to eliminate God from the equation.  They want to play god or be gods.  If you enter into other dimensions, beings from those dimensions will enter our world.  Those entities can do that now to a certain extent through entering one&#39;s minds, possession of one&#39;s soul, and even appearing in our time and space.  But if we open up that portal, we will not be able to control who or what comes in.  If you believe in the spiritual world, you should know that there are two spiritual worlds: one good and one bad.  It really is that simple.  The good part contains God and His angelic beings that are good.  The other one is evil.  Both can enter into our world appearing not as they are.  Remember an angel appearing as a man.  But probably could appear in any form if they wanted to.  If beings as some claim to be aliens from other worlds were totally good, would they perform horrible experiments on mankind?  Would they not appear to mankind where people could see them?  After all, if they were so far advanced, would they even fear our weapons?  But perhaps they are a mix of human and spiritual.  That is why they can be killed.  But you can not kill the spiritual part only the human part.  If you really believe in the bible, you could accept that there was a time when the two mixed.  How, I don&#39;t know.  But somehow it was possible.  We live in a strange world where there are many forms of life.  How do life forms exist in extreme conditions?  We can not understand all the mysteries of life.  Perhaps, it is better that way.  The bible warns us not to enter those worlds.  But blindly, scientists still do it.  We spend so much money trying to contact other worlds.  If they were good and could reach us, they would contact us not the other way around.  What is the purpose anyway?  If they spent all the money that spend on such things on human beings on the earth, they could end human suffering.  Why do we want all that technology?  All we ever do with it is create more deadly weapons with it.  How many ways can you kill a person?  The scientists and the military, &quot;Let us count the ways.&quot;  Mankind has not learned to stop fighting with each other.  Mankind has not learned how to stop wanting more money and power.  Mankind has not stopped wants to be gods and living forever.  Mankind has not stopped learning how to stop messing with our genetic make-up that makes us truly human and good.  We don&#39;t become super-human to be better humans.  We become super humans so we can fight with other super humans.  Even in the best of humankind is the instinct to retaliate when someone hurts us.  We may not act on it but it is still there.  All these centuries have taught us nothing.  We don&#39;t fight to end suffering in the world.  We fight for financial reasons.  Now we are creating a world of humans that instead of getting healthier, they want more drugs that ruin their brains.  How many people now are on drugs.  Society is handing it out like candy.  Dumb them down so we can control them better is their motto.  We have the greatest of minds and technology is blooming.  But we can&#39;t even take care of the world&#39;s citizens.  Scientists want to reach Mars.  Who cares if people still don&#39;t have access to clean water or food to exist?  Traveling to outer space is more important than solving how to help people living on the street.  Our priorities are all wrong.  How foolish to want to live forever?  Is this life a life to desire for all time?  I hope not.  I pray for an afterlife and going to a world without pain and suffering.  But they want to live here in some kind of body for all time.  What kind of existence is that?  A wormhole even if it lets us travel through time and even if possible will only take us to a time we shouldn&#39;t visit or change.  If people came back, would people change?  I doubt it.  If they warned us of a bad future, would they listen?  I think not.  We will reach a time, that is the world still exists then, where we will enter into new worlds.  It is very sad that we can not take care of our own planet, our own citizens of this world, and concentrate on bettering this world instead of satisfying our own curiosity in our quest of knowledge.", "comment_date": "2021-04-21T16:13:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lillith9008", "comment_text": "&quot;On this evening&#39;s episode of &#39;Around the Universe&#39;, we will be discussing dark energy!

They are simply added to create a sum tally number.\r<br>\r<br><br>Apply rule one:<br><br>-273.15 Absolute Zero\r<br>-274.15 Cosmic Microwave Background at One degree above Absolute Zero.\r<br>-275.15 Cosmic Microwave Background at Two degrees above Absolute Zero.\r<br>-276.15 Cosmic Microwave Background at Three degree above Absolute Zero.<br><br>\r<br>2 = 6 Zero&#39;s, 7 = 14 Zero&#39;s, 3 = 3 Zero&#39;s, (decimal point) 1 + 5 = 6. -273.15 (6 + 14 + 3 + 6 = 29) Twenty nine zero&#39;s.\r<br>2 = 6 Zero&#39;s, 7 = 14 Zero&#39;s, 4 = 4 Zero&#39;s, (decimal point) 1 + 5 = 6. -273.15 (6 + 14 + 4 + 6 = 30) Thirty zero&#39;s.\r<br>2 = 6 Zero&#39;s, 7 = 14 Zero&#39;s, 5 = 5 Zero&#39;s, (decimal point) 1 + 5 = 6. -273.15 (6 + 14 + 5 + 6 = 31) Thirty one zero&#39;s.\r<br>2 = 6 Zero&#39;s, 7 = 14 Zero&#39;s, 6 = 6 Zero&#39;s, (decimal point) 1 + 5 = 6. -273.15 (6 + 14 + 6 + 6 = 32) Thirty two zero&#39;s.<br>\r<br>29 + 30 + 31 + 32 = 122<br><br>\r<br>I hope this opened your mind to new idea about how mathematics may operate.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Mark Anthony Rockliff<br><br>Perth WA, Australia<br><br>.", "comment_date": "2021-03-25T21:46:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony A", "comment_text": "when a human has been enlighten , one can activate sacral chakra and drawn dark matter to one self , and walk around the earth and create shivers on the humans around you ^_^... im assuming you have a good  hearth and are not taken away by the male reptilian who&#39;s dna still being carry inside.", "comment_date": "2021-03-25T00:16:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Folofus", "comment_text": "Anyone else come here after the news that dark matter may not even exist? \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T11:15:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aranimda", "comment_text": "Scientists: Believing in God is unscientific.

So when they examined galaxies and studied galaxy rotation, they expected to see the same, i.e.; stars closer to the galactic center traveling faster than stars out on the edge where gravity would be weaker. But they saw something different. Stars far from the center of galaxies were traveling as fast as stars near the center. Like an Album turning on a turntable. The outside edge has the same speed as the center edge. There simply was not enough matter in a galaxy to cause this.

Again, to reference a much simpler form of this, look at what happens when we die. We don&#39;t just disappear into nothing, we leave something behind.

Einstein said mass is not in space time,  but are extensions of space time.  So, what if the total mass of the universe,  cannot be found,  by measuring it in any single reference of time,  in other words,  at any given moment,  there is a finite amount of mass,  in that moment of time.  So, to know the actual mass of the universe,  we would need a way,  to measure its mass over time. What I&#39;m saying is,  how do we know,  that the missing mass of the universe,  is not simply located,  in different references of time? I mean what physics do we have,  that says the total mass of the universe,  must all exist,  in a given reference of time? What I&#39;m saying is,  that if in a given measure of Time,  if I measure the mass of the universe,  how do we know,  that that mass figure,  is not specific to the time reference.  If matter were spread out over time, then you could never measure it in a single reference of time,  and get its total mass,  since its spread out over time, to calculate the mass of the universe,  would require formulating its mass spread out over time,  and in all the universes time,  that would give us the total mass.  The missing mass, is lost in time,  it&#39;s not lost in space.  Some of its mass should exist in the past,  some of it in the present,  and some of it in the future.  You would never be able to measure its total,  from a single reference in time. I mean think of it like a pie, divided into slices. Each moment in time,  would give you only a slice of the total mass of the universe.  Any observation we make in time,  would only reflect that slice, which you could never measure the total mass of the universe,  by measuring just a slice, but you would have to find a way, to add up all of the slices.", "comment_date": "2020-09-27T19:57:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dibyam Bhardwaj", "comment_text": "It&#39;s like surface web, dark web, and deep web.", "comment_date": "2020-09-27T19:08:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jack", "comment_text": "when you get dark elixir in clash of clans", "comment_date": "2020-09-27T19:00:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maxiluc", "comment_text": "This might be a dumb question but whatever.<br>Can&#39;t the expansion of the universe just be attributed to the fact it&#39;s been constantly expanding since the big bang?

The concept of aether was used in several theories to explain several natural phenomena, such as the traveling of light and gravity. In the late 19th century, physicists postulated that aether permeated all throughout space, providing a medium through which light could travel in a vacuum, but evidence for the presence of such a medium was not found in the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment, and this result has been interpreted as meaning that no such luminiferous aether exists.", "comment_date": "2020-09-24T13:54:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neil Lunavat", "comment_text": "But why does it matter?", "comment_date": "2020-09-24T13:37:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anjan Goddu", "comment_text": "I think its time to face reveal", "comment_date": "2020-09-24T09:52:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Still", "comment_text": "Does the act of observation change dark energy in sort of the same way the double slit experiment works.

And after the 2nd. World War Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born in the 20th century he was a child or poor infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until the year 2036 he is the dictator of Russia and antichrist (Criminal-Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or currently protests of racism among others. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, we must apply the corrective of ending once and for all with the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that they do have active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Island Cayman, VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, HaMishtara HaTzvait- ISRAEL among others, since they are breeding grounds for demon allies or helpers of the antichrist of the century 21 and these helper demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine POPE of the Catholic Church Francisco, WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkish empire, Iran empire, Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA failed \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator of VENEZUELA Nicolas Maduro Moros who has ill-gotten 5,000,000,000 dollars deposited in the Vatican bank not including the ill-gotten billions of dollars that they constantly deposit in his anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc&quot; a small part is sold to the previously named helper demons of the 21st century antichrist but really Most of those riches are sold primarily NOT to Russia but directly to the current 21st century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the antichrist of the 21st century and all his &quot;helper demons including Nicolas Maduro Moros- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use them to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or in a general way to harm or submit to the humanity. In the world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called a caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the disclosure as a state secret of the INTERNET since it is currently NOT only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the bottom of the ocean with the INTERNET is nothing hidden . And the 3rd. Event is the disclosure to humanity that will be announced no later than or MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the missing link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. There will always be only wars: &quot;conventional as all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will later come to this in order either to unjustly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there is more old or elderly population living there than young population and also due to mishandling of batteries as the capitalist communist republic of CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. Hence, my theory comes that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there have been more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal and plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why we must end several myths that seem Childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God since our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 2) That the dinosaurs They were extinguished by a huge meteorite or asteroid that hit the earth and the oil came or is the product of that extinction. What DOES really happen is that the aliens were modifying the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs so that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem. And scientifically or technically oil exists before the dinosaurs or since the planet earth was formed since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Oil in Rock or Crack and buried at high depths the oil is liquid or molten since the rock Oil crack due to the high temperature and pressure under the earth or at the bottom of the sea this becomes liquid or molten also as is the case of iron at the level of the earth&#39;s surface or in mountains and far from the core of the earth is in solid form iron, on the other hand, in the center of the iron-nickel earth is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that exist there creating the famous magnetic field that protects us from the gamma radiation and neutrons that come of space especially the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of the dinosaurs, then I ask, is it that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or purebred dinosaurs lived perhaps only in the North Sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ? In our universe there are asteroids that contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; also petroleum in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest oil reserves in rock or crack are held by the USA, whose technology to melt or exploit it was transferred or rented to the Republic of China since they have huge amounts of crack or oil in rock and this oil reserves in rock or crack of the USA surpass the liquid oil reserves that VENEZUELA and OPEC countries have. 3) That there is fresh water on the earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since there are huge reservoirs of fresh water below the earth&#39;s surface, as in several comets, planets and asteroids they are sources of frozen fresh water supply. 4) That man did not go, did not step on, or did not reach the moon, since on 07/15/1969 he did arrive and colonize the moon and at the end of the 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology see plane TR-3 Black blanket. 5) MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded due to a missile impact error on 03/08/2014. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as I affirm or confess on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of the USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of the possible pandemic such as the covid-19. 6) That it was by chance that the asteroid that exploded in the airspace of Tunguska-Siberia-RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What if it really happened is that the 10,000-year-old black knight extraterrestrial artifact that orbits between the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired a beam of energy to prevent further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile approaches or orbit close to it. There is a trace recently discovered that in our ancestor with more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced technologies of wars between extraterrestrials. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for &quot;Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction&quot; and NOT by mere chance.

The matter and energy in the universe is not speeding up either.. The fabric of space/time is expanding itself which was created in the &quot;big bang&quot;. And as it expands like a balloon objects move further apart an increasing speed just like two dots on the surface of a balloon move faster apart as the balloon expands. Gravity can not exert force on space itself but does dilate time. Only the objects therein are pulled so there is no stopping the expansion of the universe with gravity unless time is reversed. Space itself will continue to expand.(Objects however have been observed to move faster than light but does not defy the light speed barrier because space is what is actually moving.\u00a0<br><br>To test this theory scientist would only need to confirm the acceleration of the matter in the universe is speeding up/away from each other at the same rate as an expanding balloon would. (as opposed to the mystical dark energy being the cause)The universe is probably expanding at a set speed set by the big bang. The matter just appears to be speeding up because the bubble is getting bigger.<br><br>Last interesting though...<br>Since objects in space have through an odd loophole have already broken the speed of light barrier in relation to our observations (by being in expanding space.) I am sure there may be other paradoxes. Could it to ever collapse back to a single point since time would quite possibly be working in reverse for objects perceived\u00a0to us to be moving past the light barrier. Maybe it could get so fast that time could reverse again? Perhaps as the mass increases for the objects traveling faster than light the dilation becomes so acute that there could be a collapse/reversal after all?", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T05:23:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Africa98", "comment_text": "Dialectical path is the right answer.

Dark matter&#39;s observed by noticing that the outer part of galaxies is moving faster than the center.  It is possible that blackholes of the center of each galaxy exist before the big bang. They attract each other and form clusters due to their gravity.  They just capture the stuff from the big bang and since black hole spins, it forms the disk shape.  The leftover energy of the big bang causes the outer part of the galaxy to move faster than its center.  A black hole is still an object caused by the collapsing of gigantic stars. And the object is still sitting in this space-time and they engulf everything in their parts including each other.  The gravity is so strong that it shut off the lighting property of space-time.  Blackhole forms and consumes, and one day, when it gets too big it explodes creating the big bang. It recycles the universe. After all, dark energy, dark matter, black hole, and the big bang are made up of the assumptions.   No one really knows.

However, quantum theory seems to be more accepted as the years plod on. Quantum theory, is especially designed to be as unintelligible and complicated as possible, so that the peons may not learn the secrets of their university graduate overlords. A basic explanation of Quantum Theory is the Shroedinger&#39;s Cat example. A cat, locked in a box, may die, but you won&#39;t know until you look. Until then the cat is in a state of &quot;quantum flux&quot;, I.E the cat is both alive AND dead, simultaneously. Of course, any scientist can tell you, that is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange eons even death may die.

Rather, matter subsists through a meaning, and that meaning is life, it is spirit.<br>   Also, as may be established through observation, matter is not the thing served so that everything may be ascribed to it. It is rather the servant; it renders service to the process of the perfection of a truth. And that truth is life. And the fundament of that truth is spirit.<br>   Also, as is self-evident, matter is not dominant so that recourse may be made to it or perfections sought from it. Rather, it is dominated; it looks to the decree of some fundament, it is in motion in the way that that decree dictates. And that fundament is life, it is spirit, it is consciousness.<br>   Also, as is necessary, matter is not the kernel, it is not the fundament, it is not a settled abode so that events and perfections may be affixed to it or constructed on it. Rather, it is a shell prepared to be split, rent, dissolved; it is a husk, it is froth, it is a form.<br>   Consider the following: a creature so minute it can only be seen with a microscope has such acute senses it can hear its friend&#39;s voice, and see its sustenance; it has extremely sensitive and sharp senses. This demonstrates that the effects of life increase and the light of the spirit intensifies in proportion to the reducing and refining of matter. It is as though the more matter is refined and the more we become distanced from our material existences, the closer we draw to the world of the spirit, the world of life, and the world of consciousness; and the more intensely the heat of the spirit and the light of life are manifested.<br>   Is it therefore at all possible that there should be this many distillations of life, consciousness, and spirit within this veil of materiality, and that the inner world which is beyond this veil should not be full of conscious beings and beings with spirits? Is it at all possible that the sources of these numberless distillations, flashes, and fruits of meaning, spirit, life and the truth apparent in this material existence in the Manifest World should be ascribed only to matter and the motion of matter, and be explained by it? God forbid! Absolutely not! These innumerable distillations and flashes demonstrate that this material and manifest world is but a lace veil strewn over the inner and spirit worlds.<br>Risale-i Nur Collection Words - 526<br>Bedi\u00fczzaman Said Nursi", "comment_date": "2020-01-03T11:35:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MEHAZ", "comment_text": "All-Glorious Maker created the seven levels of the heavens. The planets swim in the heavens like fish and glorify God. It is said in a Hadith: &quot;The skies are waves held back.&quot;  That is, &quot;the heavens are an ocean the waves of which are stationary.&quot;<br>   And so, we shall prove this truth of the Qur&#39;an extremely briefly through seven rules and seven aspects of meaning.<br>   First Rule: <br>   It is established by science and philosophy that limitless space is not an infinite vacuum, but filled with matter called ether.<br>   The Second: <br>   It is established by science and reason, and indeed by observation, that the bond of the laws governing the heavenly bodies like those of attraction and repulsion, and the conductor and transmitter of forces in matter like light, heat, and electricity is a matter which fills space.<br>   The Third: <br>   It has been established empirically that together with remaining as ether, like other matter, it has various forms and formations. Just as there are three states of the same matter, liquid, gas and solid, like steam, water, and ice, so too there is nothing to reasonably prevent ether having seven states or levels; it cannot be objected to in any way.<br>   The Fourth: <br>   If the heavenly bodies are studied carefully, it will be seen that there is a difference in the levels. The level which contains the vast cloud-like sphere called the Milky Way of course does not resemble the level of the fixed stars. It is as if the level of fixed stars have ripened and matured like the fruits of summer, while the uncountable stars apparent in the form of a cloud in the Milky Way are constantly emerging and beginning to mature. According to accurate conjecture, the level of fixed stars also appears different to the level of the solar system. And so on. One may adduce seven systems and seven levels which differ from one another.<br>   The Fifth: <br>   It is established by conjecture, sense, inductive reasoning, and experience that if a material is given order and form and if other artefacts are made from the material, it becomes various levels and forms. For example, when a diamond mine is begun to be worked, from the material both ashes and coal and diamonds are produced. And for example, when fire is begun to be formed, it separates into the levels of flame, smoke, and embers. And for example, when water and oxygen are combined, levels like water, ice, and steam are formed. That is to say, it is understood that when a single substance is worked, it may separate into levels. In which case, when Creative Power starts to work in the substance called ether, in accordance with the verse, and fashioned them into seven heavens, it created from it seven sorts of heavens as differing levels.    The Sixth: <br>   The above indications necessarily indicate both the existence, and the plurality, of the heavens. Since the heavens are certainly numerous, and through the tongue of the Qur&#39;an the Bringer of Sure News stated that they are seven, for sure they are seven.<br>   The Seventh: <br>   Since in Arabic, terms like seven, seventy, and seven hundred express multiplicity, those universal seven levels may comprise multiple levels.<br>   In Short: <br>   The All-Powerful One of Glory created the seven heavens from ether, and forming it into levels, ordered it with a truly fine and wondrous order and sowed the stars in it. <br>Risale-i Nur Collection Flashes - 99 Bedi\u00fczzaman Said Nursi(R.

Both the &quot;Steady State&quot; model as well as the &quot;Big Bang&quot; Theory have both been discredited in July 2019, when  the first details began to emerge of a series of discoveries by a Hi-Tech Electrical Engineering company that is literally turning Physics on its head. They have almost accidentally proven the &quot;Electric Universe&quot; model in pursuit of new Multi-Billion Dollar technologies which were suspected if the Electric Universe model could stand up to rigorous Laboratory testing. No new technology it should be noted is going to be possible if the Science is spurious ! <br><br>The first details of the testing under the name SAFIRE project were released at an Engineering &amp; Science conference at Bath University in July 2019. As these are Engineering discoveries the company has already announced it has NO intention of bothering with the Scientific &quot;Peer review&quot; methods of announcing and subjecting its methods to scrutiny, as it basically sneers at Science for wasting decades chasing Theoretical nonsense.   <br><br>As a result of proving the Electric Sun model to be correct, and indeed pushing beyond the boundaries of known Physics, the first discovery revealed is a way of &quot;turning off&quot; radiation. Secondly comes a new type of Nuclear Radiation Free Reactor (already on the drawing board) which promises cheap green energy more efficient that either Wind generators or solar panels. Understanding the true nature of how Stars and the Universe work electrically, has revealed in the Laboratory, that Plasma is not conforming to the Newtonian Law of Gravity. A nice little conundrum which reveals Science has already been left behind. Out of the window, go: BLACK HOLES; Dark Matter; Dark Energy; Expanding Universes; Big Bangs; Steady State Universe; and Einstein&#39;s daft nonsense. Which by default dumps Quantum mechanics as well. Back to Kindergarten for many Scientists it seems. <br><br>The revelations so far by this Hi-Tech Company has now drawn in the US Government, who are most likely interested in where  this may all lead. Indeed the Hi-tech Company says that opening one door is leading to a number of others, and they may have opened Pandora&#39;s box. They will currently Nov 2019 only say there&#39;s a lot more to come, much of which it seems involves a total re-writing of how we understand our solar system and the Universe.

It was in essence already described as &#39;length contraction&#39; of high speed objects in Einstein&#39;s special relativity.

It is only due to the fact that all countless electron planes are unaligned that cumulatively we experience this restmass space contraction to operate radially.

So called `Dark Matter`is just matter in a different Dimension bacause there are frequences of everything,also matter.There are Physical Universes in Dimensions above us and below,and since matter and energy are two sides of the same thing; and when I say `below` us I mean that OUR matter is not the result of the most concentrated form of energy; get it? Good. Say for the sake of this example that there are TEN physical universes  each occupying the same `space` but not the same frequency/Dimension and each With different timelines so that Our PRESENT can be anothers PAST or FUTURE .Gravity,being MULTIDIMENSIONAL which means that it Works between all the ten Universes so that the Gravity from OUR matter contributes to stabilizing the others and the Gravity from the other universes contribute to stabilizing OURS,each one contributing to to the other nine;a bit like the `Three Musketeers` rule: `All for one and one for all`. That is why Our matter(the only one we currently perceive) only accounts for a small part of that Gravity.I use the term PHYSICAL Universe because there are also NON-PHYSICAL ONES in which Gravity has NO effect.  I have`nt quite figured out what `Dark Energy`is yet so let me get back to you on that. But in the meantime I`ll give you a bit of info on Black Holes; they shift between at least two states and since I`m not a scientist(if I was I would`nt have known any of this) I`ll Call them `Hungry` and `Full`. Black holes become unstable and suck in vast amounts of matter/energy that they accellerate to UNBELIEVABLE LEVELS and Re-Energize energy ITSELF, in a way very hard to explain and spews it out through a White Hole. In so doing they give their contribution to the Re Energization of the Universe itself because Scientists are WRONG about `All the stars eventually burning out etc and the Univers going dark because it receives Energy from Sources they know NOTHING about including microscopical black holes so tiny that atoms would be like planets to them.They have yet to Discover those,if they ever will.Thank you for Your time.

The fact that space appears to be more dense near galaxies is because they will have attracted huge  amounts of microscopic dust and stray atoms surrounding them which, in turn is sucked in by the gravity of the galaxy.  Although  microscopically unrecordable, collectively they probably contain just as much matter  as the galaxy which they surround and, of course,  collectively, they  will exert a gravitational force, which is being misreported as the gravity created by dark matter. The problem with astronomy in relation to dark matter is that it cannot contemplate something that enjoys its own physics. It has to be measurable.That is arrogance locked in the belief that  physics can explain everything i.e. the cause and effect will  be observable.

Then according to our knowledge of mass and inertia, this galaxy and every other one measured should totally fling them-selves apart. But they don&#39;t. Therefore science has concluded that what we see is the effect of [MORE] gravity. More than the gravity from the matter visible, so the matter that produces this gravity is invisible. So let&#39;s call it &#39;Dark Matter&#39;... This scientific method has a flaw. Here it is. When scientists saw the spin of these measured galaxies was too great for the mass of those galaxies to keep in gravity/balance, scientists assumed they saw more of the same gravity, requiring more of the same gravity producing mass, when what they saw was a DIFFERENT gravity. This is just a hypothetical... What if the Earth, planets and sun emit a gravity that works like we understand... (We have an understanding that if you jump off a cliff you&#39;re going to fall. But we have NO idea why.) However, we attribute gravity to mass, and expect it to do as it&#39;s supposed to do. But we didn&#39;t see that when we measured the speed of rotation of galaxies. We saw too much speed for the mass. I think that galaxies are kept from flinging apart by a different kind of gravity. And that gravity comes from super-compressed mass such as in &#39;Sagittarius A*&#39;. This mass under unimaginable pressure emits a &#39;focused&#39; gravity that adds to and amplifies normal gravity - The amplification effect is cumulative, so matter close to this super-compressed gravity source reacts as normal gravity is acting on it. (Granted incredible gravity due to the incredible amount of mass in a super-compressed mass gravity producer such as the super massive black hole in the center of our and most galaxies. So close to the source, the different gravity doesn&#39;t amplify and adds very little. As that cumulative-effect gravity spreads to the edge of it&#39;s galaxy, it has grown in amplification by hundreds, even thousands of times and galaxies do not fling apart. AND invisible matter is not necessary.) Further more, I propose that the gravity of both of these types moves faster than light. (I also think that the different types of gravity will eventually be found to be a spectrum. With different masses producing gravity with different attributes.)", "comment_date": "2019-10-02T04:52:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Why Google?", "comment_text": "Crashing gravity waves; splashes of space time.

The planets swim in the heavens like fish and glorify God. It is said in a Hadith: &quot;The skies are waves held back.&quot;  That is, &quot;the heavens are an ocean the waves of which are stationary.&quot;<br>   And so, we shall prove this truth of the Qur&#39;an extremely briefly through seven rules and seven aspects of meaning.<br>   First Rule: <br>   It is established by science and philosophy that limitless space is not an infinite vacuum, but filled with matter called ether.<br>   The Second: <br>   It is established by science and reason, and indeed by observation, that the bond of the laws governing the heavenly bodies like those of attraction and repulsion, and the conductor and transmitter of forces in matter like light, heat, and electricity is a matter which fills space.<br>   The Third: <br>   It has been established empirically that together with remaining as ether, like other matter, it has various forms and formations. Just as there are three states of the same matter, liquid, gas and solid, like steam, water, and ice, so too there is nothing to reasonably prevent ether having seven states or levels; it cannot be objected to in any way.<br>   The Fourth: <br>   If the heavenly bodies are studied carefully, it will be seen that there is a difference in the levels. The level which contains the vast cloud-like sphere called the Milky Way of course does not resemble the level of the fixed stars. It is as if the level of fixed stars have ripened and matured like the fruits of summer, while the uncountable stars apparent in the form of a cloud in the Milky Way are constantly emerging and beginning to mature. According to accurate conjecture, the level of fixed stars also appears different to the level of the solar system. And so on. One may adduce seven systems and seven levels which differ from one another.<br>   The Fifth: <br>   It is established by conjecture, sense, inductive reasoning, and experience that if a material is given order and form and if other artefacts are made from the material, it becomes various levels and forms. For example, when a diamond mine is begun to be worked, from the material both ashes and coal and diamonds are produced. And for example, when fire is begun to be formed, it separates into the levels of flame, smoke, and embers. And for example, when water and oxygen are combined, levels like water, ice, and steam are formed. That is to say, it is understood that when a single substance is worked, it may separate into levels. In which case, when Creative Power starts to work in the substance called ether, in accordance with the verse, and fashioned them into seven heavens, it created from it seven sorts of heavens as differing levels.    The Sixth: <br>   The above indications necessarily indicate both the existence, and the plurality, of the heavens. Since the heavens are certainly numerous, and through the tongue of the Qur&#39;an the Bringer of Sure News stated that they are seven, for sure they are seven.<br>   The Seventh: <br>   Since in Arabic, terms like seven, seventy, and seven hundred express multiplicity, those universal seven levels may comprise multiple levels.<br>   In Short: <br>   The All-Powerful One of Glory created the seven heavens from ether, and forming it into levels, ordered it with a truly fine and wondrous order and sowed the stars in it. <br>Risale-i Nur Collection Flashes - 99 Bedi\u00fczzaman Said Nursi(R.

But what he got wrong is that the universe were expanding at accelerating rates. Halton Arp is right by pointing that different portions of a galaxy can have different red-shift readings. Generally, dimmer stars will have very high red-shift readings. Brighter stars have lower red-shift readings. In addition, stars at the edges of visible universe are generally dimmer thus they all have very high red-shift readings which don&#39;t necessarily imply that they were retreating at accelerating rates away from us. In conclusion, it is wrong to believe that the entire universe were expanding at accelerating rates. Why?NASA claimed that Hubble Space Telescope can see the formative state of the young universe which implies that those celestial bodies were travelling much faster than the speed of light in the past but somehow they have slowed down for some time slow enough now for the light of the past to catch up with us that allowing us to see the young universe. This is simple kinematic problem. If the expansion of the universe is accelerating since Big Bang, it is impossible for us to be able to see the past of the universe when it was young. Disclosure by NASA attests that the universe is slowing down in its expansion to pave way for imminent implosion to facilitate next round of Big Bang. Space between celestial bodies is not just space. Scattering celestial bodies within the entire universe is like rubber band where stretching (using kinetic energy) it will increase its &quot;elastic&quot; energy (will transform to universal gravitational potential energy). In short expansion requires energy. If we let go the stretched rubber band, it will snap back to its status quo condition. It is wrong to assume that the space between celestial bodies will be expanded without the input of other energy (like transforming kinetic energy to universal gravitational potential energy). As the universe is aging, proliferation of black holes will take place. It is likely that those dark matters are those &quot;invisible&quot; black holes. We can&#39; actually see black holes because they are dark but they surely can interact with light through mutual gravitational attraction. On the other hand, the underestimation of the real strength of gravity by Newton&#39;s Universal law of gravity equation may lead us to presume the existence of dark matters. If you are interested in real discoveries, I Would recommend you to read\u00a0 my book, The Unification Theory - Volume One and you will be amazed with lots of new, interesting discoveries.

A super super black hole with enough matter inside it could spin even faster because it will be physically smaller even though it is more massive.

One should treat the entire universe as it all being matter, Yes even the near vacuum is a density albeit inconceivably low in density, we  must fully understand that the near vacuum is simply a highly energetic mass, And should enough Near vacuum end up being compressed a star may be born, Eg Lighter Atoms are fused into Heavier Atoms, thus the more energy that ends up being stored, the denser the mass, ergo as energy is stored, the mass&#39;s repulsion is minimised, thus the highly energetic near vacuum easily repulses all less energetic mass towards other less energetic mass. <br><br>After all if a mass is not as energetic, it will experience what most refer to as a magical attraction rather than the proper way which is best explained via General Relativity and its tight association with Mass/Energy, which BTW is also tightly associated with Special Relativity and Time.<br><br>It&#39;s a no brainer if anyone clearly understands how energy is stored or converted to mass, and Mass converted to energy along with how General &amp; Special Relativity are all tied in with each other, then those principles, when considered properly and applied to Galaxies, it is obvious Dark Matter &amp; Dark Energy are positively not necessary, in fact understanding all the principles properly we can even explain why in the past, Physicists were once fooled into advocating to an accelerating expansion of the Universe, mind you at the time of posting this, it is still the general consensus, but I trust this soon will change as more data and experimental work is conducted..", "comment_date": "2019-04-28T06:28:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Elbert", "comment_text": "I just thought of something else it&#39;s the universe expand faster than light then if you look to the edge of the universe Jimmy b blinded by The big bang itself is it just now caught up with your ass. cool stuff huh.", "comment_date": "2019-04-27T12:15:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Elbert", "comment_text": "I&#39;ll hear something to think about Hawaii don&#39;t you just call dark energy antigravity which make sense that a super Force a case into gravity and electromagnetism and all that good stuff why wouldn&#39;t there be auntie once also.

Evidence our souls are immortal and everlasting thus so is consciousness and always has been in our universe in some way or form. Most forbidden history states that not ascending to the next dimension is rare for species and descending is rarer.

And that is not the case either.<br><br>I solved both mysteries several years ago and know what is causing both observations.<br><br>First off, in 2004 I discovered an error in Einstein&#39;s field equation. You know the equation used to come up with his general theory of relativity which tries to explain the movement of mass via gravity. Because his equation is missing important variables then many observations will not coincide with the predictions the theory postulates. Dark matter and dark energy cannot be explained by the general theory of relativity thus the movements of stars and galaxies become dark and mysterious. But, if he had simply included a few more important variables into his equation then his theory would have predicted the movement of stars and galaxies with precision. <br><br>One of the variables that is missing is the weak nuclear force, i.e., radiation. Another is the action responsible for gravity. He did not know what was causing space to react because of mass. He only was able to describe it. Thus the underlying reason why his theories was not able to predict the movement of stars and galaxies. <br><br>If he had included the weak nuclear force in his equation he would have realized what the action was that was causing gravity, i.e., space to react to mass. See, when a star radiates energy into space the energy is new to the universe. Like when adding heated air to the contents of a balloon it expands. If the universe had cooled after a big bang then it would not be expanding, it would be collapsing, growing smaller and smaller over time. But because mass is adding stuff to the universe space expands, and also causes stars and galaxies to propel themselves slowly over time (dark matter and dark energy). <br><br>Just think how much energy has been added around our solar system over the 5 billion years that the sun has been spewing stuff (heat, particles, EM fields etc) into the universe. The heat and energy that is added causes space to expand similar to the balloon when energy is added to it. If energy is not added to the balloon then it does not expand but would become smaller and smaller over time. There is more matter and energy in the universe today than there was in the beginning. Thus why space is constantly increasing with time. I know this contradicts a law of thermodynamics, but so does the observation of space expanding when it should be cooling and collapsing over time.<br><br>If the weak nuclear force was a variable in his field equation, and noting what occurs to a rocket spewing energy into space over time causing the rocket to be slowly propelled, accelerate slowly over time, the same thing then should occurs to stars and galaxies over time. To test this hypothesis one would simply need to take the age of the star or galaxy and divide by it&#39;s velocity to get it&#39;s acceleration rate. If this hypothesis is correct then every star and every galaxy throughout the universe would accelerate at the same rate because of the time it was spewing stuff. Their movement then would have nothing to do with mass of the star or galaxy but everything to do with the length of time it spewed stuff into the universe.<br><br>I then did a study on the velocity of stars and galaxies where the theory of general relativity could not explain so to find a common acceleration ratio. The sun for example is about 5 billion years old and is traveling at about 500,000 mi/h. So the rate of acceleration for our own sun would be a 1 mile per hour increase about every 10,000 years (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ&amp;t=1m10s\">1:10</a>,000). This acceleration rate if the weak nuclear force is to blame should be common throughout the universe, not because of the amount of mass a star contains (gravity) but because of the time it was spewing stuff into the universe. So I then studied the Milky Way galaxy to determine if it also fit the same acceleration ratio. The Milky Way is about 13.7 billion years old is is traveling at about 1.37 million miles per hour. It also fits the same acceleration ratio as our sun, a 1 mile per hour increase every 10,000 years (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ&amp;t=1m10s\">1:10</a>,000). I didn&#39;t stop there. I went on to study the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way.<br><br>The Carnia dwarf galaxy is traveling at about 1,300,000 mi/h and is around 13 billion years old.  So it too accelerated at the same rate as the Milky Way and our sun. A constant rate of about 1 mile per hour increase every 10,000 years (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ&amp;t=1m10s\">1:10</a>,000). This can&#39;t be a coincidence! So I then studied the Draco dwarf galaxy and it is traveling at about 1,280,000 mi/h and is about 12,800,000,000 years old. It too accelerated at the same rate as the Milky Way galaxy and our sun at about a 1 mile per hour increase every 10,000 years (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ&amp;t=1m10s\">1:10</a>,000).  So now it&#39;s not a coincidence. I then went on to study the Sextans dwarf galaxy and it is traveling at about 1,240,000 mi/h and is about 12,400,000,000 years old. So it too accelerated at the same rate as the Milky Way and our sun, a 1 mile per hour increase every 10,000 years (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ&amp;t=1m10s\">1:10</a>,000). Definitely not a coincidence! The data all shows that stars and galaxies are not moving because of their mass/gravity but instead because of the time they have been spewing stuff into the universe and has nothing to do with mass/gravity. Showing because it is not mass causing the observation it is not dark matter or missing mass! It is simply a mistake believing that gravity is the only force in the universe able to move mass when we know it is not. Ask any rocket scientist if a rocket is propelled by mass/gravity and he will laugh at you and say no, rockets are propelled by the energy (stuff) that they spew, i.e., the weak nuclear force called radiation. Then ask them if the propellant is added to space to cause the movement? And they will say yes. The action of the stuff entering space behind the rocket is what causes the equal opposite reaction called propulsion. <br><br>There are a few predictions that come about if mass were adding new stuff to space around them. One is space should be expanding everywhere around mass. Second is the expansion rate would not be equal everywhere but would be dependent upon the amount of mass in the space, i.e., spewing stuff. The Hubble constant would be found not to be constant. There are areas in the universe containing lots of mass and should be producing lots of new space around them. Thus space would not be expanding everywhere at the same rate. Another prediction would be that this expansion of space would occur around all mass, spewing stuff into space around them, including planets. Thus the space between Titan and Saturn should be expanding too. This expansion should be observed with every planet, every star, every object adding stuff to space around them, including the planets that do not contain oceans. Tidal forces would not be able to explain the expansion of space around planets that do not contain oceans.<br><br>There, I believe I solved both dark mysteries in my spare time, with time to spare.

It comes from the outside of our universe. I believe this because if you were to look at the fabric of space from a 2nd dimensional perspective,  mass from the top would bend it down - the top being our universe - but if you were to put something UNDER this fabric, that &#39;something&#39; would bend the it UP, making all mass from the top oppose the area while the explanation is unseen and it&#39;s visuals are blocked off by the fabric.<br>\u00a0The fabric of space is the boundary of our universe that is always there wherever we go and cannot be escaped by simply moving trillions of light years through space, it is the boundary that doesn&#39;t end at a place, it ends at a certain level of energy condensed into one spot. When there is too much energy in one spot for the fabric of space to handle, it is either, burned, ripped, or maybe even corroded, just like any other regular sheet of fabric. But this fabric is IMMENSELY strong, it&#39;s so strong it can support the biggest black hole in our observable universe. So running around with a simple refrigerator magnet to connect with another dark magnitude of energy from the outside universe would be hardly noticeable or not even possible, because it&#39;d be the same as using that magnet to attract another magnet on the other side of something much much bigger than a planet.<br>\u00a0Maybe to that outside universe WE are the dark matter and energy.

Before you were born, you &quot;WERE&quot; that <b>nothingness*. *BUT</b> you CAME from that state of nothingness &quot;INTO&quot; existence. Can&#39;t after death be similar? coming back into another body? after all if <b>ETERNAL OBLIVION</b> is to come after death then HOW did we come into existence FROM that eternal oblivion that was <b>before</b> BIRTH? therefor I believe we migrate into another body after death. Also The first law of thermodynamics, also known as Law of Conservation of Energy, _states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; energy can only be transferred or changed from one form to another_. For example, turning on a light would seem to produce energy; however, it is electrical energy that is converted. Shouldn&#39;t that make you lean towards eternal <br>existence theory? after all only <b>NOTHING</b> comes from *NOTHING*. If there was ever absolute nothingness then there still would be NOTHINGNESS today. The only other option is existence always was. In science there is also another theory for origin of the universe other than the Big Bang, that is that another big bang occurs and new universe emerges after big crunch(end of the universe) aka Cyclic Universe theory. <br><br>So, the cycles of universe coming into existence and going out of existence must have been eternal, it is extremely stupid to say that it isn&#39;t and it had a beginning and at the same time say energy cannot be created nor destroyed. THERE using simple science.<br><br>One question for all of you<br><br>Do you believe energy is either<br>1 ) Eternal<br>2 ) Had a beginning(Violates law of theromdynamics)<br><br>Please note the word : <b>IF</b><br><br><b>IF</b> you still don&#39;t agree then from scientific view, if... only just &quot;IF&quot; universe after heat death or whatever, another Universe springs up then it is safe to say that existence and cycle of universe is eternal and we are all eternal. <br><br>In several religion there exists a theory that existence is eternal for example...<br><br>In the Bhagavad Gita, considered by Hindus to be a most holy scripture, Krishna tells Arjuna; &quot;Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.&quot;<br><br>OR<br><br>GOING EVEN MORE SCIENTIFIC<br><br>If the cycle of universe coming into existence and going back to nothingness is eternal then there are infinite possibilities of all happening meaning our consciousness is one of them! IF SO then our consciousness WILL happen infinite times forward if it can happen once. ALSO that it HAS happened infinite times before because of <br>Infinite Time<br>Infinite Possibilities<br><br>You are infinitely egoistical(spelling error?) if you think there are and will be only finite number of sentient beings. Wouldn&#39;t that make YOUR consciousness 1/Infinite chance since you<br>were one of infinite possibility of consciousness existing? this theory can be thrown out of the window if we assume consciousness is one and that we are all one consciousness<br>experiencing infinite lives. We feel seperated because of our identity(aka name, nationality, memory, experiences, personality, our physical body etc)? <br>???<br><br>So in the end we are left with these choices as reality<br><br>1 ) Eternal existence and only one universe ( THEN WHY THE FUCK THERE IS FINITE ENERGY NOT INFINITE ENERGY EXISTING? WHAT IS EXISTENCE AT ALL?)<br>2 ) Eternal Multiverse theory where there are infinite numbers of universes ( it means infinite energy exist... assuming all universes had similar laws... WHAT!?)<br>3 ) God ( Eternal god which would explain why everything is the way it is. hinduism and vedas mentioned all above i stated like 4000 years ago. Vedas also has<br>MULTIVERSE theory.

It&#39;s not virtual particles themselves that cause it, but the gap in space they leave behind between the time they come into existence and annihilate one another. Imagine the curvature of space in an empty space, now let&#39;s give it a value of 0 (as there&#39;s nothing to cause gravity we will consider the curvature neutral and represent it with a neutral value of 0), when the virtual particles come into existence in that space, they leave a gap  behind and this gap changes the neutral value of 0 to a negative value (for the sake of explanation let&#39;s say -1), the more empty space there&#39;s, the more these negative values - from each virtual particle&#39;s space gap - sum together, therefore, generating more anti-gravity and accelerating the expansion of the universe. When it happens in a space that&#39;s not empty, the curvature caused by nearby massive objects exceeds the negative value so it never actually gets to be negative at all (-1 + 1000000 = the value remains positive anyway, plus it&#39;s an insignificant change), meaning, there&#39;s no expansion there. The expansion in the universe as a whole only increases proportionally to a large amount of empty space. The more empty space, the more expansion, as well as the more expansion, the more empty space.

A bigger mass means greater gravity, means greater range and thus expanding to extreme conditions. It might be that Black Holes who evolved faster than it should outside of our galaxy are pulling us - or what is more likely, getting all the Helium that our stars need in order to build them up, heating them up and keeping the gravity they have in order, thus we might expand further from the sun, in which our solar system is expanding further from the center of our galaxy, in which our galaxy is expanding further towards a massive or multiple massive black holes. So we basically get dragged away, and the universe is not a self-sentient being that expands on demand or on circumstances, and is more random than originally thought.

Dirac is matter travelling backwards in time), not only set &#39;the arrow of time&#39; but also sent a gigantic wave of photons ahead of the expanding remaining matter.\u00a0 We can&#39;t see them since they travel at C, but even they, via E=mc^2 influence the universe.\u00a0 The reason for the matter to anti-matter disparity?... perhaps chirality,... but that seems like a &#39;cop-out&#39;.

That repulsive force may reduce much slower with the distance , let&#39;s say with a factor of 1/r^10, where &#39;r&#39; is the distance between the repulsing objects. Isn&#39;t the existence of such force going to produce the observed effect of the dark energy?<br>P.S.

We live in trying times when the intelligent are made fun of ( discriminated against for seeking truth or those elusive facts, nothing new there) and celebrities that sell useless junk are worshipped.  I am really concerned that the thoughtless masses are gonna take us down the hwy to hell where civilisation will collapse for a pretty long time (there is no hell really, that is more made up god turds) .  The poop is gonna hit the fan when the fishing in the South China Sea collapses, which I expect will occur in ten years or less.  From a cultural standpoint one of the main underlying problems is the idea that when it goes to poop we will be saved.  The masses believe we have dominion.  This has always been a bad idea and now is pretty much proving itself in the bad idea area.  I can respect faith but sorry all the rest of it has to go.  Books of fiction cannot be allowed to be the basis for governing the planet.  I am completely sure that if things continues as they do now we are completely doomed.  Sadly, 80 percent of Earthly people have faith in god, which very sadly, logically leads me to have no faith in a long term future for us.  The Earth will be fine, but millions and more likely billions of us are going to die in 100 years or less.  I have considered these things for quite some time, and I am seldom wrong.  Yes I have an ego, I really think about things,  too many of us do not.<br><br>God is not great. All gods are made up magical sky men mostly, who as a group have offered zero proof of their existence (There have been a few sky women, a very, very small number ) .  The holy rollers expect to be saved when things go to a very bad place, but imaginary magic sky men save no one not even rollers.  The whole idea of god is the biggest con ever by man on man.  If you are a women you should be really mad that all the major religions treat you as second class.  My problem with it all is that I have a working brain that concluded that god is bull turds when I was 11 years old (not the record ran across 8 years old recently) .  So most of the world is run  by people who do not have a fully functioning brain.  The other thing that gets me is how can anyone read the bible or koran cover to cover and not come to the conclusion it is fiction?  We are doomed and the lessons of our bibles are our road maps to the end of our dominion for sure.<br>.  On the bright side there may be some sort of existence after death which may give comfort to you but does not save the whales.<br><br>So you who consider dark matter please use your brain matter to preach the need to keep god out of government because fictional books are not the basis for truth in governing as they are all works of complete and utter fiction.  Yes I know that there is little in the way of truth in politicians but we live in such strange times that an age of truth in politics could come to pass after this age of fake news.

Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. <br><br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>The first observation of gravitational waves was made on 14 September 2015 and was announced by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations on 11 February 2016.[3][4][5]Previously gravitational waves had only been inferred indirectly, via their effect on the timing of pulsars in binary-star systems.<br>.........................................................<br><br>All four states of matter solid, liquid, gas, and plasma which go into the makeup of the cosmos, are comprised of elementary infinitesimally sized energy particulates at the fundamental microcosmic level of the cosmos; and larger atom particulates of at the physically apparent level of the macro-cosmos.<br><br>Therefore, regardless as to whether we are discussing the natures of waterborne, airborne or electromagnetic waves travelling through outer-space, all waves of themselves are made up of particulates of energy, that can only propagate through a medium of particulates.<br><br>As such, and given the recent observation of gravitational waves being produced by the collision of two black holes and propagating through outer-space, this event which was witnessed by multiple initial observers, and millions more via video recordings of this event taking place.<br><br>This serves as being empirical proof, that outer-space is indeed made up of an invisible medium of energy particulates, which facilitate the transit of gravitational and other electromagnetic waves through outer-space.<br><br>Further Proof<br><br>Law of Physics<br><br>For there to be an output of energy, there must be an input of energy.<br><br>As such, it follows, that all forms of motion extending from those of infinitesimal vibrations, up to and beyond the orbital motions of particles around the nucleus of an atom, and planets around a star, all require an input of energy to fuel their motion.<br><br>And the newly discovered gravitational waves, cannot be nor professed to be an exception to this ironclad and absolute rule of physics.<br><br>Therefore given the fact that gravitational waves do require a medium of energy to facilitate their forward transit of motion through outer space, and an immediate and constant input of energy to fuel their forward transit of motion through outer space.<br><br>So it becomes apparent, that it can only be, that it is the medium of energy that facilitates their forward motion of transit through space, which also serves as the input of energy to fuel and drive their directed forward motions through outer space, namely a non-detectable dark invisible form of energy.<br><br>Additional Rational<br><br>There are only two choices concerning the fundamental nature of outer-space.<br><br>The first choice is as with the old schools of physics, which were of the belief that outer-space is an energy less void of nothingness.<br><br>The second choice is as with the modern schools of physics, which are of the belief that ninety percent of the cosmos is comprised of dark invisible matter.<br><br>However, confusion has reigned regarding this, as some physicists also refer to dark invisible matter as to being dark invisible energy.<br><br>And additionally, the inappropriate use of the word mass and misinterpretations relating to the nature of mass has also served to add to the confusion (s).     <br><br>Hypothesis and rhetorical question relating to the fundamental nature of outer-space.<br> <br>If we were able to do the impossible, and use a remote control device to manifest (Note I am aware that it is impossible to manifest nothingness, as this is a contradiction in terms, however this is a hypothetical scenario, not a reality to be taken literally), a wave of particles or a body of matter within a totally energy-less void of nothingness, what would happen?<br> <br>All particles whether they exist within a wavelength or a body of matter *radiate energy outwardly from their structures*, and it is this output of energy that serves to facilitate their motions and their interactions with other particles.<br> <br>Therefore given the introduction of radiant energy particles into an energy-less void, they and their outputs of radiance would instantaneously blink out of existence as their energy dissipated into the void.<br> <br>Vis-a-vis Hypothesis <br><br>If we were able to do the impossible, and use a remote control device to manifest an energy-less void of nothingness into the airless (devoid of atoms only) vacuum of a science laboratory bell jar.<br> <br>What would happen as a result?<br> <br>The radiant energy of the surrounding atoms of glass would instantaneously be drawn into the energy less void, and arguably the glass bell jar would either shatter, disintegrate or disappear into the nothingness that was within the bell jar.<br> <br>As Such<br><br>Energy cannot exist within an energy-less void of nothingness.<br><br>Energy-less nothingness cannot exist within anything (energy and matter).<br><br>Conclusion: Dark Invisible Energy <br><br>The vast majority of outer-space is made up of non-detectable elementary particles of energy, which form the overall fluidic/oceanic medium of outer-space;

Nothing like a big bang ever happened, so there is no need to invent dark matter and dark energy! <br>At the center of almost every galaxy (as viewed from the hubble telescope) is a bright area that many astronomers have assumed are a cluster of stars at the center of each galaxy.  That is incorrect.  <br>The very brightest light coming from the center of each galaxy is the explosive bright light from the creation of matter from nothing.  You can imagine how much explosive energy is required for the creation of matter from nothing.  Then the matter being created spirals out from the center of each galaxy and starts forming stars, and planets, and nebula, etc.  <br>The FACT that the hubble telescope &quot;scientists&quot; recently viewed the galaxy they named GN-z11. I quote from the Hubble scientists &quot;It is seen as it was 13.4 billion years in the past, just 400 million years after the Big Bang.&quot; That means that even 400 million years after the Big Bang there still wasn&#39;t enough dust to block our view of light traveling for 13.4 billion years. If we can see light that started traveling 13.4 billion years ago, then obviously the space between the galaxies, even 13.4 billion years ago, was crystal-clear! Not a single speck of dust in a light second! We would never be able to see even the closer galaxies, if the big bang actually happened, through all the dust and detritus! The creation of matter pumping out of a single event (Big Bang Theory) would get caught in the gravity from the event would cause a galactic type swirl. The universe would be filled with nebula gasses from one side to the other! The whole universe would be more like one gigantic galaxy with stars and clouds everywhere. Isn&#39;t it obvious to everyone? How could we see almost to the other side of the universe, but we cannot see the other side of our own galaxy through all the dust clouds?!?! The only way the space between the galaxies could be so clear and clean is if the individual galaxies were created by a creator where they stand. I believe the reason they are burning so bright in the center of almost every galaxy is because the same creator is still creating matter in the center at the time that light left each galaxy. <br>I am saying, this is a theory of mine. I am publishing my theory right here on YouTube. What&#39;s wrong with that? Must it be written on paper? I have not heard anyone else say these theories. These things are quite clear to me. How about you? Go to Hubble web site and read about galaxy they named GN-z11. The Hubble pictures don&#39;t lie! Isn&#39;t it obvious? It just takes a little common sense! <br>God is the creator, and Jesus is his son!", "comment_date": "2017-09-10T10:18:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Reza Zamani", "comment_text": "So my expanding belly fat is dark energy&#39;s responsibility?", "comment_date": "2017-09-09T17:59:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alberto Carvalhal Campos", "comment_text": "Mysteries, only mysteries.

This was an invisible energy that was invented by someone, as they couldn&#39;t explain why light could travel through a vacuum and SOund couldn&#39;t. &quot;Well light can&#39;t just travel through nothing, it must have a medium to travel through, so let&#39;s invent something and test it&quot;. So they invented the Ether, and said that earth travels through it, and thats whats propogating light. And everyone believed this, that there was an Ether, an invisibnle field of energy that light and the earth traveled through. &quot;Let&#39;s test it. If light is traveling through this shit, we&#39;ll be able to tell, by measure light coming into a specific point, in polar opposites of the earths movement. The first beam of light will come in the same direction the earth is moving, and the other will come in the opposing direction to earth. The light if the Ether exists should be different, as one light beam will have the assisted speed of the earths movement. and the other beam is coming in the opposing direction to earth. and boom, the light speed was the same from both directions. <br><br>But they had no problem inventing and believing in this stuff until their measurements said &quot;Nope, somethings wrong&quot;. <br>Thats why we&#39;re being handicapped by oour adoration for Newton and Einstein. <br>If we can&#39;t start from scratch and say &quot;Ok, they might be wrong on a universal scale&quot;, then we&#39;re chopping ourselves off at the knees. <br>I mean it&#39;s obvious, Dark matter and Black holes are another &quot;Ether&quot;. We can&#39;t see them, measure them or interact with them, but they MUST be there, as this particular things i happens. <br><br>The Galaxies around us, do not operate how newton and einstein tell us they should, but they do all uniformly act in the same way as eachother. they&#39;re all the same, they&#39;re all doing something, that completely goes against what newton and einstein told is they should be doing. So what does that mean to you? Ether Time. <br><br>Am i the only person who can see that Einstein was wrong, and all this dark matter, dark energy and Black holes stuff is just bullshit? they literally make an observation, it doesn&#39;t match the main theory, so they start cramming shit into the theory until it DOES fit.... using Free Values. We can&#39;t see Dark matter, we&#39; can&#39;t interact with it or measure it. Not even Light can interact with dark matter or interact with it. but it MUST be there, as the stars everywhere in distant galaxies are all traveling at the same speed around their center. &quot;Ok Enisteins theory tells us this particular thing shouldn&#39;t happen, so let&#39;s start cramming values of something else in there, to make up the difference&quot;. It&#39;s what ALL scientists say about Religious people. &quot;You can&#39;t explain massive things in Nature, so you just say &quot;God made it&quot;. This is the exact same. You start getting bad results, and instead of thinking &quot;Ok this is really really weird, Einstein and Newton tell us, that the stars in the inner and out parts of each galaxies should be traveling at much different speeds around their cores, and even bigger than that, The further a galaxy is away from another galaxy, the faster it&#39;s going, it&#39;s speeding up. instead of slowing down as it moves away from other galaxies&quot;. <br><br>So they see these GAPING holes Newton and Einstein. Instead of saying &quot;OK, back to the drawing board, these theories are working on a local basis, but on a universal and galactic level, they simply don&#39;t hold up&quot;. They say &quot;Well, nope, they&#39;re correct, Einstein must be correct, so lets invent something out of our heads, and jam that into the equation, and even thought we can&#39;t see, feel, measure or interact with this stuff, it&#39;s still the most powerful invisible, unmeasureable force in the universe&quot;. <br><br>Come on man. It&#39;s OBVIOUS, Einstein was wrong, Newston was Wrong...ger. There&#39;s no Black Holes, There&#39;s No Dark Matter, There&#39;s no Dark Energy. We need a new theory of what? Gravity... Time... Light even. We&#39;re religiously holding onto the fact that Einstein MUST be right, even though when you look out through a telescope and measure and examine what you see, it CLEARLY says he was wrong. HUGELY wrong. <br><br>I mean why does no one ever question... Einstein made his amazing Theory and Predictions before Dark Energy, Black holes and dark &quot;matter&quot; were &quot;known&quot; about. Right? So his measurements should have been completely wrong, in fact, if dark matter actually does exist, then EVERYONES measurements should be wrong. Completely wrong. <br><br>If dark matter is SO powerful, that it makes Galaxies, like ENTIRE galaxies start to accelerate faster and faster away from eachother. the further and further they separate, and it&#39;s so powerful that it makes all the stars in any part of a galaxy (inside or outside) all move at the same speed around their core, then we should see Dark Matter having a MASSIVE effect on the things around us locally. <br><br>Like. Dark Matter should be affecting the moon, our Oceans., The sun. and especialy our solar system. I mean, If all the stars in the galaxies, whether inside or outside, are all moving uniformly, and are all being pushes apart faster and faster, then why doesn&#39;t any of that stuff (AT ALL) happen in our Solar system, and why was none of it able to be measured before we knew about it? IF Dark Matter is having THAT much of an effect on Galaxies, internally and externally and making them speed away from eachother defying relativity, light and gravity, then why were we able to make a SINGLE correct calculation or observation from earth at all before Dark Matter became &quot;known&quot; to us? <br><br>How were they able to exactly estimate the position of Certain planets before they could see them, just by observing the gravitational pull it had on an existing planet? <br>Like which one was it, uranus or something? They could see one of the planets was looping in it&#39;s orbit, being pulled on by something else, and they were able to work out exactly where astronomers should look, and they looked there and boom, a new planet. But if you were to try the same thing in Andromeda, it would fail, as everything over there apparently is effected by Dark Matter. Meaning everything is rotating at the same speed no matter how far or close it is to the center or edge of the galaxy. <br><br>We&#39;re literally Jamming a Square Peg into a round hole, and literally and figuratively filling up the edges with bullshit to fit the round hole problem. Even De Grasse Tyson. <br><br>All i&#39;m saying is, everyting we see out there, tells us that Einstein and Newton were wrong, but everything we see locally (most things) tells us they were correct. So at best we have a local solution for a global problem. <br>It&#39;s like unising a generator to keep out building with electricity, while the rest of the city is turned off, no power.<br><br>I know i&#39;m gonna get stung by people who believe these Gravity and Relativity questions are ironclad, and it&#39;s a perfectly logical solution to start inventing invisible, immeasurable, un interactive substances and start adding them to Einstein to make it fit, and still decades later we still can&#39;t see, measure, or even begin to wonder what it is. <br><br>And don&#39;t talk to me about Gravitational Lensing being a way of measuring the mass of Dark Matter, it&#39;s just horseshit. <br>If it wasn&#39;t, why is our solar system working correctly and doesn&#39;t seem to be affected by Dark Matter at all? <br>not even 1 in 1 million parts of our solar system is being affected by dark matter, if you go by the measurements and predictions correctly made throughout history before Dark matter &quot;existed&quot;. like i said, it has such an incredibly strong effect on massive galaxies, that if it did exist, then we wouldn&#39;t have got anything even close to the measurements of gravity we got here before we knew it existed. if it did actually exist. <br><br>Honestly. how can we spend 100 years + looking at gravity, light and matter the way we do, sending rockets to the moon, to space, sending probes outside our solar system, sending rockets and people to orbit the earth etc. And then finding out &quot;Wait, none of the other shit in the uniuverse is acting how it&#39;s supposed to, there must be an invisible force that adds 2/3 more mass to the entire universe, and this is what&#39;s causing the other galaxies and stars to act the way they&#39;re acting&quot;. <br><br>So again, if they think that dark matter it adding 60+% more mass to galaxies to make them function the way they are actually functioning, and this 60+% matter is now causing galaxies to accelerate faster and faster the further and further it get&#39;s away from another galaxy,  then why the hell, don&#39;t we have 60% more invisible mass in our solar system? and why is it not affecting our measurements here?", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T17:06:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karam albakri", "comment_text": "probably better", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T11:55:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karam albakri", "comment_text": "subsucribed !", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T11:55:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karam albakri", "comment_text": "something wrong<br>you said in the 7th video in the dark matter section<br>&#39;dark energy&#39;", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T11:52:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A.C E", "comment_text": "I have always thought of dark matter as nothingness, however nothing is still something and therefore has mass.", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T00:05:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sebastian cuello", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ&amp;t=5m38s\">5:38</a> the earth is flat not round. this video is just part of a conspiracy", "comment_date": "2017-06-25T20:44:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GG ", "comment_text": "I figured out what is Dark matter and Dark energy in 2013. sorry but I will not share it with you.

Science tells me that all of creation (or all matter for you non-believers) is composed of basically the same ingredients but in varying quantities. <br><br>IMO dark matter is very similar to our water, most likely it is at the stage before water becomes water. I also liken this to the egg or in space&#39;s case, a giant egg sac. So, dark energy is then likened to sperm... it moves on it&#39;s own (synergy) after something causes it to &quot;go&quot;. <br><br>Thus, dark matter, like water, is a conduit for electricity, or energy. Without light, there is no energy. But! Like the expert pool shark, our Creator called HIS shots (other invisible entities, like us, must take the Creator at his word because none of us were formed at the time of the big bang. But, somewhere early on the process, these other heavenly beings started becoming aware they exist and the older ones get to see most of creation. <br><br>I&#39;m leaning towards the thought that stars are alive as they give life through their light. Only one heavenly being has been given the power of life in itself, thus, we only have one star that reproduced, according to it&#39;s own makeup. The others get to watch and the Bible says they have a glorious time. But some, aren&#39;t content with their position and because they are more physically godlike then we are (God&#39;s image) they don&#39;t stay put (rogue stars are indeed out there,  per science. They manage to come to earth and mess with us as they please. Meanies they are! <br><br>Anyway, some of them were upsetting enough to the Creator that He locked them in pits of extreme darkness and they can&#39;t get out. Apparently,  the state their in I&#39;d liken to us in a coma. Powerless though who knows what goes on in the ol&#39; noggin.  So these black holes are stars that have completely reversed the process of their creation. <br><br>Their dark energy doesn&#39;t stop closing I on itself until all traces of it&#39;s existence are eliminated. Toss a rock into a pond and watch the ripples! Dark matter closes in on itself, erasing all evidence of that dieing star. And when this happens,  time is erased... poof, gone!<br><br>Because we know that just recently two black holes collided and thus very thing happened.  I can then deduct that probably because of their relational position they were fairly close in age, be it a few hundred thousand years... Can you imagine the details we&#39;d be swimming in if their age was found by counting their rings (trees) or like earthlings (growth and degeneration)? As heavenly time goes, the span of time between the two doesn&#39;t matter... heck,  their time has been wiped out. Those two beings will Duke it out on their now shared prison until they are consumed by the dark matter that gave up space for them. Natural expansion should occur as everything affected by those two problem star children readjust itself. How great would it be to get back what was originally yours when someone fails to honor their part! Oh the dollars I&#39;d have!!!! <br><br>Anyway, the movie Thor (if I was paying attention correctly) accounts for all that dark matter that was once animated but is Jo longer and the dark energy traded within. There&#39;s hammer was i believe only one case of l collapsed dark matter emprisoning it&#39;s dark energy. Thor probably could have made it back for Jane had his hammer been squared! <br><br>And really,  we earthlings have to go back to dust. And our energy... that invisible (dark) energy that moves us, it goes back to our Creator. Some of us HE promised to remember to just because our time eventually becomes as if it never was it doesn&#39;t have to stay that way. For some of us, we will just be as if we never were. <br><br>So, dark energy, that is God&#39;s own force. All the dark matter in creation can&#39;t make itself animate. That&#39;s our Creator&#39;s job. <br><br>Thank you for reading if you made it this far. Don&#39;t believe me? You should hear how I tie history,  religion, mythology,  and hard evidence together. When you get to k NJ ow God, ya may be a simpleton like me, but I understand because it&#39;s right... even if I use grade school terminology or speech. <br><br>God&#39;s fingerprint.... gets the right answer every time.

Scientific theories don&#39;t get elevated to level of scientific laws given sufficient evidence, Law and Theory are two completely different terms in science.  Theory is an evidence based model of how something works (ie. Natural Selection), and a law is a mathematical representation of some property of science (ie. Ohms Law).

Scientists also assume that gravity is the only force in the universe able to move the matter in a sea of energized space.<br><br>The law of thermodynamics also assumed that energy cannot be created.

After discovering the exponential expansion of space with distance the first thing they should have done was correct the law by saying that energy CAN be created but not destroyed.

It is only when energy is created in the universe equally opposite to gravity can the universe expand at a great distance up to the speed of light.

AND if you challenge this I say to you it is just as plausible (or unlikely) for matter to be able to make Gravitational Energy as it is to make Dark Energy.<br><br>So how does this do away with Dark Matter? \u00a0Quite simple: \u00a0If you look at the velocity profile of stars in galaxies, if matter is self-propelled, when stars reach a certain threshold/distance from the core of the galaxy, they overcome gravity and start accelerating and increase in velocity and they don\u2019t need a Dark Matter gravitational halo to do it. \u00a0By endowing matter with another fundamental property, that of self-propulsion, the mysteries of galactic and universe dynamics are solved at a stroke.<br><br>The math proving that galaxies rotate much faster than they should is done, as is the case for the accelerating expanding universe. \u00a0Now it is high time for mathematicians to apply the math to the Baryonic matter which is what is being propelled and not to the spaces between it. \u00a0<br><br>If you want to explore this further please go to my YouTube introductory video by keying in \u2018The universe we now live in\u2019 and for my video on \u2018The Accelerating Expanding Universe\u2019 \u00a0please key in those words on YouTube<br><br>And by the way this hypothesis does not violate the law of conservation of energy because it is comfortable with the idea that from the moment of the big bang, the total of energy in the universe has remained constant.\u00a0 No additional input of energy is required to make our universe work no matter how infinitely large it grows.", "comment_date": "2017-01-26T21:18:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Esteban Martinez", "comment_text": "Do a video on alternate dimensions or string theory!", "comment_date": "2017-01-26T06:08:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dire Wolf", "comment_text": "Worst of all we cant taste dark energy me: I ACCEPT THAT CHALLENGE! <b>goes to patch of dark matter and licks</b> it tastes like chicken", "comment_date": "2017-01-26T00:27:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oscar Ronquillo", "comment_text": "We are all inside kirby... yeah thats it...", "comment_date": "2017-01-25T11:39:17Z", "likes_count": 104}, {"comment_by": "Abso Lutely", "comment_text": "dark matter = SATAN!", "comment_date": "2017-01-25T08:47:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bisyrock", "comment_text": "FRICKN BULL CRAP ........

PLEASE, PRETTY PLEASE, use the words THEORY and HYPOTHESIS correctly. We DON&quot;T have theories about dark matter or energy. we HAVE hypotheses. In science the word theory means something very different than in our daily lives. Commonly, we call something a theory, when it is just made up and nobody knows whether it is true or not. In science, that is called a hypothesis. In science a Theory is when a hypothesis has been tested and tested and scrutinised and there have been predictions made according to that hypothesis and it all checks out and it does explain the observed facts well. That means, in science a theory is something we accept as truth. That&#39;s why there is the theory of gravitation. Nobody says that it doesn&#39;t exist or work because it&#39;s a theory, because the theory is proven numerous times and we know it works. Same goes for Evolution (although many people still use the stupid &quot;it&#39;s just a theory&quot; argument, because they don&#39;t understand the distinction I am explaining now).<br><br>So again, please use these terms correctly.

Well, okay, then they say space time folds over or in on itself, and thus that &quot;infinite&quot; mass doesn&#39;t exist in our space time. So therefor that infinite mass of a black hole doesn&#39;t factor in the overall mass of a galaxy or the universe. Seems to me like some of this missing mass of the universe could actually be accounted for in our misunderstanding of black holes as infinite mass compact objects. Maybe a finite part of this infinite mass compact object exists in our space-time, and thus can account for a large part of the Dark Matter/Energy? But that might not jive with current orbital measurements of black hole systems. If the black hole had more mass in our space-time, the orbiting objects would travel much faster, etc. Right?<br><br>I really should go out and buy a new edition of a college astronomy book.

The first is stronger but both\u00a0are weak fields. It requires 1 Megavolts over 1mm distance to expose an acceleration\u00a0field\u00a0of 0.00861 Gees of even neutral particles. Dark matter\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0Intra-galactic electrons and Dark Energy, Extra galactic protons. There is no need for potential difference within galaxies themselves. The problem is telling QFT physicists to leave the particles model in favor of an events\u00a0model. We don&#39;t know about particles, we know about their collisions in the bubbles chamber as liquid hydrogen bubbles or as interaction with detectors. To say that particles are strings of curved chronon/event fields tells nothing to conventional physicists. Background, <br>There are two ways to affect time measurement, <br>1) By not allowing geodesic motion = acceleration. <br>2) By allowing geodesic motion but in curved space-time = free fall. <br>The equation of gravity of the chronon field has one side <br>describing (1) and the other is space-time response (2). <br>Also the operator of the theory is represented as Relational Observables - The chronons as quantum states. Replacing these <br>chronons by stochastic processes will still keep the trajectory curvature <br>representative vector, well defined see U_Lambda in (85) in my paper. <br>The relational observables are the Psi functions in(86) and they <br>become relational in (85) as they sum up to P. <br>BTW, The secondary 2x2 matrix block in the Scarr-Friedman matrix <br>is the reason why quantum spin is always +1 or -1. The orientation<br>of the acceleration Tensor/Matrix is either +1 or -1.

Now when it comes to Gravity, it is always measure by an interaction with another object, or objects around it. When gravity hits a spot where there is nothing, it essentially, similar to light, does not know how to react by this and moves around this or is moved accordingly. So once gravity hits this empty spot, it does one thing but stay in a place where it can effect and be effected.<br>I&#39;m sure there are a million ways to disprove this, and my knowledge on the subject is not nearly the level of some people.

So what you are seeing is a galaxy on the far edge of the universe that was moving much faster then it was now because the universe was expanding faster in the past? Or does the red shift account for the time difference from far objects that would take billions+ years to reach Earth? As more distance stuff will appear to us as they were billions of years ago (exact age would depend on how far they were. So an object 1 billion light years away would look like what it was 1 billion years ago. Thus due to the limits of the speed of light, we can never see such objects as they truly are in the &quot;present&quot;)<br><br>So the universe expansion acceleration could be an illusion. But perhaps I&#39;m just misunderstanding something... :P<br><br>But assuming expansion acceleration/Dark Energy is real, my theory on Dark Energy is perhaps a result of the natural decay of a universe in a larger super-structure in line with a multi-verse theory. I have no idea what such a structure would look like or how it operates. But perhaps Dark Energy is simply the entropy of an external force acting upon our universe that is accelerating due to the aging of the energy holding our universe in place/together and exists outside our space-time continuum. The only way one could prove this theory though is to build a working time machine. In theory, going back in time to measure Dark Energy would result in the same readings as what they were in the present as well as the future.<br><br>The only way to &quot;observe&quot; the acceleration curve (beyond simply &quot;calculating it&quot;. Aka, seeing the effect that cause from a past event would bring) would be to find a way to observe the universe from outside the universe in a larger space. Assuming time/space even exists outside the universe. Thus the only evidence Dark Energy exists would be the red shift of distant objects as a result of the limitations of the speed of light and beyond that, we can never make use of or properly measure Dark Energy.<br><br>But this could present a time paradox. Assuming a time machine is possible, you can go into the distant future where you would expect the universe to be much larger and colder as a result of the acceleration of Dark Energy. However in skipping the time in-between, you did not exist for long enough to observe the actual acceleration as it occurred outside of the universe. Thus you will find the universe as it would be if the acceleration of Dark Energy stopped. The reverse would occur if you go back in time. But that then would be a paradox as past events would constantly be altered altered due to Dark Energy&#39;s increasing dominance over the universe that is occurring independent of it.<br><br>This may just prove time travel isn&#39;t possible though. Then it wouldn&#39;t be an issue. But going into the future is still possible. You can just go into orbit around an extremely massive object like a black hole or travel close to the speed of light to cause time dilation. But what impact this has in relation to the super-structure outside of our universe as observed from our point of view could be complicated and unpredictable. I would guess going into the future in this way also means that you would see a universe as it would be if the acceleration of Dark Energy stopped because you didn&#39;t cause time dilation in relation to the larger super-structure surrounding the universe. Perhaps just chock it up to timy-wimy-wobbelly stuff. :P<br><br>It&#39;s all over my head and I wouldn&#39;t be able to work out the details.

In which case higher redshifts further away also would mean further back in timescale and closer to big bang.

Theefore space itself looks like a energy field of particles too.
