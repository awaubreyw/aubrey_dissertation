Banks create money by selling their credit in exchange for cash or debt. Banks create credit out of nothing unlike non bank financial institutions. Banks create deposits when they exchange their credit for cash or debt(making loans). The reason why banks pay interest for cash is for liquidity purposes. Cash or tokens provide liquidity in an economy by being able to exchanged for goods or services. But demand deposits can be accessed by debit or credit cards, letters of credit, bank transfers, drafts, cheques, bills of exchange, bills of credit. These cash substitutes can be used as substitute for cash. When customers demand for cash and the banks cash runs out, the deposits in the bank never run out. The cause of bank runs is not being able to provide liquidity. After all only about 3% of all money is in cash. Today most people use credit/debit cards and other electronic payment methods and therefore bank runs almost never happens.

If this would be true people had to be forced to save money, but in real life the amount of saver&#39;s money stored by banks is tiny compared to the amounts of credit money granted by banks. So, where does the money come from? Answer: money is issued by the central bank of a country (or, in case of the Euro zone: by the European Central Bank). But the central bank doesn&#39;t simply &quot;print&quot; the money and scatter it all over the country. Instead, the money is pulled by the creation of value. A customer who raises a bank credit receives fresh central bank money. The bank just borrows the money for the credit from the central bank for a low interest rate and then lends it to the customer to a higher interest rate.

Most people who rent don&#39;t count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment. For example, you invest $599,000 to buy a second home and rent it out for $3000 a month. Let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make $1000 a month or $12,000 a year. What would your annualized return be? 2 percent on the entire amount. Now, you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down $120,000 on the property. However, you are on the hook for the full $600k regardless of what the future FMV of the house is. Furthermore, people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however, this is a false assumption you can make. In the best case, you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply, however, if inflation heats up, you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms.  This is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates. The central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending. We haven&#39;t seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the COVID spending, your best choice is to look into crpto and ANDYHACKSLLC , Its the video.", "comment_date": "2021-07-22T09:15:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ua9c1\u19c1\uaadd\uaaaest\u4e43\u3116\u311a\ua9c2", "comment_text": "I bought some stocks in a medical REIT that invested in, well medical properties several decades ago.

It has fatal flaws that help banking executives make billions while damaging the economy with hyper inflation.<br>The reason inflation exists is that banks give more credit than they are supposed to and each time there&#39;s not enough money, they take money from the central bank to pay their debt, which prints money basically. <br>If banks however lend only 50% of the money they have in vault, only to a specific group of people who are startups or small business owners with long term based contracts and with payable interest rates, then the world would still continue to develop, there would also be no inflation thus no economical crysis. We are all in this game whether we want to play it or not. I am not participating in this system, not taking a loan and only using my credit card to buy stuff online and always paying the credit card with full amount before my receipt arrives. But i am affected with this system, every single year there is a fucking hyper inflation like 20% or whatnot, during 2018 the inflation in Turkey was more than 50% but the official number was 26%. Every year everything i know is getting more and more expensive. A cup of tea was around 2 TRY before 2018, in 2018 it was 3 TRY, 2019 3.5 TRY, now 4.5 TRY maybe even more. Everything else is getting more and more expensive with a similar fashion. But the only difference is i am not getting a raise and even if i am, it&#39;s much less than the inflation. I&#39;ve been becoming poorer and poorer every single year for the last 10 years or so even tho i am not doing anything to cause it, but rather working harder to some how stabilize the situation.

The banks are concerned about profit. Why would they give loans out with full knowledge the debtors would default, where previously most of these same people were denied a loan by that same bank? Another thing to thank the federal government for. Strict banking regulations were passed (usually along with accusations of racism according to loan denial stats) forcing banks to give out mortgages they knew would go into default. So what does the federal government do? Legislate more banking regulations into place resulting in massive bailouts and government favoritism like we\u2019ve never seen before. An example of this type of favoritism is Amazon paying 0 tax in 2018 and Tesla paying negative tax years prior. But wait, aren\u2019t these mortgage defaults and legal tax evasions supposed to be the result of an unfettered free market run rampant? <br><br>After 2008, there should be no distinction between private banks and central government. Some of the bailout stipulations have been compared to government seizures. This is probably true since many of the banks weren\u2019t given the option to refuse bailout money. The only thing preventing the checks and balances between the public and private sectors from crumbling is the possibility of banking institutions becoming obsolete through blockchain technology. If credit unions can handle loans in customers\u2019 best interests and blockchain can securely manage transactions, what\u2019s the point of a bank? Maybe we\u2019ll still need their atms.

I usually explain it this way: Imagine john. John has all the money there is in the economy - 1000$. he puts it in a bank. The bank by law has to reserve 10%. So the bank reserves 100$ and lends out the other 900$ to Charles. Charles then takes this loan and puts it in another bank. That bank reserves 10% (90$) and lends the other 810$ to Nick. Now you can see how money has been created. Charles has 900$ to spent and nick has 810$ to spend (to a total of 1710$), while there is only 1000$ real dollars in this economy. If Charles or Nick fails to pay, the system crumbles. However, each bank lent out less than what they received in deposits. Conlusion:  Yes, banks create money.

And when countries go broke,,,, these private banks comes in and loans a whole fucking country money! and you have to work to pay them off.... and you thought they operate with your money...... lol.. the fed is a group of banks... who are completely independent.... virtually Untouchable... Above the law and responsible for the situation in the world..... of course you won&#39;t know about it... you weren&#39;t supposed to....

Currently banks are not required to actually have the money they operate with. The have only a tiny fraction - this means that when one walks in with money to deposit, bank holds this fraction (as a reserve) and lends the majority. And where is the problem? Well, one deposits 100 coins, reserved are 10, than one borrows 90 coins, another one deposits them, than 81 coins are going and bang, we have 1000 coins out of thin air. And in a system where 100% reserve is required, the system contains only 100 initial coins. This means that the bank lends it, the interest belongs to the deposite owner and the bank makes money on provision. So all those weird ways of making money faster than you should are based on the fractioned reserved system. And now required is how much, 3%? Less? I am not sure. And all the further regulations are simply to make it harder to compete with already established banks that can afford dealing with those.

crisis was caused by Bill Clinton, who 1) Passed the GLBA in 1999, which repealed part of Glass Stegall and allowed for a bank to simultaneously act as an investment bank, a commercial bank, and an insurance company, and 2) authorized banks to give loans to anyone. Bush tried to stop it, but gave up and let it collapse. Obama then came in with the whole &quot;too big to fail&quot; and authorized a ridiculous stimulus package to bail the banks out. Federal government took on massive debt and now we&#39;re sitting here at $20 trillion. If Obama was smart he would&#39;ve continued what Bush tried to do and reverse GLBA, but instead he compounded the problem. &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot; is utter bs. Banks are a business. If a business fails, something better comes to take its place. So if a bank is gonna collapse, let it collapse. The problem now is the banks actually ARE too big to fail since the 1999 merger essentially created a monopoly on the financial industry, and small local banks were swallowed up. With no fall back, the monopolistic financial industry needs bailouts whenever they&#39;re in danger, which is a very dangerous precedent and another economic collapse can happen at any time.", "comment_date": "2017-05-04T19:22:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Adventures of Mr Red Blob", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTTGALaRZoc&amp;t=3m46s\">3:46</a> Hang on, a Doctor Who phone box doesn&#39;t come out of a bank, does it?", "comment_date": "2017-05-04T16:01:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Korina Galatis", "comment_text": "With their new videos that give you existential crisises, it is nice to watch one of their older videos", "comment_date": "2017-05-04T14:20:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mauri Meronen", "comment_text": "Money = Dept - they don&#39;t lend out deposited money - they create new money out of thin air when you take a lone.

This weeds out the irresponsible banks, because now the people who work there have huge stakes in the game. Clients won&#39;t lose trust in banks because their savings are guaranteed by the state, rather than a bank. Bail outs are bad because they send the message that if the bank makes bad choices the state is going to save it. It&#39;s basically rewarding the behaviors that caused the problem in the first place. This is how it should be anyway.

From gold dug out of the earth and and refined to become the gold standard? Not anymore. Here&#39;s your answer:<br><br>&quot;The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. the process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand ever invented. Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin. Bankers own the earth.&quot; - Sir Josiah Stamp (1880-1941), Director of the Bank of England. Further, &quot;A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. Therefore the growth of a nation and all her activities are in the hands of a few men. we have come to be be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world. No longer a government by...the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.&quot; - Former Presdent Woodrow Wilson, referring to the inception of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. He said that less than 10 years after the Act was passed. Now it&#39;s been over a century. Ever wonder why we&#39;re so badly in debt?

If you go to the bank and ask for a credit card, you can be sure they don&#39;t check anything to make sure they have funds available, they issue the card. If the bank arrives in a situation where the level of deposits is insufficient (which is quickly diminishing as legislation relaxes the reserve ratio on many kinds of accounts), it barely even matters since they can borrow deposits from the central banks at no interest. In fact, this is what they&#39;ve been doing for years, which of course is enormously profitable. You gotta pay them, but they don&#39;t have to pay the central bank, and the central bank doesn&#39;t even follow the pretense of getting deposits from anywhere, the whole idea is they create money as they deem fit.<br><br>It&#39;s obvious that the banking system is even more volatile than before. Now the basis is not related to deposits, this is merely a nod to tradition. The banking system now more than ever is a straight confidence game, where the only value of the currency is faith in the ability of the central bank to manage panic.

Someone would say they earned it, ok, so where did the company get that money to pay them? They got it from a selling goods/services, but if we follow the trace of money, and who created it first, we will see that the Banks created that very first bill (by buying bonds from its country, with the interest, of course, so then, government puts that money into a circulations and the money goes to people, people lend their money to banks, and banks, through the process of fractional reserve landing, lends that money to others, with interest, of course...So, as we go through the process, we can see that for every single dollar and cent out there, there is an interest rate! So, the question is, how do we pay back that interest? Well, we cannot....we can only go into a debt more and more, until it collapses (like it did, many time throughout the history). This why we have poor countries (it&#39;s because one country, in order to pay back its debt, takes the money from another country, so then that country cannot pay back its debt, the same goes for people). Basically, the countries which mange to take money from another country are rich, while others are in never ending debt...<br>To get this even clearer, if you borrow very first dollar \u00a0into existence, with interest, how do you pay back that dollar? Well, you borrow more money, but now, you have two dollars, but owe 4, you go even deeper into a debt, now you have 3 dollars, but owe 6, and so on and on... If we stop borrowing the money, we would be able to payback only the principal, so our three dollars would cover the principal of borrowed 3 dollars, but the 3 dollars from the interest would still be there!

They bought a lot of Bonds from banks (which is a loan from nothing which creates more money making it less valuable). Besides inflation, this means low interest rates. Too much money around. The price of money falls.<br><br>With very low interest rates, banks could leverage themselves up to high heaven without much trouble. all the resources in the world to take foolish risks.<br><br>And the second reason is government guarantees. Banks would hand out mortgages to almost anyone and bundle up all of these loans into mortgage securities, which the government would guarantee (giving it a higher rating). Also, in so doing, the banks new they were completely protected.

Then under president Bill Clinton, the government doubled down on those regulations, forcing the banks to provide even more high risk loans.  <br><br>The banks new it was all going to collapse eventually so they took steps to attempt to protect themselves.  These steps were twisted by the liberally biased media into nothing more than corporate greed.  Also around this time, many politicians, like John McCain were warning that the housing bubble was going to burst, and attempted to push legislation to repeal the regulations that forced the banks into giving the high risk loans in the first place.  However, left leaning politicians like John Kerry, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary and Bill Clinton, and Al Gore, continued to ignore the warning signs and even adamantly state that there was no danger of a housing market collapse.  Not even 3 years later the bubble burst and the great recession took hold.  <br><br>Then the government decided that rather than backing off the banks and allowing them to fix the issue, they created several &quot;stimulus packages&quot; which was basically just creating dollars that did not exist, and writing huge checks to the banks.  They even forced some banks, like J.P. Morgan Chase, to take the money, even though Chase said they did not want it, and paid the money back as soon as they were legally allowed to.  <br><br>And why did the government decide to force these ridiculous regulations on the banks in the first place?  To prevent a practice called &quot;red lining&quot; in which banks used to literally use a red marker, and outline areas on a city map that were generally lower income areas, or areas of high unemployment and crime. The banks new that people from those areas were far less likely to pay back a mortgage, so they were basically denied from the outset, unless they could prove they had the means to pay the loan back (lottery winnings, inheritances, long term employment at a high paying job, etc.)  <br><br>The problems arose when somebody realized that a lot of minorities tended to live in these red lined areas.  Suddenly, rather than it being a slightly unfair business practice, the banks were accused of rampant racism, which of course prompted the left wing lead government to do what they always do.  Stick their noses where they don&#39;t belong and write laws forcing businesses to take up damaging business practices.  <br><br>If you have ever heard of the &quot;malaise&quot; of the late 1970s, this was a big part of it.

What does this mean? It means that we got funding for doing this topic sooner than we would have done otherwise \u2013 the sponsor had no influence over the content of the video! This video represents our own research and opinion on the topic. This video is a bonus video, on top of our regular uploads.<br>The reason I\u2019m posting this here is that we want to be super up front and honest about sponsorships \u2014 we do want to make videos that entertain you and that help make the world a little bit more awesome. But it is impossible to sustain ourselves with the youtube channel \u2013 we are too many people and the videos take too long to produce. So we will do sponsorships to make this Youtube channel more sustainable from time to time. How is this gonna work: Sponsors can pay us to do certain topics, or to have their project features at the end of the video (like the audible adds lots of STEM channels do). But the scripts will not be approved by a sponsor. Everything we tell you is researched by us. We are in the explaining stuff business, not in the advertisement business (well, ok, you can hire us to produce a video \u2013 but it won\u2019t go up on our youtube channel).\u00a0<br>If you have questions or comments please tell us, total transparency is super important for us. And if you want to help us get 100% independent from sponsors, you can support us directly at Patron: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1NOxZ7p\">http://bit.ly/1NOxZ7p</a>. Our ultimate goal is doing youtube and similar projects full time, for you guys and because it is so much fun.
