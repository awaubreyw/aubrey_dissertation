I know it is a woo woo topic to you, but there is actually some really interesting and compelling data, studies and declassified CIA documents out there. You and others might laugh while reading my comment, and I myself would have done the same a couple of years ago. I am a born skeptic and I want data to support my believes, but I have finally come to a conclusion: \r<br>\r<br>The UFO phenomena is either A) Crafts built by a non-terrestiral intelligence. B) Crafts built by an terrestiral intelligence, which has been kept away from the public. C) Both of the cases mentioned above (case A and B).\r<br>\r<br>What is known about the UFO phenomena? \r<br>Well, we know from radar (radar on ground and air), gimball fighter-jet camera footage, mass sightings, eye witness accounts from trained observers (Pilots, astronauts ect.) - That these UFO/flying saucers can accelerate from a hovering state with no movement, to speeds well above multiple times the speed of sound in about 1 second. With these velocities they make 90 degree turns like a pingpong ball bouncing of a wall. The public should look into these studies and all the data. Yes, it might not mean aliens, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unlikely that it is aliens. Especially because these crafts were painted and described way before mankind ever made planes.\r<br>\r<br>Good luck and keep up the good work :)", "comment_date": "2018-11-11T01:31:55Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Zycloak", "comment_text": "When \u2018s Kurzgesagt gonna make a game?
