Friends today. Enemies tomorrow. The human being carries within himself the seed of corruption and abuse of power. What  people seems not see (including current governments) is that things are already out of control and going back with this &quot;evolution&quot; is a necessity of yesterday. I will try to draw in simplistic words the trap that everyone is building without writing a book in the comment: ordinary people do not care, do not act and do not see it because ordinary people want some &quot;savior&quot; to represent them in the Government . But Mr. America is a good patriotic citizen. A family man. Every day he gets up at 6, takes the garbage out, takes his car, parks on Avenida X, walks 3 or 4 blocks and arrives at his government office. While he was on his way to vote against an obscure law designed to undermine the state, his wife was taking a Uber Taxi to the mall and his son was walking 5 or 6 blocks to school. Now, Mr. America, who had the fate of the land of the free in his decisive vote, is being blackmailed by unknown people in his office and across the streets. Mr. America fears for the life of his family because every move he, his wife and his son make is anticipated by dangerous individuals following data from all &quot;security&quot; cameras, GPS taxis, etc.  A dirty and cowardly chess. The point here is that if this system continues to evolve, whichever group takes power (including foreign governments), it will never lose power again. This technology must be destroyed.

More independent investigations are finding that the collapse of the towers as per NIST is fraudulent. They didn&#39;t release input data and isn&#39;t peer-reviewed. Dr. Leroy Hulsey of University of Alaska Fairbanks has opened his report up to peer-review and has released the input data. <br>Fires have never brought down steel-framed slyscrapers. Let alone within just about an hour of burning (both towers) and when only 20 of the total 115 floors were only on fire i.e. most of the structure was healthy and intact. WTC7 never hit by a plane. <br>NIST posits fire as cause of collapse initiation in all 3 buildings.. assymetric damage causing symmetric collapse is highly unlikely and the explanations sound like Rube Goldberg devices. NIST also refused to test for explosives despite NFPA fire and regulation codes suggesting total collapse of steel structures needing to test for explosives, incendiaries or arson.. especially in a supposed terrorist attack. <br>The top 15-20 floors crushing the bottom 80-90 floors violates newtons 3rd law - if the force exerted on the lower, heavier structure (the towers were built bottom heavy i.e. more mass in lower sections for stability) was enough the destroy everything in its path, then it should have also destroyed itself in the process because every force has an equal and opposite reaction. <br>The laws of conservation of momentum suggest that with each impact, and each equal destruction of a static and moving object, the system would come to a rest when all the stored energy is dissipated. <br>NIST has had to admit to near freefall after having denied it because of David Chandler, a high school physics teacher could easily reveal it. Prior to this, the lead NIST investigator has stated &#39;freefall is impossible because that would indicate no structural resistance&#39;, so why was there in reality &#39;little to no structural resistance&#39;?<br>Also NIST has stated there were no witnesses who heard explosions, which is a lie. There are plenty of videos and official police transcripts of witnesses, including first responder firemen and reporters, who all heard distinctly similar series of explosions. They also claim the molten metal seen pouring out of the towers was &#39;aluminium&#39; which does not radiate when molten, unless inside a forge/melting pot and immediately becomes silvery when exposed to air due to rapid cooling.<br>The other lie is that the jet fuel (10000 gallons in conservative estimations) seeped into the building and spread fire - forgetting that each tower had a rough volume of over a million gallons. I.e. about 1% of the building could have only possibly been affected by jet fuel, which cant even burn at the temperature to melt steel (which was seen on video and described by firemen as &#39;running down channel ways, like you were in a foundry&#39;)", "comment_date": "2019-10-23T19:32:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Onesowndemon", "comment_text": "Just because its not illegal, doesnt mean its not wrong so yeah, nothing to hide nithing to fear", "comment_date": "2019-10-23T16:02:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jessica Laporte", "comment_text": "\u00c7a marche pas les cam\u00e9ras de surveillance dans les maisons priv\u00e9es?

Regarding the part guys said, &quot;Despite high hopes the NSA surveillance program has not stopped any major terrorist attacks.&quot; I will present you with a question: Do you think by doing internet research and asking people that don&#39;t actually see the day to day work, you will ever know how much potential terrorist activity has been prevented? Obviously, if it has been prevented you would not know and see them on the news. I agree that agencies can be more transparent and report on what they&#39;ve actually prevented but I would say most likely not going to happen because usually, it will give out the sources and methods when you answer the &quot;how&quot; factor when you make those things public. I&#39;m sure they would love to take credit if you did something so good wouldn&#39;t you be proud to announce? But it&#39;s not that they don&#39;t have achievements to share, the nature of what they need to share could be very sensitive. So if they basically yell out to everyone saying &quot;HEY THIS IS HOW WE STOP TERRORISTS&quot; then the terrorists are going to go like &quot;hmmm that&#39;s good to know we&#39;ll take that into account on our next 911 attack.&quot; In a melting pot country like the US with more immigrants than any other country, you have to realize when you release information to the public, the word &quot;public&quot; is not synonymous to &quot;citizens&quot; but it includes terrorists, outsiders, non-citizens (anyone with access to internet) , criminals and others.", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T21:40:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Midori Okane", "comment_text": "I think if the average IQ was higher we would have less problems", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T07:31:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ichabe dichlieb", "comment_text": "So thats how Webcam Videos for youporn are found.", "comment_date": "2018-02-28T12:16:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hughes Ministry", "comment_text": "Orwell\u2019s nightmare", "comment_date": "2018-02-26T07:38:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "josh", "comment_text": "&quot;This video has been taken down because of a complaint from the national security administration&quot;&quot;Sorry about that&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-02-26T02:55:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "emilydotbug", "comment_text": "First grandpa rick, then BMO, now ice king I love this show!", "comment_date": "2018-02-25T17:23:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hisopio", "comment_text": "yay amerika nuked us with <br>the F bomb of the cellphone", "comment_date": "2018-02-25T11:56:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kalapador", "comment_text": "I feel safe....

The people that are in fear versus the people who actually get affected from terrorism is just out of whack. The truth is that people are always going to die. And it&#39;s not that big of a fucking deal. We don&#39;t have to hold a damn ceremony for 3 fucking people. I get that people get scared, but it&#39;s because of the news. The news needs to make money and therefore needs to publish interesting stories. People are driven towards action, but without realizing it, make themselves more afraid. The news reports a lot more bad stuff than good, making us see the world through a scary filter. This is not true. You look at the people who are probably getting laid right now versus the people who are getting bombed by terrorists and it is very very skewed. People have to stop worrying about useless shit that isn&#39;t even going to affect them.

People are not encouraged to think for themselves and when this happens, we become malleable.

My comment would be that although I think you have the problem identified, and you&#39;ve started thinking about better ways of dealing with it than what we&#39;re currently doing, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve necessarily thought the issue through fully.  Freedom is good, but give freedom to a terrorist, and they may commit a nasty crime.  I&#39;m NOT advocating enhanced spying or ethnic profiling or anything.  Those things are wrong.  I&#39;m just saying that the solution is to nurture a society that wants to be decent upstanding citizens.  Most modern societies fail at that pretty badly these days, and the prime reason is not that humans are innately bad.  We are innately good, but can have bad tendencies if we&#39;re put in situations that tempt us to be bad.  If we encourage our societies to be moral (by basing what we do on good principles such as honesty and decency and hard work and fair distribution of resources, and transparency and encouraging a love for the environment and a strong sense of duty towards stewardship of it, and fairness and justice for all, including people in vulnerable circumstances like widows and orphans and ex-criminals...) then the problems will slowly disappear.  This is a cultural thing.  And it&#39;s a hard ask to get from where we are, to that sort of society, because one of the biggest evils inducing us to be bad is considered to be normal and good these days - namely money and the pursuit of money.  We need to radically alter this system so it&#39;s impossible for some people to have such vast inequality of resources - which comes from the current set-up with the money system.  That is hard, and will encounter a lot of opposition, but is nevertheless an indispensable tool in fighting the evils in our world.  The system outlined by Christian Felber in his book Change Everything <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_for_the_Common_Good\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_for_the_Common_Good</a> would be a good start I think.<br>But getting back to the principals and the problem I was getting at that I saw in this viedo: although freedom is great, and necessary, the greater the freedom, the greater the responsibility you have to use it wisely.  Freedom is powerful, and with power should come responsibility.  If people have shown that they&#39;re not moral, then they still deserve a little freedom, but less than people who are more moral.  Unfortunately judging morality is extremely fraught with difficulties.  It&#39;s possible that a lot of people in prison are quite moral people, but have been in difficult situations and had difficult upbringings and have just made a few bad decisions.  And it&#39;s possible that a lot of people not in prison, people who are free and walking about on our streets and in our supermarkets and skyscrapers are actually quite immoral, but are just quietly biding their time and doing as many immoral actions as they can to get their way within the system (I know some people who seem like this.)<br>So, the goal is to have a society where people WANT to be good.  To have that, we have to have a starting condition that nurtures and encourages this and makes it attainable.  And it reduces the power and freedom and privileges (not removes, reduces,) those things for the people with low amounts of morality so they can see the benefits of it, and will work hard on becoming moral.  The way to do this is to a) remove the power of the most evil things on the planet, the primary one of which, in my opinion right now is money, using a system such as the Economy for the Common Good, and b) encourage a culture of morality (which here in NZ and in many Western societies is being weakened, mostly by money and evil people who buy into money-is-good, such as right-wing organisations and parties,) with legislation that uses both stick and carrot to move us in that direction.", "comment_date": "2017-02-10T10:50:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Heinrich Himmler", "comment_text": "TRUMP PENCE2020\u263a", "comment_date": "2017-02-09T22:07:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u82cf\u96e8 suyu", "comment_text": "This is why I have a sticker sticked onto my laptop webcam and front phone camera.

There were lies everywhere.  After the coup and before the coup some journalist supporting it.  I can&#39;t say all of the arrested journalist are was guilty but who can stand this.  They are lying on everywhere.  They are humiliating us.  They are betrayal to country. None of us want this.  Still there is some journalist who supporting the terrorism.

Don&#39;t put a Trump figure in the animation and say &quot;wrong hands&quot;. You bet a &quot;Oba-lary&quot; figure can and will expand GuantanamoBay and extend war. And you worry about surveillance while people die justified by your votes? You cannot just focus on one topic without taking others into account.<br><br>3. NOBODY can assure that our type of &quot;secret democratic vote&quot; is really just. In Germany  more than dozen manipulated elections where discovered last year, let alone the undiscovered ones. <br><br>4. Terrorism as such was created by the major industrialised country&#39;s, starting just after 2nd world war with the UK and US in the Middle East. Some sources say it even started with the introduction of Hitler himself, being sure he will fail to make way for those very same people who &quot;use&quot; tools such as terrorism  to proclaim security measures.  It is a way of undermining and controlling a functional sovereign nation blaming it to create rebells(terrorists), where in fact these rebells were and still are trained by &quot;us&quot; to take control of the very same nations. Either way, our so called liberality doesn&#39;t cover those rebells interests, which is why me make them no.1 enemy of of thr state. Of COURSE we didn&#39;t get a bit safer since we started suveillancing us. Those puppets that we blame every once in a while are our doing! <br>The fact that you completely missed this fact proves you are just part of those narrow minded people that will always be controlled by fear. You will open the door for surveillance 4.0 unknowingly while trying to proclaim different. <br><br>5. I heard this greenhorn politician nonsense so often: &quot;let&#39;s be proud of our democracy&quot;. You people are a bunch of University students and journalists at best. If you would know ANYTHING about democratic values go read Robert Alan Dahl and then come again an rethink your words. You are not in the position to claim such generalized statements let alone on YouTube without explaining anything, indoctrinating the younger minds here for the worse. <br><br>&quot;we have to improve foreign policy and international cooperation&quot;, &quot; improve existing laws and not create new ones&quot;.<br>That&#39;s what people like you never explain, how it&#39;s supposed to go down. (no matter if it&#39;s in a nutshell or not). Cause you don&#39;t know how. The above said IS happening at the moment. We are cooperating with Turkey supporting the killing of PKK and Kurds and Syrian people, aren&#39;t we? We ARE still cooperating with the Saudis, who did not take a single refugee, aren&#39;t we? We ARE cooperating with the Chinese and setting up our companies on their land creating only very cheap labor for the people there to make cheap and low quality products for us, aren&#39;t we? We ARE cooperating with NATO states at our best, especially at times of near east expansion, again killing millions of people, aren&#39;t we? You don&#39;t know anything about democratic values. We voted for these things that are happening now. Democracy can be manipulated and a goddamn dictatorship like any other governmental system.<br><br>The once honoral and pacifist liberal ideas (of which this video is naivly full of) are long gone and undermined by those few people that found a way to form them in their way, making you believe in values that give these people free passes in doing whatever they like, creating a monarchy with a bunch of lobbyists while making it look like a polyarchy, let a alone a democracy.<br><br>Summary: <br><br>YOU are part of the problem, and not the solution like you proclaim.

Its like a quite takeover of their country. Plus why would the U.S. lie about WMDs?<br><br>No one I have ever met my whole life who uses rational thought can agree with this war we have started. Yet we never pull out. That means the people don&#39;t have a say, that means that a special group has the only say in wether or not we start a war or not. Thats messed up.<br><br>How are we going to change the world when our own Gov. won&#39;t even listen to the people? Who is running this shit?<br><br>I have my own way of seeing this, I just want people to ask why we do what we do. Because the way things are going now, no one is taking responsibility for their actions, a country of punks. When I was younger, I always assumed adults were responsible. Yet the people who are given responsibility and power are driven by greed. With no interest in even attempting to fix an issue, rather we have endless arguments on how nothing can be done. However I know a humans mind is capable of approaching any problem and overcoming it. Can we not build a society as though we were sending man to the moon? Because the current society reinforces a humans mind to be greedy.

Free public education and by association its intellectual resources are OUR tools! We have the opportunity to actually shape our lives and therefore give it meaning in our own way. To me, THIS is the true beauty of our country. At this point I&#39;d like to address all those posting about America&#39;s dark history: WE GET IT! Our country SCREWED UP. But is lounging in the past going to solve the problems of the future? All this does is create a chasm in our country that defies unity... something that we sorely need especially in such a critical time in our history.

Ever since the Paris attacks, people in Europe have been trying to arm themselves because they feel that their government can&#39;t properly protect them, either arriving too late, or arriving outgunned (or non-gunned) and becoming victims themselves. In the US in recent years, people on the left have called for more gun control in the wake of mass shootings, but their solutions wouldn&#39;t have prevented what occurred, as was the case with Sandy Hook. The San Bernardino shooters broke nearly every firearm law in California leading up to and during the attack; laws that punish people after an attack don&#39;t do anything to prevent such actions, and are especially useless if they&#39;re not alive to punish.<br><br>Many of the proposals I hear from the left are long term solutions that seem to be aimed more at slowing or stopping general sales of firearms rather than short or immediate solutions like allowing civilians to carry for their own defense in more sensitive places. It&#39;s not something unfamiliar. Texas made it easier to carry weapons in restaurants after a mass shooter rampaged through a restaurant in 1991, and the only person legally allowed to defend themselves had to lock their gun in the car, and couldn&#39;t save anyone, including her parents.", "comment_date": "2016-04-15T02:42:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Talon ViperChef", "comment_text": "Not this bullshit again on this channel.

Thanks to Big Data and the idea of Moore&#39;s Law, it doesn&#39;t matter how big the haystack is, because the speed at which that haystack is searched becomes ever faster regardless. One could argue that the &quot;surveillance state&quot; is inevitable on the grounds that every action in every location on the planet will soon be able to be captured in real time, with computers capable of telling us anything they see before we ask them what we&#39;re looking for.<br><br>Second point: you&#39;re jumping to some rather hasty conclusions in saying that the government &quot;lied&quot; in order to justify a backdoor. Tim Cook was vehement when he said that &quot;our data encryption is so secure, not even we can crack it.&quot; They were 110% positive the FBI would never, EVER be able to get into that phone. And were that true, then the FBI would never have been able to brute force the phone. As soon as they did find a way, Apple immediately pressured the FBI to reveal how, so they could patch it and regain that &quot;110% hackproof&quot; status. Someone&#39;s being despicable in that scenario and it&#39;s no longer the FBI.<br><br>The problem is we fetishize the black box that is technology. We expect it to perform exactly as intended without having to think of how it works or how it&#39;s used. The very definition of a brute force attack is one of simplicity. Yet we&#39;ve proven time and time again that PIN protection is a false layer of security (see <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5944567/the-most-and-least-common-pin-numbers-and-numeric-passwords-is-yours-one-of-them\">http://lifehacker.com/5944567/the-most-and-least-common-pin-numbers-and-numeric-passwords-is-yours-one-of-them</a>). When it gets down to it, if you put anything in yourself, on yourself, or on something that is connected to you, there is ALWAYS a chance that someone could take note of its existence. Even if it&#39;s embarrassing or unintentionally incriminating, you have to be able to take responsibility for the things that are a part of you.<br><br>The real issue is not the surveillance state, it&#39;s the idea that everyone is potentially a threat. In many respects, everyone on this planet is and is not a threat simultaneously. We all have the potential to wrong others, to hate others, but at the same time we all have restraint. The true injustice of your first example isn&#39;t that &quot;all Muslims were put into a system,&quot; it&#39;s that &quot;all Muslims were perceived as threats to national security.&quot; That&#39;s a far more encompassing issue because even if the Muslim community isn&#39;t /charged/ with anything, they are the ones who suffer as victims of prejudices inherent to the system.<br><br>I do believe there is a major hypocrisy here, when we ask the government and corporations to be transparent, yet guard ourselves and judge others around us who do the same.", "comment_date": "2016-04-15T00:32:30Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Samu", "comment_text": "Can you do a video on police brutality/violence in the USA on communities of color?", "comment_date": "2016-04-15T00:31:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Williams", "comment_text": "These videos are fucking incredible.

While government agencies are terrifying, and must be crippled, we don&#39;t need to give them any more fear power than they already have.  Additionally, most webcams have a light hardwired in, and this light is forced to activate by the firmware, which anyone who has ever tried low level hardware modification can tell you, is very difficult to do, and completely impossible to do without physical access, so that really does weaken the &quot;without you noticing bit.  Again, I&#39;m not saying these agencies aren&#39;t too powerful, quit the opposite in fact, I&#39;m simply saying that by adding things they can&#39;t to to the list of things we think they can do, we give them more power than they already have, or deserve.<br><br>On the iPhone thing, at no point did anyone serious actually think Apple&#39;s involvement was necessary for that to be accomplished, the iPhone&#39;s security capabilities are rather impressive, but they are far from unbeatable.

The trick was, under the basic operating system, information vital to reading any data was erased after ten unsuccessful attempts.  But all this meant was that the operating system needed to be modified to allow more attempts, or better yet, the relevant encrypted information needed to be retrieved, and brute forced in a different environment altogether.  Either of these processes would be resource intensive, but totally doable.  I&#39;m not totally sure what their motivation for asking Apple before doing this was, they may have wanted the publicity, either of Apple yielding to their demands (obviously didn&#39;t work), or taking advantage of the publicity from Apple&#39;s predictable refusal, to publicize just how &quot;capable&quot; they are, or maybe they wanted to simplify the process, either to avert cost, or because they where unaware of how relatively simple the process was, maybe they even wanted to take such a relatively simple case, unlock the dead terrorist&#39;s phone please, to establish a court precedent that they could use later.
