As if I&#39;m standing on the street, it was in winter, and I understand that all this is gone. Something happened, and our universe was pulled out of existence at such a high speed that no one noticed it, in short, with exceeding the speed of light many times. And that means I am standing at my entrance, and I see everything not like everyone else, not like I usually saw it myself. I see the sun in the form of an empty black circle, and everything that contained water, trees there, people, animals, snow, were less transparent than everything else. But the general background of everything was no longer a material ghost. And I understood one thing, that I need to hurry to convey this to people, that we are no longer there, there is nothing of this at all, that this is all our illusion, just a leftover effect. The world went away so quickly that it was ahead of its time. And I understand that everything will soon disappear. We urgently need to warn everyone about this danger. But carefully, so as not to scare. And so that we would have time to do something, come up with something, to stay alive, so as not to disappear. I went to the neighbors and tried to tell them this, but they looked at me without understanding, and I was scared. Then I again stand at my entrance, look up and think about what to do? what to think of? after all, the time of this action ends, and soon there will be no one and nothing left. Even information. And suddenly, in the distance, as if a star lit up! I stare at her, but she seems to be not so far away, seemingly like a flickering spark, it seems to be there and at the same time not. Or rather, a spark is like annealing. And it is so small that only I could see it, and at some level I understand that it is millions of times smaller than an atom. I ask myself the question, what is it? And if the voice answers me, this is everything. I didn&#39;t understand anything, I ask, what does everything mean? The voice answers me, this is the universe. And I understand that having somehow got there, there is the universe and our planet, but from the outside it looks exactly like this. Then I ask, what is this thing called? And the voice answers me - (A` segment of the quark) -<br><br>When I woke up, I wrote it down so as not to forget. ))", "comment_date": "2021-04-12T11:10:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jannat Hoque", "comment_text": "Uranus and Neptune are not  Gas gingt, Uranus and neptune are Ice Gingt.", "comment_date": "2021-04-11T10:22:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cam Chau Nguyen", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt color scheme used to be so simple", "comment_date": "2021-04-09T12:24:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gurbir Rai", "comment_text": "You\u2019ve got to appreciate how far this channel has come \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "comment_date": "2021-04-07T19:36:48Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Edward Lyons", "comment_text": "Sedna: Can I introduce myself?<br>Neptune: Uhhh....
