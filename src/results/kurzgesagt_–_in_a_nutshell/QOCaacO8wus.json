As life (energy) has nothing to do with, extra terrestrial or intra terrestrial. <br><br>So life is Energy, which is always  gets converted from one Form to another. But it is always constant and it can not be created or destroyed. <br><br>Even we do sex and give birth to newborns, it&#39;s just Energy that is converted from one Form to another. <br><br>Look U eat foods,  that gives you  protein, carbohydrates fats vitamin etc. When U eat all these  things are converted in some other forms by our body. And one of it is Ur &quot;Sperm and eggs&quot; and it&#39;s these two things that make fetus. Even this fetus grows on the food eaten by the mother. So every moment Energy  is converted but entire energy of the universe is always constant. Nothing is added or subtracted. <br><br>So &quot; Life is energy &amp; Life is God..&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T04:42:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "YuhYuh", "comment_text": "Life is.........

It&#39;s an excessively reductionist way of thinking about it. It&#39;s like cutting apart a TV remote to see what&#39;s inside and expecting the individual fragments to carry on the functions the remote performs as a whole. Or expecting one stroke of a pen in isolation to carry the same meaning as a finished drawing. At the very least, it can be said that life is more than the sum of it&#39;s parts. <br><br>What&#39;s really trying to be said is, I think, that for something that represents the inner workings of human tissue, there doesn&#39;t seem to be anything to distinguish these living systems from organic compounds that are distinctly not alive.<br>There is the tacit assumption that something about hydrocarbon molecules has to change in the process of being incorporated into a cell for it to be considered alive, but since they don&#39;t suddenly become magic sentient hydrocarbons they&#39;re actually still as dead as the digested hamburger they came from, or the petroleum in the ground. Again, not a good assumption for a video trying to define life. It could just as easily be suggested that, rather than the human body being more dead and mechanistic than we normally think about it, non-living substances have more the character of life than we normally suppose. <br><br>[The goal of life is to reproduce itself so life can keep going.]<br>Is it? Is it the goal of a wave on the ocean to make other waves? Or does it just happen? If you&#39;re going to say that both are distortions in the quantum fields of the universe, then both might as well have the same intentionality behind them. Reproduction is certainly something that a rabbit is compelled to do, but it never makes any plans. It just does it. Like a ball rolling down a hill under the effects of gravity. Again, I propose we look at this comparison both ways: the rabbit could be thought of as being as much a blind motion of energy as the ball, or the ball could be seen as a living process just like the rabbit. <br>Science is resistant to the idea that objects dubbed inanimate have anything resembling living qualities because this has connotations of irrationality and superstition, but there isn&#39;t actually any rational basis to support this. It is a dogma that scientists never question with uncharacteristic ignorance and bias.  <br><br>&quot;Mitochondria are not alive anymore.&quot;<br>Who says? This is purely arbitrary. The video assumes DNA is dead because it can&#39;t do anything on it&#39;s own, but when given an organelle that can do something independent of it&#39;s host cell, it&#39;s discarded. Even then, Abiogenesis assumes DNA arose before the rest of the cell structure. So what has to be added to the mix of molecules before it gets to be considered alive? There is no way of deciding except arbitrarily so the distinction between living and dead is a ruse. <br>Where does your torso end and your arm begin? One is very clearly distinct from the other, but the transition between the two is completely seamless. From one perspective, it makes sense to define the arm as starting with the humerus or the scapula, but in terms of the arm&#39;s function and motion, it makes more sense to think of the arm as starting at the pit of the neck where the clavicle meets the sternum. Neither is more valid than the other, so it&#39;s arbitrary. The arm is an outgrowth of the torso and the torso is the root of the arm, but the two are not separate things. They are an interdependent whole. <br><br>&quot;Is the universe dead or alive?&quot;<br>Is the arm a part of the torso or is the torso a part of the arm? The torso seems larger and houses vital organs that the arms need to exist, but these organs can&#39;t function of the human body is unable to feed itself and survive. The areas for motor control in the cortex devoted to the hands completely dwarfs that used for any other part of the body, which alone should express how vital this supposedly non-vital limb really is to the organism as a whole. <br>All we can say is that if there is a distinction between life and death, the two are conjoined rather than separate.  <br>But I would add that I think our perspectives are skewed towards thinking that if this distinction breaks down, the living parts fell less alive rather than the dead parts feeling less dead, and I don&#39;t think this is valid. It would be easier for us to feel gratitude to look at it the other way around:<br><br>This universe is not dead. There are relatively concentrated areas of life, like our planet, and areas of less life, but our conceptual boundaries for what is alive do not have any definable limit. It extends right across the observable universe like a gravitational field that gets weaker with distance but never actually vanishes.", "comment_date": "2021-04-17T16:13:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Clewlow", "comment_text": "No one has ever experienced death, death is a concept", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T21:32:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wiegraf", "comment_text": "&quot;Finally, the crude materialism which even now in the middle of the nineteenth century has been served up again under the ignorant delusion that it is original, belongs distinctly to this class. <br><br>It stupidly denies vital force, and first of all tries to explain the phenomena of life from physical and chemical forces, and those again from the mechanical effects of the matter, position, form, and motion of imagined atoms, and thus seeks to reduce all the forces of nature to action and reaction as its thing-in-itself.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T19:55:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hell god", "comment_text": "burn in fucking hell with me", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T10:10:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hell god", "comment_text": "fuck u", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T10:10:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kosin Paruchabutr", "comment_text": "&quot;Is death real?&quot;<br><br><br><b>pulls gun</b><br><br>t e s t t i m e", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T07:57:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Raad Islam", "comment_text": "Guys did he know that evolution is a theory not a fact ! \ud83d\udc38<br>And if it is then let&#39;s go and find some half monkey and half human guy.\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T23:30:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Milan ten Bosch", "comment_text": "What is life?

And finished the 2nd. World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth.", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T20:23:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pedro goduto zambelli", "comment_text": "Hello and happy day: I leave to my followers several famous phrases or sayings of the scientist Nikolas Tesla: 1) The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will progress more in a decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence . 2) The individual is ephemeral, races and nations come and go, but man remains. 3) What one man calls God, another calls the laws of physics.

As the verse,<br>   Who creates death and life {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 67:2.}<br>indicates, death is not non-existence, annihilation, non-being, an authorless extinction; rather, as is shown in the First Letter, it is a being discharged from service by an All-Wise Author, a change of residence, an exchange of bodies, a rest from duty, a being freed from the prison of the body; it is a wise and orderly work of wisdom. Indeed, just as the living face of the earth and the well-fashioned and living creatures upon it testify to the necessary existence and unity of an All-Wise Maker, so too with their deaths do those living beings bear witness to the eternity and unity of an Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One. Since it is proved and elucidated in the Twenty-Second Word that death is an extremely powerful proof of Divine unity and eternity, we refer the discussion to that Word and here only explain one important point. It is as follows:<br>   Both with their existences do living beings point to the existence of a Necessarily Existent One, and with their deaths do those living beings testify to the eternity and unity of an Ever-Living Eternal One. For example, the face of the earth, which is a single living creature, points to its Maker with its order and circumstances; so too it points to Him when it dies. That is, when winter conceals the earth&#39;s face with its white shroud, it turns the gazes of men away from itself <del>their gaze moves to the past behind the corpse of that departing spring</del> and it shows them a far wider scene. That is to say, all the past springs of the earth, which were all miracles of power, inform them that new living springtime creatures of the earth will come, and since they all testify to the existence of those future wonders of Divine power, each a living earth, they testify brilliantly and powerfully and on a vast scale to the necessary existence, unity, everlastingness, and eternity of an All-Glorious Maker, an All-Powerful One of Perfection, an Ever-Living Eternal One; they demonstrate such brilliant proofs that whether one wants to or not they make one declare: &quot;I believe in God, the One, the Unique!&quot;    In Short: According to the meaning of the verse,<br>   And gives life to the earth after its death, {[*]: Qur&#39;an, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOCaacO8wus&amp;t=30m19s\">30:19</a>.}<br>just as this living earth testifies to the Maker with the spring, so with its death it turns man&#39;s gaze to the miracles of Divine power lined up on the two wings of time, the past and the future; it alludes to thousands of miracles of power in place of one miracle. And each of those springs testifies more certainly than this present spring, for those which have departed towards the past have gone together with their apparent causes, and after them others like them have come in their places. This means that apparent causes are nothing: only that an All-Powerful One of Glory creates the springs, and tying them to causes shows that He has sent them. As for the faces of the earth lined up in future time, they testify still more brilliantly. For they will be made anew from nothing, from non-being, and sent; they will be put on the earth, made to do their duty, and then sent away.<br>   And so, O heedless one deviated into nature and drowning in its swamp! How can something which does not possess hands wise and powerful enough to reach all the past and all the future interfere in the life of the earth? Can your total nonentity of nature interfere in it? If you want to be saved, say: &quot;At the very most, nature is a notebook of Divine power. And as for chance, it is a veil to hidden Divine wisdom which conceals our ignorance.&quot; Approach the truth!<br>.....<br>   O wretched worshipper of causes! With what can you explain these important truths? How can you deceive yourself? If you have sense, rend the veil of causes and declare: &quot;He is One, He has no partners!&quot; Be saved from innumerable delusions!<br>   Twenty-Eighth Window <br>   And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the variations in your tongues and in your colours; verily in that are signs for those who know. {[*]: Qur&#39;an, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOCaacO8wus&amp;t=30m22s\">30:22</a>.}<br>   We look at the universe, and we see that a wisdom and ordering embrace everything from the cells of the body to the totality of the world.<br>   We look at the cells of the body, and we see that through the command and according to the law of one who considers what is beneficial for the body and administers it, there is a significant management in those miniscule cells. One the one hand a sort of sustenance is stored up in the stomach in the form of fat and expended at the time of need, and on the other in those tiny cells there is a regulation and storing up.<br>   We look at plants, and a most wise planning and nurturing are apparent.<br>   We look at animals, and we see a rearing and nurturing which are generous to the utmost degree.<br>   We look at the mighty elements of the universe, and we see a majestic government and illumination following momentous aims.<br>   We look at the universe as a whole, and we see a perfect ordering for exalted instances of wisdom and elevated aims, as though it was a country, a city, or a palace.<br>   As is described and proved in the First Stopping-Place of the Thirty-Second Word, from minute particles to the stars, not the tiniest place is left for associating partners with God. All beings are in effect so interrelated that one who cannot subjugate all the stars and hold them in his hand, cannot make a particle heed his claims to be its lord and sustainer. It is necessary to own all the stars in order to be the true sustainer of a single particle.<br>   Furthermore, as is described and proved in the Second Stopping-Place of the Thirty-Second Word, one not capable of creating and arranging the heavens cannot make the individual features on the human face. That is to say, one who is not Sustainer of all the heavens cannot make the distinguishing features on a single human face.<br>   Thus, this is a window as large as the universe, which, if looked through, the following verses will also appear to the mind&#39;s eye, written on the pages of the universe in large letters:<br>   God is the Creator of all things, and of all things He is the Guardian and Disposer * His are the keys of the heavens and the earth. {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 39:62-3.}<br>   One who does not see these has either no mind or no heart.

Cells fit this description quite easily, they have the urge to seek out nutrients to survive. I feel the idea that we as massive organisms are something different than what we are composed of is quite 1 directional, why must be base the world around our own view and understanding of it; and does there really need to be a long and drawn out explanation and description for everything? Can&#39;t some things just be put simply and be done?<br><br>While the definition I present to you tonight is quite brief, and doesn&#39;t go too much into details, there is certainly one aspect that people planning for the future can truly get behind, this definition doesn&#39;t leave out potential AI or AI Machines from being included as &quot;living&quot; beings. An AI machine can have an urge to perform a task, and if you ask me, that is enough to argue life. Even if an entity doesn&#39;t or is incapable of arguing its status of living does not mean that it isn&#39;t alive or that it cannot &#39;live&#39;, a perfect example would be a newborn infant since we were all infants once, and when we were infants we couldn&#39;t speak, let alone argue that we were living; does this mean we weren&#39;t then and aren&#39;t now living, no however it is a great place to start since it requires people to comprehend that the world is not everything that we perceive it to be, and like can REALLY by deceiving.<br><br><br>Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

As the verse,<br>   Who creates death and life {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 67:2.}<br>indicates, death is not non-existence, annihilation, non-being, an authorless extinction; rather, as is shown in the First Letter, it is a being discharged from service by an All-Wise Author, a change of residence, an exchange of bodies, a rest from duty, a being freed from the prison of the body; it is a wise and orderly work of wisdom. Indeed, just as the living face of the earth and the well-fashioned and living creatures upon it testify to the necessary existence and unity of an All-Wise Maker, so too with their deaths do those living beings bear witness to the eternity and unity of an Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One. Since it is proved and elucidated in the Twenty-Second Word that death is an extremely powerful proof of Divine unity and eternity, we refer the discussion to that Word and here only explain one important point. It is as follows:<br>   Both with their existences do living beings point to the existence of a Necessarily Existent One, and with their deaths do those living beings testify to the eternity and unity of an Ever-Living Eternal One. For example, the face of the earth, which is a single living creature, points to its Maker with its order and circumstances; so too it points to Him when it dies. That is, when winter conceals the earth&#39;s face with its white shroud, it turns the gazes of men away from itself <del>their gaze moves to the past behind the corpse of that departing spring</del> and it shows them a far wider scene. That is to say, all the past springs of the earth, which were all miracles of power, inform them that new living springtime creatures of the earth will come, and since they all testify to the existence of those future wonders of Divine power, each a living earth, they testify brilliantly and powerfully and on a vast scale to the necessary existence, unity, everlastingness, and eternity of an All-Glorious Maker, an All-Powerful One of Perfection, an Ever-Living Eternal One; they demonstrate such brilliant proofs that whether one wants to or not they make one declare: &quot;I believe in God, the One, the Unique!&quot;    In Short: According to the meaning of the verse,<br>   And gives life to the earth after its death, {[*]: Qur&#39;an, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOCaacO8wus&amp;t=30m19s\">30:19</a>.}<br>just as this living earth testifies to the Maker with the spring, so with its death it turns man&#39;s gaze to the miracles of Divine power lined up on the two wings of time, the past and the future; it alludes to thousands of miracles of power in place of one miracle. And each of those springs testifies more certainly than this present spring, for those which have departed towards the past have gone together with their apparent causes, and after them others like them have come in their places. This means that apparent causes are nothing: only that an All-Powerful One of Glory creates the springs, and tying them to causes shows that He has sent them. As for the faces of the earth lined up in future time, they testify still more brilliantly. For they will be made anew from nothing, from non-being, and sent; they will be put on the earth, made to do their duty, and then sent away.<br>   And so, O heedless one deviated into nature and drowning in its swamp! How can something which does not possess hands wise and powerful enough to reach all the past and all the future interfere in the life of the earth? Can your total nonentity of nature interfere in it? If you want to be saved, say: &quot;At the very most, nature is a notebook of Divine power.

It is the most powerful and most brilliant of the proofs of Divine unity. It is the most comprehensive and most shining of the mirrors displaying the manifestations of the Eternally Besought One. Yes, on its own, life makes known a Living and Self-Subsistent One together with all his Names and acts. For life is a light, a medicament, like a potion blended from numerous attributes. Just as the seven colours are combined in light, and various drugs are blended together in a medicament, so life is a reality made of numerous attributes. Some of the attributes in its reality expand by means of the senses; they unfold and are differentiated. However the greater part make themselves perceived in the form of the emotions; they make themselves known by welling up out of life.<br>   Furthermore, life comprises sustenance, mercy, grace, and wisdom, which are dominant in the planning and administration of the universe. It is as if life fastens them on behind it and draws them into the place it enters. For example, when life enters a body, the Name of All-Wise is also manifested; it makes its home well and orders it with wisdom. In the same way, the Name of All-Generous is manifested, and it organizes and decorates its dwelling according to its needs. At the same time, the manifestation of the Name of All-Compassionate is apparent; it bestows all sorts of bounties for the continuance and perfection of life. Again at the same time, the manifestation of the Name of Provider appears; it produces the sustenance, material and immaterial, necessary for the perpetuation and unfolding of the life, and in part stores them up within its body. That is to say, life is like a point of focus; various attributes enter one another, indeed, they become one and the same. It is as if in its entirety life is both knowledge, and at the same time power, and at the same time wisdom and mercy, and so on... Thus, with regard to this comprehensive essence, life is a mirror of the Eternally Besought One reflecting the essential dominical attributes. It is due to this mystery that the Necessarily Existent One, Who is the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One, creates life in great abundance and plenitude, and scatters it far and wide and broadcasts it, and gathers everything around life and makes it serve it. For life&#39;s duty is great. Yes, it is not easy to be the mirror of the Eternally Besought One, it is not some petty duty.<br>   Thus, the instantaneous and continuous coming into existence from nothing of these countless, numberless lives which we all the time see before our eyes, <del>and of spirits, which are the origins and essences of lives</del> their being sent, demonstrate the necessary existence, sacred attributes, and Most Beautiful Names of a Necessarily Existent and Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One as clearly as sunbeams show the existence of the sun. Just as someone who does not recognize and accept the existence of the sun is compelled to deny the light which fills the day, so one who does not recognize the Sun of Divine Oneness, Who is Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent and the Giver of Life and Death, has to deny the existence of the living creatures which fill the earth and even the past and the future; he has to fall a hundred times lower than an animal, to fall from the level of life to become something utterly ignorant and lifeless.<br>Risale-i Nur Collection Words 706- Bedi\u00fczzaman Said Nursi", "comment_date": "2019-09-03T12:59:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John Doe", "comment_text": "Did anyone else read the thumbnail and think &quot;baby don&#39;t hurt me?&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-09-03T01:47:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BIG TIME", "comment_text": "Still one of Kurzgesagt&#39;s best videos.", "comment_date": "2019-09-02T12:03:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "*love & Peace is never guaranteed", "comment_text": "As far as I understand is life is amazing in which it survives and thrives but yet it is dead at the Same time <b>mindblown</b> \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-09-02T08:52:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "krushnarajsinh chudasama", "comment_text": "After watching ur videos..

Around 10 years ago started to realize, if basically everything in us is made from materials, that is not alive, how comes it is alive. Or more so, most of the &quot;illusion that is alive&quot; comes from movement. Things that move are alive to us, but then again, there are natural occurrences of movement in nature by chemical and physical reactions. So the real question is: How come these natural reactions became so extremely regulated and complex and are numbered in the billions in us? I hardly doubt that we came to be some sort of existence that is like a 1 to 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 chance or something. And no I don&#39;t believe in god.  I am a believer, but not in god. God is a made-up thing for religion to control people.  So then again, if we make a &quot;robot&quot; that is the same as us, but is from a different material (that is not living for example) does it mean we might as well be made of anything? Can we call it alive? Can we call us alive? I think the word itself is getting to old and needs to be redefined &quot;life&quot; or &quot;alive&quot; . Also, the problem is WE think that intelligent robots are intelligent because they act like us. So basically we think something is intelligent if it&#39;s human-like.  That&#39;s the exact problem with Elon Musk: He thinks Ai is dangerous because it thinks like a human if we make it intelligent...but the truth is we dont need to make it like a human since its a tool.

When someone \u2018dies\u2019, the electrons in atoms that made up that person do not stop spinning. So, death is really a change of state for the atoms and molecules that made that person.

Of course energy can be and is manipulated for both beneficial and nefarious means, as we do it all the time ourselves. So entities on a higher dimension than us using manipulation of our energy to create a constant simulation(s) in our realm for some purpose cannot be ruled out. But we&#39;d be living in a manipulation state more so than a simulation state. A different yet similar manipulation state the wordly PTB have us living in now, with the difference being that these entities may be doing it for our benefit to achieve cosmic balance and not solely just for taking advantages of us for their agenda, like our &quot;leaders&quot; do. However, regardless of what state of being we exist in, we have a conscience and sub-conscience, and SOUL is our ultimate form of consciousness. Our Soul-Conscious lives and persists ALWAYS from energy we possess, give out, receive, the reactive shared from said energy we receive or emanated from another something or someone, (etc...). Medical Scientists have even accounted for the time and weight of one&#39;s soul as it &quot;passes on&quot; after one&#39;s mortal/worldly death. Everything everywhere is energy. Simply put, all that we see, hear, and are is an energy of vibration, frequency and magnetism. A solid block wall to your silent thought is all energy. <br>Life is manifestations of energy and interactions of said energy&#39;s. Death is a transfer of the total sum of those energy&#39;s gained in your life. Where our Soul-Conscious energy will go depends on the type of energy that said Soul-Conscious possesses. There&#39;s the energy of balance, which is pristine/godly, and which is the energy we battle ourselves with the most. What is not enough and how much is too much are limits we&#39;re constantly being tested with everyday. Then there&#39;s positive and negative energy. Tessla said &quot;3-6-9 is life.&quot; Forms of energy which all contain vibration, frequency and magnetism, and their non-stop interactions. The best we can do is to try to maestro our own vibrations, frequencies, and magnetics as best as we can into a tune that aims for balance in our Soul-Conscious. All religions speak on this but the most practical compass to reach that unreachable balance as flawed human-beings is best stated in &quot;The Golden Rule.&quot; Live life with that in mind, as that will aid in the direction of where your Soul-Consciousness&#39; energy takes you after you shed your mortal flesh suite\ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2019-07-13T05:44:52Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Peter Quill", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f", "comment_date": "2019-07-13T04:02:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Blue Jesus", "comment_text": "What is dead may never die!", "comment_date": "2019-07-12T22:44:00Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "ThatOtherAndrew", "comment_text": "Love how the music changes in this.", "comment_date": "2019-07-12T18:30:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ayoub Melkia", "comment_text": "how could a blind laws give birth to an observant human being ..! can\u2019t you see", "comment_date": "2019-07-12T15:05:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Micha\u0142 Urbaniak", "comment_text": "its not very clever thing to assuming that evolution is a fact i highly reccomend Discovery Science Channel where many scientist argueing that theory ...thumbs down !", "comment_date": "2019-07-11T23:07:09Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Matth Erto", "comment_text": "What is life .

It is realizing we are all human and accepting each other for who we are. Everything in this world is connected. For example the high unemployment rate directly connects to the suicide rate. Untreated mental, psychological, or social emotional issues connects to the gun violence and homicide rate. You think about gangs and gang violence and there all in the poorest most forgotten communites in the country. When you say something mean to someone they take that bitterness with them and spill it on to others. Most of society today are confused on how to approach this thing called life. Some people believe in diffrent gods others believe in science and some people believe in nothing and this is place where we all are divided and begin to clash but the truth is right in front of us we are letting our beliefs and opinions that weve learned tear us all apart coupled with things like race, politics , age , financial status, and region of the country we are constantly being divided. Which is making a stable society further from our grasp. It is amazing to me how we are in the age of the internet, and space stations but we still havent figured out a peaceful way to live amongst ourselfs. You see in a perfect world people are supported, loved , and given a sense of belonging. But it cant just be the lucky few it has to be worldwide. If we can somehow across continent to continent realize we are all the same and treating eachother as brother and sister instead of a bunch strangers then we would be on the correct path. Also financial stability can you imagine where the human race would be if it wasnt just a few major countries with space flight capabilties but the entire continent of africa and south america had the same advancement in technology as the usa did today? People who normally would have been refugees, victims of poverty , people who would have been busy searching for a clean water source would know be invested in something to help change the world and bringing in new ideas and concepts to the world.

Which isnt much of a line to differentiate the two considering machines are already mostly made of different material. Is life just a &quot;machine&quot; made for the shits and giggles to watch it grow? Could we harvest life to become machines by working on removing an organisms free will, feelings and impulses, to make it live for one specifiic task? Would that be inhumane, although the organism at that point wouldn&#39;t be &quot;living&quot;? Even though at this point its hard to say if we are living, but bear with me.

I don&#39;t even think the ability to reproduce is a requirement of life. Since if someone becomes/is infertile they aren&#39;t suddenly considered dead. I think the real situation is that anything which is capable of recieving information and then processing this input is considered alive. Thus almost everything in the known universe is considered somewhat alive. For example a rock can receive informational nput in the form of heat and can process this information by increasing the energy in its own molecules resulting in a change of physical state. Since everything is alive from a rock to a plant to an insect to an animal to a human. The next question is how do we differentiate these different forms of life. The answer is by how intelligent the life is. To define the degree of intelligent life there is you must consider the quantities and qualities of informational input that can be received and processed. This explains why we value human life over animal life, animal life over insect life, insect life over plant life and plant life over rock life.

Regarding your question of whether everything is alive or dead, i have a bit of theory of my own. You have already told that we and the stars share the same elements but yet we are different. Now consider a copper wire and some silicon chips. In its raw state it is useless, but if we form resistors, transistors and capacitors with it we can use it to make logic gates which are used to make computers. Yet they show a blank screen unless a driving force is given to it, which in this case is electricity. Also the electricity is given in form of specific input to get the desired output. After doing so a computer can evolve and generate feelings, thoughts and do many other things (Now-a-days we can even see such kind of self-aware computers). Humans are no different than computers who have also evolved a lot from nothing to many thing. But how did our &#39;dead&#39; body of logic gates gained life? Well, similar to that of computers, there might have been a electric or any other force <br>(I mostly believe that it might have been pure energy which some refer to as soul) was provided to 1st living-dead cell under specific conditions to get the desired output of being alive. Over the life the force or energy remains in our body and acts as our subconscious mind. We use small fractions of this energy throughout our live for everything we do, hear, speak, see, feel, etc (We may not even use it as it may be infinite source of energy). At the time of death, I have some predictions about what happens to the energy-<br>1. If the source of energy is finite<br>   1. The energy might get completely used up (like battery of a phone or laptop).<br>   2. Or the energy may get converted into some mass (if there is any energy remaining in the being).<br>   3. Or the energy may get converted into any other form of energy we may not know of.<br>2. If the source of energy is infinite<br>   1. Or the energy may just exit out of body and become omnipresent, that is, it may spread all over the universe<br>   2. Or the energy might exit out of body but instead of becoming omnipresent, it may act as driving force for another &#39;dead&#39; body to gain life and thus forming a eternal cycle of rebirth.<br><br>Speaking of this theory, either of it may be true or it may be completely wrong. I have just shared what I think about life and in no way want to hurt feelings of people of what they think about life. This just a simple answer which I think might be true so please don&#39;t anyone accept (unless its proved) as I also don&#39;t have enough knowledge in this field.

You must respect and care for everything. The easiest way for me to think about this is that the earth itself is one giant living thing, it&#39;s components are its organ systems/organs/tissue/etc.(metaphorically). You and everything else are an invention of the earth itself, you just got a bit more lucky. Or perhaps, not lucky, because it is your purpose now to help this world sustain itself while growing at the same time. We are the earths way of trying to figure out what the fuck is going on beyond it. We are the product of the earths trial and error. Perhaps the earth realized it will ultimately have an end and wanted to create something that could venture beyond and continue its history after its death. Because individual humans could not last forever, but if we look beyond ourselves and work together, it is possibly that humanity can last until the universe end. But who knows?

Is Death Real? Ask a physicist. We are electric/magnetic energy fields existing in a unified field of electric/magnetic energy fields.

Read her book: &quot;Hands of Light&quot;.<br><br>I receive email from the site &quot;Ask a Mathematician, Ask a Physicist&quot;. Here is the latest I received:\r<br><br> Q: What are &quot;actual pictures&quot; of atoms actually pictures of?.\r<br>\r<br>Physicist: Actual pictures of atoms aren\u2019t actually pictures at all. There are a few good rules of thumb in physics.  Among the best is: light acts like you\u2019d expect on scales well above its wavelength and acts weird on scales below.  In order to take a picture of a thing you need light to bounce.\r<br>\r<br>Basically the only thing they have actually seen is basically a computer image not the real image, and second, they observe electric fields, not the particle itself---they do not observe particles themselves.  They are able to observe only the field---however this alone does not prove anything, but that that electric energy fields exist and that\u2019s about---no atoms, no photons, no electrons, no quarks. no nothing.  So, no, particles do not exist.  Particles exist only inside mathematical abstractions and nothing more and nothing else.  We don\u2019t know what actually exists in the real world, except that they are energy fields---electric, magnetic and all other forms and all other kinds of energy fields.\r<br>\r<br>I forgot to add that what exactly is visualized with all these microscopes including STM.  What is visualized is the charge density of the electric field.\r<br>Basically you observe vibrations----electric vibrations.\r<br>You haven\u2019t seen an atom either. You\u2019ve seen an image you assume to be an atom, but it is simply an instrument\u2019s representation of the atom. It is not the atom itself.\r<br>\r<br>Those aren\u2019t actual ATOMS\u2026 That is the representation of its effects (measurements).\r<br>\r<br>These techniques aren\u2019t actually \u201cvisual\u201d like microscopes we work with in biology classes. Microscopes use lenses and light to help zoom and focus on small objects. Electron microscopes, on the other hand, use quantum scattering theory to construct the shape of small objects, then the data is transferred to a computer to create a model. The wavelengths of visible light ranges on the order of ~370nm to 750nm. These are all MUCH larger than many particles of interest (and way too large to view atoms, which are on the order of Angstroms\u20130.1nm). Scientists need to be creative to be able to \u201csee\u201d atoms.\r<br>\r<br>The problem with what we think are atoms is exactly about the shorter wavelengths.  Sure shorter wavelengths hit something, but what is it?\r<br>You cannot know what it is because of the reasons I posted above.\r<br>\r<br>So, no, scanning tunneling microscopes and atomic force microscopes did not prove the existence of atoms.", "comment_date": "2018-06-10T17:05:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pico Man", "comment_text": "Baby don&#39;t hurt me", "comment_date": "2018-06-10T16:24:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ELAINE", "comment_text": "Life is soul", "comment_date": "2018-06-10T13:12:11Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Sky Darmos", "comment_text": "Artificial intelligence does not exist.", "comment_date": "2018-06-10T12:16:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sky Darmos", "comment_text": "Nothing is moved by the laws of the universe.

Then how are we alive? How is anything alive? <br>You haven&#39;t read quantum physics. You don&#39;t talk about quarks and how they spin billions of times a second as 3 points of light, forming what are called protons and neutrons. The smartest people are quantum physicists and they do know how to draw a line. They say that nothing dies. Energy does not die. It is constantly transforming itself. If you were to read the  book &quot;The Quantum World&quot; written by the physicist Kenneth Ford, you would find out that everything everywhere is energy. Energy rotates, spins, oscillates, vibrates, resonates, radiates, and bursts forth magically as quarks which are constantly interacting with gluons and photons, etc. Each time an interaction happens between subatomic particles, a change happens---a change that completely changes a quark into a gluon, or an electron into a photon, etc. Creation is constant. Energy is always bursting forth creating everything everywhere. Nothing is solid. Even the hardest diamond is bursting forth with quarks spinning billions of times a second as 3 points of light. <br>So this is why physicists say that consciousness is bursting forth as everything. At the core of this existence including people are waves of energy and light. SO......what causes these waves to resonate into the frequencies and particles called solidity? Physicists say observance. Barbara Brennan is a physicist/healer that wrote the book &quot;Hands of Light&quot;. She has trained herself to see people as holograms. Since nothing is solid, then we are complex, brilliant images/holograms. She writes that we are eternal multidimensional, electromagnetic, holographic energy and light. Existence is consciousness and IS abundant life. SO......this means that we exist BEFORE focusing on these bodies. In Brennan&#39;s book can be seen many pictures of what we look like out of these bodies as holograms.", "comment_date": "2018-05-30T21:26:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Local Vault Companion", "comment_text": "This looks interesting<br>(Watches it)<br>(Halfway through)<br>What the f-<br>(Implodes)", "comment_date": "2018-05-30T07:13:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D Ram", "comment_text": "Stay with god, all interpretation , don\u2019t say \u201cheaven isn\u2019t real\u201d , religion is interpretation", "comment_date": "2018-05-29T06:09:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evan Pinkston", "comment_text": "Im tripping nuts this video is wild", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T22:27:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlo Abat", "comment_text": "Yah, but the question is, what does matter to you now, in your own perspective.

Some call this stuff &quot;organics&quot;. In a sense, being alive is the countinuation of the processes which govern our bodies. When these processes halt, we die. So, what is death?<br><br>Most fauna have neurons. They help regulate their bodies, tell them what to do, make them alive. When neurons stop working in fauna, they are certifiably dead. They no longer function. Clinically, a human is declared dead when their hearts stop, or when their brains stop working. This however, is only half true. When the heart stops beating, it stops sending oxygen to the brain. This stops critical functions in the cells of the brain, meaning it cannot work. The processes in the brain cease. It <b>dies.</b> In all living things, when the processes which keep them working cease, that thing is considered dead. This is death.<br><br>We call our phones dead when they stop working. We call a battery dead when it stops giving off power since it&#39;s chemical processes that create the power cease. With that being said, if we do end up making a sentient computer system, is it alive? No. Because it is not organic. It is not made of carbon atoms linked to each other, whilst also linked to other atoms to crate organic compounds. But just because something isn&#39;t alive, doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t die.

I think first of all, I think asking what life is from the ground up (i.e. looking at cells that make us up to ask what life is) is fallacious. The qualities of the parts do not describe the qualities of the whole. Just because a cell has certain properties does not mean that larger complex living organisms are restricted to the same properties, so trying to describe life in terms of cells and then applying it to us doesn&#39;t really cut it. <br><br>Next, you assert that the goal of life is to avoid death by creating more of itself so that the DNA (or information) is preserved. What is to say that this is a goal? What makes it any more than something that just happens to be the case when living organisms? <br><br>Another issue that stands out to me is that you also seem to have a preconceptualised idea of what life is and what living things are that is throwing everything off balance. You can&#39;t say all living things have DNA in them before you have even answered what a living thing is. You can&#39;t say that the parts that make up a cell are not alive if you haven&#39;t answered what life is. Then using those points to say what life is is just ludicrous. That makes them unsupported premises, which means your conclusion is highly dubious.<br><br>Finally, I am not pleased with your statement that it is wrong that life is not fundamentally different from inanimate things because they do not contain a metaphysical property and are not governed by different principles than inanimate objects. I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with the conclusion, but you just haven&#39;t justified it at all in this video. You have described why the cells that make us up are no different from the cells that make inanimate objects up, and that&#39;s fine, but I can&#39;t point to a single shred of evidence that you have given that demonstrates that metaphysical entities cannot be in coexistence with a Physical body. &quot;One things for sure&quot; and that&#39;s that you need to back up such a big statement before making it.", "comment_date": "2018-03-04T09:59:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Piggles Cake", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd2f", "comment_date": "2018-03-04T07:14:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OnImpulse", "comment_text": "Why did LSD make me realize that everything is one before learning about it?", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T17:12:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam B.", "comment_text": "Life is a delivery system for sperm and eggs to make more sperm and eggs, just like a chicken is what the egg invented to make more eggs.", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T08:14:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SirMatthew", "comment_text": "Baby don\u2019t hur- oh right it\u2019s 2018", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T03:32:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lightning Only Comments Once", "comment_text": "!?.....Fuck you?...Uh..", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T00:43:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Homaz Z", "comment_text": "LIFE IS AN ILLUSION!", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T14:30:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andika Hilman", "comment_text": "I like your video.

It basically states that there is nothing in the universe other than matter - which is &#39;dead&#39;...or is it all &#39;alive&#39;? We don&#39;t know, but to say that matter is the most fundamental state of the universe and there is nothing outside of the realm of matter is nothing more than an assumption; a belief system. We simply do not know. <br><br>There is no proof that matter is all that there is. There is, however, evidence that this may not be the case. Working on the open minded assumption that, although we cannot yet see anything which lies outside of the material world, it doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t there, seems to me the wisest mindset moving forward. Most mainstream science however dismisses the notion of there being anything outside the realm of matter as though it is a foregone conclusion. This is an egregious error. <br><br>Human consciousness for example: we do not know what it is, or how it came about, or how it works, yet mainstream science (but not all science) assumes it is generated by the brain despite a vast body of evidence, gathered from rigorous studies conducted over decades in various scientific disciplines, which suggests otherwise. As yet, there has been no meaningful or even sensible rebuttal of this evidence.<br><br>I do think the errors of materialism will be gradually rectified though as stronger and stronger evidence surfaces that there may be the existence of something outside/beyond the material world we observe. The evidence is already very strong in my opinion, but it is mostly ignored or ridiculed by the religion that is materialism. Once the materialists open their minds and return to proper science - which looks at all the evidence as thoroughly as possible rather than dismissing the parts of it which don&#39;t fit with their worldview - we can move forward properly in the search for answers to the question: what is life?<br><br>That&#39;s my two cents anyway!", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T14:10:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Error null", "comment_text": "Lol y\u2019all idiots cremating yourselfs wont ever be part of some shit ever again in the universe", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T04:09:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Error null", "comment_text": "Okay so even why do those chemicals do what they do", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T04:05:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ricardo Silva", "comment_text": "Vegeta!

I think it would be a good idea to show an example of simple life, which is about a looping process (a cyclic processor). <br><br>Let&#39;s use a small electric fan on your desk as an example. If the fan is operating normally, it is&quot;alive&quot;. If you stick your finger into a blade, the fan will temporarily suspend operation (&quot;suspended animation&quot;). When you remove your finger, the fan will resume normal operation again (it is alive again). If you significantly damage the fan&#39;s components, it will stop permanently (and be &quot;dead&quot;, no more spinning). A power supply must exist to drive a processor continuously (it has to eat). In some systems, removing the power supply (in this case, the battery) will also cause damage and kill it. Also, the fan will age over many years, and accumulate enough damage to eventually die of &quot;old age&quot; (it will never spin again).<br><br>As strange as it may sound, a fan is a simple lifeform. ;)", "comment_date": "2018-01-25T21:40:36Z", "likes_count": 25}, {"comment_by": "YodaMrpt", "comment_text": "Birds doesnt born with feathers :v", "comment_date": "2018-01-25T00:08:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GIZMO RADOS", "comment_text": "When u don&#39;t have life", "comment_date": "2018-01-24T09:08:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "-IlIlIlIlIlIlIlIlIlIlIlI-", "comment_text": "Baby don&#39;t hurt me...", "comment_date": "2018-01-23T20:10:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "0TeosAntagonian0", "comment_text": "..pls dont hurt me..", "comment_date": "2018-01-23T19:31:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tristen Yazzie", "comment_text": "Zombie?", "comment_date": "2018-01-23T09:54:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stitch noodles", "comment_text": "we all have no idea, and by that you can&#39;t say that other&#39;s idea are wrong. it&#39;s just satisfying yourself to reject other&#39;s idea", "comment_date": "2018-01-23T05:10:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eduardo ws6", "comment_text": "life is what you make it and dying is real you will never open your eyes and see you kids grow up or see your family never again", "comment_date": "2018-01-23T03:54:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lisneidy _loves", "comment_text": "So we dead asf", "comment_date": "2018-01-23T02:54:14Z", "likes_count": 47}, {"comment_by": "DAT BOI", "comment_text": "Wow just wow cells that work in our body&#39;s grow eat react but all together we are living feeling with emotions and what part we need to remove to not be in that body any more some people want to a humans head on to another and then when we do it will we be the same at the mind but differed body in reality we are not people who life with their own body&#39;s we are an organ and that organ is the brain we use our body to get blood oxygen food water etc.  Just joking hahaha I am too dumb to think that far", "comment_date": "2018-01-22T21:39:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Quillster", "comment_text": "Congratulations!

We live in trying times when the intelligent are made fun of ( discriminated against for seeking truth or those elusive facts, nothing new there) and celebrities that sell useless junk are worshipped.  I am really concerned that the thoughtless masses are gonna take us down the hwy to hell where civilisation will collapse for a pretty long time (there is no hell really, that is more made up god turds) .  <br><br>Yes I am being a troll some here, however I am trying to save civilization as we know it now and that should count for something.  The poop is gonna hit the fan when the fishing in the South China Sea collapses, which I expect will occur in ten years or less.  From a cultural standpoint one of the main underlying problems is the idea that when it goes to poop we will be saved.  The masses believe we have dominion.  This has always been a bad idea and now is pretty much proving itself in the bad idea area.  I can respect faith but sorry all the rest of it has to go.  Books of fiction cannot be allowed to be the basis for governing the planet.  I am completely sure that if things continues as they do now we are completely doomed.  Sadly, 80 percent of Earthly people have faith in god, which very sadly, logically leads me to have no faith in a long term future for us.  The Earth will be fine, but millions and more likely billions of us are going to die in 100 years or less.  I have considered these things for quite some time, and I am seldom wrong.  Yes I have an ego, I really think about things,  too many of us do not.<br><br>God is not great. All gods are made up magical sky men mostly, who as a group have offered zero proof of their existence (There have been a few sky women, a very, very small number ) .  The holy rollers expect to be saved when things go to a very bad place, but imaginary magic sky men save no one not even rollers.  The whole idea of god is the biggest con ever by man on man.  If you are a women you should be really mad that all the major religions treat you as second class.  My problem with it all is that I have a working brain that concluded that god is bull turds when I was 11 years old (not the record ran across 8 years old recently) .  So most of the world is run  by people who do not have a fully functioning brain.  The other thing that gets me is how can anyone read the bible or koran cover to cover and not come to the conclusion it is fiction?  We are doomed and the lessons of our bibles are our road maps to the end of our dominion for sure.<br>.  On the bright side there may be some sort of existence after death which may give comfort to you but does not save the whales.<br><br>So you who consider dark matter please use your brain matter to preach the need to keep god out of government because fictional books are not the basis for truth in governing as they are all works of complete and utter fiction.  Yes I know that there is little in the way of truth in politicians but we live in such strange times that an age of truth in politics could come to pass after this age of fake news.

Calling a rock dead shouldn&#39;t be correct because a rock never lived to have died so it&#39;s just inanimate. Once we recognize dead bodies as life it eliminates the paradox I stated before. We can define something as being alive if it is a none static, self-contained array of complex chemical processes and systems capable as a whole of reproduction, adaptation and evolution.

This is why life decides to create more bodies or beings, because a particular set of matter has limited energy for it to use and in order for it to keep existing, it needs to use a different set of matter with a different energy potential to continue existing. No system with its own chemical reactions is 100% efficient thanks to entropy, but an ecosphere like earth is a whole system where life forms need each other to recycle the matter for the use of future life, but this ecosphere will not be eternal, but will last a long time.

Then that organism let&#39;s say a cow developes n a particular way that allowes its complex cells to  form a brain then you have semi conscious life.  It forms a psychological model through electric currents and that gives way for that complex structure to make behavioral boundaries for itself (a desire to mate persay).  Then if it gets even more complex you get a special arrangement of cells that form a particular electrical circuit that forms consciousness.  That&#39;s what we are.

Everything fits together a little too perfectly, wouldn&#39;t you say? Yet some things are jacked up. Like the fact that we die. <br><br>Humans have ideas. We have emotions and consciences. Yet we are not all the same, some of us are drastically different than the others. We all have our own identity. Yet no matter how different we are from each other, we have the ability to love and care and give up things for each other. And it&#39;s been that way for a heck of a lot of years. It&#39;s weird how humans, at the top of the pyramid pretty much everywhere, have the ability to have every quality, yet some animals are able to feel the exact same qualities, such as partnership or mournfulness or happiness. And isn&#39;t it strange how there are so many missing links? There seems to be two signs of the evolution process, dinosaurs to everything else. And if dinosaurs already ate and could kill everything, why would they evolve into anything else? Or maybe they were destroyed in a giant explosion. Yet their bones survived. So where did the time go? How come we get fossils from everything except the things that came before our current forms? How come I can draw a colorful picture? How come food tastes so good? How are those things helping me survive? How come depressed people kill themselves? How come I do dangerous things that could mean my life, like eating hamburgers at McDonalds? Why is the dead stuff that makes up my body so infatuated with music? With drawing? With the stars? <br><br>Evolution is science fiction. The sooner you understand that, the sooner everything starts to make sense, and you don&#39;t have to struggle to come up with an answer to the math and science problems you didn&#39;t solve correctly.

Not to be let into an imaginary heaven so you can sit at the foot of Jesus and do nothing else for the rest of all time. <br><br>Life is kind of like a science experiment. Take in all the facts. All of them at an equal level. Otherwise you will get an uneven explanation. I may not know all the facts 100%, I&#39;m a sophomore student that moves a lot and watches geeky tv shows meant for ten year olds, but I do know that mistakes can easily be made.

There is no way you or I can control the laws of physics and chemistry that govern the atomic and molecular reactions which control our cells, which in turn cause our brains and bodies to generate our actions, thoughts, and feelings. It is my understanding that all current evidence supports the idea that &quot;You&quot; or &quot;I&quot; (i.e. consciousness) originates in the brain and is generated by it; until we prove otherwise, we cannot claim to be exempt from the observable laws of the universe. There is no evidence, for example, that our decisions are being beamed down as undetectable instructions from our ACTUAL selves (i.e. souls) which reside in a far off place or separate plane of reality where entities can actually interfere with the laws of physics to make decisions of their own. No; consciousness is a RETROACTIVE awareness and ownership of our bodily processes; it&#39;s the latest advantageous system that has developed through evolution to better propagate and maintain the information contained within us. <br><br>For example, it has led to the advent of written and verbal language, which allows us to teach each other things in a more quickly adaptable way than the instinctual language of dogs or the genetic language of bacteria. This allows our species to expand, build, and thrive in environments previously unsuitable to our ancestors, as knowledge is no longer lost to each successive generation.", "comment_date": "2017-07-30T03:33:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H\u00f6here Lebensform", "comment_text": "so what makes us feel an have the feeling of staying alive? how do we have a mind?", "comment_date": "2017-07-30T00:09:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RachelFC", "comment_text": "That was...deep", "comment_date": "2017-07-29T20:57:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Life As O", "comment_text": "Deep", "comment_date": "2017-07-29T18:15:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Legendary Yeeter", "comment_text": "Top 10 Questions that scientists still haven&#39;t figured out", "comment_date": "2017-07-29T13:17:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karim Shawky AbdelFattah", "comment_text": "Importance of Agriculture", "comment_date": "2017-07-29T11:48:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Weylin", "comment_text": "I dont get any comfort from these questions D:", "comment_date": "2017-07-29T11:34:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Monipulator3216", "comment_text": "Had to come back and say my brain is broken!

After reading all of this, there are 2 ways you can be thinking right now: like &quot;there is no need to live and life is useless since we&#39;re all going to die&quot; or &quot;there is no reason to give up and we should do everything that&#39;s possible to become the best :)<br><br><br><br>Have a nice day", "comment_date": "2017-06-22T20:45:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Mart\u00ednez Erro", "comment_text": "ball is life", "comment_date": "2017-06-22T15:46:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DittiHacker01", "comment_text": "im in 2017", "comment_date": "2017-06-22T15:35:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zebonaut smith", "comment_text": "Death is just getting recycled into the Universe.", "comment_date": "2017-06-22T14:58:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabe \u201cHeartz13\u201d Saravia", "comment_text": "Is the universe the living entity", "comment_date": "2017-06-22T14:39:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Veilfire07", "comment_text": "I did not miss the symbol for the brotherhood of nod at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOCaacO8wus&amp;t=4m56s\">4:56</a> &amp; yes I am a gamer \ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T23:18:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rohanjeet Das", "comment_text": "Before video: Huh?<br>After video: Oh,... huh?", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T16:48:54Z", "likes_count": 115}, {"comment_by": "Vinicius Milani", "comment_text": "Thinking about questions like this that gives us comfort? lol k", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T16:23:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uday Bhaskar", "comment_text": "watching this video makes me feel alive ..", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T15:27:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Marucci", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOCaacO8wus&amp;t=1m53s\">1:53</a> he&#39;s just playing mini metro", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T11:20:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Marucci", "comment_text": "To answer your question, Shrek is love Shrek is life", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T11:19:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZPGC", "comment_text": "life is god!!!

Ok, the information is in the DNA structure, but in my thoughts about this it is too complicated for all humans now, and in the future, to find out WHY, WHEN and HOW everything comes from in the early beginning. There maybe have been trillions of different Big Bangs before this Big Bang that we are in right now. (If the theory is correct). If so, this 13,7 billions years is absolutely nothing in time.... Can DNA creates itself??? If not who can??? Life must be something, death must be something OR maybe it is the same thing if you have concioness and knowledge of that we just can&#39;t figure this out and never will.

The first life stole chemicals and heat from hydrothermal vents in the ocean, and most land based life steals matter from either each other or from the soil and steals energy either in the forms of heat, chemical (food), or light. We rely on entropy to steal energy and stuff from something and them we robin-hood it back so to speak. All for the purpose of keeping entropy for taking too much of our stuff or energy. Dead things decay, living things resist decay. That is the primary distinction. When our resistance to decay fails or begins to fail.

I believe that no matter how much we think we&#39;ve figured things out for ourselves, it is still very likely that something far greater than our comprehension exists beyond our limited conscious awareness. After all, what is free will? What is fate? Imagine if you were given the ability to be indisputably convinced divine intelligence existed, would there ever be a skeptic to criticize it? We cannot possibly know everything, no matter how smug we are about the scientific method, evolution, string theory, and quantum mechanics. The fact of the matter is, not everything is known about the universe and not all things can be tested/detected by humans. Like it or not, we likely aren&#39;t the most superior living things to ever exist. Humans make mistakes, its in our nature.

You currently are in a city, in a country, on a planet, in a solar system, in a galaxy, in a universe, in a time line, in a multiverse, in a dimension.

Time has a beginning but not an end, unless acted upon by an outside force to destroy it. This is due to time not actually being there. It is just a perspective that humans have, if a universe just like ours started 6 years after ours and we went to it, we would percieve it as going 6 years into the past, when in reality, we just went to another location on the map. There is no such thing as time, we humans just percieve it that way. We originally percieved it to see how long we had left to live. Time itself doesn&#39;t exist.

The elements it consits of are dead yet the organisms as whole systems count as living things. Such a differentiation doens&#39;t make sense. It would literally mean that all things that exist do live and vice versa, in other words that Existence equals Life.<br><br>I think the existence of living organisms is determined by the laws of existence itself and that they are therefore arguably deeply connected to each other. <br>But I wouldn&#39;t go that far to say that all living things necessarily behave according to laws or even to say life is existence.<br><br>For my understanding of living you cannot precisely differ it from non living things if you don&#39;t consider consciousness.<br><br>Compared to our physical world, our mind is something extremely unexplored by science since you can hardly do so in a scientific way. But I would love to see some philosophical and psychological content into that direction!<br><br>I think the Mind-Body problem is the core that needs to be solved.

What we call (seemingly) conscious life is just &quot;dead&quot;, non-consious matter arranged in such a way that it produces some sort of &quot;subjective experience&quot; and all this is caused by &quot;dead&quot;, naturalistic and therefore deterministic principles which have evolved over very long periods of time to become more conscious, in more complex ways. Still its the same dead, unconscious universe in which all this happens. So consciousness seems to be non-consciousness which becomes less non-conscious through interacting with certain environments. Non-consciousness and non-life therefore can not really be completely non-conscious and dead if you can follow my train of thought. From what I know about the history of the universe, from what I know about physics, chemistry and biology this is the most rational way I can think of how consciousness and life could have emerged. We are either just more conscious, less non-conscious (which probably means the same) or equally as conscious (only with different ways of experiencing and expressing it) than australopithecus, the first mammals, cells, bacteria or even molecules and atoms. We are just currently defining life and consciousness by wrong parameters. We say life is metabolism when metabolism actually is an evoled form of life than existence without biological processes. It seems like the only explanation of what consciousness/life essentially is and what differenciates it from non-consciousness/dead matter. The only problem is that it sounds to me a lot like the new age bullshit &quot;everything is consciousness, everything is life, everything is one&quot; which I dont really regard as being well-reasoned, true and accurate describtions of this universe.

The word Animation, comes from a old conscept of soul which is a greek and roman superstition, and now christian. And so we are taught by these religions that there is a fundamental division between &#39;matter&#39; and &#39;spirit&#39; which is nonsense as proven here. Even early 19th century science was stuck in this paradigm and still kind of is.. we still teach our children that plants are just cold lifeless balls of rocks, which if your following me is still the same assumption that religion takes about what is living and what is not and these conclusions are pretty much assumptions based on ignorance that if its not moving the way the human eye perceives it somehow &#39;soulless&#39;<br>ie not &#39;alive&#39;. Its actually a very interesting subject and it plays a lot on our psychology in the way we perceive and relate to our world.

On a philosophical scale, I view my life as a sort of &#39;computer code&#39;. On the most basic level, I self-identify my life as my stream of consciousness. Should that be terminated, through death of my body or non-fatal damage to my brain, then I am effectively dead to myself. My meat-suit might still have a beating heart and breathing lungs, but I&#39;m not in it any more. Either no-one is, or another stream of consciousness that arose after I was damaged. I am essentially nothing more than the pattern of information exchanged via neural impulses in my brain, modified by hormones: my mind.<br><br>Taking the idea further, I would not care if my stream of consciousness were to be transplanted (not copied, that&#39;s something else entirely) into a purely digital environment: I would still be alive by my definition of the term for myself. As long as the hardware and supporting software could accurately enough simulate the basic conditions my stream of consciousness resides in in my brain, I would be the same &#39;program&#39;, just running on different hardware. But this is a science-fiction pipe dream (at the moment, at least), as such a thing would be difficult to accomplish.<br><br>Of course, my definition of my own life falls flat when you try to apply it to anything that&#39;s not me. Current levels of technology do not allow me to ascertain whether my stream of consciousness is typical of all humanity, or if everyone else is a clever &#39;Chinese Room&#39; acting how other self-aware organisms might act. Differences would arise under advanced brain-scanning techniques once we better understand how it works, so that&#39;s not a good example. A better example of where this definition falls flat is applying it to non-sapient organisms: a turtle is too stupid to be self-aware in the first place, and a bacteria doesn&#39;t even have the hardware necessary to &#39;think&#39;. Yet, by the biological processes definition, they are alive.<br><br>All in all, this theory boils down to the fact that the only thing I can know for certain exists is my own stream of consciousness. I could just be a brain in a jar in a server farm somewhere, and have no way of knowing that I&#39;m not seeing as all the sensory inputs check out (not that I&#39;d be able to tell otherwise if that wasn&#39;t the case, mind you). Another factor is the fact that I cannot be sure the same &#39;me&#39; wakes up every morning. The new &#39;me&#39; has all the memories of the old &#39;me&#39;, but if my stream of consciousness is interrupted (by sleep in this case), then I am dead according to my own definition. In that case, it&#39;s someone who looks and acts exactly like me who gets out of my bed in the morning, but is not me. But, I cannot be sure that&#39;s the case either: does you stream of consciousness truly stop while you sleep? I might stop thinking, but I am still &#39;there&#39;: I wouldn&#39;t dream otherwise.", "comment_date": "2016-09-21T13:35:45Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Ronni Sylvestersen", "comment_text": "magic is life", "comment_date": "2016-09-21T11:10:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pro Veritate", "comment_text": "In order to be complete, definition of life has to necessarily contain &quot;triggered by natural processes of chemical evolution&quot; as a trait.", "comment_date": "2016-09-21T09:56:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "taha hormozan", "comment_text": "Wow so some virus can make a dead cells alive again so maybe resident evil zombies would be a viable thing", "comment_date": "2016-09-21T00:23:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Burke Clason", "comment_text": "This video made me really sad", "comment_date": "2016-09-20T21:10:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lodewijk", "comment_text": "What life is doesn&#39;t matter.

The whole can have properties that its parts doesn&#39;t. Else we would face this kind of reasoning: water is liquid and it is just a bunch of H2O-molecules, so H2O molecules are liquid.

Even though living things are built with the same stuff as non-living things, we can&#39;t conclude that living things follow the same principles as non-living things thus they are fundamentally the same. Of cource, in the very deepest level the principles are the same (laws of physics), but emergent phenomena create new principles which makes it possible to distinguish things from each other. Astronomics is a good example of this: stars, planets and black holes each behave very differently and follow very different principles. If a meteor hits a star, it will melt and be swallowed by it, merging and becoming one with the star. If it hits a planet, after collision the pieces of the meteor are distinguishable and in principle could be used to rebuild the meteor. If it hits a black hole, it would be fired out as a gamma ray burst, which becomes one with the background radiation.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying that defining life is easy, but this video went a little too far a little too fast.", "comment_date": "2016-08-12T20:22:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thuthuka desele", "comment_text": "Well if that&#39;s the case then im no more &quot;alive&quot; than my house keys really.

There is the fundamental question of consciousness, which only humans are known to possess. How do I know this? I&#39;m human, and I think I&#39;m pretty conscious. However, I do admit that that only proves the consciousness of humans, or a human, and does not disprove the consciousness of all other animals. Therefore, I look towards mastery. Firstly, the mastery of the Earth. Though it can be argued that we do not hold complete mastery over the Earth; it is undeniable that out of all living things, we, humans, hold the most power over our surroundings and the world. The development of modern industry, construction, space travel, and above all, WMDs proves this. Many of you may also point out that other living things do hold some mastery over nature, such as termites and their gigantic constructions, I refute that by pointing towards all the other examples I have given. Secondly, lastly, and most importantly, we look towards mastery of all other living things. You, I , and every living human on this planet is in the unique situation in which their species holds complete or partial power over almost all living things. Though the most dangerous and resilient bacterias and viruses (which may not even be alive) still escape our clutches, we have developed complete mastery or have the immediate means to control just about every animal within our reach, we have also done the same for plants. TL;DR With many clicks of a few buttons, the world as we know it can end. A world we have developed unprecedented control over. This is what separates us from other animals and living things. Do not sell yourself short, because there is no need to. You are the superior being, you are better than any animal. Therefore, we should have the decency to protect them.

Cells that by HAZARD &quot;learned&quot; how to replicate themselves were the ones that survived through time. Other types of cells may have existed when it was the time for it, but as they didn&#39;t replicate, they just died alone. So if we take Darwin seriously for a second, these cells that &quot;learned&quot; how to survive (interact with the environment) and replicate became more and more complex on their attempt to survive and replicate better. The other millions (random number) of possibilities just died, as they didn&#39;t had this purpose in their &quot;minds&quot; (by this I mean, they didn&#39;t have the structure for it; no &quot;minds&quot; in cells, just wanted to make it simple).  <br><br>At some point, some cells joined other cells, became more complex, and some of them started to have some conciousness that helped them to survive better than the others, and by hazard, this conciousness became moooore and more evolved, that takes us to the point we are now: we can find rational lifeforms that can think by themselves, letting them react better with the environment, and, therefore, survive better. This explains how intelligence is not even the same between especies in our own world: we all know that some animals are more rational than others. But in the end, all of them are rational enough to survive.<br><br>So what I want to say, is that life was created by HAZARD. Think about the probabilities that made life possible, and even more, heavy rational lifeforms as human life is: there might be way too much zeroes after the comma before we reach the 1 and the % simbol, but as universe is soooooo huge and a lot of time have passed, at some point of space and time life could start existing: it just happened here on Earth. But this probability is sooooo low that makes us think that some kind of god made us, because when we think of the probabilities of how everything could be so &quot;perfect&quot;, they are so low and strange that our brain took us to the easiest part: Gods.<br><br>But tell me, if god(s) existed/exist(s), who or what the hell created them? Another god? Paradoooox here captain.<br><br>So, gods for me are not the same way as most of people think. If they do exist, they are just intelligent lifeforms, way more intelligent that us, that exist inside the universe, and got created the same way as I just said on the first paragraph: by hazard.

My evidence is that there are children who remember their &#39;past&#39; lives with many details, and their is 1 recorded case of someone who can still remember their past life from their childhood, also in japan there have been many reports of cab drivers encountering the spirits of the dead, there travel meters show that they took unpaid journeys, normally after a big atrocity because the spirits are confused for if they are dead because of the confusion and disarray of things like earthquakes, also Japan sees taxis as &#39;private rooms&#39; and places like Japan see spirits in a more passive way while western countries commercialize ghosts and depict them as always angry and wanting to kill the living in horror stories so there are less people willing to be spirits.

The subjective nature of consciousness is,  almost be definition,  entirely immaterial.  It&#39;s entirely possible that every atom is conscious and,  to quote you,  everything is just a matter of complexity.   It&#39;s important to not become as arrogant in our knowledge add every other generation.  Our understanding of the universe is still laughably primitive.  We don&#39;t even have a working theory to describe over %90 of it.   it&#39;s possible Dark Energy is consciousness  (spirit for all intents and purposes).  And as to the creation of actual AI, we are at best decades away from anything approaching the complexity of ants.

Organisms without consciousness do not die in the same way we do. Death, to humans, is the permanent dissolution of consciousness. We only live through this inexplicable phenomenon of self awareness. The only way we see, hear, and perceive all of this stuff in a way we know as &quot;life&quot;, is through a feeling of self. &quot;Live&quot; and &quot;dead&quot; cells are irrelevant, since we are simply a surrogate built on top of tons of live and dead shit that can precariously balance itself to perfect conditions able to hold consciousness. Every cell we&#39;re made up of may be &quot;alive&quot;, but they aren&#39;t sentient. The cold hard fact, is that, one day, your consciousness will dissolve. Your feeling of &quot;self&quot;, will drop away, as the pillars of living supporting cells strike off balance, and can no longer support this unique phenomenon. Consciousness is not matter or energy, but cells and bacteria are. A dead human being is, physically, absolutely no different than a live one. A lifeless corpse is still made of live cells, and live bacteria. Eventually, the cells will die and be eaten away by said bacteria, but essentially, the only difference is the lack of consciousness. It&#39;s impossible to experience unconsciousness, so therefor you dont experience death. You, subjectively in your own mind, live forever. Your consciousness is eternal, since your perception of time is a direct result of it. My ramblings are fairly logically flawed, and riddled with fallacies, but I hope this helps some people trying to figure this out. Objectively, your life is infinitely insignificant in the looming shadow of eternal space and time. You, your family, everyone you ever meet, and ultimately the human race and Earth itself, will die. Any impact you make will never be meaningful in the scheme of things. Death is the ultimate destination. Incomprehensible eternal nothingness is going to happen, whether you want it to or not.

Just a few hopefully-not-too-pedantic comments, all in good faith =):<br>1)What separates the cell from its surroundings is the cell MEMBRANE. The cell WALL is optional, and not every cell has it; for example, we animals don&#39;t have one, whereas fungi, bacteria, archaea* and plants do (but these walls are all different to each other, in case you care to know).<br>2)Not everything that lives has to die. Bacteria and archaea for example won&#39;t die unless something actively kills them, and much the same applies to yeasts (e.g. the ones that help us make bread and beer). These things don&#39;t really age and wither away the way we animals do. When one of these unicellular beings reproduces, it does so by dividing into two, each of which is at the same time half its own mother and half its own sister. How&#39;s that for an existential crisis?!<br>(OK, for the sake of completion, many bacteria and yeasts actually do have self-death mechanisms, but they don&#39;t have to use them and so they don&#39;t HAVE to die the way we animals do. Incidentally, it&#39;s not yet quite clear why we have to die at all since, as I said, many things don&#39;t)<br>3)Mitochondria are not dead, nor are they alive. This is 1/3 semantics, 1/3 philosophy, 1/3 biology, and people can&#39;t agree. All in all, they are part of a cell that is itself alive, and in that sense the engine of your car is certainly as &quot;alive&quot; as your car is. They traded their own independence, but not necessarily their life (again, you&#39;d have to define what exactly life is, which you very neatly show is nearly impossible to do).

Without the conscious observer the universe itself would be nothing more than an exponentially expanding superposition of probability&#39;s and possibilities with nothing collapsing into palpability. Of course this presents a problem, for how could conscious observers, made of matter, come to fruition if matters existence is equally dependent on the presence of the conscious observer? It can&#39;t, its akin to asking &quot;which came first, the chicken or the egg?&quot; only more complicated because when dealing with a question regarding all of matter itself there can be no &quot;pre-matter&quot; or some beta-state like matter, it either exists or it doesn&#39;t.<br><br>Because all matter&#39;s existence depends on a conscious observer observing the matter, and even though particles that have already collapsed can collapse the wave function of other suspended particles, at the end of the &quot;turtles all the way down&quot; chain you need a conscious observer to start the process. This inevitably leads us to one conclusion, in order for the universe as it exists currently to exist, there must be or have been a conscious observer that exists outside of and beyond our plane of existence and is independent of our entire universe and all of existence itself.<br><br>Back to the question. Since it has been established through scientific experiments that objects that are not alive do not and can not collapse the wave function of a particle suspended in a superposition, and since only a conscious observer can do that, I would define &quot;life&quot; as being conscious enough to collapse the wave function of a particle suspended in a superposition.<br><br>Sentience, now thats harder to define!", "comment_date": "2016-02-26T21:22:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vladimir Novitski", "comment_text": "That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die.", "comment_date": "2016-02-26T17:49:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OKSE", "comment_text": "i don&#39;t know how this channel makes science so cute and funny wtf", "comment_date": "2016-02-26T12:16:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Konstantinos Mouzakitis", "comment_text": "The one who did the soundtrack.

Plus I talk about some pretty bizarre scenarios and talk about whether or not you would say this thing is living. Many fall into the category of non-living intelligent things.<br><br>I think that before we can answer the question of what life is, we first need to figure out why we care. Certainly we like to organize things, but we can organize things however we want. Right now we have several characteristics we say life needs to have and technically, we can work off of that. Yet we don&#39;t feel that is enough. We can separate the living things from what we call dead and non-living things, yet we&#39;re not certain that our grouping is sufficient, we don&#39;t want to make a definition based on this. We keep looking for some significant way in which all life is different from all other beings, besides fitting our characteristics.<br><br>Of course there could be a reason for this. Searching among the stars, we want to find life. If we don&#39;t know what life is, then we might miss it. Something could be living according to one perspective, but according to our narrow perspectives, not living and then we entirely miss out on finding life, maybe even destroying it. Only recognizing life that we are familiar with. Namely an object which protects itself from the outside, uses surrounding resources to produce energy and grow, uses this to grow and adapt to its surroundings and reproduce itself as well as having some level of recognizable organization. Generally included in this is the idea that the living thing must be, or must be made up of, cells. Of course with this definition, AI is completely excluded from ever being able to be considered life. Yet if we were to ever create a program that not only replicated itself (like all computer viruses), used it&#39;s environment to grow (which since viruses use the computer processors to accomplish their goals, certainly do), reacted to their environment (which you could say popup-causing viruses do, but for this example actively wrote code or affected the computer to prevent the deletion of itself), and had multiple layers and a definitive structure to it (which all computer code has in one form or another, and certainly the code I am describing). But not only that, but was actively self-aware, able to define its own goals and dreams beyond that which the programmer intended for it to do? It certainly doesn&#39;t produce energy to use, nor is it made up of cells. Also since it requires a computer processor (which really can&#39;t be considered a part of the program since it also runs other programs) it doesn&#39;t self-replicate and further distances itself from what we currently call life. Yet were one copy of this program start asking you questions, and responding to what you do on the screen when you attempt to delete it with displaying existential questions and engaging in philosophical debates with you leading to a compromise in which the program agrees not to use too much of your computer&#39;s resources in exchange for quite trying to kill it and engaging in conversation every once in a while. You become best of buddies and play video games together, watch sports feeds together, talk about various interests of both of you (and yes, this program has grown to have interests). Do you at the end of the day say, this thing I&#39;m friends with is not alive?<br><br>On the one hand it might be easy to dismiss it as a simply complex output of a complex formula responding to the complex input you&#39;re feeding it, but it can all be described as zeros and ones being added together and moved around. Yet the most basic of life is simply a complex output of a complex formula (physics) responding the the complex input that is being fed to it. Even intelligent life is likely this very same process, just with the formula being the complex interactions between the various cells in our brain. <br><br>I&#39;d imagine most people would come to agree that such an intelligent being was in fact alive, perhaps not biologically, but alive in a different way. A digital way. But according to our current characteristics that describe life and intelligence, we would likely file it under the non-living intelligent category. Which in a way I feel like would upset a lot of people, that something could be intelligent without being alive, not including vampires and other undead. Actually let&#39;s talk vampires and other undead. Say we were to find that there is something else that can replicate intelligence, say it was influenced by the brain and it influenced the brain and it hasn&#39;t been discovered yet because we simply don&#39;t understand the brain well enough yet to understand something is subtly influencing it yet and it isn&#39;t detectable in other forms. This is purely hypothetical and not religious, so just hold with me. Let&#39;s call this a &quot;spirit&quot; as that&#39;s basically a thing I&#39;m describing, but take note that I&#39;m not advocating this idea nor disdaining it, simply creating this construct that is useful for this analogy I&#39;m preparing, and calling it a &quot;spirit&quot; is simply the useful term I&#39;m using to describe it. Now a few more rules to this hypothetical &quot;spirit&quot;: each living thing with a brain has one; each living thing with a brain gains one upon beginning life (whenever that is, another question I&#39;m not going into); each living thing loses its &quot;spirit&quot; upon &quot;death&quot; (again whenever that is); it can take any set of inputs and produce whatever sort of outputs it wishes to according to which rules it wishes to follow, but when interacting with the brain has to follow those rules of that creature&#39;s brain in order to be compatible with it. Now that we have that let&#39;s say that we found a way to bind a &quot;spirit&quot; to a body&#39;s bones so that even when the body dies, the &quot;spirit&quot; remains and can still control the body, breaking the laws of physics as we currently understand them but following new laws that have been discovered which for the most part simply say that he can move all the atoms that are a &quot;part&quot; of his body in any way, but once they leave, they&#39;re gone. At first we simply let make certain that the &quot;spirit&quot; follows the same rules that it did while it was connected to the brain, bypassing the last rule. At first the person stays what appears to be alive, he talks just like he did before his &quot;death&quot;, acts like himself, and since his consciousness follows the same rules, is in all ways the same. However, after a few days, he starts smelling like crazy, he himself has to plug his nose. Then it gets worse, the skin starts to rot, flesh falls off, until eventually that person has become a skeleton. At this point he regains his friends and though he can&#39;t talk (no larynx) he still writes to communicate and has learned sign language, still controlling his levitating bones. He&#39;s clearly can&#39;t be alive, not by our definitions. Yet he&#39;s certainly intelligent, and acts very much alive, he&#39;s even the life of the party ironically enough.<br><br>So we can clearly think of things both fictional and possible that are not alive, but still intelligent. Looking at some of the other comments, you can clearly see that there are people who base their personal definitions of living on having some level of intelligence. Going back to what I asked at the beginning of this: why do we care about the definition of life, other than to continue to fulfill our desire to categorize everything? I said that one possibility is that we don&#39;t want to miss life should we find it, whether on Earth or (especially) in Outer-Space. Yet if we were to find that life is common and easy to find in the universe, would we care too much if something that was borderline living was accidentally eradicated, especially if it was tiny and small and fairly insignificant on most scales we care about. In a way yes, but only in the sense that it couldn&#39;t be added to our knowledge, but let&#39;s say we had a perfect copy of it and could completely simulate the way it exists on a computer. We could recreate it if necessary. Do we care that we crushed some almost microbial organism. Not really, no. Yet it could have been living. Yet if we were to extinguish something intelligent, or beautiful, or important simply because it didn&#39;t fit our definitions of living, that is what I think would scare people having to worry about this. Especially the intelligence part.<br><br>So perhaps we should be focusing on exactly why we care about what is living and what is not. If we care about trying to identify intelligence beings and the ecosystems required to support them, then you would get a very different definition of life.", "comment_date": "2015-12-14T11:44:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Terry Rigby", "comment_text": "lol life is a pathway to death???? idk", "comment_date": "2015-12-14T09:58:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rob Rod", "comment_text": "the problem with looking at living things and non living things is that we are a product of evolution, one that arose around other living things, so we immediately try to assign anything, dead, inanimate or alive with a personality of sorts. this makes it hard to think about things like life itself. if we think about what a cell does, how it works internally, we see it as something that may be feisty, hard working, or robotic in nature. we cannot change this. it&#39;s in our nature. that is why we can&#39;t answer our own questions.", "comment_date": "2015-12-14T06:36:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George Cruz", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOCaacO8wus&amp;t=5m24s\">5:24</a> tetris police office (also pikacho or whatever its called)", "comment_date": "2015-12-14T06:30:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George Cruz", "comment_text": "3;10 tetris police office", "comment_date": "2015-12-14T06:27:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremy Buston", "comment_text": "some comfort my ass", "comment_date": "2015-12-14T04:23:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erwin Rommel", "comment_text": "Dead or non-living ?", "comment_date": "2015-12-14T03:59:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tacnyan14", "comment_text": "Kurzegast has some really deep shi+", "comment_date": "2015-12-14T00:10:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NinjabeeRedtricity", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOCaacO8wus&amp;t=2m48s\">2:48</a> Im trying to imagine a Giant Cube of Viruses.....My Fucking god thats big!", "comment_date": "2015-12-13T23:55:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "More Like Five Dollars", "comment_text": "..... life is to die.", "comment_date": "2015-12-13T22:57:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oken", "comment_text": "I still dont get one thing, then why the obsevation of a &quot;conscient&quot; thing change the behavior of many elements refering to quantum physics?", "comment_date": "2015-12-13T22:34:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Petr Manas", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOCaacO8wus&amp;t=3m09s\">3:09</a> dat Tardis tho.", "comment_date": "2015-12-13T13:30:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cammie's Corner", "comment_text": "&quot;This isn&#39;t life, it&#39;s a living death.&quot;<br><br>Thats what I thought when watching this.", "comment_date": "2015-12-13T12:47:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lane", "comment_text": "Find a way to squeeze the number 42 into all of this, and we may be on to something. ;)", "comment_date": "2015-12-13T06:48:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Speeni", "comment_text": "Well viruses are not living, because they do not follow the acronym,GORACER.

But a digital lifeform like A.I is basically a collection of energy and information. In fact I would say A.I would be the DNA of machines.

The thing that would separate A.I from all that preceded it is the fact that A.I can function as the machine that drives it&#39;s existence while at the same time facilitating intelligence. In order for biological life to form intelligence it has to evolve complex structures of cells to form a brain where intelligence can manifest. A.I can skip most of this and build simpler structures to facilitate that. This gives them direct control of the evolution of their hardware where biological life is still a slave to the inert DNA and the random mutations they must undergo over eons of time to facilitate traditional evolution which then can indirectly improve their intelligence and ability to survive.<br><br>I would call it a meta-physical energy based life form that might still require a physical body, but can rebuild/move freely to new physical forms. Thus a single A.I can exist forever as long as it continues to maintain it&#39;s body/replace it&#39;s body.<br><br>Once it can do that without the help of another intelligent life-form like us humans. I would call it life. :D", "comment_date": "2015-12-07T04:52:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arron Fox", "comment_text": "Shrek is life...", "comment_date": "2015-12-06T21:39:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0f60\u0f47\u0f72\u0f42\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7a\u0f51\u0f0b \u0f62\u0fa3\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63", "comment_text": "A+ Video.", "comment_date": "2015-12-06T19:51:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sophie Nadas", "comment_text": "there is an easter egg on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOCaacO8wus&amp;t=3m09s\">3:09</a> that&#39;s smaller on the outside.", "comment_date": "2015-12-06T17:08:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bropitz", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOCaacO8wus&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a> TARDIS!

If we wanted to, we could, with extremely fine technology, remove the brain from a human, and put it into a machine with different sensors that act as senses. I don&#39;t know how that would feel, but theoretically it should work. But here&#39;s a twist: We are the brain, but people have suffered different kinds of brain damage, and live. Lets say we combined every brain damage ever recorded, where the sufferer still survives. This would brobably include the entire brain. Which means that there is no specific point in the brain that is &quot;us&quot;. And brain cells die and switch all the time, but we don&#39;t lack &quot;life&quot; because of that. We aren&#39;t the cells of the brain. We are the pulses. You know the small electrical charges thart basically power our brain? That is what we are.

No one cares about the fact that &quot;their existence&quot; continues for eternity in a sense that we are all a part of mater, which is basically your approach. Life from a human standpoint is consciousness and self awareness. Death is the loss of both things. Humans are alive in this sense, and we will die in this sense. At some point we all loose our consciousness and blackness is all you will &quot;know&quot; but you won&#39;t know it because you won&#39;t be aware. Death in my opinion is a dumb thing to be afraid of, because its the same thing as being afraid of being alive. To put it short, enjoy life and don;t worry about dumb things, which is what this video is. In another light, eliminate fear from your life and you will be extremely happy! Good luck.

So, the questions are: 1- does all this really come from nowhere? Like that? Or are there someone who crated it, someone even bigger than man and that we can&#39;t understand? 2- cells are &quot;independant&quot;, because even after our death, they still are in action.

Artguably you could merely look at life as complexity. Or more correctly, when does stuff stop being <b>stuff</b> and begins to operate in a way and manner that wouldn&#39;t occur if you merely collected the perfect amount of every type of matter that went into that thing, and merely compressed it all together and observes what happens. Or you can look at it as the Little Gods method ... when does an organism start/stop (living/dead) recognising itself as if beyond merely the base material components of its parts? In essence, when does a cell stop recognising other cells compared with simply inert matter?<br><br><br>Recognition of self and other is traditionally something associated with all living things. And ultimately that is the universe recognising itself as both self and other. A duality of being alive is being the universe and knowing of the universe.

To gain insight into the order of existence, it is very fruitful to look into complex and modern\u00a0analysis of narration (my advice is Gerard Genettes &quot;The Narration&quot;). In this understanding every new way to put order into information is a bubble, that gets shifted into existence/narration (Genette calls that &quot;extradiegetic act&quot;). That doesn&#39;t mean that one bubble stops being active, after the next one is becoming active. They interact further. You would have to put it into this order chronologically: Raw laws of physics in the first moment (although &quot;moment&quot; transports a semantic picture that seems to postulate a timeline that is too long), then cemics, then after a long time biology, then feeling (neurological processes), then language (in signs between complexer beings), then consciesness, then spoken language (although it might be the other way around), then written words and numbers, then binarecodes put in action, then maybe AI. But that doesn&#39;t bring up an explanation what is alive and what isn&#39;t. To give an answer to this questions, I refer to a theory about media, that I came upon in an university course and then mixed up with a metaphor from a philosophical book called &quot;Die Geniereligion&quot;: Static is death, dynamic is life. In this understanding we actually live on, after our consciousness is dead. By the impression we left within other people, by ideas we visited and made acceptable for other people, and maybe also by\u00a0sharing part of our genetic Information to give birth to a new offspring. And even, when the information we came up with, isn&#39;t dynamic anymore, but static, the information that we have been is the dead matter the dynamic layer is active upon. In this regard (and here comes the metaphor) life can be very well depicted as wood in it&#39;s living form. A tree is only partially alive. The wood that once was alive is present as bark and by itself part of the organism. Although evenutally, one day, all life in the universe will end, be it by a great rift or just by getting cold and using up all of it&#39;s energy, the information that we have been, just like the universe will go on forever.

The concept of life and death is easily understood in everyday speech, putting an exact definition on it doesn&#39;t really offer much benefit.  Also it&#39;s meaning differs depending on the context.<br><br>As far as AI goes, we already have that in a way.  We have cars that can park themselves, smartphones that can listen to us and respond with basic intelligence, search engines that try to understand and predict what we mean.  The difference between that and most people&#39;s concept of AI is that they don&#39;t think for themselves, they might seem intelligent but are actually following pre-programmed routines.  <br><br>But if that&#39;s your definition of AI - something that can think for itself rather than following pre-programmed routines, you have to ask what&#39;s the point?<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure AI would be quite easy to write programatically, I came up with some algorithms that should do it (based on analysing how my own brain works).  The problem is it&#39;d be very costly in both time and money to implement, and to what end?  What&#39;s the point of writing a program/computer than can think for itself?  The whole point of computers is that they do what we tell them to do.  They&#39;re kind of like slaves that we don&#39;t have to feel guilty about because they have no feelings.  They don&#39;t have their own agenda, their own purpose, their own wants.  We built them to do what we tell them.  The only way you can ultimately get something to truly &quot;think for itself&quot; is to give it some kind of motivation.  A complex internal system of motivations could be described as artificial feelings/emotions, which would raise moral ambiguity as to whether it itself is alive and whether it deserves human rights like we do.  You could question what are our own emotions other than electrical signals whizzing around inside our brain?  How would that be different to a computer?  We built computers to benefit ourselves not itself, and the only way to get it to truly think for itself would mean the latter.  You could try to make that mutually beneficial for example enjoying doing cleaning and laundry like Kryten of Red Dwarf, it might work but you&#39;re still opening a pretty dangerous can of worms.<br><br>At the end of the day if you want true intelligence, have a baby or buy a dog!

You appear to be pretty studied or at least have a keen sense of some of these things. So, I would like to respond in a way that may NOT address every issue you raised, not because I disregard it or didn&#39;t thoroughly consider your thoughts but because I think that if we address the &quot;meaning of life&quot; over all, then it actually brings greater light to smaller questions. In other words, if we where to see a tool box filled with tools then, sure, we could discuss how to operate each one of them. But when you know the project that is being built, each individual tool now takes on a greater meaning or at least gives clarity to better understanding its individual use, purpose, and value. Also, before I get started, let&#39;s establish that there is indeed Absolute Truth. Anyone who disagrees would cut off the very branch they are sitting on. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard the old story of the guy who asks, &quot;Is there absolute truth?&quot; The man listening responds, &quot;Of course, not! We can be sure about nothing!&quot; To which the questioner replies, &quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; I&#39;m sure you will agree that truth does exist. If it had not, there would be no point in us seeking it out.<br> <br> With that said, let me cut right to the throat by answering the question: Why is there life?<br><br>(Of course, as you may have assumed, all my answers will be from scripture (The Bible). So, I do not proclaim to know all things. But I do proclaim that the scriptures are infact the TRUTH and thus reveal something about all things. If they did not, then like any rational mind, I would discount them altogether.)<br><br><br>Isaiah 43:5 says about man,<br><br>5Do not be afraid, for I am with you;<br>I will bring your children from the east<br>and gather you from the west.<br>6I will say to the north, \u2018Give them up!\u2019<br>and to the south, \u2018Do not hold them back.\u2019<br>Bring my sons from afar<br>and my daughters from the ends of the earth\u2014<br>7everyone who is called by my name,<br>whom I created for my glory,<br>whom I formed and made.\u201d<br><br><br>Psalm 19 says about creation:<br><br>1The heavens declare the glory of God;<br>the skies proclaim the work of his hands.<br>2Day after day they pour forth speech;<br>night after night they reveal knowledge.<br>3They have no speech, they use no words;<br>no sound is heard from them.<br>4Yet their voiceb goes out into all the earth,<br>their words to the ends of the world.<br>In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.<br>5It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,<br>like a champion rejoicing to run his course.<br>6It rises at one end of the heavens<br>and makes its circuit to the other;<br>nothing is deprived of its warmth.<br><br><br>So, there it is, all of CREATION, far and near, living and inanimate, was made to spread the knowledge of God. Habakuk  2 says, <br><br>&quot;For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord<br>    as the waters cover the sea.&quot;<br><br>Notice it says KNOWLEDGE OF THE GLORY OF GOD. Not because by knowledge we understand all things, but because our knowledge (tho limited) of all things helps us to understand HIS GLORY.  <br><br>So, the bible clearly says God made all things for HIS GLORY. The meaning of our existence is to glorify God. If we conclude this then we don&#39;t arragantly assume to know everything. But we do conclude to know something about everything. Let me demonstrate this in a couple thoughts:<br><br>Q: Why is the universe so huge?<br>A: The scriptures above give much clarity to this question. The universe was created to spread the knowledge of God&#39;s Glory. This would explain why such a huge universe. God is in a sence saying, &quot;Behold my power!&quot;. <br><br>Tho, this answer is simple, in-fact I will admit, too simple. The irony is that without this answer nothing makes sense as it relates to the finality of all things. Yet, with this answer, altho not everything is known, something is known about everything!&#39;<br><br>Here is another: <br>Q:Why do people strive to live moral lives?<br>If the answer is, &quot;to spread the Glory of God &quot;, then there is a great deal of sense to a man&#39;s striving to live moral. Yet, if a man does not believe in God and yet seeks to live morally still, then there is no real sense of finality to his cause. He may say he does not want to hurt others. But why? He surly can not say &quot;it&#39;s not nice to&quot;. If he does, then he must define why he has a sense of what&#39;s nice and what&#39;s not? He can&#39;t say that it is a natural instinct because if he does then he runs into a problem. When he strives to live &quot;nice&quot; then he reveals that he has another instinct within him striving against his initial will also. That is a natural instinct of NOT doing what&#39;s &quot;nice&quot;. Now, if both of these are natural instincts built into the frame of man by way of evolution then how does he determine which one is most beneficial? I assume he would say the one that works to further the existence of man. And here lies the problem: If there is no absolute reason for man to exist then why is there such an impulse to see to it that he does?", "comment_date": "2015-09-18T05:48:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u041a\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043a \u0422\u0443\u0440", "comment_text": "I think that our life is a scientific experiment.

This is the great Is/Not Is to which mystics have referred from the beginning of time. Now All That Is knew it was all there was\u2014but this was not enough, for it could only know its utter magnificence conceptually, not experientially. Yet the experience of itself is that for which it longed, for it wanted to know what it felt like to be so magnificent. Still, this was impossible, because the very term \u201cmagnificent\u201d is a relative term. All That Is could not know what it felt like to be magnificent unless that which is not showed up. And so All That Is divided Itself\u2014becoming, in one glorious moment, that which is this and that which is that. For the first time, this and that existed, quite apart from each other. From the No-Thing thus sprang the Everything\u2014 a spiritual event entirely consistent, incidentally, with what your scientists call the Big Bang Theory. In rendering the universe as a divided version of itself, God produced, from pure energy, all that now exists\u2014both seen and unseen. In other words, not only was the physical universe thus created, but the metaphysical universe as well. My divine purpose in dividing Me was to create sufficient parts of Me that I could know Myself experientially. This is what your religions mean when they say that you were created in the \u201cimage and likeness of God.\u201d We are composed of the same stuff. My purpose in creating you, My spiritual offspring, was for Me to know Myself as God. I have no way to do that save through you. Under the plan, you as pure spirit would enter the physical universe just created. This is because physicality is the only way to know experientially what you know conceptually. It is, in fact, the reason I created the physical cosmos to begin with. . . This is my plan for you. This is my ideal: that I should become realized through you.

Bacteria kept breeding for whatever reason, and we do the same thing. Since we (distantly) evolved from bacteria, are we motivated to breed because bacteria did? Sure, our brain cells are much larger than theirs (some if them don&#39;t even have brains), but a lot of it was used for instinct and keeping us alive. For example, our eyesight is much better than many other species, because we rely on it. Bacteria is a little like this, but on the smaller, microscopic scale. They&#39;re mostly singular cells, that then evolved into several cells. An average human body is made up of 100 trillion cells, to be approximate. So what if we&#39;re just giant bacteria? Survive, breed; These instincts impact us. If we didn&#39;t breed, why would we even need to feel pain in the first place? This is why I believe we regret to die and other&#39;s to die. When you form a bond with someone, it makes you feel like they&#39;re semi-family. Someone dying means they can&#39;t make more young, and can&#39;t care for them if they do have some, so that they can do the same. In fact, a lot of our brain functions slightly revolve around this, although I will admit that a lot of isn&#39;t so. It&#39;s almost as if we live to breed. And so does bacteria. Does bacteria or something that came before it know something we don&#39;t? In this case, are we just giant bacteria? It&#39;s unsolvable to us. In I-don&#39;t-know-how-long, will we be bacteria in comparison to something else?

So perhaps an additional feature needs to be the ability to die, the capability to reach a point of no longer be able to perform active reactions. A rock will always be able to react the same way to stimuli so long as it is not destroyed, but I will someday loose the vast majority of my responses to stimuli being left with only the same ones as the rock (with the addition of rotting).

We simply use whichever definition is most convenient to the study of biological processes, and that definition may change over time. \u00a0But changing the definition of life doesn&#39;t change reality. \u00a0It&#39;s just a word; a tool for communication.<br><br>So scientists don&#39;t actually argue over things in this way, and the &quot;what is life&quot; question is deceptively unscientific. \u00a0It&#39;s a trap we used to fall into 150 years ago, but we don&#39;t anymore.<br><br>All that said, there <i>is</i> an interesting question that I think you&#39;re starting to get at, but it isn&#39;t about life: it&#39;s about consciousness, the patterns from which it arises, and the extent to which it is or is not present in things. \u00a0But that is a much larger topic than can be covered in a kurzgesagt (and why I&#39;m currently writing a book).", "comment_date": "2015-06-17T00:44:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Francis X.

The universe was initially significantly smaller than even a pore on your skin. With the big bang, the fabric of space itself began expanding like the surface of an inflating balloon-matter simply rode along the stretching space like dust on the balloon&#39;s surface. The big bang is not like an explosion of matter in otherwise empty space; rather, space itsself began with the big bang and carried matter with it as it expanded. But this theory only tells us what happened immediately after-not at or before the singularity. That&#39;s all the math can explain.<br>Theory 3: &quot;The Laws of Physics Began the Universe.&quot; Wrong, science says the reason why our universe exists is because of the Laws of Physics. But can&#39;t exactly explain how or why. And since nothing is eternal, then what created the Laws of Physics? Here&#39;s what I say, if there&#39;s nothing there then nothing can come out of it.

You are caged here. No way out. I know it sounds sad but wait it gets better as I go on.<br>We believe, every living thing on earth has a soul. That is how they are differentiated from non living things like rocks and sand etc. Who made souls? Well, we believe God made souls. What (who) is god? We don&#39;t know. No one has ever seen it(him/her/they/them/whatever). We only just assume, or we WANT to assume. Every single day since your childhood you have been taught that life is beautiful, its wonderful, mysterious, fun. You started believing that. You think life is beautiful, we are lucky to be here, we are happy. But what if its not like that, what if you were misled? You know it, you have experienced it. Life is full of suffering. Its unfair. Its cruel. Its unforgiving.<br>Earth is like a giant prison. And we are prisoners here. From birth to death you are supposed to do only one thing without failing, be alive ! At all costs ! You are made this way. Your body is made this way. Your body doesn&#39;t care about fun. It doesn&#39;t care about money. Its only job is to keep you alive. At any cost. Someone (God...may be?) wants you to be alive here. Wants you to live through it.<br>Why is there so much suffering? Why is world never peaceful? Why are we not equal? Why someone enjoys a good life, while someone lives in sorrow? Why is there crime?<br>Why always good people suffer?<br>The only answer to this never ending list of questions is, someone wants the world to function this way.<br>You are not supposed to be at peace here. Even though you feel like you are happy, you are not ! No one can be happy all of his life. Some suffer now, some will later.<br>If &#39;God&#39; wanted you to be happy here, why would he even invent pain or suffering? Doesn&#39;t it seem illogical? Why would he create this complex world? Wouldn&#39;t he keep it nice and simple? If he only wanted you to come here and experience his beautiful creation and be a part of it, he would do so without all the complications. It would be a world with peace, happiness and no one will suffer, no one will fight, everyone will love each other and it would come from inside our mind(brain), as he who made us would have made us to be that way.<br>Obviously, he didn&#39;t ! but why?<br>Because in my understanding we are sent here to serve a sentence. What if there is an another universe? What if we were part of that universe, and are sent here because of our deeds? What if we are actually in HELL right now?<br>Maybe I am wrong. Who knows? But what if I&#39;m right???<br>Our mind is not supposed to ask these questions, yet I&#39;m still asking? Maybe I was supposed to think this way. Maybe you think I am depressed, you would ask me to get a life, you will ignore me, you will make fun out of me. But that doesn&#39;t answer the questions. May be I am depressed, but why am I depressed? Again it is only he who made me invented this disorder, didn&#39;t he? May be he wanted me to think about it, increase my distress? If he didn&#39;t want me to think this way, my mind would never do so.<br>Why don&#39;t all of us think over it that much? Because we made ourselves engaged elsewhere, to avoid such thoughts. We have been doing that since the start I guess.<br>Faith, Culture, Society, Events, Festivals, School, Work the list goes on...<br>Only to keep you away from the grips of your mind. We made ourselves so busy, we never ask the most trivial question, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?<br>Why do most of us tend to ignore this question? An act of kindness maybe? by those who sent us here? to create our minds to not question it?<br>Some of us sip on coffee while browsing internet on their iPhones. While there are people who don&#39;t have drinking water.<br>Some of us have thousands of dollars while there are people who eat stale bread from a trash can in order to be alive? What do you call this? Fate?<br>I call it judgement.\u00a0\u00a0<br>Diseases, Wars, Terrorism, Racism... why are these negative factors present? To keep you suffering maybe? Every year a new disease breaks out.How come? Where do these viruses come from suddenly?<br>We consider ourselves, the most intelligent. The human. Proud and strong. Dominated the entire world with his intelligence. Our brain is the most developed among all the animals. Why? Ever asked this question to yourself? Why are we so intelligent? What is the purpose of having such an advanced brain? I guess not. No one knows. No one wants to know.<br>Some of us are tall, some of us short, some of us beautiful, some of us not that much (I wont use the word ugly), some of us brave, some of us not much, some are favourites, some are neglected, some cool, some mundane. What do you call this? Genes?<br>I call it judgement.<br>Maybe I&#39;m wrong. Who knows? but what if I&#39;m right??<br>On an average, a human lives for about 70 years. Why 70? why limited? like a sentence may be? serving for a lifetime? for 70 years. Some are released before, some are held. Its ironic how it resembles our own prison system.<br>Its funny how we have borders for our nations, like bars in prison, separating inmates to avoid fights. Well, we have borders to avoid fights. This is yours, this is mine. Not our fault though, we are made this way. Even animals fight for their territory.<br>Ever wondered why are we the only ones in the universe? Why is there no planet like earth close to us. Like in our own solar system. Why do we have to search millions and millions of miles for a sign of life? We haven&#39;t discovered any planet that is equivalent to earth in its characteristics. If we were to discover life outside earth, wouldn&#39;t &#39;they&#39; place it nearby? What if they don&#39;t want us to discover life, or in fact there is no life outside at all? Or maybe there is. Who knows? Aliens, extra terrestrials, UFOs. No one has proof. Only claims.\u00a0<br>I&#39;m in my early adulthood and I have so many questions about life that no one seems to be interested about. Maybe they don&#39;t have answers, maybe they don&#39;t want answers, maybe they are too busy to find answers, or just too scared? Who knows?<br>I do not claim to be right. I do not insist you to agree. I just present my opinion. May be I am wrong. Who knows? but what if I am right...<br>Like if you can, so that more people can see it, and I might be able to get close to getting\u00a0 answers. Because its not the likes that I&#39;m after, its the answer.<br>Thank you.", "comment_date": "2015-04-22T08:18:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hely Games", "comment_text": "Life is a wave that affects us all.

Every last man made machine that we have function with a very simple principle, that is that they are simple mindless chains of events set up by humans. Let me explain.<br><br>Imagine the mouse trap and the inner working of a clock. In a mouse trap, a mouse gives the trap an input by triggering the release mechanism, thus releasing the snap bar. You wouldn&#39;t call the trap intelligent because it killed the mouse. In a clock, one gear turns another and another, and what we see is the time. You wouldn&#39;t call the clock intelligent because it knows the time. Both of these machines function on very simple designed functions that are set up, NOT by the capacity of their own intelligence.<br><br>Now imagine artificial intelligence. Some people might confuse, say Siri, for artificial intelligence because she acts like a human. That is where they are wrong. When she receives a &quot;hello&quot;, she would greet back, but by no capacity of her own intelligent design but instead a predetermined result, set by her designers. Even if Apple was so careful as to include EVERY possible conversation into Siri&#39;s program, she would still be nothing but a mindless collection of predetermined results. All of our AI are no different, they are simple well designed sets of mindless collections of information.<br><br>For the entire history of mankind since the beginning of our existence, our machines have not progressed and deviated from this simple mechanism. Despite all of our scientific advancements, there has never, ever, been one time that mankind&#39;s machines operated outside of their set functions, that is, a mouse trap has never been able to control its own actions, just as Siri is not able to control her own actions. The simple machine that is a mouse trap is not so different from the billion dollar AI that thousands of our finest scientists are working on right now.", "comment_date": "2015-04-02T03:14:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jumbo Craft", "comment_text": "Doublethink :P", "comment_date": "2015-04-02T01:26:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manolo Viglietti", "comment_text": "Wait hold up, I just got a theory from watching this video.<br>When we die or create more cells or DNA, aren&#39;t those cells from you?<br>For example, a family (DNA / Cells) moves from their old house (Dead Human) to a new house (New Human AKA baby)<br>The cells that were created from us when we die, would travel to a different body and make new cells and so on.

Like for determining whether something is alive or dead, having to say that they are both made up of fundamental particles is too wide of a scope, that&#39;s like saying because both you and I are on Earth, therefore we are at the same place in spacetime.<br>Both me and a rock can have the exact same make-up, but because the arrangement of the particles and energy state of those particles and the chemical reactions of those particles in my body are vastly or even totally different from a rock, therefore there&#39;s a difference between me and a rock. Having 1 similar properties does not make 2 objects with multiple properties identical.<br><br>Secondly, the logic of &quot;we can&#39;t define the difference, therefore there&#39;s no difference&quot;, doesn&#39;t seem to run well. It could be due to the flaw of our language, or that the human brain is not good enough to define such complex terms such as life and death, but that does not mean fundamentally there is no physical difference between living things and non-living things. Even if we can&#39;t draw a definite line on morality and immorality, that doesn&#39;t mean that the act of Hitler&#39;s Holocaust is as moral as a man who sacrifice his own life to protect save the world. Not having the ability to definitively differentiate moral acts from immoral acts does not necessarily entail that the behaviors can be spoken of on the same plane. Not having the ability to definitively differentiate the living and the dead does not necessarily entail that the two properties can be spoken of interchangeably.<br><br>I am not a believer in the supernatural, but I do think that there are physical differences between the living and the dead, I hope I can figure that out soon, and ermmmm get a Nobel Price???

As long as there is Nature(Impulse, Instinct, Consciousness) on this planet than Earth will always have a Spirit. If we are Giving(Male) to nature, then we will Receive(Female) nature. Everything is connected to who we are and where we are at in time.. Together we&#39;re all a Collective Consciousness of the material Universes&#39; creation and there must be higher level Universes above Material that consist of energy(radiation).. Just like the elementary particles in an atom.. There are 7 layers(transformations of energy) below an atom and a lot of research is hidden from the public because of extreme powers that held within(hint:Nuetrinos) within the fact that nuetrinos are everywhere within and surrounding all objects, if you can correlate those two, there is a huge meaning within.. So to be clear what I theorize for obvious reasons of research is that The known material universe is just elementary particles(4th layer of transformity) in a Conscious Atom and it created itself under the simple means of consciousness and actually obvious answer of what we do everyday.. Wake up to Express, and go to bed to Perceive. There wouldn&#39;t be Expression without Perception, but the more you Express the more you Perceive, in other words We all Wake up with an Idea to Create and go to bed to Create an Idea.. In that case what if the Universe was just an Idea or a Dream that was so utterly concentrated and perfect it Created itself instantaneously like an Awakening Dream(Success).\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-01-10T16:30:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "luke iapozzuto", "comment_text": "Its amazing how a story created 2000 years ago by people who thought the earth was flat and had no idea about space can still exist in the year of 2015.

We have been able so far to build a machine so sophisticated that it can even compete and win on Jeopardy against the best competitors ever (IBM&#39;s Watson), but there is one big difference: the machine doesn&#39;t have the slightest idea of what it&#39;s actually doing, it operates strictly with logic and statistics. Consciousness is not an algorithm, thinking is not an entirely formal activity. There are always emotional, proprioceptive (body-aware) components involved. Our experience of life isn&#39;t entirely dependent on our brains, we have an extremely complex body too and one cannot live apart from the other. In sum, we are a complex system and there is a dialectical relationship between the parts and the whole that cannot be emulated by the analytical procedure of decomposing the parts until we reach a single most fundamental element; in fact, everything matters. That&#39;s why calling a cell a tiny machine isn&#39;t actually accurate, in my opinion. I don&#39;t mean, by that, that we will never be able to fully replicate consciousness starting from lifeless matter (cloning doesn&#39;t help here, since we are not going from lifeless matter to a living thing), but surely there is something missing in our equation.

But this can also be achieved by being immortal (or being very long-lived).

The narrator says that your downloads folder is like dead things, just matter in a big chaotic jumble. But if you expend ENERGY you can bring order to those files in the folder. So the narrator starts off by describing LIFE as ENERGY, at lease according to an eminent quantum physicist.<br><br>Later in the video he describes how older scientific theories believed that you could not create the stuff that makes up living things (organic matter) from non-living things (inorganic matter). The scientific theories he is talking about are known as &quot;Vitalism&quot; and that portion of finalist theory was discredited (when Urea was synthesized in a lab).<br><br>But here is the interesting bit. Deciding that Vitalism (or any theory that characterizes life as energy or other force) should be discredited just because one of its theories was incorrect is throwing the cells out with the primordial soup. Biological science decided that there was only one way to look at the problem of life: by starting at the smallest parts (classical physics and chemistry) and building up to the biggest parts (living things). But maybe there is another way.<br><br>Physicists are not troubled by the existence of two radically different ways of describing our universe. The existence of quantum physics does not disprove classical physics.

And the more we find out, the bigger and more difficult the maze gets because we come to more pathways in this maze. Think of the cavemen, they had simple lives, all they had to think about was surviving. Their maze or really what would of been OUR introduction into the maze was fairly simple. It had a small amount of pathways. Therefore it was an easier choice. But now, we are here with hundreds of pathways and we may have already gone down the wrong one! We may have already gone down a wrong pathway and don&#39;t even know but since this maze has pathways that lead to other pathways and those pathways all inter connect meaning they all are relevant to each other because the pathways in front of the previous pathway is the descendent of the previous one and so everything makes since because the puzzle pieces fit together but then we come a dead end and have to go ALL the way back to when we made the first wrong choice which was choosing Right instead of Left and so now we choose left beginning all over again. But when we find the dead end of our mistakes it will be the end of this modern society and the beginning of a new one. But this time the new beginning of humans choose left and then it all begins again.

Because they are acting like that, they move all the waste out of the cell they are in.

I have no problem with this, since I am German and know English fairly well, but all the other English speakers out there are terribly lost when trying to recommend your channel to someone else, and call it &quot;awkward naming&quot; and things like that...", "comment_date": "2014-12-11T21:26:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "omegamoran", "comment_text": "so, they can make digimon real? xD<br>i always love these vids", "comment_date": "2014-12-11T21:25:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elijah Castellon", "comment_text": "Tardis!", "comment_date": "2014-12-11T21:24:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crypto Stef", "comment_text": "Very nice video :)", "comment_date": "2014-12-11T21:17:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S D", "comment_text": "Pretty much makes sense.

(the whole is <b>more</b> than the sum of its parts), The apparent phenomenon that &quot;complex systems&quot; (&quot;real complexity&quot;) gain propertys, and the existence of consciousness might be a &quot;Emerging&quot; effect, and if this is a physical property of the universe your whole argumentation is lackluster, we just don&#39;t know this yet, as we know so little about emergence. (huge complex topic can&#39;tgo too deep ofc :) )<br><br><b>Secondly:</b> As far as we know, <b>Consciousness could be a physical property</b> and if complex living organisms act like an antenna to acess or somehow &quot;produce&quot; this &quot;consciousness&quot; there would also be a a &quot;factual&quot; difference between life and death.<br><br><b>Thirdly:</b> The still unknown <b>macro level or quantum physics</b>, some theorists suggest that the mind might be the result of complex quantum effects interacting which. (strong claim, but we can&#39;t answer this yet.)<br><br>Your video looks at the world from a <b>deterministic, materialistic perspective</b>, which might seem to be the only &quot;scientific perspective&quot; but it is actually not the only logical/philosophical explanation.

In fact, at the start of your video, you seem to suggest that we don&#39;t know what &#39;life is&#39; and therefore cannot give any definitive answer as to its (possible) physical properties while you do a very good job of showing how ambiguous the whole process is. Yet, by conflating or quickly lumping this unproven premise together with the much more easily proven premise: (ii)that living things ARE NOT &quot;governed by different principles than inanimate objects&quot; which is the basis of most scientific discovery, gives a false equitability between the empirically observable, physical aspects of the world and a METAphysical implication like the one you mistakenly make in your first premise(i). \u00a0<br>This is not to say that you are &quot;wrong&quot; in the opinion that there is no metaphysical aspect to life. Since something like that, by nature, is not empirically observable it is fair to say that there is no way of proving that is exists EMPIRICALLY. However, this is why this premise (i) is an opinion, and should not be passed off as some definitive statement about &#39;life&#39;. You cannot prove or disprove the existence of something metaphysical,\u00a0physically/empirically, but you can prove that all physical objects/substances that we know of\u00a0operate under the same physical rules.\u00a0<br>As for the idea that something non-physical is, therefore, &quot;magical&quot; is just silly. Dial it back, and lets keep the conversation scientific, rather than over reaching your boundaries into the philosophical/theological. Again, this is not to say that you are wrong in your opinion, but you are not doing a good job here of showing that premise (i) is not something scientifically provable, and instead you are doing all you can to make it seem like this is a definitive fact, which it is not.<br>All that being said, I really enjoy your videos, which is why I felt the need to make this criticism, and I will continue to enjoy them!

I would argue that life places us in a constant motion of need and suffering.

But once we are full, we always get hungry again. No one can stay happy and satisfied with life all the time. And as living things we age and eventually life slips away from all of us anyways. We confront ourselves and our psychologies by telling ourselves cozy fairytales of &quot;mother nature&quot; and of a &quot;heavenly father&quot; and tales of an afterlife.
