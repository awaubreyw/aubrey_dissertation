This is the region to the northeast of Turkey and west of asia. Leaving it out is imho a big oversight because of just how important Chechnya (and to a lesser extent Dagestan and Akbhazia) have been in the context of global jihad.<br><br>Many Arabs fought in Chechnya during the 1990s as part of Ibn Al-Khattab&#39;s force. In the 1980s a significant part of the anti Soviet forces were Chechen (this would also become relevant later in the 1990s when all those Chechens returned home). In fact Vladimir Putin essentially came to power due to the Chechen wars,  which in the eyes of Russians proved Yeltsin as weak and Putin as &quot;strong&quot;, ignoring the vile war crimes both Yeltsin and Putin committed in Chechnya (around 1/3rd of Chechens were killed, gravely injured or were forced out, that&#39;s a higher proportion than Syria).<br><br>With the second Chechen war (1999-2009) the IIB (Islamic International Brigade) became a much more significant force in the North Caucasus, this would lead to many Arabs fighting in Chechnya and building contacts with Chechens. When the USA invaded Iraq these Arabs then asked these Chechens for help and thousands came. Chechens were the best of the Mujahiden in Iraq, both Iraqi and American sources agree on this. Fallujah had a particularly high nunber of Chechens, part of the reason the city was so bloody.<br><br>The large number of Chechen Mujahedin leaving Chechnya for the middle east drained the Chechen struggle of manpower. By the 2010s the Chechen insurgency was dying out and mostly could only perform minor attacks occasionally. However the Chechen wars had enabled Putin to consolidate power, being an extremely important factor in why modern Russian government policy looks the way it does today.", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T20:23:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DAHABOO - \u062f\u0647\u0628\u0648\u0648", "comment_text": "Thank you Americans ,pls we don\u2019t want anymore of your \u201c\u201dfreedom \u201c\u201dand \u201c\u201dpeace \u201c\u201d", "comment_date": "2022-05-13T20:28:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trenbolone-q8", "comment_text": "not true isis was not made by saudi arabia its a game from the usa to show ppl sunni are bad they fear the sunna because they fight back unlike shia\ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2022-05-13T09:40:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S\u00e6mundur Sveinsson", "comment_text": ".", "comment_date": "2022-05-08T15:09:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ahmet y\u0131ld\u0131z", "comment_text": "Imagine no war and focusing to science.

He didn&#39;t use chemical weapons. The mainstream media are nothing but bloody monsters who work for money and say the most inhumane things about anyone who opposes their leaders. Soon he will emerge victorious with his people&#39;s support and you&#39;ll see the truth. You say you don&#39;t get your information from mainstream media but I can clearly see that it wasn&#39;t the case earlier. And btw the US didn&#39;t invade iraq for its relations with terrorism but just to destroy the region! I don&#39;t want you to address that in a video but just know it.

The Kurds fought alongside the American soldiers to defeat ISIS, after the war against ISIS was over, the Iraqi government called Iranian and Turkish forces into Iraq to attack the Kurdish forces so they are forced to leave the areas where they regained control in fear of adding it to the Kurdistan region and asking for independence. Then, Donald Trump happened, and he withdrew the remaining American forces from the area, giving Turkey the green light to massacre Kurds in Rojava (west Kurdistan). <br><br>What&#39;s so important to know about Iraq is that the Kurds are ultimately stuck in a state where they are oppressed and don&#39;t belong. The Kurds have their own culture, language, and even their own religion, and they&#39;re one of the biggest ethnic groups still without a country. The Kurds want to establish a democratic and independent state and seperate from the rest of Iraq. (same thing is true for the Kurds in Iran, Turkey, and Syria) They even held a referendum in 2017, which was majorly opposed by the neighboring countries. Iran&#39;s president said in a public statement: &quot;we will not allow the creation of another Israel&quot;, (Israel being the most secular and democratic state in the Middle East.)<br><br>Big chunks of Turkey, Iran, and Syria were originally parts of a greater Kurdistan, and that&#39;s why they oppress the Kurds so much. So they do not ask for separation. Major steps have been taken by these countries to even cleanse their countries of Kurds, the most notables being banning the Kurdish language from being taught/spoken, genocides (such as the Halabja genocide committed by Saddam Hussein and the Ba&#39;thist intelligence), etc.", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T21:36:36Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Hage", "comment_text": "Iraq is destroyed becose Government and Iran", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T20:04:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mohamed hantera", "comment_text": "isis is us made <br>wars are us made", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T19:39:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mahdi A.

The US gets most of its oil domestically, it is not dependent on foreign oil (which was really code for &quot;ramp up domestic drilling). As for imports, according to the US Energy Information Administration, the countries it imports the most from is Canada (49%), Mexico (7%), Saudi Arabia (6%), Russia (6%), and Columbia (4%). And like this video says, it would be much cheaper to just import the oil. So no, the US did not invade Iraq for its oil. <br><br>So why did the US invade Iraq in 2003? Quite simply to regain American influence in the region. Saddam Hussein was pretty anti-American. Three years prior to the invasion, he switched the country from trading oil in US dollars to trading oil in their local currency. He and Saudi Arabia, a strong ally of the US, had terrible relations. Rumors of weapons of mass destruction (which were never found) were the excuse needed to invade the country and topple the government. Once the US finally left in 2011, it left in place the authoritarian federal Iraqi government. In effect, the US replaced one authoritarian government with a pro-American authoritarian government. Quite frankly, if Iraq is to ever become stable, it won&#39;t be because of the US. A pro-American dictatorship is a lot safer for US interests than a democracy for Iraqi citizens who have a negative view of the US. <br><br>It&#39;s important to be real about the motives behind the invasion. Saying it was about oil is a simple cop-out answer that does nothing to highlight the real answer. It was to regain influence over the region because the US sensed Iraq was becoming too independent. <br><br>Another one: some claim it was because Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons and was using them against citizens. It is true that he had chemical weapons, and he used them against the ethnic Kurdish population in northern Iraq. However, the Kurdish Genocide happened in 1989, and when the US invaded in 2003, the only chemical weapons they found were already decommissioned. If this was the motive for invasion, the time for that had long passed. The First Gulf War already happened in 1991, so if genocide was enough of a motive, that would be the time to depose Hussein. Ethnic cleansing and chemical weapons were definitely not a motive for the Bush administration.", "comment_date": "2020-07-22T02:06:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "A_SQUARE", "comment_text": "Dude so not show that flag i contains the name of our God and beloved prophet.

Now there are Iraqis who side with iran and others who side with the USA even though they don\u2019t seem able to handle it well it\u2019s still better than being a part of Iran which is an extremist religious country that we want no business with Iraq has the potential to become like a heaven it has everything a good country needs it can even become the best and most peaceful country in the middle east where not everything is about religion but it lacks power and a leader who doesn\u2019t base the country on religion", "comment_date": "2020-07-19T13:20:40Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Rand M", "comment_text": "I\u2019m Iraqi and it\u2019s 2020 and there are even more crises in Iraq now lol.", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T23:58:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Metadragon", "comment_text": "Pretty much every conflict in the world is partially caused by the UK.", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T20:23:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "FBI- \u0645\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0644\u064a", "comment_text": "Sunni and Shia is the same religion but Shia is wrong cuz they think that all profits r in different Positions in Islam like they think that Ali is better then Omar .", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T17:46:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A.

First you remove the Alawite radical Syrian regime while Russia was still weak and a remnant of the collapsed Soviet Union which would lead to the Sunni majority to take control of Damascus government then you remove Saddam regime which will lead the majority Shia to take control then you remove the Iranian regime after choking it by controlling all surrounding countries.

Fanatics of a certain ideological group don&#39;t kill people associated in the same group. They have killed thousands of Muslim adults and children. They are criminals and killers.<br>A final note: the reason for all this killing and all these wars is economic and enforced by politics .. I and every single person in the middle east wouldn&#39;t give a damn if his neighbour is Christian or Sunni or Shiaa simply because there is no minority oppression .. at least for these groups.<br>Look at the amount of investment .. all these weapons .. these are not made by simple citizens but by major powers who will get something if they won the war.", "comment_date": "2018-08-13T00:41:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ajmal dev", "comment_text": "must tell what usa did before 2003.", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T15:35:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uranija Zeus", "comment_text": "So many lies I&#39;m surprised video doesn&#39;t implode...", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T11:08:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K", "comment_text": "Sorry but Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t support isis", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T00:29:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Valero", "comment_text": "We have to nuke isis", "comment_date": "2018-08-10T14:32:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IcecreamProductions", "comment_text": "What about Amman?", "comment_date": "2018-08-10T13:19:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BayknCookr_", "comment_text": "i still wonder why ISIS fight to make an ISLAMIC state, because on the process they&#39;re clearly violating islamic rules.", "comment_date": "2018-08-09T11:03:21Z", "likes_count": 842}, {"comment_by": "Bue Nade", "comment_text": "Private central banks", "comment_date": "2018-08-09T03:19:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eiksei", "comment_text": "Lana.<br>Danger Zone :)", "comment_date": "2018-08-08T15:06:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Stationery Draw", "comment_text": "Did you know.

In my opinion anyone that has religious has never thought about is it really true or not or why there is no magic gid-like stuff anymore? Like reviving people or making a dragon with a stick. My father says never believe In something that you&#39;ve never seen, yet he believes in religious stuff. How are we so sure that there is another world after we die? Like heaven and hell, no one came back from the dead to admit it and yet people believe it. In Islam god says in quran (overall) don&#39;t be happy in this life, don&#39;t be rich, work very hard so you will go to heavens when you die. In bible it is kainda the opposite, you can drink wine and dance and be happy while they are haram in Islam, so seems like there is not only one god and bla boa bla. I know no one cares about what I&#39;m saying but when we finally find aliens everyone will understand that religions are not true since no god said there are aliens.

Not for the country the IS took, but to show the rest of the world that the islam isnt the cruel thing everyone thinks. Stand up for your believe or watch it die slowly, because that is what will happen. Islam will be hated more and more until somebody will say stop. And when it is an idiot with access to strong military power who hates the islam you will NEVER EVER get rid of the bad picture the islam has now. <br><br>Oh and PLEASE!! Dont take everything in the islamic books as taken. Dont use it as a strict rule book but as a guideline. Unless the majority of the islam doesnt change the strict view of their religion they will never reach the present.<br><br>Oh the last part can actually be applied to many other religions too, but you dont see so many christians (example) living their life so strictly.<br><br>I actually think that religion and politics should never be mixed", "comment_date": "2016-12-08T19:54:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmad Masoud", "comment_text": "I love how they excluded Palestine from the Muslim world :)", "comment_date": "2016-12-08T14:49:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aly", "comment_text": "War exists because there is always profit to be made, religion exists to take the blame.", "comment_date": "2016-12-08T08:23:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cana Kraut", "comment_text": "I keep seeing this &quot;The Islamic State isn&#39;t Islamic because they kill muslims&quot;.

US are not with Assad but claim they are with the people and world at large to fight  terrorist like ISIS. So you can see the victim is the people of Iraq and Syria. The people dont want Bashar or ISIS. They also do not want US and Russia enter their country.<br>US have tried to manipulate the oil price in order to make Russia suffer because Russia supply a lot to european countries but it seem to work at the beginning where Russia were losing from low price of oil. But Russia manage to live with it and still supply the oil. Then US try to cut which ever country that supply oil to Russia. So you see the victim like Libya, Iraq, Syria all fallen down to US. They try to make Iran suffer by imposing economic sanction but Russia veto it. US dont dare to attack Iran at the moment because Iran are quite strong compare to Libya or Iraq or Syria and are strong ally to Russia and China.<br>But US will continuously to be the leader and control the world by making the world wealth theirs. They wont stopped until the world stood to their feet. But it wont happen easily. The growing interest to deal and ally with China and Russia showing steady growth.

As for the people who say that ,,Everyone who believe in something else than us are EVIL! HURR-DURR!&quot; Here&#39;s a thing which was caused by such thinking: CRUSADES. Yes, medieval CRUSADES AGAINST PEOPLE who had different faith. Being atheist myself, if I lived during that period, I would&#39;ve been probably killed/ brought to christianity by torture and/or threats. Besides- I have respect towards the pope and his beliefs, but saying that christianity is a religion of love is hardly what really happenned in the past. Funny enough, many Islamic  people say that their religion is a religion of LOVE and PEACE, just as christians say even today. Not to mention that what christianity left behind (murdering, tortures etc.) now is a common thing among the Islamic radicals. I&#39;m not saying that all believing people are bad- I&#39;m just stating the fact that the ,,war against the unfaithful&quot; is nothing more and nothing less than a modern attempt of repeating the crusades.

Western coalitions were bombing Iraq and Syria for over 3 years and ISIS continued to grow... fast.<br>2. Western coalitions were flooding the region with weapons to so called &#39;moderate rebels&#39; since the start of the conflict. I often wonder if a conflict could have happened without all these foreign weapons. <br>3. Western media 2 years into the war starts to admit there aren&#39;t really any moderate rebels except for the FSA which were a few soldiers in an airbase in Turkey. Pentagon admits spending $500M and coming out with less than 100 rebel fighters after 3 years. Still they continue to flood weapons into the region despite admitting nearly all rebels are jihadists.<br>4. The oil in Iraq and Syria has been reported as funding ISIS since they rose to prominence, western media reports that cutting their funding is the best way to stop them. Turkey is implicated in buying this oil and having an open border with Syria for jihadists beyond any doubt and reported by media worldwide. Western coalition remains a big ally of Turkey despite this.<br>5. The only effective &#39;rebel&#39; ground force against ISIS up until this point has been the Syrian Kurds, which the US has been supplying weapons to. Turkey claims to be fighting ISIS yet has only hit the Kurdish peoples since they have thrown their lot into this mess. Western coalition maintains strong alliance with Turkey.<br>6. As a contrast to the western coalitions efforts, Russia starts bombing in Syria. Russia accused of bombing moderate rebels despite western media unanimously declaring there are no moderate rebels only weeks before this, yet for some reason Russian bombs have a hard time hitting anything other than moderate rebels (Where did they all come from all of a sudden?). 6 months after starting their campaign a ceasefire is called across Syria and major towns liberated from ISIS and back into the hands of the Syrian govt. forces.<br><br>So, a coalition consisting of 14 countries (US, Australia, France, Netherlands, Jordan, Morocco, UK, Belgium, Denmark, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey &amp; UAE) has been fighting ISIS for over 3 years and ISIS has only grown. The main line driven home by many politicians was that &quot;Assad must go&quot;, despite them having no answer for what replaces him in a country that was almost fully taken over by jihadists. They had no more rebels to support, jihadists were everywhere and threatening Europe and the US, yet still Assad had to go otherwise peace could never be achieved. (Also look at those countries in that list, almost a quarter of them have been accused of supporting extremists for the past couple of decades)<br><br>One country (Russia) starts to bomb ISIS and brings about a ceasefire and the liberation of many Syrian towns from ISIS in the space of 6 months. <br><br>Something doesn&#39;t add up right? Why couldn&#39;t the most advanced war force in the world stop these guys yet some second rate yesterdays news country sorts it out in record time? It seems to me we were okay supplying jihadists with weapons so long as they got rid of Bashar Assad and fighting terrorism was never really our objective. I can&#39;t understand any other reason why we were so pathetic in fighting ISIS other than the fact that we never had a ground force backing up our strikes. Well... The Syrian army was what Russia used, why didn&#39;t we use them to stamp out terrorism? We decided it was more important to get rid of Bashar Assad than it was to get rid of ISIS.<br><br>Even though we&#39;re supposed to be fighting ISIS, we actually made it. By invading Iraq, flooding the region with weapons and keeping the civil war going, allying ourselves to countries that support terrorism and letting them supply their jihadist proxies without any consequence, tolerating &#39;allies&#39; doing business with ISIS (i.e. Turkey), trying to let ISIS topple Assad rather than truly fighting them and letting our &#39;allies&#39; flood Syria via open border policies without any consequence to them (i.e. Turkey).", "comment_date": "2016-04-07T01:06:52Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "James Pitcher", "comment_text": "I appreciate how the narrator says that we need to some how break this cycle.

Another approximation is from a study done by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, which states that approximately 3.5 million people, 1.35 million of them children, are likely to experience homelessness in a given year (National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, 2007).[2] With 2007 as a benchmark, the data from the report showed a 6.8 percent decline in homelessness among individuals, a 3.7 percent decline of homeless families, a 13.1 percent decline of the unsheltered homeless population, and a 19.3 percent decline in persons experiencing chronic homelessness.[3]<br><br>One out of 50 children or 1.5 million children in America will be homeless each year.[4] In 2013 that number jumped to one out of 30 children, or 2.5 million.[5] There were an estimated 57,849 homeless veterans estimated in the United States during January 2013; or 12 percent of all homeless adults. Just under 8 percent of homeless U.S. veterans are female. Texas, California and Florida have the highest numbers of unaccompanied homeless youth under the age of 18; comprising 58% of the total homeless under 18 youth population [6]<br><br>Because of turnover in the homeless population, the total number of people who experience homelessness for at least a few nights during the course of a year is thought to be considerably higher than point-in-time counts. A 2000 study estimated the number of such people to be between 2.3 million and 3.5 million.[7][8] According to Amnesty International USA, vacant houses outnumber homeless people by five times.[9]", "comment_date": "2016-02-24T02:45:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johr Db", "comment_text": "why america come into picture whenever there is a chaos in any part of the world??<br>why they can&#39;t MIND THIER OWN country&#39;s problem where they have more than half of their population is home less.", "comment_date": "2016-02-24T02:45:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan Parr", "comment_text": "To all of the people saying they are scared of Isis, let me tell u this:<br> IT is PHYSICALLY impossible for Isis to win right now.

The US and <b>UK</b> invaded Iraq because the Anglo-American oil companies were after one of the largest oil reserves of easily accessible oil in the world. The neo-cons had been writing about invading Iraq for more than a decade expressly for that reason alone; with reference to the Majnoon filed in particular. American Theocracy by Kevin Phillips does a good job discussing this.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQPlREDW-Ro&amp;t=00m23s\">00:23</a> Also, false. The CIA had formulated a reconstruction plan for Iraq based upon the Marshall Plan. It was very comprehensive and was first formulated in the 1980s with periodic addendums. The Bush administration, instead, through out the Plan in favor of implementing a colonialist paradigm to destabilize the country and create an insurgency. Banning the Baathists, not pushing a pro-labor and women&#39;s rights agenda, abandoning secularism, omitting minority and citizen rights, whole sale selling out of any sense of checks and balance system - what was done in Japan, many said could not be done, but it was. Iraq had even more the circumstances for success but was undermined by the greed and corruption of the true masters of the West: big oil, the war industry, the hedge fund bankers, and wall street speculators. Iraq went to having one of the best educated nations in the region to one of the worst. Despite its richness in oil Iraq only provides it citizens with a few hours of energy per day and constantly has petrol shortages.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQPlREDW-Ro&amp;t=00m25s\">00:25</a> This is the typical formula of colonial policy. You take the oppressed population then put them in charge to guarantee loyalty to their colonial masters while marginalizing the former dominant population. It gives you the added bonus of internalize conflict that allows for the removal of resources to go mostly unchecked by a distracted populace that is divided and thus easily conquered. <br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQPlREDW-Ro&amp;t=2m40s\">2:40</a> Untrue. Anonymous, the hacktivist group traced ISIL recruitment accounts back to Saudi Arabia just a few weeks ago (December 2015). Also, Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Gulf states still are sending money to ISIS while violently suppressing the Shia minority in their own nations. In real terms the Gulf States have done nothing to stop ISIL. Saudi Arabia today spends more money on &quot;defense&quot; than Russia, yet it has taken in exactly <b>ZERO</b> Syrian refugees in a deliberate policy to create more instability in the region. None of this has been an accident by just incompetent policy.

When a nation resists the will of US corporations, or decides to sell in a currency other than the US petrodollar or refuses to sell to US friendly nations, then we invade. We replace the previous regime with a puppet government that will sell all infrastructure, oil and energy rights to US corporations. The banking elite grow.

The only people doing so are actually Western leaders in a desperate attempt to defend their Islamic allies (who might very well been supplying ISIS on the fight against Iran).

Happiness =/= approval rating</b><br>Do the American people have low approval of leadership? Of course, we almost always do. But the reasons we do not approve our leadership is because of matters that are so radically different than that of countries in the middle east. We argue about universal healthcare while countries like Iraq are struggling to even have medical equipment. Americans disagree on military spending, while Iraq&#39;s military is almost non existent. Do I disagree with a lot of action that the U.S. is taking? Of course, but I would rather live here in peace and freedom than in the Middle East where approval ratings mean absolutely nothing to oppressive regimes.<br><br><b>2. Are you seriously comparing NSA/SOPA to abuse by other governments?</b><br>The NSA, although something I am against, is no where near the level of intrusion that countless other governments take. Think about it, we are here arguing about whether our government can record just basic data about phone calls (which can only be accessed by a warrant sent to the phone company) while many Middle Eastern countries regularly go through unwarranted and violent searches and seizures, are regularly denied the rights to speak out and of press, and often do not have basic human rights.<br><br><b>3. Poor or low income in the U.S. =/= poor or low income in Iraq</b><br>You have to be an absolute moron if you believe that wages in both countries, and the standards surrounding them, are the same. 1/4th of Iraqis live on only a few dollars everyday. A minimum wage job in the United States could pay almost $60 in the same amount of time. <br><br>Then to top it all of you go into ad hominem attacks that have literally nothing to do with the content of what he was saying.

Not to mention the vast majority of these armies are not comprised of just your run of the mill innocent civilian fighting for freedom. The simple fact that al Qaeda immediately rose to fighting power in Iraq confirms the US belief that the region, and in fact Iraq itself, was teeming with foreign extremists. Iran and Iraq were not only ideologically aligned with extremists, they have sponsored, armed and supported them directly in the past and present. This whole Bush lied, sectarian domino effect is just a cute hippie go-to half ass explanation. In fact with a little basic logic it only serves to confirm the original authorization of military force in the first place. Think about it - no other war in which we were a belligerent did some sort of sectarian / civil unrest just erupt into a full scale decade long war across the region. Obviously they were already there.......obviously we and our allies had cause for concern... It wasn&#39;t just about &quot;WMD&#39;s&quot; (not just nukes, chemical and bio as well).

For example, it has restricted arms transfers to Myanmar, China, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in addition to countries subject to UN arms embargoes. However, it has supplied arms to other countries, for example Sri Lanka, Bahrain, Egypt and Yemen, where there is a substantial risk that they could be used to commit of facilitate serious human rights violations. Irresponsible transfersAs the main arms supplier to Egypt, the US authorized the sale of small arms, millions of rounds of ammunition and chemical agents for riot control, despite the security forces\u2019 violent crackdown on protesters. Yemen was also supplied with small arms, chemical agents and armoured vehicles, and Bahrain with small arms. It provides Colombia\u2019s security forces with arms, military aid and training, despite their persistent violations of human rights. Stance on the ATTSince October 2009, when the Obama administration reversed previous opposition to an ATT, US support has been crucial in getting to the current negotiation stage. The US has said it wants the treaty to raise the international standard for export control of armaments as close as possible to that of the US. However, the US position is weaker on human rights protection in the treaty than many of its allies. For example, US officials have not wanted to include obligations on states to prohibit transfers of arms even where there is credible evidence of their potential use for serious violations of human rights. US officials have also argued against including ammunition under the scope of the treaty, claiming it is too sensitive and would pose technical problems of implementation. Overall, US officials would prefer a short loose document that spells out general principles to \u201ctake into account\u201d rather than strong binding measures.", "comment_date": "2015-05-17T07:51:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OdinMMA", "comment_text": "The Western Coalition that invaded Iraq has a large amount of responsibility for the current disastrous situation in the Mid East.

Iraq and Iran(Shiite country) were in war. Iran called US for help, therefore they can share the sources of Iraq. US and their allies striked Iraq. the majority of the victims were civilians (you can look up for that in leaked Wikileaks). Lots of women and children have been killed by the world saviors. obviously you won&#39;t watch that in Fox news.<br>Saudi Arabia was the most country that suffered from Al-Qaeda in that time. how are they sponsor Al-Qaeda? Why Al-Qaeda was terrorizing in Saudi Arabia? Al-Qaeda members are people lost their mind after their women and children have been killed by the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. Then they blamed Saudi Arabia for being allies with the US and not support them against the US. ISIS is Al-Qaeda. ISIS is the name of the county they made. and the so called &quot;Iraqi military&quot; are actually Irani military actually.<br>Now what does that have to do with Syria? Syria government is controlled by Iran. After the so called &quot; Arab Spring&quot; the Syrian people (majority Sunni) decided to fight back the the suppressing of the government that controlled by Iran who hate Sunnies for political and religious reasons. Iran killed a lot of Syrian. Therefore the same thing happened. Syrians people after they suffered they made a separated military which called (Al-Jaish Al-Hor) which mean the Free Syrian Military (terrorists in the US terms). Now some of the Free Syrian Military joined the ISIS. and some of them refused. and the ISIS fought the rest of the Free Syrian Military.<br>The question that simple minded US civilian always come in their mind after they see their savior military save the world, Why the US don&#39;t eliminate ISIS?.<br>Simply, because there is no oil left there.<br><br>bottom line: If ISIS is evil, the US is waaay even more.", "comment_date": "2015-03-07T22:06:14Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "stephen connell", "comment_text": "ISIS are nothing but a footnote \u00a0and will be driven out by those who want a future not a an ocean of blood and the worlds biggest grave yard,", "comment_date": "2015-03-07T12:34:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "EkoMonster", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t lisin to him", "comment_date": "2015-03-05T22:51:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EkoMonster", "comment_text": "You dummy you said it wrone", "comment_date": "2015-03-05T22:51:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liam Daisley", "comment_text": "These are very well made videos.

When we read news reports that claim that the US government was, until this week, left in the dark concerning ISIS, we are reading analysis that is either from a fantastically uninformed source or from someone who simply invents fake news to suit their boss\u2019s political agendas. ISIS has been well known under a variety of names to even the most feeble Western intelligence organizations since at least May of 2004, when the group web-published video of their execution of US contractor Nick Berg. Even if the CIA wanted to hide the existence of ISIS, it could not have done so, as ISIS has never tried to be particularly secretive. On the contrary, they have always done their best to garner as much media attention as possible, and they have always been clear about their objectives.<br><br>So who is this group that seems to be surprising so many oblivious \u201creporters\u201d?<br>In the broadest terms, there are three main intransigent political groups in Iraq\u2014the Shia, the Sunnis, and the Kurds. The Shia Arab group is in power and is ruling with the same lack of skill that we would expect from any other Iraqi political coalition. The Shia block and their grossly incompetent and very corrupt Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have made little effort to protect the interests of the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq or the large Sunni minority scattered around Iraq.<br><br>The uprising in Syria was started by moderate Syrians in a desperate hope to find freedom. Iran quickly moved to help keep their obedient Assad servants in power. In response, Iran\u2019s Shia Hezbollah militia went on a campaign to consolidate their power in Lebanon and Syria. Sunni radicals of various stripes banded together under the ISIS brand to oppose Hezbollah in Syria and Lebanon. As a result, most of the Syrian moderates were swept aside or murdered. As more cash has flowed into ISIS pockets during the Syrian Civil War, the group\u2019s influence has grown. In the meantime, Maliki\u2019s government in Iraq has grown closer to Iran, while being propped up by US taxpayers.<br><br>Does your head hurt yet? It certainly should.<br><br>So why does the West care about one more war in the Land of Infinite Wars?<br><br>The collapse of the Iraqi Army is a frustrating embarrassment to the US government. Under the \u201cyou break it, you own it\u201d doctrine first stated by US Army General Colin Powell,* both the Obama and Bush administrations have invested heavily in trying to finance and train something that might look vaguely like a functioning government in Iraq. In exchange for our $50,000,000,000 post-war reconstruction extravaganza, which has been managed by a 5,000-strong diplomatic corps, we ended up with something even more chaotic and violent than our worst inner-city ghettos. We ended up with Iraq. So did the poor Iraqis that live there. Americans are a sentimental bunch, and many Americans hate to think that all that reconstruction money we sent to Iraq was a complete waste.<br><br>What will the impacts be?<br><br>My best guesses are as follows. Neither Iran nor the US will quietly accept a radical Sunni regime in Iraq. If ISIS becomes too powerful, even their Saudi, Kuwaiti, and Qatari backers will grow uncomfortable with their presence and will withhold funding. ISIS will never be able to achieve their dream of consolidating power over all of Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. They may be able to keep a hold over Sunni dominated areas of Iraq, but they will face a constant struggle to occupy what they have thus far captured.<br><br>On the economic front, oil companies will do what they have been doing for a hundred years. They will raise the price of oil beyond any real escalated costs of obtaining crude.<br><br>On the political front at home, loyal Republicans will pretend that Iraq was once a great place to live, and they will blame the current disaster on Obama. Loyal Democrats will pretend that Iraq was once a great place to live, and they will blame the current disaster on George Bush. Loyal Americans will likely notice that both administrations demanded far too little of the Iraqi government that we financed and propped up, while thousands of our military members died or suffered serious wounds.<br><br>And for the children of Iraq?

This video was made in the Western sphere, and as such, there is no surprise about this common disinformation.<br>What is disinformative in this video is the declaration that Bashar al-Assad started the Syrian civil war. Bashar al-Assad did not start the civil war in Syria. No one person started the Syrian civil war. In 2011, a series of massive protests led to some of the protestors being shot by government forces. This event eventually led to a media announcement by some defectors of the Syrian Army and others to start the &#39;Free Syrian Army&#39;. In the West, it was portrayed by\u00a0mainstream media that the &#39;Free\u00a0Syrian Army&#39; was heavily organized and moderate, and that the bulk of opposition to Assad was made up of &#39;moderates. In reality, however, the Free Syrian Army is hardly a unified structure, and the command structure and history of fighting\u00a0given on Western sources like Wikipedia is very superficial. There are many different groups who claim to be a member of the &#39;Free Syrian Army,&#39; many of whom are indeed\u00a0 adherents of some form of radical Islam upset by the secular rule in Syria, lack of Sharia law, and Alawites having a higher social status than others in the country. I&#39;ve seen many hours of war footage from Syria, and shouting &quot;Allah hu akbar!&quot; 20 times in a row compulsively whilst killing other people and blowing shit up does not indicate to me that a person is a &#39;moderate&#39;.<br>Second, there is an ulterior motive for Bashar al-Assad as being portrayed as the root of all evil in the West. Sure, Bashar al-Assad has done many evil things, but there is a specific reason for this portrayal in the West. I think it is logical to analyze the war in Syria as being one part of a neo-Cold War between the United States Military and Vladimir Putin and his gang. I&#39;m going to try to stay on topic here and not talk to much about the neo-Cold War, but just notice that the constant nature of Russia and NATO being at odds everywhere in the world proves this point. With this in mind, it is common knowledge that Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin are allies. Seeking to destroy an alliance between an enemy and their ally is a common strategy to increase a party&#39;s global power in the world. As such, this is why the State Department has sought funding for the Syrian rebels fully knowing that most of them are radicals, and why the mainstream media in the United States reports most of them to be &#39;moderates&#39;. It is also the reason why most people in the United States believe that Bashar al-Assad committed the chemical atrocity in 2013, despite the fact that Bashar al-Assad had everything to lose and nothing to gain from such an atrocity. Because it goes against my common sense that Bashar al-Assad would have ordered such a thing, I believe it to be the rebels who committed the chemical atrocity in order to gain Western support to further destabilize Syria, so that they may have a chance against Bashar al-Assad&#39;s army.<br>Now this double standard has finally blown up in the United States&#39; face. On the one hand, the majority of rebel fighters in Syria\u00a0are funded by the United States military, and at the same time they are portrayed as &#39;moderates&#39; and freedom fighters fighting against a discriminatory and evil\u00a0governance. However, since most of these fighters are Islamic extremists, a small sect of them have trickled into neighboring Iraq, and all of a sudden, this sect is portrayed now more accurately as terrorists, since the United States military wants to keep Iraq stable, and wants to keep Syria unstable and hostile towards Assad at the same time.", "comment_date": "2014-06-22T08:25:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "charlie johnson", "comment_text": "If anyone says &quot;nukem&quot; your just stupid ._.", "comment_date": "2014-06-22T07:53:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zalltime", "comment_text": "Really enjoyed your vid dude!! keep em comin!!! very informative", "comment_date": "2014-06-22T07:13:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mays", "comment_text": "The only thing I&#39;m wondering is....
