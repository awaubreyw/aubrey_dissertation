Yes, regulatory agencies have messed up and the organic label isn\u2019t as helpful, but what organic is supposed to mean is still better.

I know this because I keep a small chicken coop for 15 chickens. I have no illusions about usefulness, and I consider the measure of ethics controversial.

Fruits generally generate the minerals and vitamins early in there process, when its mature it just get larger with mostly more water.

Topic wasn&#39;t researched deep and wide enough. No talks about impacts of farming to soil&#39;s microbiology and person&#39;s gut microbiome. <br><br>Compost fertilizer is not the same as synthetic fertilizer. It is like saying injecting insulin into your body is the same as your body naturally producing it - both are the same chemically, right?! Wrong cause one is disease and dependent on constant outside input. Synthetic fertilizers totally decimate soil microbiology and year after year soil will become more &quot;dead&quot; and more dependent on synthetic fertilizers while with organic soil microbilogy suppose to get healthier and less dependent on fertilizer injections. <br><br>Impact of synthetic fertilizer on environment is really bad - no mention of chemical runoff to ground waters or rivers. Why do we have algae blooms which destroys marine life? Ask your friendly conventional farmer.<br><br>Synthetic pesticides are even worse. One word - glyphosate(Roundup) which is proven to destroy person&#39;s gut microbiome and linked to cause cancer. It is also possibly linked to bee hives and other pollinators dying off. Kurzgesagt makes great videos on immune system and complexity of gut biology but conveniently &quot;forgets&quot; impacts of synthetic pesticides. Neem oil, baking soda and soap don&#39;t kill people, glyphosate (Roundup) and other synthetic pesticides do due to efficacy and concentrations of poison. At least mention this issue and raise questions. Hmm...<br><br>And regarding nutritional facts: no way produce grown on organic soil with natural compost has the same nutritional density and diversity as produce raised conventionally. Tomato from super market will never taste the same as Organic tomato from your local farmer. If people can taste difference with taste buds then I am sure chemically they mist be different too.<br><br>One thing they got right - buy seasonal and local. Nothing beats that. Organic is far from perfect. But it is move in the right direction. Solar panels are not perfect either but many people understand we have to decrease dependency on carbon fuels and keep looking for alternatives. Conventional farming is not healthy for us or environment. We need to change our approach even if it is not going to be perfect path. More important is moving on the right direction. <br><br>Shame on Kurzgesagt for such shallow research on this subject compared to other well researched topics. If organic was &quot;not great&quot; they should&#39;ve suggested improved alternatives to organic farming like Permaculture ecosystems.

If bacteria or fungus can not get nutrition from a tomato they are trying to &#39;eat&#39;, then they&#39;ll just die off and that tomato will be just fine.  Consider how quickly a regular apple and a wax apple will rot.  Rot is just microorganisms eating something.  That&#39;s what the food industry is doing - they are converting something that has nutrients (and will rot quickly) to something that has no nutrients (and will not rot quickly).  My grandparents used to have a garden.  I remember the smell and taste of cucumbers, tomatoes, strawberries, etc. from childhood.  The stuff I buy at the store now LOOKS like the stuff from my childhood, but has a fraction of the taste, smell and flavor.

In that sense, conventional farming is in a losing battle, constantly amending the soil even though the productivity of the soil continues to decline and the surrounding ecosystem is adversely impacted.", "comment_date": "2021-06-25T14:56:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u041d\u0435\u041c\u0435\u0426\u043a\u0410\u044f \u041e\u0432\u0427\u0430\u0420\u043a\u0410", "comment_text": "Next video: Is our life good?", "comment_date": "2021-06-25T05:07:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jaideep Shekhar", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t be the only one who saw the reference to Snow White at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PmM6SUn7Es&amp;t=3m30s\">3:30</a>, right?", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T16:57:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Solared", "comment_text": "&quot;All natural doesnt mean nontoxic and you&#39;re slowly killing your children~\ud83c\udfb5&quot; -sorrow tv", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T02:49:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ateyah", "comment_text": "\u201cWhat you eat is much more important than how it\u2019s produced\u201d", "comment_date": "2021-06-23T07:57:47Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "Owen Mullaly", "comment_text": "Yooo it\u2019s food and stuff", "comment_date": "2021-06-22T23:06:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vijaya H", "comment_text": "Actually organic have more advantages...<br>Can&#39;t just say by watching this once...", "comment_date": "2021-06-22T09:31:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Laurenty Kalashnikov", "comment_text": "Organic food is not healthier , it&#39;s less dangerous .

As it stands today, when food comes from organic agriculture it doesn&#39;t mean much, regulations are pretty lax and conventional practices are still used, many &quot;organic&quot; farms are barely different from conventional and are able to ramp up the prices by just adding a worthless label that governments only created in order to tranquilise the rising amount of people who worry about their negative footprint on the planet.<br><br>However, true organic exploitations exist (and are increasing in number), that maximize the use of non-intrusive methods and do come with several benefits over conventional ones:<br>- Conventional farms impoverish the soil they are planted on, as many of these farms rely on monoculture to save in expenses (specialization is cheaper). Soils are ecosystems of their own, every plant species has different interactions with different kinds of soil and draws different nutrients from it in different amounts (outputs), while giving back different kinds of nutrients (inputs). Just as if a person eats the same food every day, the soil gets weakened by a lack of variety. Plant yields become fewer, so we add fertilizers, which in turn further change the chemistry of the soil. Eventually soils become sterile, and it&#39;s happening all over the world. As of now we don&#39;t know how to create new soil and soil regeneration takes a while, so we need to take care of it. Taking this on account, organic farms being bigger (which is actually not forcefully the case) but sustainable in the way the soil is treated (crop rotation, fallow, compost use) does not seem like a greater issue.<br>- Permaculture techniques (agricultural techniques based on the interactions between different species) are characteristic of (true) organic farming, and allow for different crops to be planted inside the same plot of land, reducing the need for pesticides and fertilizers, as some crop species benefit from being close to others. These farms also take advantage of certain hunter-prey relationships between plant parasites and other bugs, fungus, bacteria or other (biological pest control). Other types of mixed agriculture which reduce the need for land use include agroforestry (farming inside forested areas) and aquaponics (parallel crop and fish farming). In a near future, we should be able to create machinery that is able to work this type of farms. (e.g. Milpas are a traditional permaculture style from Mexico that grow maize, beans and squash; farm equipment builders could create a tractor that is able to plant and harvest these three at the same time, if this type of farming became more widespread) <br>- Organic farming can be done un urban areas, both near and inside the cities (rooftop gardening, vertical farming), while promoting local consumption and raising food awareness in urban areas (people are extremely dissociated from their food and its origin. Also food producers, as essential as they are to our society, are not shown enough recognition). This could not be done with conventional farming because of logistics and the fact conventional farming does utillize larger amounts of phytosanitary products.<br><br>In the end, most of the agricultural improvements should guide our production towards less use of space, less use of pesticides, smaller task-flexible tractors (+ drones), small-ecosystem farming and less intrusive fertilizers that are actually biodegradable and have a higher bioavailability. As the video says, we should strive to eat more vegetables and less meat, especially bovine meat (responsible for soybean large monoculture exploitations). We should also eat less processed foods as they contain corn syrup (maize monoculture), palm oil (palm oil monoculture), sugar (sugarcane and sugarbeet monoculture) and other products whose production is responsible for deforestation, social unrest and soil, water and air pollution.", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T22:52:11Z", "likes_count": 32}, {"comment_by": "ericopera", "comment_text": "I am studing chemistry and technical ingeniering, please dont publish sch a bull shit, of course organic food is more healthy", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T22:34:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Julie dauverd-girault", "comment_text": "Thank you @@UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q<br>I find this video very interesting !

Guess what we are! Those are specifically (meant to be) toxic to us. I learned this from my ecology professor at university. Synthetic pesticides can be chemically tailored to harm pests more and humans less. That&#39;s their whole point, in fact. <br>2. Synthetic pesticides are sprayed on the surface. You don&#39;t actually eat them. You peel them off, wash them off, or both. This is especially true for things like potatoes, where the pesticide-protected leaves are not even the same part of the plant as the underground tubers we eat. This is PRECISELY an advantage that a plant&#39;s self-produced toxins DO NOT have. They are in its cells. Bites from insects actually stimulate toxic responses, so it&#39;s a feedback loop, too!<br>3. Also, metabolism: the more material &amp; energy the plant spends on making toxins, the less it invests in growing the delicious nutritious fruit/seed tissue we eat, so it&#39;s either a smaller yield, longer growth time (and expense) or both.<br>4.

Here&#39;s the thing though, the more Nitrogen you put into the soil the more is gonna leak. When Nitrogen leaks from the soil it ends up in lakes, rivers and the ocean, leading to severe consequences which I will not dive to deep into at the moment.<br><br>Focusing on carbon in the soil: Carbon is what essentially makes soil come alive, it helps the soil store water and nutrients, it increases yields and creates a better environment for bacteria, microorganisms bla bla bla all of that. The future ahead of us will most likely bring more unstable weather circumstances which means fewer days of rainfall but more rain when it finally comes, if the soil then cannot hold water properly.. you get it.<br><br>Green manure: This goes hand to hand with crop rotation, it is letting a piece of land &quot;rest&quot; for a season while replenishing stores of Nitrogen and Carbon through (for and example) growing nitrogen fixing plants and then letting the roots rot in the soil (NOT PLOWING).<br>This might seem like a waste of space but actually, if we are to stop getting our supply fertilizers from mines in marocco and other places (getting shipped all around the world), it is a necesarry sacrifice and with time as carbon stores in the soil increase, production will too naturally.<br><br>Using toxins only if necesarry and very hard controls of what&#39;s being used.<br><br>Now, all of these aspects can be met both within the fields of &quot;Organic&quot; and &quot;Conventional&quot; but if you&#39;d look at where the focus lies withing the 2 practices and who is practicing what the most you&#39;d see that Organic wins.<br><br>All of this is just scraping the surface of complexity of the problem with modern agriculture.<br><br>I will finish of with a riddle:<br><br>If you year after year put nothing but Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potasium (N-P-K) into the soil and year after year grow vegetables or grains that take up that plus important trace minerals from the soil such as Magnesium, Calcium, Iodine and Zinc etc. what will happen after a certain amount of time? :D", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T14:40:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SmoczaMucha", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not too happy about it, my biggest issue with the non-organic produce was the amount of preservants in it and this issue wasn&#39;t mentioned here at all", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T12:59:19Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Baa Sisk", "comment_text": "If the vegies in the video looked like what they look like at<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PmM6SUn7Es&amp;t=2m29s\">2:29</a> then i would defenitely eat them way more", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T14:33:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tiara Reih Mequiota", "comment_text": "&quot;When a hippie says go back to nature, remember, this strawberry is just as man made as this poptart.&quot;<br><br>            -cgp gray (or grey)", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T12:43:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Islamic chanel", "comment_text": "In Bangladesh Pestecides Kill Over:5000 People Causing:Kidney Failure", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T07:04:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "phaseshifter3D", "comment_text": "I live alone, and I buy organic bananas because I found they last longer than non-organic ones.", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T00:12:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Starlight", "comment_text": "Do a video on GMO&#39;s, please?", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T18:24:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Autism Mommy Avenger", "comment_text": "\u0156a", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T16:04:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mayank Bhagya", "comment_text": "What about greenhouse emissions from chemical fertiliser companies?", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T15:53:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S O", "comment_text": "odd of having cervical cancer in USA is .0079%<br>oddS of serious effects from the HPV vaccine 2.3-2.5%", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T19:11:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Florencia Jimenez", "comment_text": "Adventure time swords much appreciated", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T05:52:24Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Synthwave the toaster \ud83d\udcbf\ud83d\udc9c", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PmM6SUn7Es&amp;t=5m16s\">5:16</a>", "comment_date": "2020-12-05T23:48:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jf", "comment_text": "I think you managed to avoid the subject.

After the land is left to fallow (for just one year), crops are grown again, whether rotated or not, this fallowing does not replete the soil, and certainly with the intensive use of fertilisers, and pesticides, it eventually becomes useless. It gets worse and worse, and farmers produce less and less, and buy land elsewhere, or make it elsewhere, to duplicate their practice, continually producing desserts along their path. There are massive environmental implications considering fertilisers and pesticides, and even organic agriculture<br>, that which never uses fertilisers nor pesticides. All practices of agriculture expose the soil to the sun, to the wind, to the rain, all without plants above, after harvest, cause desertification which makes the soil uninhabitable for soil organisms, and causes the soil to dry, it becomes a dessert. The soil stores the largest biomass of life, I think, besides the sea. There are more living species in the soil that anywhere on land, and these organisms sustain the life above. Farming practices such as permaculture sustain these organisms, for the practice does not disturb the soil, and aims to support as much biodiversity as possible. And thus the soil organisms in the trillions break down nutrients, converting them through many conversions through many organisms, they eventually feed the plants, and in turn the plants feed the soil, with leaves and the organic matter they produce, that returns to the soil. The greater the diversity of soil organisms the better the soil. Great soils have soil molecules that have high surface areas and high porosity, they bind together to form bundles, and these bundles are not formed with conventional agricultural practice, organic or otherwise. Soil organisms are imperitive to a sustainable soil network that supports the biodiversity above, and the biodiversity below. The better the soil the more efficient. Nutrients are made available in a good soil, via the use of the bacteria, arthropods, nematodes and mycelia. These organisms together break down plant waste, feed off of it, and convert it to food the plants can feed on, all while organism are fed to organisms within the soil, and are as well converted in such away that plants can feed. Mycelium, which are fungi that are spread throughout a living soil, have a ginormous surface area. They have threads that reach further down, and further away than roots of plants. These threads feed the roots with nutrients and water, and in return are fed with sugar. These threads die, as do many root systems, even tree roots. roots die and new. ones and newer ones take their place, and whether dead dying or newly formed, soil organisms are eating them, breaking them down, converting them, for them to be fed back. This is a system that is self sustainable. This is not what happens in agriculture. Agriculture is not self sustaining, and destroys the native biodiversity of this planet, feeds a growing consumer of its industry, it needs depleting, and the population needs to deplete with it to ensure maxium species rescued", "comment_date": "2020-11-14T21:27:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mobile Task Force Unit Epsilon-11", "comment_text": "E", "comment_date": "2020-11-14T19:53:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allysandra Ilagan", "comment_text": "Hi guys! if u care for the environment, please use Ecosia as your search engine.

Conventional farming often uses genetically manipulated organisms, or GMO&#39;s. We don&#39;t have much experience with GMO&#39;s yet, they haven&#39;t been around that long. But what for example happens with GMO&#39;s is that they are made immune to very potent herbicides like glyphosate, so that you can spray your fields as often as you think necessary, killing all plants except the one you intend to stay alive. This is disastrous for surrounding wildlife, especially when sprayed from planes, and creates an effect similar to antibiotic use in livestock, as in that some weeds are starting to get resistant too, leading to an arms race with the environment as big loser. GMO&#39;s are also associated with companies like Monsanto, who have so many court cases going against them on so many levels and topics that there must be something very wrong there. Read about it, judge for yourself.<br><br>2. The video mentions the use of natural fertilizers instead of artificial ones. Artificial fertilizers are made using mined resources which have to be transported and are finite. Phosphorous, for example, is mined in select locations around the planet, and there&#39;s a lively debate about when we will run out, not IF we will run out.<br><br>3. Organic farms try to be circular, meaning that for example the livestock on the farm creates the fertilizer that is used on the vegetables. Just as in turn plant matter that&#39;s not sold might be used to feed that livestock again. Far less transport costs, plus this is more sustainable.<br><br>4. More land use for organic farming is a problem, however if this would be coupled with consuming less meat - which we have to anyway either by choice or later by law - we will actually have excess land. The land argument is only a problem because of our consumption patterns.<br><br>5. Lastly, livestock is left out of this picture, which seems like cherry picking to me. Livestock is generally integrated in organic farms like I mentioned before, and the impact on livestock welfare, health and production quality is enormous. Visit a conventional pig farm once in your life, check how the animals are living on top of each other, eating the same industrial sludge every day, without seeing daylight ever, while being pumped full of antibiotics, and you will be thoroughly disgusted. This is a practice that has to stop, because of all parties involved. Buying organic vegetables and fruit more or less automatically supports better livestock holding practices.", "comment_date": "2020-09-25T16:25:40Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "Knightshade ", "comment_text": "Nah western folks dont like to eat blemished foods, they want bannas spotless and their apples hot red....we here in southe east asia leave in poverty the best way to save our money is to grow our vegiies,fruits and livestock on the backyard cuz were Pooor", "comment_date": "2020-09-25T13:12:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TigruArdavi", "comment_text": "Dear kurzgesagt,<br>generally great and neatly made videos, but <b>thumbs down</b> for this one! Do your research properly! While the health part is absolutely agreeable, you definitely lost out on the environment part. There is an abundance of studies that suggest that organic farming is advantageous to the environment. On average, the GHG emissions are lower than conventional. The most significant point is when it comes to biodiversity. Species diversity and abundance is extremely higher on organically farmed land, there are loads of recent studies from all around the world that found this.<br>And yes, a lower productivity, i.e. larger land use is given, but with modern organic farming methods it is on average over all crops and land types, only about 20% less than conventional, though of course differing vastly on the specific case. In certain cases it can even boost yields, when you replenish land degraded by industrial farming through organic methods (and at this point let&#39;s not forget that about  1/3 (!) of the worlds food production is wasted - goes to the bin in developed nations or decays in developing ones due to lack of proper infrastructure).<br>As always, yes it&#39;s complicated and of course it depends, one needs to be cautious not to compare, well..., apples with pears. Slashing down rainforest to grow water-guzzling avocados in a developing country to serve the local hippster-life-style store is sure <b>not</b> on the plus side for the environment, however much &#39;organic&#39; they&#39;re grown.<br>The methods and principles of organic farming (though there is no single definition or standards) go far beyond just using natural toxins instead of synthetic ones. Pesticide use is significantly less in organic farming and while in conventional they are kind of a &#39;standard tool&#39; in organic they are rather a last resort and you go first for regionally adapted plant varieties (and animal races), benefical organisms, natural antagonists and a vast range of other measures.<br>The main difference is, &#39;in a nutshell&#39;, you don&#39;t consider the land just a production substrate to work your standard tools on, but as an agro-ecosystem that needs to be thoroughly understood and worked in compliance with to get it working for you. And that is also why organic farming is not so much about &#39;more traditional methods&#39; as you say, but understanding the ecosystem within which you farm as a whole. Of course this includes also traditional methods and knowledge, which after all has fed humanity for millenia, but modern organic farming incorporates latest scientific insight, an will surely encompass current developments soon to go broad-range like precision agricultural methods and digitalization (e.g. using satellite imagery, drones etc. to get more information to make use of).<br>Indeed, it&#39;s not as easy as conventional=evil, organic=good, but I must say that it is rather dissapointing that you missed out on the fact that agriculture as we mainly performed it from the mid-twentieth century on (and that is what is called &#39;conventional agriculture&#39;) is one of the main culprits when it comes to global biodiversity loss and substantially contributes to GHG emissions; and on the <b>scientifically based</b> facts that methods used in organic farming have some huge potential in changing that!", "comment_date": "2020-09-25T01:06:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bites the dust", "comment_text": "Gmo\u2019s are so much more practical cua they\u2019re basically improved versions of the crops and they aren\u2019t bad for you despite what a lot of people think", "comment_date": "2020-09-24T18:07:41Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Kapi234", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s just eat raw meat", "comment_date": "2020-09-24T12:50:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dummie Plays", "comment_text": "stop making bad toxic chemicals and subsistences", "comment_date": "2020-09-24T08:34:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GasMask Guy", "comment_text": "just engineer the GMO to have more and a better variety of vitamins and minerals, people don\u2019t understand that \u201cman made\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically mean bad", "comment_date": "2020-09-24T01:50:28Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Andi J", "comment_text": "i do demeter as well lol<br>just typing this in makes me feel privileged", "comment_date": "2020-09-23T16:22:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DrawingWithRaid", "comment_text": "he said &quot;Danish&quot;!

It gives the impression of a &quot;one size fits all,&quot; not taking into consideration the diversity of countries, their economies, and their food regulations. Not to mention the clearly biased choice of studies.   <br><br>I agree with a lot of what was said, especially that we should eat more veggies/fruits, regardless of their production method. Greens are good for us, and we should make an effort to have them more often into our diets. But I have to bring some different perspectives and studies to show that, in reality, it&#39;s a fundamental topic of discussion. <br><br>One crucial piece of information that is missing is about carbon sequestration. Yes, organics demand a lot more land for production, but its regenerative nature aids in sequestering the carbon from the atmosphere. According to  2007&#39;s report from IPCC, 89% of the technical mitigation potential of carbon comes from soil carbon sequestration. Even though there is no consensus on the exact amounts, what is known is that regenerative organic agriculture holds huge carbon sequestration potential. <br><br>Organics can also reduce erosion caused by wind and water as well as by overgrazing at a rate of 10 million ha annually \u2013 a crucial precondition for future food security. Also, it&#39;s an excellent way to rehabilitate poor soils, restore organic matter content, and bring such soils back into productivity while keeping higher amounts of moisture in it, thus reducing water usage. This specific factor makes it extremely attractive to farmers from developing countries such as mine (Brazil), where highly synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are used in crops indiscriminately due to weak regulations. <br><br>Finally,  organic agriculture offers many added benefits such as conserving agricultural biodiversity, reducing environmental degradation impacts, and integrates farmers into high-value food chains. <br><br>The point of my comments here is that we should be careful at how we approach certain situations, especially when they are directly linked to our health. To cherry-pick studies to make a certain point, while ignoring others that would bring a counterpoint and diversity to viewers, so to let them make their decisions, is wrong, to say the least. It&#39;s disappointing to see such a debate be simplified in a way that leads people into thinking that organic regenerative agriculture is just &quot;  A way of life,&quot; or a &quot;fake trend.&quot; Although I agree that there is a lot of scam cases around, which contribute to this &quot;bad fame.&quot; <br><br>The topic of organic regenerative agriculture deserves much more debate, especially on how we can integrate good practices from both sides so to create better food systems and strive towards food sovereignty. <br><br>For those who are interested, there&#39;s a LOT of good practices around the globe, and I&#39;m more than happy to share some of them with you + sources. <br><br>Eat your fruits and veggies, everyone! ;)", "comment_date": "2020-08-15T15:58:03Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Conehead", "comment_text": "So I should starve and not eat?

For anyone who thinks this is a new trend, organic methods have been used for thousands of years and are still used in many countries. \r<br>First point, \u2018scientists are not sure if antioxidants are actually good for you\u2019- um Antioxidants ARE minerals and nutrients that prevent cell damage and help to bust your immune system, vitamin A, C &amp; E are examples of antioxidants. \r<br><br><br>Taste difference \u2013 not just the taste but the appearance and storage durability of organic real produce is superior. I can also use the seeds (yes they come with seeds unlike synthetic) and regrow them to keep the cycle going thus reducing my own plastic use and carbon footprint. Oh and in crazy times like these organic systems are very useful!<br> \r<br>Impact on the environment \u2013 yes organic food requires more land and many suppliers and organizations lie about selling organic. But which one is more sustainable? This cannot be answered easily as you have to involve politics. The Free Trade Agreement for example, affects local organic farmers in my home country Colombia, we can grow sustainable organic food for the whole country and could import abroad, because we have the land and the climate but the deal is that we have to import food from Europe, from synthetic methods because they do not have the land and the same resources than us. Whilst the deal is economically beneficial for a few, the local farmers are jobless and have to throw tonnes of food away adding to poverty and green-house gases. And this is the situation in MANY countries around the world! Therefore both methods can be used sustainably depending on where they are used if correct and JUST regulations are put in place. This is also why organic is expensive in some countries and not in others. <br> \r<br>Synthetic fertilizer and pesticides effect on soil - soil chemistry is changing due to these products, is becoming less fertile (food less nutritious) and it is losing its drainage capacity increasing erosion which causes flooding. Crops are also losing its natural nitrogen-fixing capacities meaning each time more fertilizers have to be used, this excess of N runs down into our waterways causing a negative impact on wildlife and us if we drink from this.<br> \r<br>There are also many other issues with GMOs such as the effect on farmers health and how the big companies bully them into using GMO\u2019s! The die-off of pollinators, the food wastage issue with supermarkets only selling certain looking foods is also related to all of this\u2026 monoculture impacts on the environment and many crop species going extinct\u2026 overpopulation\u2026 this is all related   \r<br>So when you say \u2018Eating veggies is more important for your health than how they were produced\u2019 is telling people to just stay ignorant", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T22:26:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suhandi Wiratama", "comment_text": "Finally.

Truly organic, crops grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizer is much better for the environment and generally much more nutritious also. <br><br>When chemicals are used on the crop it kills the microbiology in the soil.  The microbiology actually eats the minerals in the soil, poops them out, thus making them available to the crop.  Food conventionally grown year after on the same soil becomes devoid of minerals because there is no more microbiology to produce minerals for the crop, making it much less nutritious. <br><br><br><br>This video is correct when it says that eating fruits and veggies in season is better.  Fresh produce has a higher concentration of enzymes which are key building blocks for building health.  But it is also even healthier to eat foods that have fewer toxins and more minerals.   As far as taking up more land to grow organically for the same amount of crops as conventional, this is partially true.  Many new organic growers do not understand soil fertility which is key to producing high yields from the land. Those who truly understand soil fertility and the organic approach can produce yields of as much or even higher than conventionally grown crops. <br><br><br><br>This video seems to me to be put out by the conventional agriculture industry who is seeing a decline in demand for their products because people are waking up to the value of organic produce.  One advantage is that it sure taste better and gives the body building blocks that keep it healthier than conventional produce.

The extremely high demand for certain foods all year round (corn, tomatoes, strawberries, you name it) results in both farmers and growing companies to plant massive fields of the same crop over and over and over again. <br><br><br>You see, the way farming used to be more commonly practiced is with a methodology called crop rotation. When you plant something in the ground, be it anything from potatoes to pineapples, they take nutrients from the soil (which gives them their flavor) and leaves nutrients behind when they&#39;re harvested (which enriches the soil). This is pretty much how all farming of any kind was done for a majority of our history, because each time a crop is harvested it leaves better and better soil for the next crop to be grown and harvested in.<br><br><br>However... when industrialization took the agriculture industry by storm and year-round demand for certain crops increased, a lot of growers stopped rotating crops all together and focused their entire operations on one crop specifically as opposed to several in a year, which is called mono-culturing. From a business perspective this may seem like it makes sense, as you&#39;d want to grow, sell, and specialize in whatever crop is in highest demand or at highest market price, but what happens from an agriculture perspective is actually counter-intuitive. When you make one field grow the same crop over and over again you&#39;re putting too many nutrients from one kind of crop in the soil while starving it of nutrients from other sources or kinds of produce... so gradually, over time, the fertility of the field (which is its ability to grow large yields of crops) diminishes, as does the natural flavors of produce grown in those fields, which often leads to a more bland tasting product. This is why many people complain about GMO produce not being as flavorful as &quot;organic&quot;, because GMO crops and monocultures are the predominant choice for corporate growing companies who specialize in one or two products on a massive scale, companies like the Dole Pineapple company for example.", "comment_date": "2020-01-28T20:58:36Z", "likes_count": 629}, {"comment_by": "Lil Shadow", "comment_text": "<del>Organic</del><br><br><br><i>Ourganic</i>", "comment_date": "2020-01-28T20:38:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brittany Borghi", "comment_text": "Hm, I wish this video commented on pesticides and herbicides, like glyphosate, and their detrimental effects on pollinators (and, thus, the food chain) and their demonstrated link to cancer.", "comment_date": "2020-01-28T19:51:30Z", "likes_count": 48}, {"comment_by": "Undraiks", "comment_text": "Where I live, all the fruits have seeds.

Ideally they would be no-till, building up soil, reducing the need for fertilizer, increasing yields and creating a noticeable difference in nutrient content in food. Organic would also ideally work with polycultures, avoiding the need for pest control (pests thrive on monoultures because there is always more of their food right there). Polycultures, especially agroforestry systems are more efficient on the land due to greater yields from different crops using up three-dimensional space. Above-ground they take turns photosynthesizing and then shading each other (saving water plus plants don&#39;t need more than 8-9 hours of sunlight a day to do their daily photosynthesis, summer days can have 14-17 hours, so growing crops in part shade is viable and gives you extra yields in fruits and nuts). Below-ground, mixing annuals, perennials, shrubs and trees means every depth of the soil is being taken advantage of. Not to mention the carbon trapping this world needs. <br><br>Polycultures and soil building take more skill and are more labor intensive, this would make organic cost more, but the reality is we should be spending more on food and less on all the junk we buy and throwaway and replace over and over. Get a 100 dollar phone instead of an iphone and invest in local small-scale organics, trust me. <br><br>As far as pesticides not being more toxic than drinking wine, tell that to the field workers, I&#39;ve worked in strawberry monocultures, apricot orchards, vineyards, its like being in World War 1.

Especially with glyphosate that impedes they shikimatte pathway in plants, also impairs it in our microbiome. Our microbiome secrete micro RNA that interact with our own DNA for expression of genes. Organic pesticides are indeed toxic, however, they do not show ANY where near the same sort of toxicity as synthetic. The EU, FDA, and other regulating bodies are not a trustworthy source for toxicology reports at all as they are going off very expired data that\u2019s been proven wrong.

If the right rules are generated, there is no use for the bio label. I live in the netherlands, perhaps the forefront with regards to farming, and I have this note about the most bs rule in bio food: it must be produced on full ground. To someone unspecialized that might sound like it is logical, but for the current state of agriculture it is utter rubbish. There&#39;s hydroponic systems using up all the waste that&#39;s a side product from fish. You&#39;d think I just mentioned the major reason but that is a sidenote on a small scale. there are currently greenhouses that are carbon neutral (solar energy+heat pumps), yet they are unable to put on any &quot;bio&quot; label even though they were harvested carbon neutrally, without the use of pesticides (most greenhouses don&#39;t even get infections, so there is no need for fungicides).

It is oblivious that growing millions of corn crops on itself in regions where corn shouldn&#39;t even be able to live is not and will never be the way to go if we want to survive at least 30 years more. People should stop saying that &quot;local&quot; is a trend, it&#39;s an actual way to support small farmers that live around you and don&#39;t make any profit as opposed to big producers(those being &quot;organic&quot; or not). Those farmers live nearby you and selling their products to adjacents grocery stores (by going through all the processes shown in the video) isn&#39;t even enough to be rentable sometimes. Because the company or the store would want to make profit too, they&#39;ll buy the crops (and animal products) at extremely low prices and sell them at the low cost you know from you local store. This allows them to make money while selling at affordable. You&#39;d buy from a local farmer for the same price if not a little more, but to them it&#39;s a big difference (0,2-0,5 cents to 4 to 5 euros in France) the solution is to produce massively and ruin the land, produce a lot of waste and all that greenhouse effect. Organic can be mass produced. In the video, they are comparing mass production of classic and organic. Small producers obviously have way less impact on climat and they suffer from the mass production as much as our planet. Concerning your health, it&#39;s Tru that an organic apple and a  regular apple have little to no differences. When it comes to apple juice or pie... A hand made, home made from you local farmer is way less damaging for you body than a mass produced pie filled with conservatives . Primary products don&#39;t have much difference to them as in they don&#39;t affect your heath, but overly transformed products yes. This is also a part of the &quot;organic way of leaving&quot;. You can buy any primary product and make a dish yourself for it to be healthier. The only good reason to buy organic primarily products would be buying it directly off the farm and home cooking it. Every one can do this and it will only cost you a little more money and time and it will on the long term have a positive effect on your life.

Though whistleblowers have for decades spoke about how damaging these chemicals are to the humans that ingest them, even in the small amounts still present in the food and soil after washing and cleaning, it was only recently proven scientifically that they are in fact poisonous, damaging, and possibly carcinogenic. Whether or not the practice of growing GMO seeds itself is a bad thing is still debated, but I won&#39;t go one way or the other on that, because the worst part of using GMO crops is that it lets us get away with <b>dousing</b> crops with glyphosates and other chemicals, which the plants have been modified to be resistant or immune to. <br><br>As for the non-issue regarding nutritional value, that would not be affected by whether or not the seeds are GMO or not. Nutritional value comes from the soil the seeds are grown in. However, as many commenters pointed out, growing GMO foods lets us get away with soil depletion, another practice that organic farmers simply can&#39;t indulge in because they cannot take those kinds of risks. <br><br>The people that eat organic are not following the &quot;latest hot trend that will fall away in a few years&quot;, they are people that have done their research. Clearly more than you have, Kurz. And, it isn&#39;t going away any time soon.Personally, I will eat GMO food as long as it&#39;s not full of glyphosates, no problem there, and I am glad to see conventional farmers picking up organic farming practices like using organic fertilizers with GMO crops - this is fine. When I do eat conventionally grown food, it produces a painful intestinal inflammation each and every time, which organic or non-sprayed GMO food does not. On that alone, my choice was easy, and it led me to do a lot of research to learn why this was happening. Now imagine similar triggers in many ordinary people, individuals and parents choosing to buy organic food for their kids and themselves.

In other words, there is nothing wrong with organics in themselves, it is the producer&#39;s responsibility and blame. There are literally myriads of different agricultural techniques that are more sustainable, eco-friendly, and  produce healthy food with no toxics involved; these techniques are just not widely known to the majority and are also less efficient in terms<br>of stability, and certainty in the expected amount of produce (in other words economically). As for the environment, conventional techniques and practices are by far more harmful than organics on multiple grounds. I will not get into them in detail as it would require a lot more text, but I do urge anyone who is interested to look it up for themselves. Overall, the biggest problem with conventional food systems is that they are not de-centralized, and instead big corporations produce the majority of the food with their unsustainable and unhealthy ways. Corporations which obviously do not care about the consumers health and safety as the food that is produced is bombarded with excessive amounts of toxic chemicals and other substances, just so they can make a few more pennies. No wonder cancer rates etc are on the rise, and especially in places like the US, where many chemicals are legal to use in food production that are illegal in many other parts of the world. As for land use, there are also multiple ways to farm which do not require land/a lot of land such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and mixed crops. Before you decide you have an opinion or knowledge on something, please look into it, especially when it regards something as important as our food. It is dangerous to have a misguided population. That is all. (If you still disagree, you can enjoy feeding yourselves and your children with cancer and harmful chemicals.

Whether organic food is more healthy is still up for debate, but I agree that there is most likely no significant difference. And I also agree that certain organic pesticides are more toxic than conventional, however there is much much less of it in good organic farming. There are huge differences in how organic farming is practiced. Some are basically the same as conventional farming, but just without pesticides, herbicides and artificial fertilizer and rotation of fields (thus larger landuse). Others that are much deeper and have a greater focus on the study of- and cooperation with microbiology and the local ecology, such as regenerative agriculture. Where by the amount of land actually can be reduced in comparison to conventional farming, since soil fertility goes up and thus crop yield increases with 20%. In fact, I have met and heard of more and more conventional farmers that have gone over to organic farming because it is cheaper in practice and they get paid more for their produce. In fact, I&#39;ve of quite a lot of farmers that want to do so, but can&#39;t due to restraints by their contractors. <br>Also, in the studies that you cite on environmental impact I have, so far, not seen any mentioning of the impact of local ecology. Conventional farming has caused an enormous reduction in biodiversity due to their use of pesticides that basically wipes out most of the insects in their direct environment. Since insects are an extremely important base in the ecology, this basically leads to ecological breakdown. All in all, we&#39;ve seen a great reduction of insect life here in northern Europe with all subsequent consequences as a result. This has of course also to do with climate change, but conventional agriculture is what helped tipped it over. It is ironic that the greatest biodiversity in Europe nowadays is in urban area&#39;s, and not the agricultural area&#39;s. <br>Now when it comes to the carbon footprint, I agree that it is difficult to measure the differences, considering transport and plowing. Plowing is one the biggest causes of CO2 emissions actually, since there is stored four more times CO2 in the upper ground than there is in the atmosphere. Plowing causes this CO2 to be released into the atmosphere, which it otherwise wouldn&#39;t have. However if you practice regenerative agriculture, have a no-plow system, and use your livestock for rotational grazing than your farm actually has the potential of being carbon-negative. This will also have minimal run-off into rivers and streams since you stimulate your fields to have a better, more compact root system, thus protecting the top soil from being washed away during rainfall.<br>I have to agree with your conclusion that no farming is the best for the environment, that is obvious of course. And that you should eat locally and seasonally. I find it rather troubling that we are importing all our foods from across the world, whether it being organic or conventional. <br>Basically, what I would like to say, is that the issue is far more delicate. I highly doubt the issue of ecological impact can be easily and realistically be summarized in the two studies cited. When it comes to it in the end, I have to choose for organic farming in the current time while keeping the environmental impact in mind. This is due to my own experience with organic vs conventional farming, and the scientists that I&#39;ve spoken with and read about on the issue. This does not mean that conventional farming has no way of becoming better. Right now, I think conventional farming couldn&#39;t get worse than it is, but if they manage to create new technologies that removes the need for heavy machinery (and thus no soil compression), reduce the amount of pesticides and herbicides by administering it at the correct spot, and have full control over the run-off of fertilizers, than I think that would be a major solution. That said, I think the future of conventional farming is indoor farming. That would basically be the &#39;no-farming is the best&#39; solution and have minimal ecological impact.

Glyphosate is a chemical found in weed killers that farmers spray onto crops, and onto the crops while they are being harvested to increase yields a few %.   The human body accidentally takes Gyphosate instead of the chemically similar Glycine when it is making up essential proteins that your body needs.  Unfortunately, with Glyphosate in the protein, there is an extra &#39;arm&#39; sticking out of the protein that makes it so that the protein WON&#39;T FIT RIGHT into protein receptors in the body and the protein fails to carry out its duty right. When enough of these faulty proteins exist you get AUTISM, Gluten intolerance, obesity, diabetes, and a few dozen other harmful diseases that just did not exist in such large numbers before the 1970&#39;s, when Glyphosate started being used in large amounts.     Organic foods avoid the use of these Glyphosate-containing herbicides and in that way those organic foods won&#39;t slowly mutate you from the inside.     <br>Apples:  Do they spray apples with weed killer?  No.  So you don&#39;t need to buy organic apples.<br>Wheat, grains, nuts, vegetables:  Do they spray them with weed killer?  YES, very much so.  So you have to avoid eating non-organic wheat,  non-organic cereals, and non-organic vegetables.   That includes things such as break that is made from non-organic wheat.  Whole wheat breads keep the husks;  something that contains far more absorbed gyphosate than the other parts of the wheat, so non-organic whole wheat bread is the absolute WORST bread to eat if you are trying to avoid the poisoning effects of gyphosate. <br>Milk?    Do the farmers feed the cows with grains that have been sprayed with gyphosate?  If they are then you are literally drinking gyphosate. For that reason even organic milk is the best way to go.<br>Now all of these organic foods are Hellishly expensive, often costing 2 times more than other similar foods.  Its up to you if you want to eat poison, but just remember that once your body creates that gyphosate protein it is in your body for about 5 years before it is naturally flushed out, doing all sorts of damaging effects to your body.  Yes the protein only lasts a few weeks, but its components are broken down and used again and again to make new proteins, that&#39;s why the gyphosate lasts so long in the body once it gets in.", "comment_date": "2019-01-15T04:53:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "vinzfalken", "comment_text": "The graphic is hypnotising", "comment_date": "2019-01-15T04:49:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kris Paterson", "comment_text": "Eating organtic is good on the mind and spirit.

This could lead to a so called &quot;evolutionary arms race&quot; with bacteria and fungi as they over the generations slowly get resistance to the plants defences making it more difficult. There is also an argument that it could possibly be more harmful to humans, but I doubt it would be enough. It would also save farm land.

I&#39;m a Dietitian major with a minor in Food Science and in Food Science we were looking at organic and conventional food items. Conventional food items aren&#39;t deadly to anyone per say, but let&#39;s go back to the conventional meats, meat naturally messes with ur own hormones as to be expected whenever u consume an animal, ur absorbing some of what they were made up of, but then extra hormones which is usually estrogen messes with hormones even further. Foods like breads that use soy as a filler increases estrogen in the human body and isn&#39;t usually made up of as much bran as it should be. So in conclusion, is organic food better for you? The short answer is absolutely, however is it necessary to live? Not really, but just keep in mind that conventional food items can hurt your sex drive and increase your fat storage, P.S. this is only with meat and bread items. But also keep in mind that a label titled organic isn&#39;t a guarantee, you&#39;ll still have to read the block availbale. This is because there&#39;s a thin line as to what can be considered organic or not. Technically soy, extra hormones and even transfats are actually organic, and so companies usually get away with organic labels just for show. But my gear here is that the purer food items are usually labeled organic, so I would suggest u start with organic items and then read the block in each item, until u find an item that meets your satisfactory. If you&#39;re ok with the risks above I just mentioned, then feel free to consume conventional food items.", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T10:19:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Md.

I&#39;m not sure how up-to-date these topics are or if they&#39;ve been proven/disproven so take it with a grain of salt (but I do think it would have been important to discuss.) <br><br>One topic they didn&#39;t speak on that is VERY important when weighing the pros and cons of both is gene run off, that being super weeds/bugs. Basically what this means is when growing genetically modified plants you must use a more intense pesticide to kill unwanted pests; luckily, the genetically modified plant is immune to this. However this generates what are called super weeds (or even bugs) due to gene &quot;run off&quot; (sperm and/or eggs getting some unintended modifications). For example, wheat that produces three times as efficiently requires this stronger pesticide (lets name the pesticide XP-123)so it is genetically modified to withstand XP-123. That modification runs off into plants or even insects and we are left with a weed or bug that is also (unintentionally) modified to  withstand XP-123. To get rid of these resistant bugs the farmer usually, and reluctantly has to kill their whole crop (what good is a field of wheat that has bugs and weeds you cant kill?)<br>Secondly, what if using XP-123 runs off into a water source? It ends up killing various plants and animals inhabiting the body of water (or again creating super weeds/bugs.) A way around having to use XP-123 is to instead use a much higher dose of regular pesticide. The threat here is much more pesticide leads to much more run off of pesticide again potentially contaminating water sources.<br><br>The other topic that I found rather important was the idea of how these genetically modified plants are effecting the ground. Some of the seeds are specifically designed and advertised to grow in any conditions be it infertile soil or a very dry region. Well the problem with this is that many of the plants that have been genetically modified have had some damage done to their reproductive systems either intentionally or unintentionally. If I remember correctly Monsanto, one of the largest manufactures of genetically engineered materials, used a lucrative tactic to not only generate repeated customers but force one time users into buying seeds again was to intentionally make sure the seeds were &quot;suicide seeds&quot; so that they caused drastic damage to the ground of which they were planted and died at the season&#39;s end. <br><br>Again don&#39;t quote me but rather correct me.

Unless you think the idea of allowing 45% of the worlds population to starve is ethical of course. Nitrogen bonding is only achieved artificially. It removes the need for practices such as crop rotation by allowing land to be farmed each year. Or we admit we have a huge and growing population problem and make measures to dramatically reduce the number of humans on the planet. Which would solve a lot of problems but destroy every western economy which relies on growth to minimise historical debt via infaltion. That&#39;s probably the better answer though IMO. Admit 7.5 billion people is too many and put plans in place to reduce the number.

It can be matchsticks VS rocks. It doesn&#39;t really matter in that way. In the world of business, however, it&#39;s about who gets to dominate the markets.<br><br>With GMO seeds come patents and no one other than the company holding the patent can use it and sell it. <br>If I come up with a cheaper way to produce large quantities of a certain product, I can sell a lot for cheap, and my turnover in profits will be great as more people will want to buy what they can afford, regardless of the contents of my product or how it was sourced. In the case of food, it just has to pass all the requirements of still being a food source. It just matters that it is marketed to sound like it is the affordable option and &quot;the science agrees&quot; with it. The science doesn&#39;t necessarily have to include people with compromised health or those who may not be able to consume the product. The target market are those who can consume almost anything without being immediately affected by it. It&#39;s about quickly making profits from those who are willing to trust what is being sold is okay for consumption now before they change their mind about it later. <br><br>Corporate companies have the means to purchase ideas and make them a reality to get to their end result quicker. They can afford the research and the marketing. <br>The local organic farmers produce on a smaller scale and would need more time to turn a profit. In addition, they will find themselves struggling to compete with the large corporate giants that are pocketing pennies from the vast majority of people that need to feed their families from a tight budget. It&#39;s easier to get 1 dollar out of a million people for a serving of some food item than 2 dollars out of 500k  people. The science plays no role here other than it is what the corporate giant would have it appear to say. Should there be any problem with the product at a later stage, they would already have made all the money to &quot;improve it&quot; with &quot;the latest science&quot;. Their weapon is to promote value for your money, and the science and marketing strategies are to influence public perception of the product they want to sell to them. It&#39;s like when ads for painkillers used to have a doctor in uniform give his approval of a certain brand of painkillers because he uses it himself. The GMO product with the science badge of approval is not any different. People in lab coats say it&#39;s okay so it must be okay. They don&#39;t realize that new science is not time tested or sufficiently reviewed science, and not all scientists agree on some things. The general public doesn&#39;t spend time researching old and current science journals to compare findings and if a few people do make an attempt to look into the science, they struggle to extract the point of the studies and draw incorrect conclusions. If GMO seed patents are involved, not all research info would be disclosed to the public. That&#39;s a win for large corporates. <br><br>Nothing makes the selling of products more exciting for this generation than well designed science based content that is promoted through social media. If it&#39;s done professionally and attractively, many will easily be influenced and they will not think twice to share it on other platforms. <br>A lot of products are sold using this approach and quite a few people have made loads of money over a short period of time until their &quot;science&quot; no longer panned out as people came to realize they were being duped.", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T08:27:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pisic", "comment_text": "No stop eating vegetables,you&#39;re killing the plants watafac", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T08:25:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Claude Yuan Mauritius", "comment_text": "natural food is tastier,healthier and if grown locally,cheaper!!!", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T08:24:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uc54c\ub809\uc2a4", "comment_text": "Well if counting GMO&#39;s in the nutritional analysis then conventional wins in some areas on some foods.

Please trust your whole being to Him. He can work wonders in your life. Your temple belongs to God our Creator yet too often we give our temple to satan to use, abuse and deceive. Our &quot;temple&quot; is God&#39;s ground that Satan wants to reclaim and possess.   Satan is going to do everything he can to get you and I to work in cooperation with him. The less we resist Satan the more ground the devil potentially gains.                                                               <br><br>Yes - in part, it&#39;s true: The battle does belong to the Lord.  For certain, He&#39;s the only One with the power to do anything against evil!  And how God has chosen to fight His battle is to use you and I as soldiers in His army to keep reclaiming His possession -- our human temple: Spirit, Soul and Body.  (See: 1 Cor. 6 : 19-20).  There is another dimension of victory God our Father and Creator won for us....through the sacrifice of Jesus on the Cross that we all need to seek Him to gain full revelation of.  This victory is addressed in the book of Romans, Chapter 6.  Prior to the Cross, God&#39;s people were not empowered by God to overcome sin like disciples of Jesus Christ have been after Jesus Christ resurrected from the grave.                                                        <br><br>God snatched power out of Satan&#39;s grasp to hold God&#39;s people from walking in greater degrees of obedience to God&#39;s Word.  Talk about conquering death!   To reveal to Satan and all the fallen angels (for all of God&#39;s created beings, actually) that God is so wise that He can use the worst of evil to accomplish good for those the evil has been inflicted against. That God&#39;s glory might increase throughout eternity, and so He can share His glory in greater ways than ever before.                                                      <br><br>The glory that Satan and the fallen angels once had prior to their fall will now be given to sinners saved by grace like you and I to different degrees at a future time.  For that reason alone, Satan and his demon legions are filled with rage towards our Creator and rage toward those of us who have received the Salvation that Jesus Christ gained for us, and offers freely to anyone who desires it.  (See: 1 Cor. 2:6-8; Romans 8 : 30). Sinners saved by grace can now freely receive God&#39;s holiness and righteousness.  (See: Romans 6 : 22; 1 Thess. 3 : 11-13; Hebrews 12 : 10)  There is a battle for your eternal life.                   <br><br>Please dear friends don&#39;t let satan win. Come out of this world (death) into life and life more abundantly with Jesus Christ by believing in Him and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection.

I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she&#39;ll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can&#39;t sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can&#39;t take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she&#39;s sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what&#39;s up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I&#39;ve been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there&#39;s my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T02:31:42Z", "likes_count": 32}, {"comment_by": "Puzzle Piece", "comment_text": "TRENDING #3<br>:D", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T02:30:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Azio Prism", "comment_text": "<b>Organic is just a way for rich people to feel good about buying food.</b>", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T02:30:07Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "amagicmuffin", "comment_text": "#1 on trending.<br>Nice.", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T02:28:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BeeUVr", "comment_text": "#1 on trending\u263a", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T02:28:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Modr\u00fd Kluk", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PmM6SUn7Es&amp;t=7m22s\">7:22</a> I see what you did there!", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T02:27:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Byron Holt", "comment_text": "Love the food and stuff reference!", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T02:26:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shannen Libres", "comment_text": "Eggs my mom bought said &quot;organic&quot; what&#39;s organic eggs?", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T02:26:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David W", "comment_text": "Too many sheepeople", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T02:26:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eddymakes", "comment_text": "You rock guys", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T02:25:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charlotte Abouo", "comment_text": "This is number one on trending", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T02:25:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jaydoggy", "comment_text": "In short: Some organic food is more ethical.

This is often a big selling point of GMO.<br><br>However, it is important to address the possible environmental monocultures that could emerge from cheap, profitable farming. Yes, organic farming does take more space for the amount of crop, but huge sections of land devoted to a single crop where very little land wildlife could survive could be a somewhat likely future result of cheap GMO farming. The cheaper to produce, the more of it there will be. My guess is that laws constraining the amount of land devoted to one crop someone can have will be passed (or have already been passed, I haven&#39;t looked into this that much) and it seems that GMO will continue to be a better option.<br><br>Other than those two things, I really liked the video.

In my country these substances are not regulated, they are handled without the necesary equipment, used near schools, houses, thrown from planes, they go to the water thats underground, they are on the food we eat. I dont have anything against GMO. These large companies that sell the pesticides have a lot of power and money, and I dont think they care a lot, neither do the people who use them.

There is information missing in this video.. Its a FACT that inorganic growing methods, kills of the symbiotic relationships that are located in the soil.. there is fungi which lives in symbiosis with the plant roots, where the fungi gives the plant nutrients from the soil, while the plant gives the fungi sugars.. This bond means that whenever another species of fungi (which is parasitic on trees) - tries to get into the tree and kill it, the &quot;good fungi&quot; protects the tree.. Its a natural way for the tree to be protected against threats.. Soil is FILLED with life, which plants are evolved to grow between.. When we start to mess with the natural system, we are killing off the soil food web.. This leads to problems in the long run.. There is no real difference between chemical and organic nutrients in terms of the molecular structure.. The difference is that in nature, the soil food web, slowly decomposes organic matter, giving the plants a steady and balanced stream of nutrients (and acturally the plant and fungi and bacteria and such, &quot;communicates&quot; kinda.. Like, if the plant is under stress, it releases Acetylsalicylic acid, this has an effect on the fungi, which makes it speed up the metabolism of certain nutrients that the plant needs, to combat the problem its facing [This is just an example of how these systems work]), where, if you use inorganic nutrients, you are basically adding all the nutrients at once.. this disrupts the soil food web, destroying it, it can burn your plant leaves (nutrient burn), and soo much more.. Also.. If you have a potted plant, that you have grown with inorganic nutrients.. try to take out the soil/rootball from the pot, and look at it.. healthy organic soil is rich, dark, often with a destinct smell.. Dead soil is crumbly, cant hold water, and so forth.. <br><br>Basically.. Grow organic, and throw a banana peel on the ground every now and then, or other organic material (just like in nature, when fruits and leaves drop on the ground, and is slowly broken down..<br><br><br>OR Grow inorganically, and have yourself a junkie plant, where you constantly have to make sure that you are giving it the right nutrients and shit..

The best meal is the soup cooked with a chicken or a turkey, it takes 4 hours to cook but it&#39;s enaugh for 4 days, the proteins of the meat are added in the soup. Eggs are also a good help for omelettes, we keep the cheese for the breakfast and wine for the diner.

Living like that isn&#39;t a problem, imo food wouldn&#39;t taste that good if we could it everything everyday.

And so the farmers started abusing this beacuse they can sell it for higher prices. When i do the math the price that i would sell my products is the same.

Organic and traditional farming methods are better for the environment than conventional monoculture industrial farming because of its effect on the landscape and species richness and abundance. Traditional farming methods such as open pasture grazing, crop rotation and organic fertilizers keeps the landscape open and &quot;true&quot; to its pre-human condition (at least in Europe where the Aurochs and other wild grazers kept the landscape from getting overgrown before humans took over). An open landscape (as opposed to an overgrown one) increases species richness in plants. Many flowering plants in Europe are endangered because they benefit from grazing. Grazing removes the highly competitive plants, like Anthriscus sylvestris, from taking over every open space. Not to mention the eutrophication that synthetic fertilizer lead to in lakes. Organic farming highly benefit the environment compared to conventional and you not mentioning this makes you just another opinion-pushing channel that doesn&#39;t consider all the facts.", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T17:36:34Z", "likes_count": 36}, {"comment_by": "Atesz763", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t care what I eat I just want to not starve to death", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T17:36:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alex Near", "comment_text": "I think a lot of people compare locally grown, fresh, and in season organic produce to conventionally farmed produce from overseas.

Organic is no more nutritious than conventional. Duh. And it&#39;s definutely true that we use pestisides, but  the majority are natrual such as vinegar, mineral and essential oil sprays. Sure some are more toxic, but the majority of choices at our disposal  are harmless to humans and I intend to stick to those.  It surely beats the toxic runoff of conventional pesticides and fertilizers into our waterways and to say it doesn&#39;t is irresponsible on kurzgesagt&#39;s part.<br><br>Another generalization I noticed was energy and land use. Not every organic operation uses greenhouses or all of the land that you claim. No till techniques and interplanting crops to deter pests from vulnerable crops(instead of vast monocultures of conventional that attract uncontrolled numbers of pests that <i>require</i>  the use of pesticides)are lightyears more efficient at saving energy than any conventional operation and are on the rise in popularity. It largely eliminates the need for large diesel machinary. It can be even more efficient if you implement small space techniques and of course, grow seasonal produce, as mentioned.<br><br>We aren&#39;t all perfect, but the good ones work four times as hard to keep people, the environment and ultimately, the planet, healthy. seems this video ignores truly organic and enviromental aspects to cherry pick the ones that condemn it and mask where conventional is at fault. It is a fact that conventional farms put  more toxic runoff into our waterways and onto neighboring land. It is fact that many, many conventional pesticides cause cancer and other serious conditions. In fact, the creators of Round Up, America&#39;s most popular conventional pesticide, is in the middle of several legal cases over that subject at this very moment. We shouldn&#39;t be giving conventional a free pass here.

Not just the fruit, but also products that use apples and oranges as their main ingredients such as apple pie or orange juice? Well according to the data American consumers consume about 45lbs of apples a year, and at $1.57 and $2.34 respectively for conventional and organic, that amounts to $70.65-$105.3/yr assuming you make all these products yourself(apple juice, apple pie, etc). It takes 5-8 years for the average apple tree to reach full maturity and produce a bountiful harvest (4-5 bushels or up to 200lb of apples per tree), so you could spend $525 over 5 years for apples or spend approximately $250 to care for the apple tree over the same time and get a harvest of 200lbs by yr 5. The beauty is these trees keep producing, given they are in a self-sustainable enviroment, even after the original owner has died...<br><br>I guess what I mean to say with this rant is that growing organically at home doesn&#39;t have to be difficult nor expensive. Maybe you could start out small with a tomato plant (I did, and got 60lbs off my first harvest) but the point is if everyone did this then the lands used for mass organic farming can be preserved for future generations. Not only that, you are growing your own food which is never bad for the soul.

The former is pretty obvious - Conventional agriculture uses less land. This is especially important nowadays because, currently, most of the productive arable land in the world is already being used. The latter is more nuanced. One of my major criticisms against organic farming is that it relies a lot on highly protectionist agricultural regimes in the US and EU. Organic farming isn&#39;t as practical in the developing world - firstly because most methods are more adapted for temperate climates/soils, secondly because on the business end of things it&#39;s harder for small Senegalese farmers to certify and market their produce and thirdly because, by my understanding, the margins and risks in organic farming tend to be more extreme (which is less of a problem if you are subsidised to hell and back) - there are probably other reasons, it&#39;s just been a while since I studied this.<br><br>Agriculture is realllllly important for development in the Global South - it tends to be a significantly more important sector in terms of employment and GDP than in the North. It&#39;s an area where poorer, tropical countries ought to have a competitive edge for many crops (cheaper labour costs...etc). Paying a premium for organic food ineffect devalues non-organic, which in-effect de-values food from the global South relative to the North.

Literal billions of humans in the third world would be imperiled by a broad switch to organic farming because the associated increase in cost and decrease in supply could push them below food subsistence. Further, if conventional farming can make veggies cheaper it can allow less well off people to eat healthier and live longer lives everywhere.

That\u2019s kind of the main issue. Companies like DOW and Monsanto have been sued (and lost) for their cancerous chemicals leeching out into the environment. If you grow naturally (I don\u2019t like the term organic because people cheat and murky up the waters) ie. using compost (a recycled material) and yard litter, you aren\u2019t having a negative leeching effect and you are minimizing the methane released when those things are put into landfills. It is a fallacy to assume organic farms take more land to produce, in fact more land is committed to \u2018conventional\u2019 (lazy) farming practices to support the agricultural animals industry (another terrible source of pollution and exotoxins). If people buy local from farmers like myself who use older natural methods they can check the farm for unsustainable practices, that is the real solution. Or better yet, grow your own and learn to do it right, then your own land isn\u2019t wasted. There are a plethora or methods to grow an abundance of produce in FAR less space than \u2018conventional\u2019 (I hate that word) row farming. Industry farms use tractors, chemical fertilizers (of which over 70% is leeched into aquifers and rivers), overhead wasteful watering methods (because irrigation lines get in the way of tractors), and tilling which has been known to degrade the soil since the 1927 dust bowl.

While this looked at organic and conventional, what about looking at producing crops in fields, greenhouses, hydroponics, and vertical farms? You can compare the use of water and energy, evaluate the impact of natural sunlight versus artificial (actually the greatest resource for growing, not fertilizers or water), environmental impacts each one has, cost efficiency, and what it means to the consumer.<br><br>The reason for this request, for me, primarily comes from the idea of vertical farming. While I love the idea of less land use and increased local production, they have to recreate the sun. This can be mitigated by using renewable power sources and color specific LED&#39;s, it is still a major factor in its effectiveness. Hydroponics I remember being touted as the future of agriculture several years ago, but now I never hear anything about it. <br><br>I really love the way you guys present things.

Still the best solution is to grow things yourself (cause you can&#39;t trust anyone these days to do it right) or visit a local farm to insure they meet your standards. Cut out the retail middle man cause you will find that they been raking up the prices artificially to make a profit compared to directly buying from the producer. Ecotoxicity is pretty important considering their are more inorganic farms in general then organics. For anyone curious their is an alternative to pesticides that&#39;s non-toixic but if your not a fan of creepy crawly it may not be for you. You want to maintain a population of natural predators of pests (carnivorous insects are easiest to maintain).
