These disasters cause a huge tidal wave of seawater that washes over land, even &quot;above the highest mountains.&quot; At the end it covers the earth with a thick  layer of wet mud, a mixture of sand, clay, lime, fossils of marine and terrestrial animals and small and larger meteorites. Survivors walked over this mud layer before it was hardened. Their footprints are recorded in this layer forever. These disasters are mentioned in ancient books. They tell us about a cycle of disasters that separate the seven world eras. Certainly, a cycle of regularly recurring global disasters cannot be caused by asteroid impacts or volcanic eruptions. The only possible cause is another celestial body, a planet, orbiting our sun in an eccentric orbit. Then it is close to the sun for a short period and after the crossing at a very high speed it disappears into the universe for a long time. We have pictures of this planet approaching the Earth, recorded on cylinder seals. These disasters also create a cycle of civilizations.

But it is unfortunate now that, not all will agree that we are discovering what God has already put there for us to discover, what makes all this interesting, is that all the scientists are allowed to believe in   God, but, not to use God as the answer to everything. Basically its like this . How did that get there?, &#39;&#39;well God made it&#39;&#39; please elaborate, what is it made of?. So studies can draw people closer as it is said at most we know 5% out of %100 of our known universe, what we continue discovering is always more and more exciting and beautiful. All that was created by GOD and any future creations, we will see that all is created for mankind, to entertain us to be occupied for an eternity by His designs, this can be fully understood, when in His do time He God, will restores mankind to perfect health and life. Yes we can ignore any higher power to be added to our equation, just as removing one digit from our equation and not used, but doing so we well know that we can not get a correct answer if we do so. So one last thing to say here is.  (BALANCE). You might say &#39;&#39;don&#39;t mix the physical with the spiritual&#39;&#39;. Well you might be right, but there is just one thing, If He is the Creator of it, we are then deliberately Ignoring Him and do not give the credit where it is doe. We replace God and say (Mother Nature). and when bad things happen on earth like earth Quake, we blame God for it, saying (Its An Act Of God). So the facts and truth cannot be hid away, but can be hid only for a little time, He God Himself makes sure, that mankind will know that He is God above and He alone and His Son receive recognition for His Creations, above and bellow.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

Accordingly, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. So, it makes perfect sense that the planets will move away from WHAT IS THE SUN very, very, very SLIGHTLY. Carefully consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE !!! (Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) E=MC2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. (Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE, AS E=MC2 IS clearly F=ma IN BALANCE.) Carefully consider what is the speed of light (c). A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light (c); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS clearly F=ma ON BALANCE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky !!! Indeed, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Carefully consider what is THE EARTH/ground AND what is THE EYE ON BALANCE !!! The sky is BLUE, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. THE EARTH is a BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE form in relation to the speed of light (c) AND what is THE SUN (AS what is a linked AND BALANCED opposite) pursuant to the universal (and CLEAR) fact that E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. E=MC2 IS clearly proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE. Carefully consider what is THE EARTH/ground !!! Great. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Accordingly, objects (AND WHAT IS the falling MAN) fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE. Gravity is clearly ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy, AS E=MC2 is clearly F=ma IN BALANCE !!! It all CLEARLY makes perfect sense, AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=MC2 is clearly F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE !!! (Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental.) I have mathematically unified physics/physical experience, AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE !!! GREAT !!! ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity !!!<br><br><br>By Frank DiMeglio", "comment_date": "2021-11-26T00:33:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0430", "comment_text": "\u0421ool!", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T16:07:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "x STiCKFiGA x", "comment_text": "How do we know all this?", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T21:21:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Profetas del Camino", "comment_text": "or the false", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T00:23:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Profetas del Camino", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt are you sayng  the real?", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T00:23:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ruben Dekker", "comment_text": "The fragility of earth somehow scares me \ud83d\ude31", "comment_date": "2021-11-22T15:05:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Space Poland", "comment_text": "Are we just gonna ignore the secret dinosaur society", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T03:27:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Pagel", "comment_text": "69% ice and snow, cool", "comment_date": "2021-11-18T23:37:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Denigames 2020", "comment_text": "I do wonder how do people know what is the thickness of the crust or what below it if we only reached 12 km deep???", "comment_date": "2021-11-17T05:11:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vito Didovi\u0107", "comment_text": "I havent seen amazing video like this in a while...

Luckily for our (lack of) intelligence departments, his id/passport made it through the fire inferno in near perfect condition and right into the hands of investigators.. Yup, it must of been him.. Who needs a passport on a domestic flight? Could they be so smart and so stupid at the same time? Why rent a car instead of taking a taxi... By the way to answer the question I posted, WHO DID NOT DIE (WHAT RACE) - well it&#39;s pretty self evident that the state of Israel in conjunction with rogue elements of US intelligence departments collided and committed HIGH TREASON With Little Bush and BIG Bush and Dick (Head) Chaney... There&#39;s a huge reason why this guy takes such an arrogant attitude towards these very valid questions and a reason why he deleted all my comments and postings... Why not let them stand and let people see the evidence for themselves and make up their own damn minds... Is it proper to end a &quot;scientific&quot; claim he does not agree with and use that type of language? No... He&#39;s so pissed off at the truth and the fact that &quot;the official story&quot; is being challenged is very difficult for him to accept.. Again.. Why not allow for the posts I posted to remain and allow other people commenting to view and have them make up their own minds... He claims there is satellites in space... I posted declassified information and current web sites that clearly show that these satellites are on balloons... Clear evidence and he deletes it so nobody here can investigate on their own... That in itself speaks volumes... Anyways if anyone has any questions i have 12 yrs of researching NASA BS and I have tons and tons of proof that will change the mind of anyone with the hardest indoctrinations, I have the antidote..

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGXi_9A__Vc&amp;t=3m42s\">3:42</a>, you say that the lithosphere is a viscous, convective layer below the crust but the asthenosphere is more solid. This is exactly backwards. The lithosphere (which includes the crust) is brittle and behaves how we typically think of a solid. As you move deeper you hit the brittle-ductile transition where rock no longer breaks in a rigid fashion, but it instead flows and convects.

If universe/earth would have been different we would not be here to ask ourself that question - so by definition we are not lucky because there was no chance for it to be different but still observable. If earth would have been slightly different humans would be different as well - so those &quot;different&quot; humans would call themself lucky to exist too. If earth would have been radically different no human could ever ask himself that question. Its not the earth thats &quot;luckily&quot; made to inhabit humans - humans did evolve to live on earth. <br><br>Just imagine rolling 5 dice and waiting for those dice all showing the same number. Its pretty unlucky, right? Imagine a human just pops into existance when you achive that dice roll. Is he going to be suprised to see 5 times the same number on those 5 dice? No. Because thats been the requirement for him to actually pop into existance and notice those dice... <br><br>So you could call earth lucky (or not) to have humans - but calling humans lucky to have an earth they can inhabit is just redundand... rather call us &quot;unlucky&quot; because as far as we know earth is the only planet we are ever going to inhabit. So lets call us &quot;unlucky&quot; because there are like 100.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 we are never going to be able to live on because they are either too far away or so deadly you would die in about the time you can hold your breath... So if you call us lucky to be able to live on earth you as well have to call us unlucky for not being able to live on Mars. And Jupiter. And Saturn. And Venus. And Mercury.

The sun is quite a large star, being more luminous, massive and taking up more volume than 90% of stars in the Milky Way. Most stars in the Milky Way are cool and dim red dwarfs. The closest extrasolar star to us is Proxima Centauri, which is a red dwarf. It is so dim that it is not visible to the naked eye, and it is only 4.25 light years away. 80% of stars are red dwarfs, with most being a similar size and mass to Proxima Centauri. Most of the rest are orange dwarfs, stars with 45 to 80% of the mass of the sun, and having a cooler temperature (usually within 4000-5000k, compared to the Sun&#39;s 5500k). The last one or two percent are smaller yellow dwarfs. The reason you don&#39;t see these more often is simply because they are too dim to be seen in the night sky, red dwarfs from any distance and orange dwarfs from a few parsecs away. We just see more of the top few percent largest and brightest stars in the night sky because they are bright enough to be seen from hundreds or even thousands of light years away.<br><br>In conclusion, yes, there are stars much bigger and brighter than the sun, but the sun is quite a large star itself, and is bigger and brighter than most stars in the Milky Way and probably the Universe.", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T20:43:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u13b7\u13a1. \u13da\u13aaN\u13d3\u13aaY \u13a0\u13ac\u13be\u13a1\u13c6", "comment_text": "Our planet is very ordinary if u see other beautiful planets in other parts of our galaxy and the universe", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T17:20:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Artsie Cat", "comment_text": "Has anyone else noticed that there is always a little Tardis in their videos?", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T16:15:04Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Alagu Naachiammal", "comment_text": "hey guys can you create an video on what if earth had rings", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T12:17:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Ledford", "comment_text": "Mmm thin crust.", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T08:02:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Henry Barber", "comment_text": "Still waiting for that plate tectonics video", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T06:37:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FroztByte's YoutubeAlt", "comment_text": "creationists be triggered.", "comment_date": "2018-05-16T11:58:55Z", "likes_count": 54}, {"comment_by": "Lyka Trinidad", "comment_text": "Seriously speaking, without this channel, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m able to survive school.", "comment_date": "2018-05-16T01:38:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D Port", "comment_text": "And to think some people want to exploit it in an unlimited fashion .", "comment_date": "2018-05-13T18:38:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jader Rich", "comment_text": "There is a reward of one million euros for anyone who can prove that the earth is round; Those who have invented it are Howard George Stirrup and Fernando Mart\u00ednez G\u00f3mez Tejedor, the Spanish investor!", "comment_date": "2018-05-13T17:59:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Asriel Dreemurr", "comment_text": "&quot;EARTH with vast oceans, fertile plains, magnificent mountains, fresh water rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers, orbiting a star which warms us, and gives us energy&quot;<br><b>MORE LIKE</b><br>EARTH with vast deserts, cutted trees, Wierd large cities, dirty polluted rivers, internet, chemical and a destroyed o-zone, orbiting a sun which its sunlight got through the shield, and gives us severe sunburn even in the FRICKING MORNING", "comment_date": "2018-05-13T11:42:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ramiro Velzi", "comment_text": "Nadie pensar\u00eda que un juego llevar\u00eda aqu\u00ed deep town", "comment_date": "2018-05-11T16:24:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SoundCloud in N out", "comment_text": "in German pls \ud83d\ude27", "comment_date": "2018-05-11T12:16:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omar Hamdan", "comment_text": "Earth is not by luck buddy", "comment_date": "2018-05-11T08:32:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crispyfurburger The 4th", "comment_text": "It&#39;s amazing what god created it&#39;s just beautiful", "comment_date": "2018-05-10T23:42:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chintan Meena", "comment_text": "I get emotional listening to kurzgesagt music is it normal ? <br>Really love your work :)", "comment_date": "2018-05-08T02:09:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Travel Maniak", "comment_text": "WOAH INFO IS EXPLODING MY BRAIN", "comment_date": "2018-05-07T19:05:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u9b06\u9905Waffle", "comment_text": "Good", "comment_date": "2018-05-06T10:40:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jim cherkas", "comment_text": "But the Earth is flat so this video can&#39;t be right", "comment_date": "2018-05-05T09:07:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "euan ramos", "comment_text": "Hey how can I get my own Duck?<br>", "comment_date": "2018-05-05T01:25:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ethan Nate Bicomong", "comment_text": "The Titanic wreck was in the north Atlantic I&#39;m true I know everything about titanic the grand staircase the wreck of the stern was like crash car!!!!!", "comment_date": "2018-05-02T09:18:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Safaa Alden", "comment_text": "That\u2019s god creation not by an accident \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2018-05-02T07:35:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sholehuddin Saiful Bahri", "comment_text": "who sees this video on Mars", "comment_date": "2018-05-02T07:09:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hacker the Poop", "comment_text": "So here&#39;s how earth formed.<br>Jupiter: Oh my god Saturn im going to have a baby!<br>Saturn:Cool.<br><br>Planet: * pops up to existince*<br>Jupiter We&#39;ll name it Earth.<br>Saturn: Ok.<br>Earth MAMA!

The reason this solid can convect is because the deeper into the earth, the hotter, the weaker the silicate rock crystalline bonds, the more slippage between the bonds.

One it is twice as massive as the other rock planet cores, since it is made for original Earths core and the planet the collided with us. Second, the heat at the core should force it to be liquid or even gaseous, but the pressure of the outer core and mantel is forcing it to remain solid. Its believed that its this pressure and it being prevented from phase changing is providing energy to keep its temperature so high and for its dynamo effect. By careful study of previous magnetic pole flips, we found that this dynamo effect reaches its peak and eventually grows weaker and weaker until the magnet field collapse (in an average of 100,000 year time frame), until in what could be as little as 12 hours the magnet poles flip and grow in strength but again as intense this new flip poles field strength is. It also suddenly weakens disappears (again over the course of hours) and the poles flip getting stronger and stronger again to point when the beginning to weaken to start the process all over again.", "comment_date": "2015-04-18T07:45:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DoggosAreCool", "comment_text": "I saw a tardis in the river", "comment_date": "2015-04-18T02:08:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CasualPrince", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve just discovered this channel, and would like to say thanks to you people who produce it.

This is a detail worth mentioning in educational material. <br><br>Recent exoplanet discoveries (e.g. a super massive gas giant orbiting within &quot;a hair&#39;s breadth&quot; in astronomical terms of its parent star; also rogue planets orbiting over twice the distance away from their parent stars as Pluto is from our Sun; and many other &quot;surprising&quot; discoveries) have led mainstream astronomers to <b>question the validity</b> of the long-standing accretion disc model. In fact, some of these astronomers (including NASA scientists) have suggested that the accretion model of planetary formation is simply obsolete, and that a new model will have to be developed from scratch. <br><br>It just so happens that a comprehensive and scientifically sound alternative already exists, backed by a Nobel-winning physicist and many other accredited scientists, from fields of study ranging from biology and ancient mythology, to plasma physics and electrical engineering. Unfortunately, there are significant obstacles standing in the way of even valid and scientifically sound theories being accepted into the mainstream. New observations, findings, and discoveries (especially those which are said to have &quot;baffled&quot; and &quot;surprised&quot; establishment scientists) tend to result in eruptions of controversy and contention in the scientific community (a well-known example being the initial response to Galileo&#39;s discovery that the Sun does not revolve around the Earth). Though the response to Galileo&#39;s discovery is an extreme case, it is by no means exceptional. Some segments of our modern-day scientific community have earned themselves a reputation for clinging to their long-held theories like priests to religious dogma. We&#39;re talking about much more than stellar accretion discs. There are a great deal of inconsistencies and outright falsehoods throughout the body of &quot;settled&quot; science. Within the various fields of astrophysics there are falsehoods built upon falsehoods, which have come to be accepted as natural law; the complex interconnectedness of this web makes it virtually impossible to revise or alter a given theoretical model without creating a cascade of logical fallacies that ripple into other models, effectively invalidating the entire construct.<br><br>The natural world is similarly an infinitely complex array of interdependencies, but in nature, things are not this fragile.<br><br>When science is no longer about exploring the unknown and unmasking the mysterious.. when appearing &quot;correct&quot; is valued above a willingness to be proven wrong and admit to error.. when the defense, maintenance, and preservation of a widely accepted lie is more important than being open to new ideas.. then it&#39;s no longer science.<br><br>Over the past couple years, we&#39;ve been seeing a continuous string of press releases announcing, more or less, &quot;Scientists baffled by new discovery A&quot; and &quot;New observations contradict everything we thought we knew about B&quot;. This, in my humble opinion, is a sign that astrophysicists are just beginning to wake up to the realization that they&#39;ve been ignoring a crucial piece of the astrophysical puzzle, even though it&#39;s been staring them in the face the entire time. In the coming months and years, look for this trend in science news to continue as it segues into admissions of error, but also releases detailing new theoretical models set to replace old ones.<br><br>If you read the above novella, <b>thanks for your time and open mind</b>.
