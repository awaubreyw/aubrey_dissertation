LET US ASSUME THE UNIVERSE FORMED IS UNIVERSE-1 THIS UNIVERSE IS CONSTANTLY EXPANDING AS I SAID BEFORE. IN THE UNIVERSE BANY BIG BANG HAS OCCURRED AND FORMED MANY OTHER UNIVERSES . THESE UNIVERSES HAVE BIG BANGS IN THEM TOO AND SO ON....... . THESE PROCESS WAS STOPPED WHEN THE LAST UNIVERSE WAS TOO SMALL AND DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY AN SPACE FOR FORMING THE BIG BANG WAS IMPOSSIBLE. THE LAST UNIVERSE IS OUR UNIVERSE. IF WE HAD ENOUGH TECHNOLOGY FOR REACHING OUR UNIVERSE\u2019S EDGE THEN WE WOULD SEE THERE ARE MORE THAN A BILLION UNIVERSES OF OUR SIZE. ALL THISE UNIVERSES ARE AGAIN BOUNDED BY ANOTHER UNIVERSE.

Gravity is a force that acts between two bodies and the acceptance that it can act on itself is again untested and frankly untestable.

Dark Energy/Matter are the equivalent of Ptolemy&#39;s epicycles which were ad hoc adjustments to keep a failing model relevant. When Einstein brilliantly derived his gravity model it was the present consensus that space was void of all matter and that planets were isolated islands. We now know that this is not so, that planets are connected via electric currents, magnetic fields and gravity, with the latter being the weakest by 10^39 times to an electric field. Many are the observational discrepancies with respect to the Einstein model and as such they are in effect falsifications of said model. Sadly, even within science there can be a dogmatic attitude and even questioning Einstein&#39;s model will cause one to be derided and demeaned, and as such, regardless of the validity of a paper you write, it will not get published. <br><br><br><br>In a nutshell, what he presents is a good explanation of the standard model, but considering the number of observational discrepancies that the standard model did not predict, should one still be clinging to it.

The bulk of western and central Tibet (\u00dc-Tsang) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in\u00a0Lhasa,\u00a0Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under\u00a0Mongoland\u00a0Chinese\u00a0overlordship. Thus Tibet remained a\u00a0suzerainty\u00a0of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.[1]\u00a0The eastern regions of\u00a0Kham\u00a0and\u00a0Amdo\u00a0often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the\u00a0Battle of Chamdo. Most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of\u00a0Sichuan\u00a0and\u00a0Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.[2]Following the\u00a0Xinhai Revolution\u00a0against the\u00a0Qing dynasty\u00a0in 1912, Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of\u00a0Tibet Area\u00a0(\u00dc-Tsang). The region subsequently declared its\u00a0independence\u00a0in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent\u00a0Chinese Republican government.[3]\u00a0Later, Lhasa took control of the western part of\u00a0Xikang, China. The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following the\u00a0Battle of Chamdo, Tibet became\u00a0incorporated into the People&#39;s Republic of China, and the previous Tibetan government was abolished in 1959 after a failed uprising.[4]\u00a0Today,\u00a0China\u00a0governs western and central Tibet as the\u00a0Tibet Autonomous Region\u00a0while the eastern areas are now mostly\u00a0ethnic autonomous prefectures\u00a0within\u00a0Sichuan,\u00a0Qinghai\u00a0and other neighbouring provinces. There are\u00a0tensions regarding Tibet&#39;s political status[5]\u00a0and dissident groups that are active in exile.[6]\u00a0Tibetan activists in Tibet have been arrested or tortured.[7]The economy of Tibet is dominated by\u00a0subsistence agriculture, though\u00a0tourism\u00a0has become a growing industry in recent decades. The dominant religion in Tibet is\u00a0Tibetan Buddhism; in addition there is\u00a0B\u00f6n, which is similar to Tibetan Buddhism,[8]\u00a0and there are also\u00a0Tibetan Muslims\u00a0and Christian minorities. Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the\u00a0art,\u00a0music, and\u00a0festivals\u00a0of the region. Tibetan architecture reflects\u00a0Chinese\u00a0and\u00a0Indian\u00a0influences. Staple foods in Tibet are roasted\u00a0barley,\u00a0yak\u00a0meat, and\u00a0butter tea.", "comment_date": "2018-01-04T04:26:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Avi Gindratt", "comment_text": "a physical expression of the neutrality of existence", "comment_date": "2018-01-04T03:46:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alpha k", "comment_text": "I really love background music", "comment_date": "2018-01-03T15:42:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gustav Drews", "comment_text": "Laugh out loud when they do open that black hole Shelby like 6000 years old m*<b>*********</b> what before I even reach it", "comment_date": "2018-01-02T22:58:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ken Harris", "comment_text": "sci-fi is so neat.", "comment_date": "2018-01-02T18:46:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Connor Peters", "comment_text": "This video contains the common misconception that iron is the element which cannot be fused higher for releasing energy.

Stars do not develop &#39;layers&#39;, as there are intense currents moving everything around and mixing everything up.  Our sun does not have a ball of helium at its center.  The helium is dispersed throughout.  Also, iron DOES fuse inside of stars!  But, when iron fuses, it releases less energy than it requires for the fusion to take place.  Which reduces, rather than increases, the total amount of energy in the star.  All lighter elements release more energy when they fuse, which fuels further fusion.  Once a star starts fusing iron, it starts losing overall energy, which is what eventually causes the radiation pressure to drop below the crushing force of gravity.  I&#39;m no astrophysicist, so I imagine there are many other inaccuracies and mistakes, but I don&#39;t know enough to identify them.", "comment_date": "2016-05-24T13:17:05Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "MrCalhoun", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3aV7U-aik&amp;t=0m04s\">0:04</a> Nice use of the metaphor from Lev Landau. <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3aV7U-aik&amp;t=1m06s\">1:06</a> This value for the Chandrasekhar mass only holds true for Y_e = 0.5.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3aV7U-aik&amp;t=1m34s\">1:34</a> You did forgot the subsequent neutrino emission.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3aV7U-aik&amp;t=1m47s\">1:47</a> Actually those are masses derived from observations.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3aV7U-aik&amp;t=2m41s\">2:41</a> Exactly.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3aV7U-aik&amp;t=3m11s\">3:11</a> And if we observe too massive neutron stars, this will outrule the existence of exotic matter.<br><br>Did you guys have any scientific consultant for this video?", "comment_date": "2016-05-24T07:25:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shadowninja 569", "comment_text": "It&#39;s a shame public schools here in the us show bill nye the science guy, but not videos like this.  :(", "comment_date": "2016-05-24T07:06:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RickTrajan", "comment_text": "what if a neutron star collide with another neutron star?", "comment_date": "2016-05-24T04:16:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "cozmic brandon", "comment_text": "hey could you explain magnetars for us iv heard about them but I know nothing about them", "comment_date": "2016-05-23T22:31:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LegendaryGamer16", "comment_text": "I thought that carbon fused to nitrogen and not neon?", "comment_date": "2016-05-23T19:27:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drew Layton", "comment_text": "Chuck Norris plays pool with Neutron stars.", "comment_date": "2016-05-23T17:23:07Z", "likes_count": 38}, {"comment_by": "Fernando Reyes", "comment_text": "&quot;I&#39;d rather get thrown into a neutron star then pull duty again.&quot; - overheard in the US armed forces circa Heidelberg Hospital 2012", "comment_date": "2016-05-23T15:37:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "herbin45", "comment_text": "question, could a planet build life as we know of it near a neutron star. when i say near i mean as far it can come whilst not heating over 1000 degrees.", "comment_date": "2016-05-23T10:40:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Macky D", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3aV7U-aik&amp;t=2m31s\">2:31</a> &quot;the surface is super flat with irregularities of 5 mm max&quot; really? it can&#39;t be a sphere if the surface has 5mm max irregularities, literally impossible. <b>I call bullshit</b>. not saying it&#39;s not a sphere.

This is answered by the question, why is there Gold on earth - or any other element heavier than iron? All the matter in the Universe, with some very few exceptions was once created inside a star - the difference between big gang nucleosynthesis and stellar nuclearsynthesis. It is true that inside the core of a star, like our sun for example, you will not see a nucleosynthesis beyond Iron. It simply can&#39;t really happen for the reasons mentioned in the video. However, if a star is big enough, let us say 10 times the mass of our Sun, it can fuse iron and all the other materials together that we see today. This happens at the near end of the life time of a very massive star. When they become super or even hyper nova. For a very short moment the temperature and preasure in the outer layers of the star become so high that they allow the fusion of heavier atoms than iron up to Uranium which is the natural border. A heavier star will have more preasure and a higher temperature, they will also be brighter emitting more radiation. The fusion at the end of the cycle will be shorter and shorter. Where the fusion of Hydrogen to Helium takes place within a few million years the fusion of elements leading to Uranium happens in a couple of seconds! For the purpose of this video it is probably enough to stop with iron, as they are not facutally wrong, as far as you stay with smaller stars, however it should be important to keep in mind that yeah, the other elements we have today also come from stars.

Once that material is compacted then why are there layers? Where is the material for the next layer coming from? If I have a hand full of clay balls I can group them together in a sphere loosely. That will take up a certain volume, yes? Once I compact those balls tightly though I won&#39;t have that same volume it will be smaller yes? Well in this depiction the volume stays the same after everything is compacted? How? Wouldn&#39;t there have to be more material coming to the star? Where is it coming from? Wouldn&#39;t that mean that gravity is actually always out performing radiation?<br><br>The 2 forces that control a star&#39;s balance are GRAVITY - the force sucking in towards a core and RADIATION PRESSURE which forces the star outwards. What starts the fusion reaction of the core? Is it just gravity taking over and compacting the material on the top layer?  I&#39;m completely new to this so please don&#39;t rip my head off if I say something stupid. Something is burning hydrogen for fuel because eventually the hydrogen runs out. Hydrogen is being used in order to create helium. (Check properties). If the star is big enough the hydrogen turns to carbon (Why?).  If fusion continues the star will become layered like an onion. Each layer consisting of evidence that fusion took place. So there would be a layer for then hydrogen is fused into becoming helium and another for when helium fuses into carbon and so on.  But the layers are in reverse. Instead of wrapping a ball with a layer it&#39;s more like injecting a ball with another substance. Final fusion cycle (  Hydrogen - Helium - Carbon - Neon - Oxygen - Silicon - lastly Iron (why iron? is it because of its density?)   Once the fusion cycle ends after iron is created then the radiation pressure drops (Why? Is it because the star can&#39;t condense anymore than it has so it gives up trying? Why?) exposing the star to implosion because the 2 opposing forces keeping it in balance are no longer in place and gravity DOMINATES the equation.   <br>So the star implodes destroying all material (yes/no?) So does the iron no longer keep it&#39;s properties and ISN&#39;T iron. Are all the molecular bonds of each element disrupted.<br>All the particles come slamming together causing a grenade<br>Quantum mechanical propulsion  - the atoms have neutrons spinning around them  - that force - and I&#39;m assuming that since gravity is at work and all the atoms are being squished the moving neutrons circling each atom come into contact.  This reaction causes the protons and electrons that make up the body to combine and make neutrons. All the neutrons suck together causing an explosion.<br>Neutron Stars are 1 to 3 times the size of our sun and then it is compacted down to the size of a 25 miter wide ball, maybe the size of a large warehouse.

I must admit they are of an acceptable quality. Hypothetically, OVP could be an okay person inside -- the kind people who are tolerable. He might even volunteer his time at homeless shelters for seniors and minorities who are studying for final exams.\u00a0<br><br>All-in-all, I am pretty much satisfied here. After having watched every video on this channel, I noticed some strange things, however. This would later become a consistent theme throughout The Kurzgesagt platform. That&#39;s why I decided to document it here for science. Hopefully, someone can explain what&#39;s going on. Here&#39;s my thoughts, overall. These presentational social content productions authored by OVP, evoked many strange, unfamiliar, and what appears to be non-undesirable sensations.\u00a0<br><br>It felt like a good inner feeling instead of a negative one, but I was okay with this at the time. It was a very new and \u00a0interesting experience, -- certainly not bad. Definitely disturbing. It was perhaps the apparent silence in my head that was the most surprising side effect. The sudden unexplained absence of most the ordinary murderous voices in my head was frightening at first. Very disconcerting, to say the least.\u00a0<br><br>Any of these unexpected psychological anomalies notwithstanding, such as the reduction of usual feelings of malevolence, I feel alright.-- albeit, slightly shaken. Nevertheless, despite these unexplainable inherent peculiarities, the content here did not cause me pain or duress. In fact, not once throughout my entire viewing time here did I find myself wanting to suddenly kill over dead from some type of super rare instantly fatal spontaneous terminal visual/auditory cancer.\u00a0<br><br>In a nutshell, seldom are the moments where I experience not wanting to be shot into the center of the sun. It was definitely an acceptable production suite of social media. I feel pretty good. I even decided to put him on my list of people to not kill after taking over planet earth. I am very excited; to date, this is the first person ever added to the global neutral non-aggression list. It didn\u2019t even exist until now, because I had always planned to destroy \u00a0the entirety of human life forms altogether. Apparently though, some of you hominids are okay in my book, \u00a0-- or in this case, a list with a single name on it.\u00a0<br><br>Who am I kidding? I was literally blown away here. Love the channel. Love the style. Love the format. The tone, the pacing, delivery. It\u2019s perfect.
