There is a 97% chance of death but he didn&#39;t include that most of the people who got it were hosts with weak immune systems. Also, Amoeba doesn&#39;t thrive in typical lakes or pools, it thrives in still river sediment that must be higher than 46\u00b0C (115\u00b0F) (The heat of a hot bath). And your body&#39;s average temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8F) and reaches a max of 42-43\u00b0C (107.6F). So your body wouldn&#39;t get warm enough for the amoeba to thrive.

Like a mixture of Spore Maneater and Plague INC where you need to survive in the body of a human. You need to eat and try to kill some bacteria, fight against stronger foes until you get notice by the human&#39;s defence system.

I also have a suggestion for a video. Someone mentioned to me recently that new innovations and technology have done nothing but made us circle back to the time when there was no technology. Like we used books for research once, which one could lose easily, and now there is cloud based software which stores important data and can also be lost just as easily. Basically it is the fact that technology has not made any real impact on humanity and that we were the same without it, or even better off.

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T16:37:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "molesniper666", "comment_text": "Nope nope nope.

We learned a lot in it. There were some lectures about parasites. The teacher was someone who was an expert in this field. I learned a lot in that course. <br>My advice would be:<br><br>1. Never bathe in unknown waters, especially hot waters. This brain eating parasite isn&#39;t the only parasite you can get while bathing in such water. There is a reason why I prefer bathing in my own bathtub. <br><br>2. Always cook your food correctly, and don&#39;t eat anything raw, including sushi. I personally don&#39;t eat sushi, and I cook my meat very well. Parasites in fish are more common than one thinks. Sushi is often treated, depending on the place, but it isn&#39;t a guarantee. When you cook the meat, the parasites are more likely to die.<br><br>3. Wear a full body cover when in the wild. Have good shoes too. Also, cover your head. A hat is crucial, because it will stop botflies to put eggs into you. Botflies prefer to add their eggs into animals, but some specific species can add them to humans. By having a hat, you can prevent them to add eggs into your head. <br><br>4. Never eat snails. Snails are the secondary host to multiple parasites found in fish. It&#39;s part of the circle. They stay in snails before they travel to fish. <br><br>I have more, but these will do for now, because they are the most important one.", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T03:17:45Z", "likes_count": 1018}, {"comment_by": "John Ryan", "comment_text": "Just imagine how destructive this thing must be that it has to grow extra mouths just so it can eat more brains.", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T03:15:59Z", "likes_count": 194}, {"comment_by": "Franco C\u00e1ceres", "comment_text": "Steve Taylor portrayed as a cute bird is the most wonderful thing I&#39;ve seen in a while.

It showed how politically motivated the choice of topic was in the first place, and how even science has to tip-toe to please the &quot;sponsors&quot;, and not to scare people or make them apathetic. So, a pessimistic video followed by an optimistic one, on the same subject. Hm. Eyebrows raised... and now this, a clearly fantastic, masterful SCAREMONGERING video, Hollywood style?

When in particularly favourable conditions (or exceedingly unfavourable), bacteria have a method of forming pseudo-mulitcellular colonies called biofilms. The most common one most people interact with daily is the plaque that forms on our teeth pretty much 24/7. Have you ever wondered how bacteria can form a substance so hard that, if you don&#39;t continually brush and floss them off, you often need metal tools to clear off? The answer is that the plaque forming bacteria which are attempting to consume your teeth form a biofilm, working together to shield themselves from our immune system, saliva and physical forces like flossing and brushing in order to both make it harder to remove them as well as make it easier to eat our teeth. The &quot;blob&quot; of bacteria will generate intra-cellular bonds to link themselves together and will begin dividing the work of defence and feeding amongst themselves which requires a great deal of signaling and, if you find a chemical in your body, there is a 99% chance it was first used by bacteria billions of years ago and has stuck around all the way up until now (I have a biochem degree, it&#39;s kinda just a rule of thumb you end up learning). To add to the probability they use that kind of signaling, we have recently found that the microbiota in our guts actually directly releases neurotransmitters and that is what actually gives us our cravings for specific foods... usually bacteria that have been raised on a food continue to crave it which is why you can easily get stuck wanting unhealthy food if you only eat it for a moderate amount of time<br><br>However, in the case of our ameba, it is likely that our terrifying brain-eating species here is used to hunting biofilms and so is attracted by the neurotransmitters they would use. Attacking a mass of cells gives far more food than hunting single targets but one of the main problems is that biofilms are far more resilient and ready to fight than most solo bacteria so it would need adaptations to stand a chance against its prey. The attack chemicals are likely meant to scatter defensively oriented clumps, the feeding cups are likely to tear out chunks of teamed defensive fighters and the anti-complement defence is likely to overcome any chemical defences the biofilm produces (often made to make it inhospitable to competing microbes). This ameba would then be geared for war with far more varied and hardened team-strategies than we can put up especially in an immune-system excluded zone like the central nervous system so all it needs is to make it their alive for it to be the best feeding bonanza it could ever hope for... if unicellular life is somehow capable of emotions like hope...", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T08:31:08Z", "likes_count": 77}, {"comment_by": "Skiddy Crimson", "comment_text": "I wish he was my Science or Chemistry Teacher, Lol.", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T08:31:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u043a\u043e", "comment_text": "Thanks, Kurzgesagt, now I have one more phobia", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T08:30:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vla\u010dko", "comment_text": "Me who has taken a lot water trough nose trough yers \ud83d\ude31<br><br><b>Sees end</b> \ud83d\ude0c", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T08:30:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Igor Yugure", "comment_text": "Wtf Kurzgesagt?!

This species of amoeba is what I&#39;ve specialised this in with my work. I just want to highlight infection rates are so low we simply don&#39;t have enough of a sample size to give a solid time frame from symptoms to death. But just to highlight a few things;<br><br>A week from infection to death is pretty must spot on, although before you have time to register the more severe symptoms, you&#39;re more likely to be in a coma happening around the 48 hour mark. <br><br>The main point which is just not accurate is treatment. Amphotericin B is antifungal which is capable of killing N. fowleri inside of a person. It can also be used in combination therapy with Rifampin. There are a few others listed on the CDC but I don&#39;t recall any of the named one (bar the ones I posted) when writing up my work / grant applications from the published literature. There is an argument to be made this isn&#39;t counted as a treatment as the target of the compounds are for something else. We&#39;re just fortunate they work on other things like N. fowleri. <br><br>The problem with N. fowleri is not the drugs its actually diagnosis. In most cases, if not very nearly all of them it is misdiagnosed as something else (due to how common the symptoms are) which leads to treatment which is ineffective. By the time a PCR is done to identify the infection, thats when the irreversible damage has been done. Just for point of reference, up to 24 hours without symptoms, symptoms kick in, standard treatment for something follows, then a PCR which can take 12-24 hour time frame. <br><br>Furthermore, as to initial infection. The most common way (at least in the states) of being infected isn&#39;t any of the reasons listed in the video (IIRC water sports and poorly chlorinated pools come in at 2+3), its actually nasal spray. The data shows in the states a lot of the patients had refilled their nasal sprays from tap water instead of the correct medium to cut costs. This gives the most direct, easiest route for the amoeba to take. <br><br>For anyone that&#39;s still interested, the condition is called Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis.

That loss of sense of smell/taste from COVID19?  That&#39;s because the virus infected the chunk of your brain that handles those senses.

Every year, on average you lose about .03% of your brain to random injuries or diseases.  A serious stroke can destroy 1% of your brain tissue, which is similar to &quot;aging&quot; you by 30 years overnight, but in a concentrated area of the brain instead of bits and pieces everywhere.  There&#39;s no known method of reversing the damage, and by the time you are 90, losing 3% of your brain function is nothing compared to all your other health issues at that point.  It&#39;s an interesting question if, e.g., we ever halt the rest of the aging process or learn how to do brain transplants.  A 200 year old brain is going to have serious mental damage no matter how the rest of the body functions, and we could accidentally create our own version of hell if we ever figure out how to make us last 1000 years.", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T15:05:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Your Questions - Answered!

They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can\u2019t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T14:28:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nova Octurnous", "comment_text": "FAT DUCK CONFIRMED IN KURZGESAGT UNIVERSE <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OPg-ksxZ4Y&amp;t=8m49s\">8:49</a>", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T14:28:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremie St-Louis", "comment_text": "moral of the story : keep your immune system strong", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T14:28:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "# Brawl Stars", "comment_text": "Really good animation, many info, great job! :)", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T14:28:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ricarda Lavash", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OPg-ksxZ4Y&amp;t=0m30s\">0:30</a> oh my god i can&#39;t <b>g e t    o u t    o f    m y    h e a d</b>", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T14:28:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kemical Hazard", "comment_text": "Perhaps flooding other parts of the body (like the nasal cavity or stomache) with Acetylcholine may trick the amoeba to retreat into said parts, then you might be able to kill it?", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T14:28:30Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Raoul SITBON", "comment_text": "as a discord mod, touching water or taking shower or even going outside is not a part of my daily routine.<br>Guess im safe", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T14:28:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charlie Crome", "comment_text": "ah thanks, i was looking for another reason to be anxious.", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T14:28:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Niels Symons", "comment_text": "Its gonna take some time for me to get used to these amazing new animations...", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T14:28:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "uNnHkP8mza", "comment_text": "Please bring back the old human designs!", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T14:28:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Following Curiosity", "comment_text": "I am never going to watch a video on dangerous bacteria.
