First off, since we already established that we can use &quot;magic&quot; to manipulate the moon&#39;s orbit in the video, then we can safely say that we can just use &quot;magic&quot; to completely kill off the moon&#39;s orbital velocity and it will fall in a straight line towards the earth. That would be the predicted cosmic catastrophe that happens when the moon actually crashes into the earth. In the video however, the sort of magic used to destabilize the moon&#39;s orbit can be summarized as gradually decreasing the moon&#39;s orbital velocity thereby reducing the moon&#39;s orbital radius. This causes the moon to hit the Roche limit as per what the video reveals.<br><br>Both of these scenarios do not necessarily break the laws of physics theoretically, as long as you have the massive amount of energy required to stop the moon from orbiting at all. The only difference is the time it takes to input that said energy. The scenario where the moon straight crashes into earth means that the energy was spent near instantaneously to stop the moon while the scenario shown in the video requires the energy to be inputted over the span of a year. Either way, both scenarios are completely plausible.<br><br>The title of the video is misleading in that it asks for what happens in one case but goes and explains an outcome for a different case altogether, even though both cases have completely different but equally interesting results. <br><br>Personally I would like to see another video of what ACTUALLY happens when the moon crashes into the Earth, just for the sake of correction.<br><br>Source: I play Kerbal Space Program and Universe Simulator.

Wall Streeters and banksters are trying to obfuscate: they are trying to do with finance what some scientists do &quot;blinding you with science&quot; by using complex terms and very confusing explanations. <br><br>For example, what is being missed is that the &quot;Federal&quot; Reserve is privately owned by the ultrarich owners of its district banks AND not BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. &quot;Coincidentally,&quot; the &quot;Fed&quot; gives billions of dollars of ultra low interest loans at 2.5% per year to those very ultrarich people&#39;s banks (which is below the real inflation rate), and their banks then lend that exact money at 25% a year or more to waitresses, cab drivers, autoworkers, and teachers, etc., who actually pay taxes and actually contribute to society. It is amazingly profitable -- FOR THE ULTRARICH. (Scrt: If you research, you will see that Putin was not adequately sanctioned after he stole Crimea so he was enable to rearm and funded for years with Western funds, because then the ultrarich would have lost their investments in Russia, after the ultrarich actually had SELECTED Putin to rule Russia from many candidates. Read the history!)<br><br>Lawyers do the same, and so we have a legal system in which the best liar wins, the wealthy play games and pay lawyers to make evidence/witnesses unavailable or disappear, and bribery (sometimes by contributions to elect a judge that they then own) enables the ultrarich to avoid liability. Through settlements they can also force witnesses to keep quiet by requiring them to sign non-disclosure agreements (&quot;NDA&quot;), so I would sure like to hear what the 13 year old girl who sued the orange blubber ball claiming that he sexually abused her when she was a 13 year old  would say in detail, but the NDA that I bet he had her sign will make her unavailable as a witness forever.<br><br>For example, if the Sacklers did not have that incredibly GENEROUS, bankruptcy judge (who must be on their Christmas gift list for life, along with that judge&#39;s children, grand children, and great-grandchildren being rewarded by the Sackler&#39;s $10 billion family fortune for decades) approve their &quot;bankruptcy settlement&quot; to limit their personal liability what would happen? (That bankruptcy judge should be investigated and have all of his calls wiretapped for life by the FBI, in my humble opinion. I suspect through his approval of this settlement, that bankruptcy judge and his family, down to his last descendants, effectively won the lottery, each year for the rest of their lives.) <br><br>Thousands have died due to opioids reportedly produced by and pushed by their company. But for that WONDERFUL, GENEROUS settlement that this bankruptcy judge approved AGAIN, there would be many, many lawsuits against them and their company. <br><br>Once the Sacklers lost one case (for example, the 101st case), got a judgment against them, and it became a final judgment, then in all the next 899+ lawsuits the jury would be told that the Sacklers already had been found liable for misconduct due, e.g., to negligence, and as a result all that the next 899+ juries would only determine the amount of damages for causing the deaths of thousands of Americans. The liability on each case would have been GIGANTIC, particularly if they had been found to have acted intentionally and without any concern for the welfare of their customers, so punitive damages could be awarded: each jury could then award billions of dollars in punitive damages in EACH case, because the intent of such damages is to deter and their $10 billion fortune means that it would take billions in punitive damages to deter and punish them enough. <br><br>Thus, that GENEROUS bankruptcy judge saved the Sackler family from the risk of losing every cent they have, except for exempt property, like ordinary Americans lose everything regularly. The state AGs that backed this GENEROUS settlement to help the Sacklers, so they can keep BILLIONS will no doubt also have golden futures and have effectively each won the lottery. They will each doubtless get Sackler support, because the Sacklers will be deeply grateful, for decades and will become governors or US senators.", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T07:03:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan G", "comment_text": "This would be one hell of a movie", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T06:46:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dinosauce", "comment_text": "how did the moon got there in the first place anyway.

In every quiet evening, between the sighs of the elderly and the laughter of children, there is a legend circulating. In the distant past, there was a glorious and great magical era, when human beings did not live under the mountains and walk in the dim light, but in the huge cities on the ground. Everyone can be equally bathed in the divine sunshine, and there is no need to worry that their residence is too far away from the sunshine. People even argue about which time the sun is greater at noon or in the evening. What&#39;s even more amazing is that in that era, there were no magnificent silver arches in the sky, but a disc of white brilliance hung in the distant sky. On every clear night, when people looked up, they could see. to it. Later, the people on the ground were no longer satisfied with watching the disc from a distance, they wanted to get closer to it, so they decided to pull it over and made great efforts for it. Although the human beings in that magical age had powers far beyond the present, it was still extremely difficult, but in the end, the effort paid off, and the disk began to approach the earth little by little. But unfortunately, this effort eventually led to a terrible disaster. The gods were angry with humans for trying to get their hands on the white and flawless disk, so the sea swelled, flooded the land, made volcanoes erupt, covered the sky, made the earth tremble and tear shattered the city. In the midst of this chaos, the Age of Magic came to an abrupt end, and with the exception of our most fortunate ancestors, the vast majority of human beings were killed, and even the disc was taken away, and humanity could no longer see its splendor. But the disc was pitiful, and it tore off a part of itself and made a silver arch that stood above the sky, as evidence of that magical age, and an eternal epitaph.", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T13:49:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam, Mohammed S", "comment_text": "Amazing \ud83d\ude2d\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T13:32:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eitan Yshayahu", "comment_text": "@kurzgesast             why did you chose this name", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T13:05:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yus Ri", "comment_text": "i love your exploring apps. how small a newtron and how big the universe are mind blown\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T12:05:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P Houpe", "comment_text": "Youtube just blocked Russia today youtube channel.

The gravitational force of the Earth is 70-80 times that of the Moon and the Sun. It is the magnetic plates on the Earth that allow them to rotate at a certain distance. The sun is neither too big nor far from the earth as described. An object that far away and in a vacuum could neither provide sufficient warmth nor give light through the earth&#39;s protective layers. These days, some governments are trying to make artificial sun, the heat they give is many times more than the sun does, so everyone is trying to play god.

He packs his thing to get ready for anthing he might face, he opens the door, and sees the world destroyed and darkened, the thick clouds made it dark and a the rust red light make it look like the surface of mars. He steps out for the first time in months and starts scavenging for food and anything or anyone that has survived. Then, the acid rain starts to fall, he has no choice but to take shelter in a small high-rise building and wait for the rain to stop. While in the building, he starts looking around for any more supplies, then he hears a rattling noise in the floor above, he slowly makes his way upstairs to investigate what had happened. He then peaks into a room, and then he saw a girl on the floor unconscious, he then slowly enters the room terrified for this is the first time in months he had seen another human. He sees the girl is badly injured, and tends her wounds with the supplies that he got. After treating her, he saw the girl is holding a book. When he goes to inspect it, the girl woke up and was startled, the main character then explained what had happened, the girl then thanks him for saving her life. He then asks her what is the book she was holding, she just said that it was something very special to her. They waited for the rain to stop and they headed back the main characters bunker when a sudden earthquake occurred. They run back as fast as they can to the bunker and sealed the doors.<br>Now they start living together in the bunker. (Insert some random filler moments of the living together)<br><br>The 2 then starts bonding and the main character starts to like her. He msutered up his courage to tell her about his feelings. But when he went up to her, she started to feel large amounts of pain and started coughing blood. Apparently her wound is infected (or anything bad) and she just hid it from him. He then tries to save her but her situation is worsening, he decided that she needed more help, he takes her and a bog of supplies and leaves his bunker to find someone that can help save her. He starts running through destroyed buildings, flooded streets, and a wasteland where nothing alive can be seen, he starts to give up and breaks down. She then give him the book that she kept. Just before he was about to give up, 2 men starts appearing out of the foggy wasteland, and they starts helping them, they enter a bunker with many people who&#39;ve survived the apocalypse that had fallen upon them. Humanity has survived.<br><br>Final part:<br>They spend a month or so inside the bunker the girl hospitalized and the main character met alot of people inside it. (Insert some bunker content here)<br>He then reads the book that the girl gave him, and, surprise surprise its the book that the scientist wrote (supposed to be a surprising point in the story, but i wrote the scientist story at the beginning)<br>He then learns the scientist&#39;s prediction, the main character tries to remember everything that had happened before, and the prediction is somewhat accurate. He spends days interviewing the people living in the bunker on what they remember, and on the night, he visit the girl on how she&#39;s doing.<br>The main character finally pieces together the all of the information, he then learns that<br>They are at the final stages of the moon crashing on earth. And then, at excatly that moment, an earthquake occured, an earthquake so strong that is destroys the bunker and kills many people, a huge crack on the surface led to water going inside the bunker and flooding it. The mc, knowing that the girl is at the lower part of the bunker rushes to go down the bunker while the water fills up the bunker. <br>He makes it just in time and they swam up to the upper parts of the bunker. And they try to get to the surface, they reached the top of the bonker and climed up the rocks to get to the surface. The reached the top, but the ground they were standing on cracked and the girl falls but the mc catches her just in time.<br>Now, the girl hangs on as the mc tried to save her from falling into the deep hole. <br>The mc cant bring the girl up, he tries and tries but he cant.<br>The girl realizing the situation, finally accepted it.<br>She calms the mc down and tells him her final goodbyes, and she also told him that the keys of starting civilization again is in the book she gave him.<br>She told him to survive and live to start another civilization, to repair the world.<br>She finally said her true name, and who she was.<br>And she said that she loves the mc, and lets go. <br>The mc heartbroken<br>Reaches into his satchel and gets the book. He the read the authors name, and there it was, she was the scientist who predicted the event. He looks up at the sky, as meteor showers rained from the heavens, and bright and beautiful lines in the sky were visible, the apocalypse is over. the mc now steps on to a new world. With rings in the night sky.<br><br><br>(Note: i wrote this when i was sitting in the toilet taking a dump, so i dont really know if the story is good hehehe.)<br><br><br>Update: if this gets a many likes, ill rewrite the story and make it an actual novel.", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:21:38Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Vipin Bhatnagar", "comment_text": "Amazing explanation \ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:20:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fz The Amazighiya", "comment_text": "Thank God that God exist.", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:20:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bernie Sanders", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t think that would be very good for the stock market", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:20:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SeizenLaw", "comment_text": "Earth basically turns into a Sega Saturn logo.", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:19:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaelyn", "comment_text": "The moon is not going to Crash on the Earth\ud83c\udf0d", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:19:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jingyang Lin", "comment_text": "Isnt there a movie called Moonfall?", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:17:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mixed_Emotions_69-96", "comment_text": "This guys voice.", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:13:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Su tart", "comment_text": "The cameraman be like:What how am i not dead yet?", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:11:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silience", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lheapd7bgLA&amp;t=1m23s\">1:23</a> Wilhelm scream", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:09:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anagh Paul - CST", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lheapd7bgLA&amp;t=10m02s\">10:02</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lheapd7bgLA&amp;t=10m27s\">10:27</a> was the background music of Interstellar", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:05:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JASdeW phone edition", "comment_text": "You said what would happen if the moon CRASHED into the earth <br>This is what would happen if gravity was turned off THAT is clickbait YOU LIED TO US WHY WOULD LIE TO US, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT WHY??", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:03:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roby Matta", "comment_text": "\u201cSchools will remain open\u201d", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:00:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ElectricTrooper", "comment_text": "Chills at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lheapd7bgLA&amp;t=10m22s\">10:22</a>", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T05:00:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Random", "comment_text": "Alternate Titles: &quot;What happens if 2020 recurs&quot;,  &quot;2020, In A Nutshell&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T04:59:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gaurav Bhagwaria", "comment_text": "I got nightmares like sun is crashing to the earth and I watching it from my phone and when the wave is come to me and my heart was beating so hard and we all just finished then we turned into souls and we landed on the earth that was a dream in my dream.", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T04:59:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meta Rock", "comment_text": "So earth becomes a semi Saturn\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02?!", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T04:58:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BeatboxingBuffBoi", "comment_text": "Anybody else getting flashbacks to hermitcraft season eight!?!?!", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T04:55:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P O G C H A M P S O L D I E R", "comment_text": "Imagine this entire situation is the same thing happened to saturn", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T04:52:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tu\u1ea5n D\u0169ng Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lheapd7bgLA&amp;t=10m06s\">10:06</a> it reminds me of Vault 111 in Fallout 4", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T04:50:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Skull Kid - Kazooie", "comment_text": "Majoras Mask references &lt;3", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T04:50:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "-D-Tech-", "comment_text": "hermitcraft season 8<br><br><br><br><br>bottom text", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T04:48:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "blake koning", "comment_text": "no one:<br><br>the moon: egg(splode)", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T04:47:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CrazyJayBe", "comment_text": "No way!!<br><br>They referenced Majora&#39;s Mask!!!<br><br>I......

It takes place a couple of months into the process, where the moon has spiraled toward the earth for sixty days and news of the coming moonfall has permeated our entire global population.  The tides are rising high enough to flood the coastal cities every day.  High tide eventually make skyscrapers look like the fingers of a drowning person reaching for heaven in hope and futility.  The portion of the population who see that the end is inevitable and don&#39;t want to suffer the death of the planet have voluntarily ended their own lives.  The only ones who survive are those who have decided to live until the very end, no matter what happens.  It is not a majority of the population, but there are many who choose to tough it out to the very end.  They exist in small groups, scattered throughout the world, scavenging supplies from a dead transportation system and from the houses of the deceased, while they use whatever technology they can fond in order to resist the damage of the dying of The Earth, as the moon sinks closer and closer in the sky.  The story finally focuses on one specific group with characters that we grow to care about, as their lives become increasingly dangerous and bizarre, battling hundred meter tsunamis every day, as the oceans take over the world and then recede past the horizon revealing a vast landscape that remained hidden beneath the water for billions of years. Volcanos erupt, massive earthquakes throttle the land, and eventually the gravitational friction generated by the moons unnatural proximity slowly shatters the surface of the very planet.  In their last moments, our group witnesses as the horizon itself breaks apart, continents rise into the sky and then burst into molten lava as hell rains both up and down, the air broils alive anything that was still alive, until the grand joining renders and incinerates all in unimaginable brilliance into a deafening solid white all.", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T03:56:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hecter The Hive Wing", "comment_text": "So..at the end of the day.

The Big City - A more inland coastal city than others, highrise buildings, start off in an apartment with low funding and no occupation - [Normal Difficulty]<br><br>Benefits: Higher buildings means you can stay where you are for longer. Lots of places to pillage once things go bad thus plenty of food available if you play right<br>Consequences: Being in a city means lots of competition and high crime rate. Being in an apartment means for the first 4 weeks you will need to pay an ungodly horrible rent just to stay in your apartment (rent becomes irrelevant after 4 weeks as society starts to really crumble)<br>Way to get to safer place: You cannot afford a trip out of the city as you don&#39;t own a car and are barely surviving off of bits and scraps here and there. By the time rent is irrelevant, the city itself has already flooded and you have no money nor ability to purchase a boat as the banks have been flooded (I guess you could try to break into them). Power is shutting off at this point as the power grid becomes too unstable. In order to get to a safer place, you need to either get in a safety helicopter as they evacuate whoever they can to a refugee camp far, far inland or you can try to hitch a ride with an npc out of the place, both options have a limited time frame to actually be able to do.<br><br>Way to &quot;win&quot;: Get into the limited time Refugee camp and convince others to help you go further inland with all of the important resources needed for a better encampment (easier to do if you come in with the helicopters). The more people you have with you, the more you would have to take care of but at the same time easier management of social need, higher strength, and quicker construction of various things vital for survival. You&#39;d eventually want to either find a way to construct a bunker with enough resources to outlast the upcoming months of reckoning and help you support you and your people or you would need to find a hidden governmental bunker that is made to help keep humanity alive after the death of society. You could also go to a public bunker but crime rates might be high and there might not be enough space for you and your people<br><br><br>B. The Rural Landscape - Local residence inland with small amount of plants and animals, moderate funding and farming occupation, not too far from a river that eventually feeds into the ocean (it&#39;s quite a long river) and also nearby a local town separate from the rest of society-  [ Hard difficulty]<br><br>Benefits: Away from the coast means longer survivability. Income and moderate savings<br>Consequences: In drought, meaning that farming would be more difficult. River will eventually flood and reach you. Shipments take the longest to get to you out of the three options. You need to manually drive your vehicle to the closest town to sell your goods. People don&#39;t know that the world is ending in your town until around 3 months when the moon is so big that people of the town start to notice (they don&#39;t go out at night too much)<br>Way to get to a safer place: Gather enough resources and money to abandon your place and move higher inland. You would loose your wide amount of farmland, would sell for only a small amount with the town (would have to be within the first week or two since the news would get widespread that the moon is going to crash into the earth and thus people will start to buy and move to any land that is away from the coasts to try and survive)<br><br>Way to &quot;win&quot;: Unless you get god luck finding materials for a bunker and manage your resources incredibly intensively, you&#39;d want to try and find a private bunker to get access to or a refugee bunker (a bunker that was either constructed by refugees or was stolen by refugees) or a public safety bunker designed for the public (last ditch attempt honestly)<br><br><br>C. The Coastal Suburbs - Coastal residence with high funding and high end occupation - [Easy Difficulty]<br><br>Benefits: You have a very good position to purchase things and get resources<br>Consequences: You are in a very flat area that extends for many kilometers. Near others so crime rate can increase as the days go by. Less than a month to get out of the suburbs before you are flooded<br>Way to get to a safer place: Selling your house and moving inland immediately will result in you loosing your job as you cannot reach it (any place outside of the city is out of your reach, for gameplay reasons). You would need to move in with someone else and wait until your job gives you the opportunity to &quot;work from home&quot; where you could then move out to your house far inland and still get paid while somewhere safe (your occupation is a national company that shifts over to online jobs as their bases of operation get destroyed, abandoned, or understaffed.)<br><br><br>I guess this is a game concept of mine, would be a first person game with gorgeous graphics ) for that sight you will see 60 real life days later when the moon crashes into the earth (1/6 that of a normal year and 6 real hour days instead of 24). Would need to manage food, water, money (will change once society collapses, becoming irrelevant when most of it is gone, only to come back as a replacement for trading once things settle and society starts to come back 120 days after the moon&#39;s descent, total of 180 real time days put into the game), and mental health (You would need to bring another person along with you to keep your social health sustainable, but barely).<br>Because you might be the leader for a group of people for a normal difficulty game, you could set in your own rules for managment of the people as your local population starts to grow either with new humans born or the occasional survivor. Essentially, you would want to keep them working together to stay alive.<br><br>In order to survive the extreme conditions, you would need to either construct or locate a bunker supplied with enough food, water, oxygen filters, and other protective measures to keep you alive as you waited out the toxic clouds and harsh temperature conditions.<br>You would expect the following after the moon disintegrates:<br>-Periods of unpredictable toxic clouds covering the sky to bright clearings of sunlight, would slowly diminish until around day 120 AMD (After Moon&#39;s descent) where you would have very rare, brief periods of acid rain and toxic clouds in your local area depending on where you settled<br>-Whatever items of the past world remain in your collection, these become priceless and can be used either for their abilities. Guns for intimidation/protect against whatever wildlife may or may not still exist, electronics for advanced calculations or circuitry to either automate processes or for more advanced builds, &quot;artifacts&quot; that can be used as priceless trading pawns, and books for knowledge of the BMD world (Before Moon&#39;s Descent) and for tools that could impact your survival by a major factor<br>-Extremely rare chance for survivor thieves to come and attack you, like we&#39;re talking 0.001 percent chance range<br>-Possibility to trade with other small tribes that managed to survive, would be very hard to contact them within the first 30 to 60 days.<br><br>Way to &quot;win&quot;: Easiest method is to build up resources to then build a bunker with enough supplies for you to survive somewhere inland or perhaps even up closer to the poles.<br><br><br>Since it is likely that most plants and animals will perish, the seed vault would be the ultimate challenge to get to but might be the most rewarding. Not only would you need to trek across a ravaged hellscape or a desolate, frozen wasteland, but you would also need to bring enough resources to be able to survive your trip to Norway. Perhaps there would be an underground aeronautics facility somewhere out there that you could get into and use as a method to get to Norway. Maybe there still remains a functional Airplane somewhere out there.<br>Manual pollination would also be an issue if no other animals really exist to help pollinate, fertile land would also be an issue.<br><br>Overall, it would be the most intensive strategy survival game out there if it went exactly by these rules, having +1000 hours of gameplay just to get to the end of the world.", "comment_date": "2022-02-11T03:13:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Mote", "comment_text": "running out of ideas seems like, silly scenarios in a good looking package.", "comment_date": "2022-02-11T03:12:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryce", "comment_text": "At least the earth has a ring now \ud83e\udd72", "comment_date": "2022-02-11T03:12:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julian Grabowsky", "comment_text": "&quot;...Hey Mumbo.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, Grian?&quot;<br>&quot;...

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions .<br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019.", "comment_date": "2022-02-11T00:14:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Roset828", "comment_text": "Grian..... is the moon big????", "comment_date": "2022-02-11T00:13:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gamophyte", "comment_text": "The sound design on this one was awesome.", "comment_date": "2022-02-11T00:13:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Baylou", "comment_text": "Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but I&#39;m not sure whether the moon causes the tides", "comment_date": "2022-02-11T00:12:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Abrar Rahman", "comment_text": "YES", "comment_date": "2022-02-11T00:11:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "basilisk1997", "comment_text": "Where was this video when Hermitcraft&#39;s moon was crashing into their world!", "comment_date": "2022-02-11T00:10:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "C Hunt", "comment_text": "This is Kurzgesaft in its prime.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions .<br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours.

This is bizarre because there is no realistic condition under which this would ever happen, except by, as they say, magic. <br><br>On the contrary, it&#39;s completely possible for the moon&#39;s orbit to be perturbed enough to put it on a collision course with Earth, though it would obviously involve some dramatic interaction with a sufficiently large celestial body, or numerous large asteroid impacts in a short period of time. If a sufficiently large celestial object got close enough to the moon, it could dramatically slow or change the trajectory of the moon&#39;s orbit around Earth. If its orbit was disturbed enough, this could lower the periapsis of the moon&#39;s orbit enough to put the moon on a direct collision course with Earth. Similarly, several large asteroid impacts hitting the moon directly opposite its prograde heading (large enough to slow the moon without destroying it) could produce a similar effect.<br><br>Is the above scenario likely? Of course not. But in contrast to the scenario Kurzgesagt presents, it is at least theoretically possible, and doesn&#39;t require magic. <br><br>In any case, if the moon&#39;s orbit was perturbed enough to stop it dead in its tracks, it would indeed &quot;fall from the sky&quot; on a direct collision course to Earth. There wouldn&#39;t be anything gradual about it. It would likely fall to earth within a few weeks and would not hang out in low Earth orbit long enough to break up into tiny pieces. It would instead slam directly into Earth, likely causing a mass-extinction-level disaster.<br><br>I find it odd that Kurzgesagt presents their scenario basically saying &quot;If this could happen, here&#39;s how it would happen,&quot; when their scenario makes no sense and simultaneously ignores the ways in which this could theoretically actually happen in reality.", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T22:25:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omegabehemoth", "comment_text": "Hmm a plausible theory...this could very well be how Saturn got its rings over billions of years!", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T22:25:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ammazing Bllack", "comment_text": "This videos was a like a very well written and scientifically accurate movie !", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T22:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Panda Funkey", "comment_text": "have you done a video on depression, anxiety, or autism? possibly even all three?", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T22:23:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LIBREPUB", "comment_text": "um...we&#39;re all F&#39;ed...", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T22:22:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Esteban Gonzalez", "comment_text": "That sound funnier than covid", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T22:22:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guest 7777", "comment_text": "John 15:10\r<br>New International Version\r<br>10 If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father\u2019s commands and remain in his love.\r<br>\r<br>THE BIBLE IS MAGIC, KEEP AND YOU BE BLESSED", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T22:21:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isla\t \ud83d\udd1e \ud835\udd3d**\u0421\u041a \u041c\u0415 - \u0421\u041d\u0415\u2102\ud835\udd42 \ud835\udd44\ud835\udd50 \u0420\u211d\ud835\udfd8\ud835\udd3d\ud835\udd40\ud835\udd43\u0415\ud83d\udc9b", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lheapd7bgLA&amp;t=9m45s\">9:45</a> The book Seveneves actually explored a very similar possibility about the moon breaking up and heating up the atmosphere as the pieces fell.

That ultimately probably means kilometer+ scale chunks  of Moon falling down to the Earth over millennia in nasty impacts which while slow for an astrophysical impact would be highly destructive because of how huge and numerous the pieces would be. After all all the asteroids combined amount to no more than 4% the mass of the Moon meaning that is a lot of mass to fall back down to Earth.<br><br>One problem with ring systems is that ring systems are ephemeral as the ring particles regularly collide pushing the bulk of the material to spiral inwards in this case that means falling into the Earth or they are pushed outside the Roche limit and begin to reaccrete into new smaller moons as is occurring around Saturn today.\r<br>\r<br>Thanks to the data collected from the Cassini mission the moons Mimas, Enceladus  Tethys Dione Rhea and Titan as well as the numerous dynamically unstable smaller moons and accreting ring moonlets are all believed to have formed from ring material after the cataclysm that formed the rings of Saturn occurred some billion years ago and the rings at the current rates of material loss will likely be gone 100 million years from now leaving only a thin fossil ring.  Also the net effects of an infalling ring system and tidal interactions with it would be substantial the process which is ongoing around Saturn has been increasing in obliquity driving the giant planet from equatorial low inclination to its high and increasing inclination. If ring formation effects can do that to Saturn they could and likely would tip Earth over onto its side completely which isn&#39;t surprising as our models suggest the proto Earth Theia impact is what set the Earth&#39;s axial tilt and Earth Moon orbital plane inclinations.", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:37:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iateaplumandifeelweird", "comment_text": "What Happens if the Moon Crashes into Earth?\r<br>Kurzgesagt: Yes, but actually, no.", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:36:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elias Labordus", "comment_text": "YES I love the majora&#39;s mask reference", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:36:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Astrophynix", "comment_text": "Moon big", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:36:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fury YT", "comment_text": "I am pretty sure I am wrong, but the same thing looks like it happened to Saturn.", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:36:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shawn", "comment_text": "this channel really sunk to gen z level cringe: GIANT arrows in the thumbnail because you think we are stupid 12 year olds....wtf man..", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:35:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "edt1201", "comment_text": "I love these nightmare cartoons so much!", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:33:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ron Sugartits", "comment_text": "water: omg moon gravity<br>earth: but you&#39;re on me<br>water: L + Rati", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:33:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Demetrius Merkey", "comment_text": "Hellstar Remina vibes", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:33:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "da Snoko-boi#8", "comment_text": "question on the video:<br>how can we survive the moon crush", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:33:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lance Trophy", "comment_text": "Fish would be loving it though.<br>Ride those waves like a roller coaster", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:31:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yatharth Moza", "comment_text": "How would static oceans affect the oceans, sea life, and the &quot;livability&quot; of the planet in general though?", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:31:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Literally Legendary", "comment_text": "Love the Majora&#39;s Mask reference", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:31:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JMichael Floyd", "comment_text": "Less then 90secs in they tell us there basically no way the moon can or would ever hit the earth lol and theres a million reasons why that they don&#39;t have time to explain to us lmao", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:31:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohamed Osman", "comment_text": "Is it just me or is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lheapd7bgLA&amp;t=10m30s\">10:30</a> really funny  the way he said that", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:29:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "just1boot", "comment_text": "If you like this kind of thought experiment, you might enjoy What if by Randall Munroe", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:28:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mihail Colun", "comment_text": "love the background track \ud83c\udfa7", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:28:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark \u30c4", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lheapd7bgLA&amp;t=0m21s\">0:21</a> why is the monkey eating a bowling ball?", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:28:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rohan Sewdien", "comment_text": "\u201cFerb, I know what we\u2019re gonna do today!\u201d", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:28:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ezra Faulk", "comment_text": "So in <b>other</b> words, what happens if you don&#39;t stop the moon in Majora&#39;s Mask (which I&#39;m amazed and amused to see you guys reference) would <b>never</b> happen; at least, not the moon crashing into the Earth part, because the Earth&#39;s gravity would break it apart into <b>rings</b> that&#39;d illuminate the night sky <b>instead</b> of a moon.

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:03:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richie Perry", "comment_text": "Perfect video to get me ready for the Moonfall movie", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:03:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abhishek Joy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lheapd7bgLA&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a> ah yes, kurzgesagt merch &gt;&gt; food", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:01:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "florious80", "comment_text": "Excuse me while i go find my anti-anxiety pills after watching this video....", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T16:01:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Teng", "comment_text": "The ending is wrong. <br>In the beginning of the video you have assumed that there is a constant magical force slowing the Moon down and causing it to spiral into the Earth.

You didn&#39;t explain why the earth&#39;s orbital decay slows down exponentially as it gets closer. Sure, it&#39;s orbit will speed up as it draws near, but gravity will also pull it in faster as well. <br><br>We have decades of satellite and rocket debris to model orbital decay, and spoiler: slow moving objects fall out of orbit and hit the earth all the time, especially as earth&#39;s atmosphere creates drag in LEO. The earth also doesn&#39;t have the same gravitational pull as a gas giant, so rather than breaking apart into dust, the moon would just hit us, perhaps after breaking apart into chunks. This video seems to suggest that it&#39;s impossible for a moon-size object to hit the earth, because it would instead turn into dust rings. <br><br>Admittedly, I am too lazy to do the math, but the thumbnail image is more likely than the video, where the moon turns completely into dust and settles into LEO.

It unlikely atmospheric drag would be significant at 10-20 Mm, especially for anything of significant mass, but inter-ring collisions and conservation of angular momentum would eject significant material outward and inward. Much of that material has structural strength beyond self-gravitation. boulders are held together by more than just gravity. mountain sized bolides may fracture before hitting the surface, but not enough to prevent them from delivering their full kinetic energy. impact velocities would be significantly less than comets or even asteroids, but depending on the amount of material that makes it to the Earth&#39;s surface and the rate of impact, there would be significant surface disruption, if not outright glassing significant percentages of the Earth&#39;s equatorial surface under the moon/rings orbital plane.\r<br>The moon has a terrifying amount of mechanical energy, Even magic&#39;d down to the Roche Limit with the prerequisite reduction of orbital velocity. Its hard to estimate how long such a ring would last. Saturn&#39;s ring may have a half billion year life span, but it&#39;s orbit is significant further out than Earth&#39;s Roche limit. If we applied the same lifespan to such a lunar ring assumed a significant amount of mass was ejected away from the earth, we&#39;re still looking at millions of kgs of material per second averaged over that time (average being far too conservative at it&#39;s worst, as it would follow a logistic curve rather than linear).

Say you were able to continuously pull the rope inwards with the same force, like gravity, move the ball too slow and centripetal force isn&#39;t strong enough to equal your pulling force and it comes back towards you, like throwing a ball from the ground.

Would the solar panels block an amount of sunlight from hitting earth (via a hex design for the panels) while the solar panel\u2019s energy provides an alternative to fossil fuels?

I can agree that that size of orbiting planetoid would be partially deconstructed but not so far as it would create a homogeneous ring, remember that the moon did form from that but it wouldn&#39;t be so easily reverted, after all we were hit by a planet about 1/3rd the size of earth which warped the gravitational geometry a bit which is why we technically had a ring-like structure before it amalgamated into the moon. Also, even if that happened, the momentum of the moon&#39;s decent would still swing the debris into the earth.<br><br>As a real world example of my point, Mar&#39;s moons are both far closer and of similar density to our moons but they are not rings.

Survivors may never be able to leave earth again. You have to consider that the moon plays a roll in rocket launches. NASA generally likes to launch on days where the moon is in visible orbit during the day time. That ever so slight pull helps rockets reach space and it also keeps most of our satellites in orbit. Without it their orbit would decay and fall back to earth. The ISS would be toast for this reason. Also the tides would stop meaning the ocean would be put into a very slow spin. This means that the salinity of the ocean would change killing most sea life and creating stagnant pools where PH would greatly fluctuate.

First, Brilliant is not a good resource to learn anything.  Second, they are a sponsor but don&#39;t review content.  <br><br>This was drivel.  But you did get one thing correct...were the moon to survive intact for long enough, there is a point at which Earths gravitational attraction could outweigh ( pun...get it?  Nope.  Didn&#39;t think so.) that of the moon.  But it would be dust rock and general debris that would casacade seemingly at first.  What is most likely true is that differentials in gravtational forces would cause sheer fractures long before 10k km.  Those forces would break large chunks off the moon.  Those chunks...not one, but many...would likely be the size of the object that hit Earth 65 million years ago.  So, several exitinction level events would occur prior to the final event when a fairly sizeable portion of the moon would collide and create an event of such a scale that the entire crust of the Earth would be liquified and the atmosphere burned up.  <br><br>I don&#39;t know where your assessment came from but it is woefully inaccurate....oh, it was a wiki...now I get it.  As a point, the reason that some planets have rings is because the objects that made the rings disintegrated ( the technical use of the term...to break apart or dis - integrate) far from the planet surface.  This is due to the mass disparity between the two objects and the composition of the impactor.  Hence Saturns rings are largely domintated by ice rather than rock.  Icy comets break up easily.  Large asteroids or planetoids like ceres do not.  The latter cleave into mountains of rock.  Those mountains find there way to the planets surface.  The moon is fairly large compared to Earth.  All those forces are going to cause the Moon to break up but it would not shatter into a billion little fragments.  Further, all those big pieces that survive will all fall back inevitably.  The interaction between pieces and their extreme proximity to Earth guarantees that they will rain down the final phase of destruction of whatever piece of crust remains.", "comment_date": "2022-02-08T17:59:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Gibson", "comment_text": "I smell a Hermitcraft fan at Kurzqesagt.

The rise of tides is not directly proportional to the distance of the moon... You&#39;ve got to factor in the limit of total water quantity.  There is a point at which the moon&#39;s effect on tide becomes saturated.  Once that threshold is reached there can be no more rise of tide.  Even if the moon totally disintegrates once it reaches the orbit belt beneath geostationary satellite positions, the total mass concentration of the earth will also have shifted, likely causing the earth&#39;s orbit around the sun to decay slightly...  This would increase the earth&#39;s surface temperature likely beyond a point tolerable by human life.  If the human race doesn&#39;t first destroy itself by its own actions, it will still not survive the number of years it would take for the ACTUAL decay of the moon&#39;s orbit, not this BS 1-year timeline proposed.  The temperature rise alone, during this slow decay process, will wipe us out, along with so many other variables that are not being factored in here.... This is really totally junk science, and should be completely disregarded, even as conjecture.  The fact is that we are on an inevitable path to destruction, and there isn&#39;t anything we can do about it.
