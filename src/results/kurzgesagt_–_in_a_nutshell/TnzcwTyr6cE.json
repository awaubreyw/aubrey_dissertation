Whether you will go there and 2. If you find you&#39;re not on your way there, I&#39;ll tell you how to get there.<br><br>Only two kinds of people get to Heaven: perfect people, and forgiven sinners.<br><br>What is perfect? Well, not stealing regardless of how insignificant it may seem, not saying a single evil word against anyone - not to mention God sees our thought life. And like a judge in court, a penalty has to be paid when evil is done and laws are broken (e.g. if a murderer was let off in court there would be uproar so how much more God)?<br><br>In short - we arent perfect, at all. And rather than Heaven, God, if giving us justice, will have to make us pay for our crimes by death and eternal damnation in an everlasting fire and torment. THAT\u2019s how much God hates sin.<br><br>BUT:<br>There is a way that we can be saved. AND completely forgiven. Jesus - the Son of God - came down to live a perfect life without sin, conquering all evil and the devil&#39;s sinful, lustful traps that so easily ensnare us. Jesus overcame all of that, and was then sentenced to death on a cross.<br><br>While on the cross, God poured out the anger and wrath of sin on His Son - Jesus took OUR fine of damnation in our place. That\u2019s how much He loves us. Unbearable pain and being separated from God. EVERY single evil thought, word or deed that doesnt line up with God&#39; perfection, every sin you ever have/will commit knowingly or unknowingly, Jesus took the complete, undiluted wrath for. <br><br>And, like a fine in court, Jesus paying for it means that we can go free. Not just free, but we can experience God&#39;s love and be completely forgiven and saved from Hell as all punishment was carried on the cross and crucified there for all who believe. Instead, we can live immortally and eternally in Heaven.<br><br>After His death, Jesus rose again on the third day, demonstrating His sovereignty and power and victory over not just the sins of this life, but DEATH.<br><br>GOD HAS VICTORY OVER DEATH.<br><br>Soon Jesus will return and those who died believing in Him will RISE from their graves and go to Heaven, and those who rejected His salvation, message and teachings will suffer Hell to pay their deserved fines for all eternity without a second chance.<br><br>This is your chance now.<br><br>He wants you to repent (turn away from your sin and pursue God&#39;s perfect intent for your life, striving in the opposite direction). <br><br>It\u2019s not only about escaping damnation, it\u2019s entering God\u2019s healing as well. God has a plan for your life, a plan that involves you being recreated into His perfect moral image AGAIN as we were before the sin in the garden. He loves you and wants to cleanse you - He will give you the strength. Now we can walk in His strength, experiencing His love, being taught what it means to be part of His family and too be given victory over sin and death. <br><br>He wants you to have faith in Him, letting Him take the wheel of your life (dont forget, when you&#39;re doing God&#39;s will you&#39;re following perfect love - following Him you can be certain that you are never doing the wrong thing- imagine how cleansing that feels).<br><br>What if I still sin when Ive accepted Christ&#39;s death and resurrection on my behalf?<br><br>Thats why Christ died. For your SIN. When God looks at you, striving towards Him or even falling, He sees the righteous life of Christ covering you you in place of your current, sinful reality. For those who strive to turn from sin, regardless of the pitfalls, God sees Jesus&#39;s life in place of your inability, and His blood so that yours will never have to be shed for your sin.<br><br>Religion = rules to be saved <br><br>The gospel = Christ saved us already we just have to believe it by faith alone in Christ alone. If you lack faith (as I did before), pray. He will make it strong in time. Trust Him as you would trust those close to you. He created you and knows you inside out. <br><br>Sound opposite? Thanks to our natural sinful nature, it likely does, but God knows our weakness and struggles and pitfalls with sin. THAT&#39;S why He wrestled (and won against) every temptation YOU ever faced. Just pray to God, tell Him you are struggling and are unsure - God can and will work with even the slightest desire within you to follow Him and be free from sin.<br>Ask Him to make you willing - if you are willing to be made willing, pray for it, simply shut your eyes and talk to Him.<br><br>When Satan knows people have left His camp, He won\u2019t take it lying down, He often tries harder with more trials and temptations. But Satan cannot do anything beyond what God permits, He will only allow things that will strengthen you or bring you closer to Him if you cling to Him and trust in the promises of His word.<br><br>Where do I start to learn about God&#39;s plan and His promises to me? Well, these Bible relate directly to Christ&#39;s life and our redemption, check out Matthew (or Luke if you want a more detailed account). Do it in stages and try and imagine the events and miracles as they really happened - the Bible is a true account after all.<br><br>And when and note it says WHEN, you struggle and fall on this lifelong process, know you can pray for forgiveness, dust yourself off again and get up because Jesus already bore our guilt and shame. remember that Jesus is the ultimate foundation, the reason we are given Heaven in the first place. <br><br>If you lack faith (as i did for a long time) pray. He desires to give strength and faith to His children in time when they ask Him.<br><br>If you want to let Jesus into your life, even to help you to take the first step, then read through this prayer here to get the gist of it and then just say it - trust God and give it all to Him because He has the - perfect - master plan. If you take a step - just a step - towards Him, He will take a step towards you.<br><br>NOTE: YOU ARE NEVER TOO SINFUL THAT GOD CANNOT BRING YOU BACK HOME.<br><br>Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and there is nothing that I can do to save myself. I confess my complete helplessness to forgive my own sin or to work my way to heaven. <br>At this moment I trust Christ alone as the One who bore my sin when He died on the cross. I believe that He did all that will ever be necessary for me to stand in your holy presence. I thank you that Christ was raised from the dead as a guarantee of my own resurrection. <br>As best as I can, I now transfer my trust to Him. <br>I am grateful that He has promised to receive me despite my many sins and failures. Father, I take you at your word. <br>I thank you that I can face anything now that you are my Savior. <br>Thank you for the assurance that you will walk with me through the deep valley.

We can have everyone and everything cured in one year&#39;s time the nanotechnology will be an incredible breach of security because it would be impossible to stop what they could see and hear and transmit to anyone who has access. But this would be the ultimate solution. It is more controversial because of its security situation. Literally every disease could be eradicated. But we don&#39;t do it because the technology is also very young an underdeveloped I would not be able to do what we want it to do yet. But if we give it enough research money and enough materials to be able to make and train nanotech and control systems, we literally could infect every living thing with our complete capacity to change any part of any being. This includes virus is fungus cancer genetic disorder and anything else we can imagine. The countless benefits abound. But the paranoia that could be developed I&#39;m having eyes and ears knowing everything you think feel touch or see you if your eyes. Means that no password would be safe. Nuclear codes would go anywhere it&#39;s that crazy. Unless of course we don&#39;t give the net attack the power to actually see or tap into the nervous system and only on a small scale within the body scan and maintain internal diseased situations. But Espionage such as the ability to immediately stop anyone&#39;s heart turn them into a zombie or edit someone&#39;s genetic code is just as likely if security measures aren&#39;t in place. The program would have to undergo a large amount of scrutiny. It would be almost impossible to have people in charge of the system. Except it would be a completely new job type. And certain programs could be used to simplify the system. But anyone Rogue set of nanotech could go completely the opposite direction of what we would hope. So we need to all be working together in order to be trusted with such power. It could start in hospitals and in a zoo. And spread out to certain sets of people and certain areas that can be quarantine and specially monitored to keep outside influence from changing the directives of these nanomachines. And it would still be a very slow process before it is worldwide. And hopefully it would be very slow before genetic manipulation would be integrated. We don&#39;t want random programs activating on their own either. But is this more crazy or more controlled then the proposed genetic solution? We all saw the movie mimic where a set of genetic cockroaches do the exact same thing as you are mosquitoes only they also end up becoming humanoids and threaten the world this Invasion from a species we created. Everything has its risks. And if the rewards outweigh the risks or chances of things going not as planned, I will not say nanotech is not without risk. but this crisis would be over if we already had it.

What about Africa? the jungles of South America? oh well, we said you can&#39;t use DDT because it is bad. Easy for us to say when we don&#39;t have millions of people dying from malaria. Finally, after years and years, people are coming back around to it. India said, &quot;screw you guys,&quot; and domestically produces DDT.

I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s good so many people die from malaria. But if we are going to put such a large amount of research into saving lives, we need to put an equal or greater amount of research towards new habitats for us as well. Like mars, or the moon, or even just plain old space. Earth can only support so much, it only has so many resources, and we can\u2019t keep messing with its mechanisms of maintaining the environment. Unless we are going to also provide support for our niche. Earth is like a brewing carboy. You add yeast and watch it ferment the sugar into alcohol as a waste product. But eventually the yeast will produce so much alcohol that it kills it\u2019s entire population in the carboy. We are the yeast in this case. Don\u2019t get me wrong, It\u2019s great that we are saving so many lives. In fact, without modern medicine I would have died from strep B as a baby.. but we need to make sure we also have places for all of the lives we are saving. Otherwise it\u2019s counterproductive, maybe even cruel. Because you are saving lives just so they may eventually die from the horrifying results of overpopulation. So to anybody who opposes us colonizing other planets, you should also be opposing medical advancement. Because they 100% go hand in hand. By all means, exterminate malaria. But let\u2019s build some freaking awesome moon colonies and mars colonies too. So we can keep on growing, keep on learning, and keep on being amazing. And at the same time, not being forced to destroy other life on earth just so we can sustain ourselves.. because that will end badly for everyone.

This may be difficult considering the fact that millions to trillions of viruses exist, some we haven&#39;t even discovered yet and we only eradicated one virus, small pox. My idea is thst maybe instead of modifying mosquitos, we could either modify ourselves or genetically engineer the virus in a way that it could make itself harmless and extinct.

Put some small scale grazer in for the mosquitoes to bite, and whatever food those and the mosquitoes need.  Release a bunch of unaltered mosquitoes into the box along with a few of the genetically engineered variety - wait a few generations, then introduce malaria to the environment.  See if the grazers get sick.  (Possibly introduce malaria right at the start, but that&#39;s dependent on whether whatever mammal you selected to be the bite victim (I said &quot;grazers&quot; because you want it to be a plant eater - saves you from potentially compromising the seal by having to do daily feedings).

Think about it like this ecosystems are complex and diverse, with many levels and intricate relationships between organisms. Removing any level from an ecosystem disrupts a delicate balance that may have evolved over millions of years. These systems are compromised of a series of checks and balances between predator and prey, that tend to balance the whole. The several impacts, some of which are expected, and others surprising. Population explosions the most obvious result of the removal of top predators in an ecosystem is a population explosion in the prey species. When taking action of such a scale you have to way in the actual cause and effect of these actions. Trophies cascade or a chain of events could lead to other problems with the eradication of the mosquito bacteria carrying population. Without any predators to limit population growth, humans in this case reproduce without a check, and all of them hungry. More humans eating and without anything to control them, they can quickly degrade their habitat. This puts pressure on our food that we depend on, sometimes to the point of impeding plant reproduction and defoliation habitat. To put it in simpler terms the removal of malaria or any other form of predator could in turn leave prey unchecked in this case humans meaning more humans those millions that would die would be alive and they would have to eat and use resources which could in turn lead to the catastrophic extinction of another species. Although it may seem cruel to not save human lives with any chance we get think about what could happen when we take these measures. We could in turn increase our own impending demise as our population increases so does the strain and competition for food and space. This could further cause unforeseen problems in the environment.

The gene drive potentially has the ability to destroy the genetic diversity here... which is worrying. What happens if this force genetic inheritance has some unpredictable response? What happens if in populations of mosquitoes without the malaria plasmodes that the antibodies attack the host much like an allergic reaction??? Or something to that affect?

Unfortunately the ultimate truth is that the technology is fairly recent, our understanding of how the genetic world works is changing on a day to day basis. . .well, maybe not that rapidly but we learn a massive amount about the human body as well as anti-bodies and well, everything in the world. This might seem like a &#39;good idea&#39; but we have no idea how everything would react. What if the new genetic modifications we make have an adverse effect on not just the virus but another virus? We may test for a million viruses but what happens if one of the viruses we test for, like malaria changes and instead of eradicating a virus, we create a super virus that is resistant to modern medicine? The question here is not the issue but your outlook on life. Are you an optimist/humanitarian and believe it will all work out? Then of course we should use it. If you are a pessimist/realist, you should assume that despite the chances of something going wrong here, the chances that this might cause problems in this case or future cases, should be considered a real issue. As such, you should assume the worst and say that this is not something that we should do. <br>I personally am a pragmatist and I believe that the new technology is a wild card. We may understand what we are doing but we do not yet know the repercussions of our actions. There are plenty of other things that we should be railing and ranting against that have a far higher probability of creating dangerous circumstances towards humans (like the uncontrolled feeding of cows with antibiotics and growth hormones that some studies have linked to antibiotic resistant strains of dangerous pathogens) but that doesn&#39;t mean that we should be using something just because we figured out how. Also the word &#39;hope&#39; when referring to the speed at which Plasmodium may adapt. If even a single mosquito ends up with a weakened immune system, for whatever reason, and it ends up perhaps in a pool filled with Plasmodium, it could take as little as a day before the Plasmodium could adapt using just a brute force approach. I do not know how well Plasmodium is at adapting but there have been studies that show antibiotics becoming increasingly weak over a very short period of time. As such, the chances that this is the silver bullet that will end all the suffering seems like a pie in the sky dream. So I think that this could work in the future, it may even work now however there is no rush. At the risk of sounding callous and uncaring, this has been a problem that has persisted for a long time and there is no rush to try and eliminate it before we are ready. If we create a stronger strain of Plasmodium, we may find that our efforts have only made it that much harder and that much further out of reach.<br>If they truly had some kind of end all understanding of the technology, they could just as easily engineer a genetic fault that would cause the species to become infertile after so many generations. Now I know there would ecological issues caused by the deaths of trillions of animals that are part of the aquatic and avian food chains and it would effect the entire worlds species after a time, but just as this would have massive repercussions we couldn&#39;t fully predict, the original plan contains the same risks.", "comment_date": "2016-09-22T13:13:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nishant", "comment_text": "<b>plays attack on titan theme</b> starts killing the mosquitoes", "comment_date": "2016-09-22T13:13:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yogurt", "comment_text": "Malaria is METAL.", "comment_date": "2016-09-22T13:12:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheFiith", "comment_text": "Just let the nuggers due and the problem will solve itself", "comment_date": "2016-09-22T13:10:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peppe Ddu", "comment_text": "Lots of testing should provide the final answer.<br>A self-contained, isolated environment where a selected group of people can live and work for a length of time and see if anything bad happens.", "comment_date": "2016-09-22T13:09:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bazuzeus", "comment_text": "I think malaria is a predator, and removing a predator always have been proved to be a terrible move.", "comment_date": "2016-09-22T13:06:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony James", "comment_text": "I think we do something like this.

Others saying there needs to be a big international discussion. There&#39;s some sense to both, but I&#39;m doubtful either would work for 2 reasons.<br><br>1). Firstly, politically, there&#39;s no consequence for ignoring malaria. No politician is going to be impeached for inaction. But if the GEing does happen and it doesn&#39;t work perfectly, they&#39;re risking being as tied with it&#39;s failure as Oppenheimer would be to decades of nuclear brinksmanship. The media may give the GE&#39;ed bugs a lasting nickname based on the politicians who tried hardest to save millions, and it WILL stick. So it&#39;s naive to think a discussion that amounts to &quot;we need you to risk your careers for this stuff no large amount of activists have cared about for decades&quot; is one that needs to happen quickly and will be taken urgently.<br><br>2). You can&#39;t build a lab with an ecosystem large enough, populated densely enough, modelled accurately enough and run to it for long enough test for all problems - one&#39;s that might only emerge decades later.<br><br>- To build it large enough, you have to build one too small, discover it&#39;s too small, and get approval build it bigger - assuming that it was too small won&#39;t be seen as such a failure it gets scrapped... And this may happen multiple times.<br><br>- There&#39;s no way to measure accuracy. How do you determine the exact number of mosquitoes to place in a given area? Doesn&#39;t accuracy demand sticking people in there with the malaria carrying mosquitoes(!)? How&#39;d you ensure the monitoring systems needed to tell they&#39;re breeding or not aren&#39;t throwing off the results? What&#39;s an acceptable level of inaccuracy? If the experiment won&#39;t give a wholly meaningful answer, is still low enough to justify the costs of the controlled environment? Or the loss of life in delaying release them in the wild?<br><br>- Even if the above was managed, how do you know when enough generations of GE&#39;ed mosquito have been breed to know for absolute certain there won&#39;t be unintended consequences down the line? Or conversely, if you do know, how do you convince people who don&#39;t believe you, and prevent a radicalised backlash?

We shouldn&#39;t treat mosquitoes like we treat antibiotics - as an incremental change that would need to be repeated every time something mutates. Let&#39;s think bigger - why not breed a mosquito variant that benefits metabolically from consuming malaria organisms? That way, there is an evolutionary advantage for mosquitoes that consume malaria, thus creating a self-perpetuating population of malaria-eating mosquitoes. Furthermore, a failsafe is also needed to ensure that the gene doesn&#39;t change into something we don&#39;t want. For example, we encode a toxin into the gene that is neutralized only when in tandem with the gene drive.

It&#39;s not really an ethical dilemma, rather, a predicament with how to make these mosquitoes to begin with. So, in engineering these mosquitoes, Ellena (the scientist) has run into 2 major problems:<br>The first is that there are many, many species of mosquitoes. You have to fix the code in each of them, not just a few. Each of those species slightly evolves every year too, so they need new samples annually. <br>The second issue is that these aren&#39;t real mosquitoes. They are &quot;lab grown&quot; mosquitoes so they are unable to breed with real mosquitoes. To make things worse, the process used to inject the genetic code kills all of the bacteria in the mosquitoes. These bacteria are fundamental for its survival and reproduction.<br>There are probably some other issues but I forgot. But what I&#39;m trying to say is it&#39;s really not as simple as you make it out to be.

Even if most of the humanity was convinced these people will publish fake research and surveys to put doubt in general public, make the issue political, and make sure that Malaria  exist for as many years as possible.

I mean, there was plenty of time to that to happen if being dominant was the only meaningful prerequisite existant. This is because of evolution: there is something called biological efficency which happens to matematically determine the efectiveness of a specific gen on a specific environment by taking into account the natural selection which will always be there. Briefly summarised this means that a gen would only spread if it actually gives an extra advantage to the individuals carrying it over the guys who doesn&#39;t by, for example, making them more attractive to females or whatever. The opposite thing would happen if the gen was disadvantageous for those indiviuals carrying it: it would eventually disappear. <br><br>So the real question here is: does the mutation bring on a good enough advantage to the transgenic mosquitoes over the silvester ones to justify that massive spread we are expecting from it? Mosquitoes don&#39;t gain anything from those malaria parasites as it&#39;s said in the video but they don&#39;t lose too much neither as malaria doesn&#39;t make them sick: it wants them alive spreading the illness over their real prey, they&#39;re just a vehicle - a pretty effective one. Given the extreme situation that the mutation doesn&#39;t change at all the efectiveness of the mosquitoes (also technically called a neutral mutation) then the gen wouldn&#39;t spread neither as the number of copies of it would just stabilize over the whole population after one generation. For those interested in this fact I highly recommend you to look into Hardy-Weinberg equilibriums. <br><br>To sum up there is just one way of making those useful mosquitoes predominate over its silvester relatives: we need them to be better than the already existant ones. if not, we&#39;re just going to waste money into a secured failure. The better they are compared to the other ones, the faster they will spread. <br><br>I&#39;m not an english native, so please forgive me if I&#39;ve made some awful mistakes while trying to explain all this with my poor english.

In short, the virus would be very reactive, rather than proactive in the war against mosquitoes.

It will get there soon enough, I am sure, but a large-scale &#39;test&#39; as it were SHOULD be conducted to see how the Crisper edits hold up over generations, and a fast-breeding species like Mosquitoes could give us our first hints on what might go right or wrong. Obviously it&#39;s not going to yield a LOT of valuable data, seeing as we are very different from mosquitoes, but it will give us our first hints on what happens with edited genes once they&#39;re released into the wild. Questions like, are the edited genes more vulnerable to mutation? Did editing in the gene negatively interact with any of the other existing genes in the mosquito? Did mosquitoes with the edited gene have any impact on the animals who eat them? Doing this could do a LOT of good, both in the name of curing disease and in the name of research itself, and lay a lot of fears to rest.", "comment_date": "2016-09-21T15:00:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh N", "comment_text": "DDT did a great job combating mosquito transmitted diseases, why did people ever stop using this chemical?", "comment_date": "2016-09-21T15:00:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Skaliber 2", "comment_text": "Can we get a ban on religion in the debates about CRISPR?

Eventually it would be preferable to completely eliminate them along with fleas and ticks, as they contribute nothing or less than nothing to an ecosystem.<br><br>I can&#39;t remember if this was something I read about or one of my musings, but a potential way to eliminate mosquitoes is to use gene therapy to turn reproductive cycles on its head. This can be done efficiently with this new Gene Drive, like this:<br><br>A batch of edited male mosquitoes are released into the wild. They are edited by having genetic material that either a) kills or sterilises female offspring, or in the case of the Gene Drive b) edits out an entire half-a-chromosome turning ALL offspring male (or 99.5% as they say). The result of it is a vast overpopulation of male mosquitoes that keep seeking out females, eventually driving the species, and all viruses borne with it, extinct.<br><br>THERE IS A BIG HOWEVER THOUGH. Genetics, from what I can gather, are more fluid than first appearances. Viruses make small modifications to genes every year (as seen with Zika), and there is speculation that the course of evolution sometimes leads to genetic material from other species being used in the natural process. So what happens if Gene Drive data becomes absorbed into a human system?<br><br>To this, there is no definitive answer for obvious reasons. Which is why it&#39;s important to start small-scale with tiny levels of genetic material. Potentially the best option would be to add a very small &quot;precursor&quot; edit into a species and see what happens in the wild. It may be that the malaria block is small enough, but I don&#39;t know how large this edited data is actually meant to be. From there, we can ramp up more aggressive tests, but only if results and risks are being closely observed.<br><br>This is just my thoughts and understandings.

What you&#39;re doing is eliminating a parasite without causing harm to mosquitoes themselves, So the eco system wont get messed up too much. But for all we know this could go horribly wrong, what if the parasite adapts? What if it becomes resistant? Then we&#39;ve just wasted a whole lot of time and money for nothing. And also, if we are successful in eradicating malaria everybody and their mother will want to do this to all kinds of diseases. Now lets say I want to eliminate another parasite, but I want to do it quick, so I rush it. I don&#39;t look at everything and basically hope that nothing goes wrong. But I have horrible luck and it was all a waste and the parasite I was trying to eliminate becomes a lot stronger. Like I said before I have horrible luck so maybe the parasite becomes so strong it becomes incurable. Then what happens (obviously this example is an extreme). What I&#39;m trying to say is even if we get it right with malaria, doesn&#39;t mean we wont get it right with others, and if we get it right once it will it will cause everyone to experiment with this. A way to fix the problem of &quot;rushing it&quot; could be strict government policy (but that again doesn&#39;t stop illeagal activities.&quot; Also if things like this consistently work, and we are successful in destroying many forms of diseases, the problem of over-population comes up.
