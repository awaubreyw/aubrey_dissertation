If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

So I&#39;ll do my best at a quick explanation for the curious...<br>(tl;dr - free floating sub-atomic particles spawned mainly from carbon and oxygen)<br>As mentioned they are what remains of the core of a small-to-medium sized red giant star after its fusion sequence. Once it&#39;s fused all of its hydrogen into helium, it begins to fuse helium into mainly carbon and oxygen. Once there is insufficient temperature and pressure to sustain fusion, it sheds its outer layers to reveal a core of inert (non-reacting but still very hot) carbon and oxygen. Because there is no nuclear energy being generated, there is no heat to push back against gravitational collapse. This being the case, the core collapses and is pressurized into a mass of what&#39;s called &#39;degenerate matter&#39; - essentially free protons, neutrons and electrons which are not bound by chemical bonds into atoms or molecules.<br>The step beyond this only happens to massive red giants, where their gravitational mass is so huge that upon gravitational collapse its protons and electrons (positively and negatively charged subatomic particles) fuse to form neutrons (neutrally charged subatomic particles); the heaviest of the three. This is called a Neutron Star, the densest object we can currently observe, with a density of atomic nuclei itself.<br>All of that being said; it is not really necessary in order to understand and enjoy the video.

And once all the universe&#39;s energy and density has been condensed into the size of a marble thanks to the king of all black holes, the black hole itself will collapse in on itself and everything would be released again in a humongous explosive. The energy of the black hole having condensed in on itself I believe would be so powerful that it inverts, creating dark energy and resetting the expansion of all things until that gradually dies out, and the new horde of black holes come together to form another king to soak up another dead universe.", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T18:15:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "moo", "comment_text": "After that a new universe will start.", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T23:28:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "-MSAW-", "comment_text": "im scared", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T18:58:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edward Wilson", "comment_text": "It doesn&#39;t matter what happens in a billion or trillion years from now.<br>What matters is the present time, what matters is now, enjoy life with  your loves ones and be a productive member of society.<br>That&#39;s whats important.", "comment_date": "2019-02-01T22:33:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tommy Lau", "comment_text": "Mass can be turned into energy, in the end of the universe, the energy will no longer be fluctuating and becomes eternally stable - constant temperature in anywhere of the universe with no mass, maybe somehow all energy turns into photons because photons have no mass.<br>To avoid that from happening, we need to stop the universe expanding and stop the unstable activities from becoming stable.<br>Human needs food to eat, but the evaporation of the universe turns mass into energy and left nothing else for the living beings, in the technology trillions of years later, i believe human can turn energy back into mass and turns them into the elements they want, which there are already experiments of 2 photons colliding each other to get electron and positron, which means turn energy into mass.<br>Turning a super great amount of energy back into mass would help the universe to stop being evaporated into energy because mass has gravity, the binding energy will be able to withstand or even reverse the process of the universe expansion.<br>Our only hope for the universe is not only the black holes currently exist that have the greatest binding power to bind the universe back in place or even reverse the process of the expansion, because with the future technology, we will be able to create mass and form black holes, and even adjust the rate of the expansion or the contraction of the universe given that we can manipulate energy and mass very well.<br>Human will live for eternity if we truly know how to mess with gravity, mass and space.", "comment_date": "2019-02-01T17:02:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Baseman", "comment_text": "depressing", "comment_date": "2019-02-01T06:56:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anonymous User", "comment_text": "Lol he said the death of the universe the only death would be from the star not the whole universe idiot", "comment_date": "2019-02-01T00:45:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperAsian Dude", "comment_text": "We will evolve into werewolf.

I say MERRY CHRISTMAS OF 2018!<br>I EDIT: Humanity would have probably  created a lot more than we can imagine by than so.... we could build a huge  metal ball with a lot of heat as an artificial sun  we could find a way to create iron or others just like a free method remember just like on mine craft with lava and water we will raise animals we can build other parts of our planet which allows us to expand our population But .... maybe there teleportation to other dimensions will be created  and we can share our story with other dimensions and true geniuses would have created a liquid or something that can make us live forever so they will be there for eternity  thanks a lot for having the time to read this thing sub if u want and before i end do a dab cause why not okay? OK GUYS EDIT AGAIN  THE SOLUTION IS : The black holes , have an opposite . White holes . Those pure out matter . Will be created in 800 million years from now .<br>so all matter will not die . :D so depending on the matter it comes out life can go two ways : 1 not enough needed material (matter) and humanity will die either way . 2 Humanity will have the needed material to live , and it will not get wasted and the other opinions would happen again . and my other opinions which will get added by time. Dark matter makes the universe keep expanding , if there isn&#39;t enough dark matter or it keeps getting smaller . The universe  will soon stop expanding and it&#39;ll get smaller and smaller . But stars will get close together so the heat is going to rise. Unlike on this video which during the expansion of the universe it gets colder . When the universe is so small all the black holes will collide into a massive black hole which will consume the universe and than itself. And since than all the matter that is getting lost cant go anywhere because there is nowhere to go . when it cant hold itself all the matter will explode and the black hole will turn into a container for everything , like our universe now . This in my opinion is the :&quot;Big Bounce&quot; theory . The universe has been going thru these stages for ever , and this is why it makes it difficult to understand the begging of this first universe which than did its full cycle.", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T17:36:21Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Hans Isbr\u00fccker", "comment_text": "&quot;If you need an excuse to delay work a little bit longer&quot;.

Will we just wonder the universe looking for life that isn&#39;t even there? But my theory is that if the sun pushes the earth away then the core will keep us alive for about maybe give or so 100 years, even so eventually the core of the earth will run out but maybe since it hasn&#39;t run out for millions of years then we might be able to live a bit more years, and not to mention you will be able to jump 2% higher than you use to because of the fact that the sun has its own gravitational pull and kept us in line. But there are more disasters yet to come. We will be pushed through the asteroid field, we could crash into Pluto or mars but then again if we did do that we might be able to create another planet, but there&#39;s still Jupiter, if we crash into that we&#39;re gonna get extreme winds crushing us and then the technically stone in the middle of the planet and trust me that&#39;s defiantly not gonna create a life left to live long enough in (you&#39;re still reading this? Great you should deserve a reward) and yet we might even get pushed into a black hole while were at it. The atmosphere will no long be able to protect us from the whatever its called that black holes send out, and those dangers aren&#39;t even worse to come, but I will spare you of them since you want to get back to reading the comments. But eventually life is going to run out of people so at least start making the planet a better place because at the way we&#39;re going earth is going to die before the sun even runs out, so switch them power plants into wind things and solar panels. Now you read a lot and I know most of this didn&#39;t even have anything to do with reincarnation but at least we don&#39;t have to worry about the sun dying on us for another 700 billion years even so then we may have evolved now I know you&#39;re bored so get back to reading dem comments.

We have only yet existed as modern humans for only a few thousand years (200Ky anatomically, but likely &lt;70Ky intellectually). After much less than one million years, humanity will have evolved and changed into species that would no longer be considered homo sapiens sapiens \u2013 the you and me beings as we are now all over the world. After millions of years, any descendants of humans would be unrecognizable as humans. And, that is IF we survive that long. Natural extinction-level mega-catastrophes are bound to happen by then, and \u2013 even more likely \u2013 our own man-made planet-wide disasters are likely to throw us back into a stone-age existence much sooner, like within hundreds or thousands of years.* To talk about what humanity will do when the sun extinguishes in billions of years is preposterous! Discussions of what we can do when the universe approaches heat death in trillions of years... well, that is just an unfathomable time span, indistinguishable from eternity to us humans. Let&#39;s face it \u2013 it is not just your life that is but a mere instant of cosmic time, but the entire existence of the human race is much less than a blink in the cosmos. <br><br>* Don&#39;t count on humans persisting by finding safe harbor within other worlds. Though we are on track to sending humans to other planets and moons within our solar system, since faster-than-light travel is not physically possible, we are not likely to colonize beyond our own solar system. Human colonies and outposts outside of Earth will require the most sophisticated technology for life support, making them way more fragile than life on Earth, since any critical failure will spell doom. Reaching another star system would be a voyage of multiple generations, during which the pioneers would be highly vulnerable and helpless. Plus we can&#39;t be certain that the target destination is hospitable enough, nor would it be feasible to change destinations mid-course. Then there&#39;s the limitation that terraforming another planet would take dozens if not hundreds of human lifespans, and even by then the target planet would not be as livable as the Earth we have evolved within. Sorry \u2013 I&#39;d love to be more optimistic, but these are the realities. <br><br>Notwithstanding the anthropocentric pandering, Kurzgesagt rocks!

Humanity would live in &quot;hibernation&quot; for billions of years during the heat death of the universe until the universe was sufficiently cold enough, and then the supercomputer could run on comparatively extremely low energy consumption . <br><br>Due to the time dilation near a black hole it would also buy humanity a LOT of time relative to the &quot;normal&quot; timer ticking down the true death of the universe when even the black holes have dissipated. The vast energy consumption that would be required for this supercomputer housing potentially billions of complex consciousness in a realistic paradise simulation only running on practically no energy could be theoretically solved due to perception of time. The computer could run at 1/100 the speed of your average computer, computing a second of the virtual worlds reality in a million years, and everyone could still potentially live for millions of years from your perspective in the virtual world. <br><br>I think the main problem discussed was that you would need to make the computer out of materials that could remain operational for billions of years even in the most optimistic situation where nothing interferes with it in the vacuum of space. <br><br>I am by no means educated on the subject so I may have butchered some (or all) aspects of this theoretical situation but that is what I remember.", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T17:31:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucy Negron", "comment_text": "Do you have a bird", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T16:58:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Mako", "comment_text": "this video is just a huge self realization mind fuck this video proves there is no life after death nothing happens absolute nothing no rebirth no new existence nothing you are erased from existence the only thing that will remain is your corpse which eventually still wont exist after the sun dies our universe is basically a fart cloud our universe could even basically be a fucking battery source(rick and morty) the universe is shit  nothing more  our universe only exists to evaporate after almost endless  amounts of time why am i alive what is this about :C :C :C this video fucked my whole realization of even existing if that makes sense which nothing makes sense the universe doesnt make sense me", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T16:57:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Homer Simpson", "comment_text": "Goddammit its just like Dark Souls!", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T16:54:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucy Negron", "comment_text": "What&#39;s up with all the birds \ud83d\udc26 you put them in every vid", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T16:53:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lucasplasma", "comment_text": "At that point im sure we could materialise stuff, like when you think about a burguer it appears like god did", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T15:49:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "markus", "comment_text": "GLAD I AIN&#39;T LIVIN FOR ANOTHER 100 100 BILLION YEARS.", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T08:38:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bloo", "comment_text": "Say if black dwarves don&#39;t turn into iron balls maybe we could find a way to turn the cold into energy :O", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T08:28:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xy Jay", "comment_text": "And then at the end, Once u divide the energy of the universe to its infinite size, It will collapse and start all over again.", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T03:32:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Barney the dinosaur", "comment_text": "Fuck these videos are depressing and give me an existential crisis", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T22:06:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eli Mayson", "comment_text": "this was so much help for my projetct", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T22:00:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Taner Yillik", "comment_text": "dear Kurzgesagt , can you make a video , what happen when die , in brain and what checmical trying against to die , what is going bad ... it will be very interesting video", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T21:47:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caroline", "comment_text": "what if we collect hawking radiation from a black hole?", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T12:06:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Man In The Mirror", "comment_text": "agggghhhh i wanna hug that iron sphereeee", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T06:52:16Z", "likes_count": 183}, {"comment_by": "quit my chanel 1", "comment_text": "What about  other  universe", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T06:47:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zacc mp4", "comment_text": "you\u2019ve taught me so much but could you teach me how to pronounce the name of your channel", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T06:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aleks Baja", "comment_text": "THAT<br>WAS<br>A<br>BOOTIFUL<br>ENDING", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T05:27:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pickletrap", "comment_text": "But suns also are born right?", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T04:52:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fromgeee", "comment_text": "Im honestly worried about this now but...I&#39;ll be dead before then sooo, I&#39;m good.", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T00:55:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Baldwin IV", "comment_text": "That&#39;s scary...", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T00:50:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tannie Duong", "comment_text": "Your video was really great!

I might be a special snowflake that isn&#39;t discouraged by this sorta crap, but I&#39;m no master physicist, or scientist, or enviromentalist, so that might be why. But hear me out though. <br><br>Yeah sure, we might be insignificant, but hey, so is every other living thing. It&#39;s not like we aren&#39;t the only insignificant thing. Every race is insignificant, from dinosaurs to aliens. But just because we are insignificant doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t have a self suited purpose. I mean, since when do sea bass give a fuck about what humans think? They&#39;re just trying to live their lives. Sure, we might fish and eventually drive them extinct, but does that mean their efforts are in vain? No. They tried their best, but if they couldn&#39;t do it, well, nobody really expected them to. Humans are advanced and highly intelligent compared to fish, so them winning the struggle isn&#39;t a likely outcome, but its a nice one that deserves a shot. Maybe that solution is retreating and adapting to the deep seas of the Antarctic, taking advantage of humans not being able to traverse the ocean there as well as their former homes. You never know how far you&#39;ll go untill you try. Well, you might have an idea or prediction, but ideas change and predictions do too. Now, take that little visual, and zoom out more, with humanity being the fish, and universe being us. Nobody is expecting us to become genius survivors and become galatical emperors, because I bet that alot of civilizations destroyed themselves in the process. The universe is big, and can wipe us out any second. Does that mean that humanity shouldn&#39;t try, though? No. <br><br>Imagine if every ape killed themselves. Well, would that solve anything? No, by killing themselves, they&#39;re just cementing their fate of becoming an extinct race earlier than what they could be. But what if they lived longer? Why, little did they know, they would become humans; more smarter and able than their former selves. Apes sucked back then, and humanity might suck right now, but we are constantly changing, and have alot of room to grow. Hell, we&#39;ll probably become something else entirely in due time that&#39;s better suited for the more newer challenges of the universe. Think of it like leveling up in a video game. Of course, that&#39;s because life is very similar to a game, right? Just a very large one with infinite possibilities and consequences around every corner.<br><br>I dunno, think of life as a game like...flappy bird. Yeah, sure, the dead trend that died 4 years ago or so. Forgive me, I&#39;m braindead.<br><br> Anyways, you are going to lose your streak sometime, since you are human and you make errors. But despite knowing that, you still try to get a higher score. Why is that so? Well, it&#39;s because its fun to try. Life might not be fun alot of the time, but hey, you are already given the chance to live in the first place. So why not try your best to become sucessful and help others become sucessful too? Nothing is stopping you from making the world a better place.<br><br>And hey, we always talk about superior alien races waltzing over to our system and wrecking the fuck out of us. But how did they begin? Of course they had to have an upbringing made of trial and error, and maybe they didn&#39;t need many errors to figure some things out and got lucky with the first few tries. Same thing with us. Nobody is born knowing everything. Hell, humanity is more like a toddler right now. There&#39;s alot of room for growth, and everything we do now can be improved. Technology is increasing exponentially, and the first mars mission isn&#39;t that far away.

I know you guys just said that when the whitedwarves turn into blackdwarves all life will be gone. But i was wondering if we could use blackwholes as a powersource. I mean E=m*c^2. I take that the mass of a black dwarf will be about the same mass as a white dwarf (This would mean that we would have a small object with half the mass of the sun).<br>Due to the gravetationfield of a blackhole the speed an object would get would be extreme. So if E=m*c^2 and we would throw a black dwarf into a blackhole we would get high amounts of energy. This might be an option to keep a spaceship powered for years to come. If we can use the energy effici\u00ebntly then we might be able to stay alive until hawking radiation takes out the first blackholes. If the theory that the Explosion (or implotion) of a blackhole is what we call the big bang then by using energy correctly. Storing as much as possible and using energy of objects that get sucked into a blackhole and getting as much as we can from energy then we might be able to survive until a new beginning.<br><br>Look i know it might not be correct so again correct me if i am wrong, but for now ill be able to sleep since that is hard when it seems like everything is useless and thinking like this keeps me able to sleep.

That&#39;s a long time to evolve, if we live that long..... which I&#39;m guessing we won&#39;t.  But anyway, the whole life span of a white dwarf is 10 billion times the age of the universe.  To give perspective on how long that is, imagine that amount of time compressed in to a person&#39;s life span of 100 years.  Where would we be in life?  I did the math, there are only 3.1 billion seconds in a hundred years, so if the universe was  person, it would be less than half a second old, if it were to live one hundred years.  It would still be half way inside a vagina.  Our universe is barely even born.  Could you imagine if every second of your life was the experience of a whole universe of time?  How many universes have you spent taking a shit?  Possibly millions.  If you spend only 2 minutes per day taking a shit, then after a hundred years, you shitted out  4.3 millions universes / seconds.", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T23:25:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Krabs", "comment_text": "It nutshell so it just maybe fake", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T14:39:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joao Paulo Casalino", "comment_text": "beautiful art", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T14:08:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Smoky", "comment_text": "i like how at the end evry tzime any thing is possitive", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T13:50:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jewel-Kun", "comment_text": "This is so depressing to watch", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T12:31:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Century _", "comment_text": "What if after the universe dies, time resets itself and everything since the big bang happens all over again", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T02:52:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DracoJester", "comment_text": "I love how positive he is near the end of these to contrast how unfathomably depressing the universe is", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T01:06:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Riley", "comment_text": "The white dwarf is hot like a nuke with one megaton and the hottest planet because there all hotter than the sun", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T22:42:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Riley", "comment_text": "The sun wont die because it will turn into a giant dwarf", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T22:36:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cr4yv3n", "comment_text": "Phase transition plz :P", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T19:48:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Ge", "comment_text": "But what happens when iron stars collide?", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T19:29:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "will", "comment_text": "That ending was beautiful :(", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T18:35:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Box-3", "comment_text": "Sooo you&#39;re saying that the universe is kept alive by heat and flame and if that flame were to burn out wed be in eternal darkness?

First the Big Bang. I mean that really have had to happen unless it was fake and the theory was wrong. Then quarks &amp; stuff, I happen to have the littlest clue on what quarks are so I&#39;m gonna move on. Then stars, Supernovas, Red Giants, and others. Then the sun, perfect temperature (well, technically it wasn&#39;t the perfect temperature at this time so let move on to an later stage of the universe. First, there are materials that go around it and BOOM, planets. (Don&#39;t ask me how they were made, I&#39;m a 10 year old.) So, there is so far tons of luck that we had over the past trillions of years, maybe even more, but we&#39;re not done. Super lucky to even get in the goldylox zone, and even more. We got hit by a giant rock sorta like mars and now we have a PERFECT moon protecting us from falling rocks/meteorites. We still get hit from some though, and those happen to have water. Oh! What a coincidence! (Or is it luck?) then steam goes into the air witch makes rain that&#39;s removes lava and then cooler temperatures. How lucky are we to the have the whole world covered in water then have volcanos then the volcanos make 5% of the world turn into land?!?

There&#39;s this object moving TOWARDS us that is still red-shifted!!! There&#39;s this pair of objects connected with radically different redshifts that proves the big bang wrong. In addition, in the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, near the center, where the velocities are extremely high, the red-shift is somehow washed out. This strongly implies that strong motion DESTROYS the redshift, instead of creating it. A galaxy has even been measured to have a DECREASE of one quantization in redshift, which should be impossible if the universe is expanding and the redshift is due to the doppler effect.

The resulting object will then undergo runaway thermonuclear fusion, producing a Type Ia supernova and dispelling the darkness of the Degenerate Era for a few weeks.[23][24] If the combined mass is not above the Chandrasekhar limit but is larger than the minimum mass to fuse carbon (about 0.9 M\u2609), a carbon star could be produced, with a lifetime of around 106 (1 million) years.[13] Also, if two helium white dwarfs with a combined mass of at least 0.3 M\u2609 collide, a helium star may be produced, with a lifetime of a few hundred million years.[13] Finally brown dwarfs can form new stars colliding with each other to form a red dwarf star, that can survive for 1013 (10 trillion) years,[22][23] or accreting gas at very slow rates from the remaining interstellar medium until they have enough mass to start hydrogen burning as red dwarfs too. This process, at least on white dwarfs, could induce Type Ia supernovae too.[25]&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-05-31T04:17:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sabian Martinez", "comment_text": "Well this is pessimistic", "comment_date": "2017-05-31T03:29:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arthur G", "comment_text": "Salve Bulbassauro!

Our whole history is but a grain of sand in the vast continuum of time. We are like the morning dew trying to piece together the vastness and complexity of the ocean. Like a bacterium attempting to expose the grandiose scheme of infinity. The deepest, most dillusional form of absolute ignorance stems from claiming we have even an atoms worth of knowledge or intelligence to understand the unfathomable complexities of reality. Claiming to know when our universe will &quot;die&quot; and putting a number on it is ignorance to the greatest extent. If a bee can spend its whole life living amonst us humans, yet never come close to understanding even a fraction of a percent of all our civilization, how can you expect that humans, who have been here for the most perplexingly minute amount of time, would be able to contemplate, let alone make reasonable assumptions about a universe so large that no number can define its distance. A placeholder known as &quot;infinity&quot; is used to describe it when we have no conception of what this word actually means. How can we see the whole picture when our eyes are closed? Can a blind man concieve color? We are absolutely wasting our blip of time, trying to uncover secrets that are outside our ability to understand. Like trying to shove the whole of the universe and all of time into our brains that can hardly stay focused on one task for a few minutes. Logic was created as a tool by something much, much larger. Imagine a saw, which only knows one thing; how to cut, and it tries to use that knowledge to reverse engineer how a house is built. You see, we are a tool, and reverse engineering the thing that created us lies completely outside of our capacity. We are like water trying to burn. Like a stone attempting to fly. Pray to God, the creator, for wisdom. He will bring you hope, freedom, and peace. Do not listen to fools who say they know the fate of the universe. For it is easy for a fool to say he &quot;knows,&quot; especially when your life is too short to even reach the conclusion to see whether or not he was right. There is no such thing as &quot;the end&quot;. If stars are burning now it is apparent that a force unknown to us set the cycle in motion, and has the power to reset the cycle by desire. Peace.

Then helium begins to fuse (followed by carbon, magnesium etc. until it finally reaches iron (element with the highest binding energy)) burning the outer hydrogen causing it to expand into a red supergiant. When the star begins producing iron in the core it no longer creates fusion energy as iron will not fuse and so the outward radiation pressure is no longer equal to the inward gravitational pressure which causes the red supergiant to become unstable. If the core of the star has a mass that is greater than 1.4 times the mass of our sun (the Chandrasekhar limit) then the electron degeneracy rule is overcome by the immense gravitational pressure causing electrons to fuse with protons creating neutrons (hence neutron star). The outer layers of the red supergiant come rushing in and shoot back outwards in a massive supernova explosion. The core of the star remains as the neutron star. Additionally, if the neutron star has a mass that is greater than 3.2 times the mass of our sun then its gravitational force become so great that light can no longer escape it. When this occurs the star will become a black hole.

(potential but low probability) <br>We are alone in the Universe (unlikely)<br>The laws of physics can be broken (potential, the laws of physics technically are not backed by some confirmed fundamental laws, just based on [very limited] research).<br><br>If we are not alone (at least with intelligence that rivals/is superior to our own) we will likely never completely rule over the universe due to rivalries and ethics. Conflict between rivalling civilizations will hinder progress and potentially mean the end to humanity, but what will probably happen is like the currenr situation with USA and Russia. The two civilizations will progress at a similar rate and neither one will have complete dominance; at least not for a while. Ethical issues may occur also, not interfering with the progress of other civilizations, wiping out other races to ensure/enhance the progression of our own, these issues will also hinder progress.<br><br>Probably the most important factor in our control of the universe would be the ability to manipulate/break the laws of physics. An ability such as not being able to break the speed of light or propulsion without propellant or a source of fuel. The ability to traverse the universe at speeds faster than light is essential for space exploration and control. Light itself is too slow to traverse the universe, taking millions of years to do so. Propelling ourselves across the universe would require speeds many millions of times faster than light to be efficient. Teleportation would be quicker than ftl propulsion, but you would need to be able to make data flow quicker than light aswell. Teleportation is not instant. <br><br>Propulsion without propellant requires thrust without fuel, this is essentially impossible, but nevertheless the Electromagnetic Drive can produce a reasonable amount of thrust (about 2x faster than a convential Ion drive) without any propellant, utilizing electrons bouncing around in a chamber to produce thrust. Fuel could be artificially created to supply a limitless amount, providing limitless energy is possible.<br><br>These are many of the hurdles in the way of humanity, but someday we might get there.<br><br>A distant dream.", "comment_date": "2017-05-05T08:35:23Z", "likes_count": 210}, {"comment_by": "Anushka Gupta", "comment_text": "Ok but who are we kidding?

Unless you believe in random fluctuations, which say that any particle, no matter how long, will eventually do something (ie, ice boiling at 0 degrees Celsius, the chances of it happening, at so close to zero it&#39;s almost impossible, but imagine that with 2 random particles with no gravity, randomly hitting despite being billions of km apart and perfectly still just before. It&#39;s basically saying, if you wait infinitely long, eventually it&#39;ll happen. A hydrogen atom will be made, and then decay, and go back to that same infinite state, but eventually, there will be stars and galaxies, and people.

You are attracted to women, like you are now (emotionally and sexually), but they do not exist. They existed a long time ago, and no one knows what they looked like (They have a pretty good idea from the fossils, however), but they do not exist anymore. That means, not only do you know there will never be any possibility, of you having sex with one, but there;s not even a possibility of you ever seeing one in real life. Everyone else, however, except for a very few, are not attracted to women, they are attracted to something else entirely. So, in other words, you will never find any porn anywhere on the internet, only non-sexual pictures of women. Everyone you have told about your attraction to women think it\u2019s disgusting.
