It just means that human beings can adapt to their surroundings given different stimuli.  In order to maintain the proper body temperature inside the mother&#39;s 98-degree womb, it was necessary for the baby to lower her metabolic rates to those of the mother so that the baby would not produce too much heat and cook herself to death.  Outside the womb, it is much colder and the baby loses heat quicker than before, so the baby must raiser her metabolic rates so that she produces heat fast enough not to freeze to death.  On a final note, babies can both dream and suck their thumbs in the womb.  I&#39;d like you to name ONE small intestine that can do that.  By the way, do not make the mistake of thinking that I am anti-women, because I am NOT.  I just believe that science effectively demonstrates that babies in the womb are individual human beings, and I am against the killing of babies, whether they are in the womb or not.  Again, this is not a hateful post.

Mammals and birds have very odd heat systems, they waste a lot of energy because the mitochondria are inefficient and lose energy through heat (although it&#39;s not truly inefficient, we have a use for that heat, it&#39;s just an interesting and useful evolutionary quirk). Cold blooded animals do not lose energy through heat in the same way, and thus the square cube law acts different for them. They gain heat from their environment, this is the basking behaviour you often see in reptiles, which I&#39;ll use as the example here on in. Smaller reptiles have no trouble gaining heat, as they have a large surface area to body ratio, but have a lot of trouble retaining it for the same reason. Thus they tend to be active during parts of the day only when the temperature allows them to be in thermal equilibrium at the temperature they want. Larger reptiles don&#39;t gain heat as easily but retain it quite well, so larger reptiles tend to remain active for a longer time, and thus larger reptiles like komodo dragons and crocodiles can sometimes be active all day round. This also means cold blooded animals don&#39;t have the energy requirements of warm blooded animals, and big or small tend to eat a lot less food.<br><br>In saying this, loved the video, quite accurate for birds and mammals.", "comment_date": "2017-12-22T00:07:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate Peterson", "comment_text": "Animal abuse", "comment_date": "2017-12-22T00:07:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sauron's Tea", "comment_text": "Holy moley an artsy video tutorial!?!!

In fact, almost any application of shrinking, be that in sci fi shows/movies or real-world applications, thermal density can throw a BIG wrench in the works. Let&#39;s take an elephant and a mouse and assume that they have the same core temperature. They most likely do not but mammalian life exists in a temperature &quot;sweet spot&quot; range anyways so it&#39;s not that poor of an assumption. They could both be said to have the same thermal density since a cubic volume of core mass from one animal would be the same temperature of a comparable mass from the other. This would make sense as tempurature, or thermal energy, per unit volume. However, they do not both contain the same total thermal energy. Due to the elephant&#39;s vastly larger mass and volume, it has a much larger total thermal energy than the mouse. This could be compared to batteries in a way. You can have two batteries of different sizes that each output 12 volts. They have the same energy density. However, they aren&#39;t the same size, thus the total energy output of the larger battery is greater than the smaller one.<br><br>All of this is to say that shrinking an elephant would in essence compress all of the elephant&#39;s thermal energy into a much, much smaller being. The elephant&#39;s energy density would go up, and discounting metabolic processes entirely, the elephant would cook simply by the thermal energy inherent in the elephant&#39;s mass. Opposingly, if you increased the mouse&#39;s size and thus decreased it&#39;s thermal density, again discounting metabolic processes, the mouse would freeze to death almost instantly. Again, this is an assumption made under the guise that this transformation is done without any thermal transfer from the surrounding air. This same type of behavior is found in gases that are compressed or expanded if anybody is interested in that sort of thing.", "comment_date": "2017-12-21T21:57:04Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Associate", "comment_text": "what about a pot-bellied pig sized elephant?", "comment_date": "2017-12-21T21:56:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MADbulldogV2", "comment_text": "Ok this made me a patreon.

So the bigger the animal, the thicker its muscles and bones need to be.  That&#39;s why elephant bones look really squat compared to bones of smaller mammals, which look more twiggy in their proportions.<br><br>This is also why smaller animals tend to be more mobile relative to their body size; the tiny mass of a house cat gives its muscles enough strength to launch it several times its height off the ground pretty easily. But elephants can&#39;t even run (in the sense that they&#39;ll always have at least one foot on the ground) because their muscles don&#39;t have much excess strength beyond basic support of their enormous mass.<br><br>You could try to make their bones and muscles thicker and thicker so that the surface area/mass reaches the proper proportions, but since bones and muscles are on the inside of the whole animal, you&#39;re actually still increasing volume (and thus mass) way more than cross-sectional area, so you wind up just making the whole thing less and less efficient at holding its own weight together.  Systems that depend on different factors of different dimensionalities (e.g. area and volume, which are 2 and 3 dimensions respectively) just stop working when you push their dimensions too far.<br><br>If you&#39;ve ever wondered why arthropods don&#39;t reach huge Aragog sizes, it&#39;s because their movement mechanisms also get less efficient at higher volume/area ratios, and so can only get so big before no longer being able to support themselves.<br><br>And finally, this is also why you get enormous creatures like whales in the ocean.  Since water is  denser than air, you don&#39;t have to worry as much about fighting gravity to move or even to just exist.  So the limitations of structural integrity can be pushed much further.
