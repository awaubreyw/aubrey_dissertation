I wouldnt say they grow, unless we say a star grows as comets crash into it ok it grows. But definately it increases in size as it collects more mass from things falling into it. The M87 black hole is definately NOT a infinately small point... so what the heck is up with this constant talk of a infinately small point? Does not make sense to me at all! A huge ball of the maximum pressure does make sense - and hopefully like much other materials where there exists a point of critical mass - it can explode ... voila ... the big bang. Im guessing if the M87* black hole suddenly exploded for unknown reasons - god damn there would be alot of mass comming out from &quot;nothing&quot;...

If a gravitational push comes more or less from all sides, but is blockked by earths matter, this will apear like a gravitational pull towards earth, when in might be a push towards earth, because earth blocked some of the gravitational radiation, from where it is compared to the object of the gravitational push. :) Peter", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T15:04:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "john jack", "comment_text": "You suck youtube", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T12:34:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "john jack", "comment_text": "Radio waves travel at the speed of light but escape a black hole!

If you throw it even hard enough, it will go all around the earth and come back to the point you throw it at and will continue to keep in that orbit, and this is called the escape velocity. <br><br>The same happens with light. If you shoot a laser at the surface, it bends a certain number of degrees towards earth because of the gravity bending the space around it. If the gravity is very strong like it is on a star, the light will bend so much it will spiral in to go hit the ground on the other side of it. Now if the gravity is so strong like in a blackhole (which is a collapsed star) the light it will go all the way around the blackhole and meet back to the point it was launched at. This is the blackhole event horizon. Any closer to the blackhole, means the light will spiral in, hence the phrase &quot;even light can&#39;t escape it&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-04-04T23:51:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "DragonPrototype", "comment_text": "Light is not mass.

But can&#39;t we safely say that black holes are inescapable since their gravity is agreed to be infinite and therefore the black hole will always be pulling objects in the event horizon towards its center at the highest possible speed? So if we manage to travel faster than the speed of light we basically establish a new maximum velocity at which things can travel and this will mean that the black hole will be pulling us in the middle at that exact speed. So best we can do is travel at the highest possible speed to stay in one place in the black hole (not taking into accountancy that black holes are spinning).

If the time dilation makes the time elapsed to cross the next interval take as long as crossing the previous interval, the black hole will evaporate before traveler reaches the event horizon.<br><br>This raises the legitimate question of whether anything falling towards a black hole ever actually falls in?", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T04:28:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eclips_e69", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-P5IFTqB98&amp;t=4m14s\">4:14</a> is now inaccurate, the biggest black hole in existence is TON-618", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T02:01:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "moto theroad", "comment_text": "I would like to offer a thought different from this video to some extent. The collapse of a start with such great energy that it develops a black hole is not really a hole but a rotating divergent tunnel that leads to a singularity. Mass of the universe gets sucked in due to the extreme gravity from the rotation of the black tunnel and the high density mass swirling inside moving along this convergent tunnel held in by the shear forces on the walls due to the rotational speeds.  Anything sucked in we know has at least the speed of light sucking it in and hence high translational speeds see mass moving down the tunnel.  At some point is the singularity which one could work out geometrically based on diameter of the hole and rotational speed and the energy by which the collapse of the hole was formed.  Eventually enough mass contributes to the singularity that a great explosion would happen... the density would be billions of tons just in a teaspoon... this again is a collapse explosion. Due to it translating even as a singularity the explosion would be inflationary/translation and dimensionally somewhat flat.  This would then explain our on Big Bang and why we see our universe as flat and with inflation.  So yes there was a universe before us with parts of it sucking into a black hole that created a singularity that started our universe.  The mass being sucked in has a queuing affect as it travels until it compresses due to the high energy and eventually into this singularity point.  An analogy to this would be like passengers on an airplane egressing in an emergency for the exit door.  You see the queuing affect until it almost looks like just a lump of humans versus individuals trying to get for the door.  The queuing of the convergent black hole tunnel forces this compression leading to this phenomenon.  We need to do more work mathematically looking at this type of approach.  We spend too much time wondering about events horizon vs what is happening down the tunnel.", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T17:33:45Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Raven", "comment_text": "What happens if you fell into a black hole?<br>Long answer: You die<br>Short answer: You die", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T12:49:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BAYRON SAIF", "comment_text": "If you want to escape gravity of black holes  you need  to travel at speed of light <br>Brohh are you moran ... even light can&#39;t escape", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T09:59:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Willy", "comment_text": "How tf did people even find this shit out", "comment_date": "2021-04-17T05:03:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sandi Knows", "comment_text": "Amazing how time is absolutely irrelevant in space and how truly short we live in the grand scheme of things.

I&#39;d like to discuss what happens when a black hole forms.  When it happens an isolated region of space is created.  Entirely cut off from this universe.  A bubble outside the universe connected to our universe by only a point.  A point we call a singularity.<br><br>  First thing first, a point had no dimension.  So in order for anything to cross into the interior of the black hole, that thing would need to have been reduced to a mass of zero volume, and become a string of points with no dimension.  If this is true nothing enters a black hole except a string of points. Points that have no measurable anything.  So clearly a black hole can&#39;t destroy matter in this way, by taking away an object&#39;s dimensions.  Everything getting too close would be reduced to nothingness. Leaving nothing to enter the black hole.<br><br>Rule 1\u2026.  Nothing can enter a black hole<br><br>Secondly, as an object approaches the event horizon of a black hole that object is accelerated to the speed of light at the event horizon. A few things could happen.<br><br> The object exceeds the speed of light and crosses the event horizon.  But wait relativity says to do that you need an infinite mass, so , were any object to attain the speed of light would instantly fill the universe completely, 100 percent with a homogenous mass.  So clearly this can&#39;t happen. Nothing but light can travel at the speed of light.  Right.<br>There is also the problem of time slowing down almost to zero near the speed of light and time is equal to zero at the speed of light. Therefore it stands to reason that if an object were going the speed of light time would stop at the event horizon.  No more events can occur when time is equal to zero.  I.e. you can&#39;t go any further and enter the black hole because by definition that would be an event. Which is no longer allowed because time has now stopped.  Therefore nothing can ever cross the event horizon and all matter and information trapped by the black hole is at the horizon. Compacted as if pushed against a wall. The wall called the event horizon.  As more and more matter is squeezed against the horizon it gets hot.  <br><br>  Very very hot. So hot that jets of radiation spew from the poles in both directions.<br><br>  In conclusion, nothing can enter a black hole. By definition almost, the event horizon. Should more aptly be named the No Event Horizon.  For there all time stops. And nothing can ever cross, in, or out.

Gravity is depicted from the mass of an object (star). As it burns fuel for billions of yrs, the mass decreases, making the amount of gravity do the same.  Plus you cant compress iron to where it collapses on it self,  much the same as you cant compress liquids. Using an infinite amount of force, you cant compress water to make it collapse on itself,  and if the iron core is as hot as they claim it to would be liquid. Meaning it cant be compared to collapse on itself. Not to mention the star deosnt gain mass as it explodes, nor can it have more Gravity then its had the whole time. And since when does all the Gravity from a star all come from a pin point center of space. Here on earth,  most plants and what not wont grow fruits beyond its capabilities to support the weight of said fruits and not break the branches off. It will only grow what it can hold, dont see how stars would be any different. Not to mention how does a star gravity with the mass of (x) amount suck up other stars that have a greater mass then the star that became the black hole. If they base the size of blacks holes using mass and or weight to calculate how big it is, how could it destroy stars that weigh more then what the mass of the black hole. So if i had a 20 gallon black hole, how does it sucks up a 30 gallon star the crosses in front of it,  if mass is used to measure the size of a black hole, then it shouldnt be able to absorb more then that amount of said mass, once it achieves absorbing enough matter which is equal tobits own mass, it should die and fade away.

Nothing gets past the EH, because the relative rate of time (with respect to the ordinary (external) rate of time in space) slows as you approach the EH, until at the EH, the relative rate of time is effectively zero.  This also resolves the holographic paradox, because all of that information IS at the surface of the &quot;moment&quot;.  BTW, I suspect that information is also a function of time.  Anyway, if you slice a black hole in half, to view the cross-section, it would appear as an onion (cut thru its equator), with the oldest objects near its original EH, and all subsequent accumulation stuck at its respectively greater radii of EH by the relatively zero rate of time, so the newest in-fall is forever stuck at the current EH by its zero relative rate of time.  This model does not as easily reveal to me what happens to the original content of the iron core (corpse).

It was the scariest thing ever because you knew EVERYONE was gunna die. The atmosphere went purple, things got super ripped apart and degraded, some people went up to it and accepted they&#39;re death, it kept getting bigger in the sky, I died the first time by running away but the ground beneath me broke and I was instantly in the air n died, the next time I tried to tell see it up close and when I got to this bridge it pulled me in, the third time I tried to figure out ways to stop my death bit I realized there was nothing I could ever hope to do to stop it. The last time I died to the black hole I had my eyes open which made it 20times as scary. N I swear to God it felt so real and looked so real. When I reached the surface of it, it was completely dark, and then I think I saw god. Or a deity in there but for second. Then I woke up, I went straight to this video bc I just needed to learn abt then after this experience.

I believe black holes are 4d objects. this conclusion comes from me thinking about what the stars collapsed? how did it collapse nothing? or space and time? what if it didnt but its actually a new dimension created like our big bang theory except it doesnt create mass but rather it throws it to another dimension. im not too familiar with the BBT but what if we are looking at Big Bangs in our dimension and the black hole isnt a place that teleports you to alternative worlds but rather another dimension. We cannot exist in them because of the conditions of us being 3d. the same reason why 2d cant exist in our world. it needs depth or else we cant see it and it cant do anything in our world. so we lack an immense immunity to pressure? or the formation of our molecules touching because in 3d nothing can touch there will always be some small of distance between 2 objects. like saying when our atoms are &quot;touching&quot; it holds something else that we lack right now preventing us from being in the 4d?

World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity; Similar is the case of money stolen by a thief who hides the ill-gotten money and then misuses it or commits more misdeeds; \u201cwho does not owe it does not fear it\u201d. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T21:50:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pedro goduto zambelli", "comment_text": "Hello and happy day: I leave to my followers several famous phrases or sayings of the scientist Nikolas Tesla: 1) The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will progress more in a decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence . 2) The individual is ephemeral, races and nations come and go, but man remains. 3) What one man calls God, another calls the laws of physics.

Rusty Lane", "comment_text": "3/18/2020/rev. 3/22/2020:   W Rusty Lane&#39;s theory of Black Holes:  Black holes are formed in the traditional way--a star super novas and collapses within itself.  A black hole is defined by its mass as well as its centripetal acceleration.  The area around the black hole or its event horizon is accelerating beyond the speed of light so that light itself, its photons are accelerated beyond the speed of light.  No light can be emitted from the black hole.  When you scientists contemplate black holes you tend to over think the whole issue.  My theory is that black holes are reverse space tornadoes which suck in matter at the event horizon and spew it out at the vortex of the black hole.  Most scientists think that the space-time continuum at the bottom of the black hole is so warped that a cone is formed and at the very tip of the cone there exists the singularity.  I don&#39;t agree with that.  I think the black hole forms a vortex just like a tornado which is spinning and since matter is neither created nor destroyed it merely spews matter out at the vortex just like a reverse tornado.  No one has ever seen into the bottom of a black hole and who&#39;s to say that it doesn&#39;t have a vortex or &quot;worm hole&quot; to another part of the universe.  The universe contains a finite amount of &quot;stuff&quot; or matter and matter is neither created or destroyed; it is merely transported to another part of the universe.  In this way all the mathematics still work and Einstein&#39;s theory is proved and is still valid.  I believe this is how new stars are born and that matter and energy are conserved.  If the black hole is spewing out more matter than it consumes then it will gradually grow smaller and smaller until it finally disappears.  Thus you can validate the shrinking of black holes.<br>     At the event horizon the matter is accelerated to the speed of light.  Most scientists will agree that the theory of relativity means that at or near the speed of light that time is distorted.  In order for you to exist in time you have to have height, width and depth or be three dimensional in time.  For me time is the fourth dimension.  If you have no height, width or depth then you do not exist in time or are the null set.  If you have height, width and depth and do not have any time then you do not exist or are the null set.  To me there was only one singularity.  Time equaled zero and space equaled zero at the moment before the big bang.  When the big bang happened then time began as well as did space.  The space expanded over time and is still expanding today.  This is the main reason I do not believe there exists a singularity at the very bottom of a black hole.  When things (matter) become accelerated to the speed of light time gets distorted and begins to slow down.  That&#39;s why scientists say an observer looking at a space ship approaching the event horizon of a black hole never seems to go into the black hole; they merely slow down as they approach the speed of light.  As matter is accelerated to the speed of light it falls into the black hole or crosses the event horizon where t=0 or time is equal to zero.  I believe that&#39;s what scientists mean by the firey ring around the event horizon, the acceleration of matter to the speed of light.  Inside the black hole time is zero or becomes the null set.  If a particle having height, width and depth and time is equal to zero then it ceases to exist.  I do not believe that space ever is equal to zero inside a black hole.  Space itself approaches infinity so space never equals zero as scientists think. In order to have a singularity, time would have to be equal to zero as well as space would have to be equal to zero.  I think it&#39;s just the reverse.  As the particle inside the black hole begins to de-accelerate it falls out the other end of the black hole and becomes a particle again as it loses momentum and is spewed out the vortex of the black hole.  Another view has the particle when its time is equal to zero it becomes an anti-particle and settles to the bottom of the black hole where it becomes entangled with a positive particle and that is emitted through the vortex of the black hole. Then the anti-particle is emitted as part of the Hawking radiation.  I believe in the conservation of matter and energy, that neither is created or destroyed.  I simply cannot fathom that a black hole contains a singularity; it just doesn&#39;t make sense.<br>     Now you may ask, what about the mass of the object, the black hole?  I think the mass of the black hole only affects the event horizon in that the mass causes the centripetal acceleration to approach and surpass the speed of light.  As the neutrons become packed so tightly together, time is equal to zero, space begins to approach zero as the neutrons approach infinity.

This growing, of course, also means that the gravitational field continues to become stronger and further-reaching.

Through its gravitational field, it draws, i.e. tears, very far-off nebulae, gases, dust particles, suns, and planets, as well as meteors, comets, and asteroids, etc. into its spell, and then, everything within many light-years of distance begins to rotate around this \u201cblack hole,\u201d from which a galaxy is ultimately formed, whose entire mass rotates at tremendous speed \u2013 in a bar-shaped, spiral-shaped, or any other form \u2013 around the center, even around the \u201cblack hole\u201d.<br><br>Official Contact Report 236, Thursday, April 26, 1990<br><br>Billy:\u00a0\u2026black holes\u00a0draw in all kinds of matter that are attainable for them, along with tremendous amounts of information.

Both the &quot;Steady State&quot; model as well as the &quot;Big Bang&quot; Theory have both been discredited in July 2019, when  the first details began to emerge of a series of discoveries by a Hi-Tech Electrical Engineering company that is literally turning Physics on its head. They have almost accidentally proven the &quot;Electric Universe&quot; model in pursuit of new Multi-Billion Dollar technologies which were suspected if the Electric Universe model could stand up to rigorous Laboratory testing. No new technology it should be noted is going to be possible if the Science is spurious ! <br><br>The first details of the testing under the name SAFIRE project were released at an Engineering &amp; Science conference at Bath University in July 2019. As these are Engineering discoveries the company has already announced it has NO intention of bothering with the Scientific &quot;Peer review&quot; methods of announcing and subjecting its methods to scrutiny, as it basically sneers at Science for wasting decades chasing Theoretical nonsense.   <br><br>As a result of proving the Electric Sun model to be correct, and indeed pushing beyond the boundaries of known Physics, the first discovery revealed is a way of &quot;turning off&quot; radiation. Secondly comes a new type of Nuclear Radiation Free Reactor (already on the drawing board) which promises cheap green energy more efficient that either Wind generators or solar panels. Understanding the true nature of how Stars and the Universe work electrically, has revealed in the Laboratory, that Plasma is not conforming to the Newtonian Law of Gravity. A nice little conundrum which reveals Science has already been left behind. Out of the window, go: BLACK HOLES; Dark Matter; Dark Energy; Expanding Universes; Big Bangs; Steady State Universe; and Einstein&#39;s daft nonsense. Which by default dumps Quantum mechanics as well. Back to Kindergarten for many Scientists it seems. <br><br>The revelations so far by this Hi-Tech Company has now drawn in the US Government, who are most likely interested in where  this may all lead. Indeed the Hi-tech Company says that opening one door is leading to a number of others, and they may have opened Pandora&#39;s box. They will currently Nov 2019 only say there&#39;s a lot more to come, much of which it seems involves a total re-writing of how we understand our solar system and the Universe.

Energy and matter can&#39;t interchange one another according to\u00a0 Einstein&#39;s famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. All forms of EMWs including light and heat are dynamic photons per volume per time in\u00a0 different saturations. Atmosphere of all stars is enriched with hydrogen and helium gases which are by-products of proton emission and alpha emission respectively from decaying radioisotopes. Therefore it is wrong believing stars generate heat and light through fusing hydrogen atoms to helium gas. As a matter of\u00a0fact, stars generate heat and light\u00a0 through fission process on their remnant radioisotopes. A dying dense star will eventually transform to a black hole by crashing atoms to quarks before further reducing them to preons, elementary particles where negative preons are surrounded with positive preons and vice versa therefore a black hole is extremely dense that its gravitational pull is so strong that even light can&#39;t escape from it. Gravitational wave doesn&#39;t exist. Really? Where on earth that it is sitting on the gravitational wave that is inaccessible to anyone? None! . Construct of a larger, denser nucleus required more input of energy by saturated its nucleons with more photons in\u00a0 order to squeeze them within the larger nucleus therefore hardly any excess energy can be derived from fusion process instead more input of energy is needed. Dynamic of the universe is the cause of the existence of time flow. A black hole is a dense celestial body that doesn&#39;t really affect the dynamic of the entire universe therefore a black hole will not cause time to stop or flowing slowly. A black hole will radiate out photons especially from its two jets of photons and debris whenever it is feasting. This clearly shows that radiation does radiate out from the black hole. A black hole will be disintegrated during the last phase of imminent implosion of the entire universe where preons gradually strengthen their maximum magnetic strength until they are staggering apart from one another before they eventually free themselves from the shackle\u00a0 of black\u00a0 hole.

If blackholes are infinitely small why do  they have such big &quot;event horizons&quot; since the gravity and mass are the same the only difference being that you can get close and eventually not be able to leave?(is there just a certain amount of gravity that will eventually screw with light?) How are their blackholes so massive yet they&#39;re supposed to be so tiny? Would that mean that the star itself was already way more massive? Would a star that massive already affect light?<br>2. Next question. Stars are &quot;stable&quot; because of the reactions in their core countering the force of gravity once that stops the star just explodes? And if it does it would lose mass and a lot of its gravitational pull making it weaker? So how or why does it just &quot;collapse&quot; on it&#39;s own gravity? Does that mean anything past a certain size without counter force will just collapse into a blackhole?<br>3. How is light bent so you always see the same image as well as the back of the blackhole from any viewpoint?<br>I&#39;m going to do a bit more research but if you can answer please do. I will edit the more I learn lol<br>Edit questions: how does the star lose mass and part of it during its explosion but the blackhole retains the same mass?", "comment_date": "2019-11-18T00:22:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Simplefoyz", "comment_text": "My theory on black hole cores is that the singularity can not exist because an infinitely dense point would have an infinite gravitational pull of infinite force so I think that it is a quark made up of compressed juices of all quarks.

If one survived a black hole long enough approaching the speed of light and be able to transmit data or the observation of actual light waves and photons speeding past toward the singularity, there is still the riddle of what subatomic particles (Higgs, quarks, gluons, bosons or their antimatter counterparts) lends to the extreme gravity, time dilation, or even a dimensionless singularity (or multi-dimensional and timeless singularity); under conditions as such that would allow for that, be it an anti-matter plasma engine annihilating matter and light existing as a multi-dimensional quantum structure of a sort we have yet to fathom. Perhaps iron is atomically collapsed to a superheated  gaseous anti-iron form of matter-plasma, and there are still particles beyond the Higgs boson to be discovered, or theoretically a black hole produces more antimatter than matter maintaining its anti-balance of mass, gravity, and matter against the fabric of the known spatial dimensions.

If a black hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter, for example, it will draw matter inward in a process known as accretion. A similar process can occur if a normal star passes close to a black hole. In this case, the black hole can tear the star apart as it pulls it toward itself. As the attracted matter accelerates and heats up, it emits x-rays that radiate into space. Recent discoveries offer some tantalizing evidence that black holes have a dramatic influence on the neighborhoods around them - emitting powerful gamma ray bursts, devouring nearby stars, and spurring the growth of new stars in some areas while stalling it in others.\r<br>One Star&#39;s End is a Black Hole&#39;s Beginning\r<br>Most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion. (Smaller stars become dense neutron stars, which are not massive enough to trap light.) If the total mass of the star is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun), it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity. However, as the star collapses, a strange thing occurs. As the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the &quot;event horizon,&quot; time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away. When the surface reaches the event horizon, time stands still, and the star can collapse no more - it is a frozen collapsing object.\r<br>\r<br>\ufffc\r<br>\r<br>Astronomers have identified a candidate for the smallest-known black hole. (Video)\r<br>\r<br>Watch the Video\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Even bigger black holes can result from stellar collisions. Soon after its launch in December 2004, NASA&#39;s Swift telescope observed the powerful, fleeting flashes of light known as gamma ray bursts. Chandra and NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope later collected data from the event&#39;s &quot;afterglow,&quot; and together the observations led astronomers to conclude that the powerful explosions can result when a black hole and a neutron star collide, producing another black hole.\r<br>Babies and Giants\r<br>Although the basic formation process is understood, one perennial mystery in the science of black holes is that they appear to exist on two radically different size scales. On the one end, there are the countless black holes that are the remnants of massive stars. Peppered throughout the Universe, these &quot;stellar mass&quot; black holes are generally 10 to 24 times as massive as the Sun. Astronomers spot them when another star draws near enough for some of the matter surrounding it to be snared by the black hole&#39;s gravity, churning out x-rays in the process. Most stellar black holes, however, lead isolated lives and are impossible to detect. Judging from the number of stars large enough to produce such black holes, however, scientists estimate that there are as many as ten million to a billion such black holes in the Milky Way alone.\r<br>On the other end of the size spectrum are the giants known as &quot;supermassive&quot; black holes, which are millions, if not billions, of times as massive as the Sun. Astronomers believe that supermassive black holes lie at the center of virtually all large galaxies, even our own Milky Way. Astronomers can detect them by watching for their effects on nearby stars and gas.\r<br>\r<br>\ufffc\r<br>\r<br>This chart shows the relative masses of super-dense cosmic objects.\r<br>\r<br>Read the full article\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Historically, astronomers have long believed that no mid-sized black holes exist.  However, recent evidence from Chandra, XMM-Newton and Hubble strengthens the case that mid-size black holes do exist. One possible mechanism for the formation of supermassive black holes involves a chain reaction of collisions of stars in compact star clusters that results in the buildup of extremely massive stars, which then collapse to form intermediate-mass black holes. The star clusters then sink to the center of the galaxy, where the intermediate-mass black holes merge to form a supermassive black hole.\r<br> \r<br>\r<br>Recent Discoveries\r<br>\r<br>DateDiscoveryJuly 12, 2018Fermi Traces Source of Cosmic Neutrino to Monster Black HoleJune 21, 2018&#39;Red Nuggets&#39; are Galactic Gold for AstronomersJune 18, 2018Star Shredded by Rare Breed of Black HoleJune 15, 2018Astronomers See Distant Eruption as Black Hole Destroys StarMay 31, 2018Gravitational Wave Event Likely Signaled Creation of a Black HoleMay 9, 2018Black Hole Bounty Captured in the Milky Way CenterFebruary 15, 2018Supermassive Black Holes Are Outgrowing Their GalaxiesJanuary 5, 2018Hubble Views a Supermassive Black Hole Burping - Twice (SDSS J1354 and SDSS J1354+1327)January 1, 2018Lasers and Supermassive Black Holes (UGC 6093)December 6, 2017Most Distant Black HoleNovember 30, 2017Giant Black Hole Pair Photobombs Andromeda GalaxyOctober 30, 2017Black Hole with Jets - V404 Cygni and GX 339-4October 3, 2017Scientists Find Elusive Giant Black Hole PairsAugust 15, 2017Cosmic Magnifying Lens Reveals Inner Jets of Black Holes", "comment_date": "2019-10-08T15:32:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pantomath", "comment_text": "Black holes are teleports to go to heaven or hell .That is why you need to die first to pass through them.", "comment_date": "2019-10-07T20:37:35Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Shikhraj Singh", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-P5IFTqB98&amp;t=1m07s\">1:07</a>...<br>I fell asleep", "comment_date": "2019-10-07T14:54:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Park Daisy", "comment_text": "How u collect the so much information about it.

So we know gravity bends space, and we know that every black hole takes in energy and matter but doesn&#39;t let any out minus hawking radiation. <br><br>Where does all of this go? <br><br>White holes seems to be the logical answer, and I think it is. but so far mainstream science hasn&#39;t found evidence for their existence. And I think that&#39;s because white holes are produced in the exact opposite way: Space expanding to such lengths that instead of forcing all of the information into a singularity, there is essentially a rip in space that would be torn at the smallest possible scale. <br><br>As far as I&#39;m concerned, this sort of tearing can only exist as a result of our current universal expansion/acceleration, and the Universe accelerating outward reminds me how gravity accelerates things towards it&#39;s center<br><br>okay so get ready to have your mind blown: Let&#39;s say you get sucked into a black hole. Your atoms and every other particle is taken into the singularity... and I believe it is stored. Once it&#39;s stored the only way to release it is to, like I said, have the opposite of a singularity or an expansion driven tear into spacetime, expel all of info in every direction. <br><br>The only point where spacetime could be stretched enough to rip it would be in 10^100^100 years or something.. but by then the entire existance would uniformly rip in all places. The ensuing matter explosion would essentially be a big bang in every possible place at once.<br><br>So that&#39;s how the Universe started. Our existence is a result of a White Bang in a previously existing universe that expanded itself to heat death. Why is it expanding?<br><br>Gravity and Antigravity (The repelling, accelerating force) are like hills and valleys in a space time world. Each valley is a gravity field. Each hill is an Antigravity field. Both are relative, that is to say you can&#39;t have 2 hills without a valley, or 2 valleys without 3 hills. All of that empty space is expanding, for the same reason that all of the occupied space is contracting. They are simply products of the same phenomena. The more empty the space, the greater the expansionary force is. This is why the spaces between stars aren&#39;t overcome with Antigravity, while on a galactic scale, gravity usually is overcome by Antigravity. <br><br>Now for the rest of the theory to work there is an assumption to be made that the information held in limbo after being taken by a black hole and before being expelled by a White hole, is a different dimension on a scale smaller than plank scale. This is &quot;where&quot; the 3rd dimension aka our dimension resides, but it&#39;s literally every where. When a White Bang happens, all the white holes expand. I&#39;m not sure if they touch but if they do, the dimension they come from envelops our heat death 3rd dimension, making the entire universe that dimension.<br><br>At this point it goes one of two ways:  a loop or a ladder. That dimension is either a parallel 3rd dimension... and this loops on forever, making the Universe infinite and with no causality, because while it explains what will happen and what has happened, it doesn&#39;t explain how the cycle began. Not very satisfying<br><br>Or, we are on a ladder, having come from a different dimension lower than ours through the same physics, only to be overtaken by the next dimension with the same physics.. and so on, either forever evolving higher, or coming to a final destination in death, rebirth, and evolution. <br><br><br>But yeah I needed to write that down before I forget.

So the story went, an invisible membrane known as the event horizon surrounds the singularity and crossing this horizon means that you could never cross back. It&#39;s the point where a black hole&#39;s gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape it.<br><br>The reason black holes are so bizarre is that it pits two fundamental theories of the universe against each other. Einstein&#39;s theory of gravity predicts the formation of black holes but a fundamental law of quantum theory states that no information from the universe can ever disappear. Efforts to combine these two theories lead to mathematical nonsense, and became known as the information loss paradox.<br><br>In 1974, Stephen Hawking used quantum mechanics to show that black holes emit radiation. Since then, scientists have detected fingerprints in the cosmos that are consistent with this radiation, identifying an ever-increasing list of the universe&#39;s black holes.<br><br>But now Mersini-Houghton describes an entirely new scenario. She and Hawking both agree that as a star collapses under its own gravity, it produces Hawking radiation. However, in her new work, Mersini-Houghton shows that by giving off this radiation, the star also sheds mass. So much so that as it shrinks it no longer has the density to become a black hole.<br><br>Before a black hole can form, the dying star swells one last time and then explodes. A singularity never forms and neither does an event horizon. The take home message of her work is clear: there is no such thing as a black hole.<br><br>The paper, which was recently submitted to ArXiv, an online repository of physics papers that is not peer-reviewed, offers exact numerical solutions to this problem and was done in collaboration with Harald Peiffer, an expert on numerical relativity at the University of Toronto. An earlier paper, by Mersini-Houghton, originally submitted to ArXiv in June, was published in the journal Physics Letters B, and offers approximate solutions to the problem.<br><br>Experimental evidence may one day provide physical proof as to whether or not black holes exist in the universe. But for now, Mersini-Houghton says the mathematics are conclusive.<br><br>Many physicists and astronomers believe that our universe originated from a singularity that began expanding with the Big Bang. However, if singularities do not exist, then physicists have to rethink their ideas of the Big Bang and whether it ever happened.<br><br>&quot;Physicists have been trying to merge these two theories \u2013 Einstein&#39;s theory of gravity and quantum mechanics \u2013 for decades, but this scenario brings these two theories together, into harmony,&quot; said Mersini-Houghton. &quot;And that&#39;s a big deal.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-04-15T20:50:49Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "ShadowRaven", "comment_text": "The entire universe becomes black holes, they absorb eachother, all the matter off the universe compressed in its core, it implodes, new big bang.", "comment_date": "2019-04-15T20:02:10Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Diogo Santos Silva", "comment_text": "my brother is a blackhole<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>i dontunderstand what he says", "comment_date": "2019-04-15T19:34:28Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "jenny mcdougall", "comment_text": "Stars collide to make a supernova so does that make a black hole", "comment_date": "2019-04-15T16:01:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ash.

There is enough, now the question is, who is the supernatural control of Allah, he is Allah, a world is not like a world like us, there are billions of trillion light years, as in other stars 12 stars of light, 1 url star name &lt;solar system&gt; shoots every intelligent. There are many more advanced intellectuals in our world, many of the world&#39;s finest intellectuals. It is only Allah Mia that if Allah is busy with our world, then will they not continue? For example, we make chicken cattle livestock, and they produce children with boilers, produce animals, it has given us an authority in our hands! I can not give up! We have the ability to produce fish in the crop-animal we humans<br><br>In other words, who gave us another animal in a civilized life [life]] Allah Almighty has given us control?<br><br>He gave a lot of things in the hands of different ethnic groups, gave them science and commensurate the artistry, Alien / Reptilian, Integrant Life, gave the nation today its proof that Russian scientists have received information that these Russian scientists are mixed with artistry!<br><br>The name is Anunamami Annunaki, Alla has given many things in the hands of the people of the nation; He has given the techniques of science and technology to the civilized people. He has proved that it is the mummy of a very civilized nation. The nation&#39;s rocket airplanes have been found in the world, you are unlawful and you say the infidel Can not pay? The real proof is that it is not Darwin theory! It is from real information that I have raised some books that have been written in this famous world and have been photographed in the world. We must abstain from the prohibition against the Muslims of the forbidden altercation of the unbelieving kaffirs because the quantum physics are far behind. There are teleportal  and time travelers, if they can bring them to the right, In the time of Rahim Prophet&#39;s time, the time in which he was on earth, the video can be set by the timing of the time, and it can be understood that the two methods still cannot be ascertained. Scientists have been studying. Now they are using different animals from different planets, We do not have the power to do so that the Creator is big and no measurement and no one can give it.

A photon is an oscillation of the photon field etc. <br><br>Another key thing to know is that in the presence of a event horizon, different observers disagree about whether the field is in a vacuum state (think of it as the fields with no particles and therefore no energy; although due to uncertainty, there could be fluctuations in the field which result in energy which result in the formation of virtual particles) or not.

So let\u2019s say we have a vacuum state and let\u2019s think of it as just a straight line with different waves (remember that particles act like particles and waves at the same time, so these waves just represent virtual particles which cancel each other out due to matter and anti-matter pairs). Now let\u2019s put the black hole in the center. As the vacuum state passes through the black hole, some of these waves (virtual particles) are getting scattered by the event horizon. Some remain though. On the other side of the blackhole, some of these waves are not present in the field because they were scattered. So the vacuum state is distorted. This vacuum state distortion looks like we have a stew of many particles.

This would mean that there would be no singularity.\r<br>\r<br> Second option-Now let\u2019s say that it would feel everything to be normal-that is see its predecessors fall into the black hole and that only those outside observers accelerating away from the black hole see things freezing on the surface of the black hole. For that to happen, when the same observer is moving towards the black hole, observes things going in; but when accelerating away observes things clumping up on the horizon. If that were to happen, every time the observer went back and forth the clumping would freeze and unfreeze. \r<br>\r<br>Third-Or if an outside observer maintaining a constant distance from the black hole is the one that observes the clumping. When the observer moved away, if the things unfroze, entering the black hole; relativistic predictions would be incorrect. \r<br>\r<br>Inside the black hole:\r<br>I like to talk about the first interpretation-the violation of the extrapolation of the geometry inside the black hole-that there is no singularity. If we add some definitions to the idea, it looks familiar to a question, we\u2019ve been asking and the incomprehensible answer we\u2019ve been getting. \r<br>\r<br>First, the observer sees no non-virtual particles. However, high energy virtual particles pop into and out of existence frequently. When one of such particle deforms space-time, it forms temporary gravitational influence on the \u201conly one\u201d non-virtual particle-\u201cobserver\u201d before shortly ceasing to exist and no more influencing the non-virtual particle. Another virtual particle comes into existence somewhere inside the black hole and temporarily pulls the non-virtual particle in a different direction (could be the same) with different intensity depending on their relative positions. As many virtual particles pop into existence, the particle is pulled around and pulled in some other direction while some virtual particles cease to exist and some other new virtual particles come into existence. The non-virtual particle is pulled around inside the black hole in this field of virtual particles; never quite achieving the influence to escape the black hole. It could be helpful to imagine the idea as a yo-yo being pulled back and forth, allowing the movement in all directions and the intensities to be different.\r<br>\r<br>The same idea can be described in a different way. The space-time inside the black hole is a high energy deformation in the portion of space-time where, as virtual particles pop into and out of existence, powerful gravitational waves move the non-virtual particle around, inside the black hole. The gravitational waves are the result of virtual particles coming into and out of existence, producing different patterns of gravitational strong fields. \r<br>\r<br>Explaining a very similar answer; and amazing consequences\r<br>Length below the Planck length leads to answers that there should be black holes everywhere below the Planck length. While that might tell us that we don\u2019t understand it so well, it could very well be telling us a different story this whole time. Maybe the reason systems below the Planck scales give rise to black hole scenarios is because what happens inside a black hole is very similar to what happens inside a Planck length-what happens to space-time.\r<br>Below the Planck scale, space-time is not empty and virtual particles coming into existence and going out of existence make up the vacuum energy field, as well accepted. Every point in space-time is stretched, as virtual particles come into existence as the vacuum energy field fluctuation. This is exactly like the first definition we established about what happens inside the black hole. The high energy virtual particles coming into and out of existence inside the black hole, cause gravitational influence because the gravitational waves are localized. Similarly, the virtual particles coming into an out of existence in vacuum field, stretch space-time at a lot of points (theoretically all points) and in a lot of all directions (theoretically  all directions), creating the effect observed as Dark Energy. There is one more definition we need to add here. As, the virtual particles inside the black holes come into and out of the existence, the virtual particles coming into and out of existence that make up the vacuum energy field-do so at inside the Planck-scales, let\u2019s say inside the Planck volume. Since, the two phenomenon are extremely similar, that is why we get an answer that there should be black holes below the Planck scales, when we compute the prediction of our theories. But more than being similar, the two phenomena could be two observations of a single phenomenon.\r<br>\r<br>The Hawking Radiation and conservation of information\r<br>It could very well be the case that the matter eaten by black holes in our universe appear as virtual particles in space-time outside the black holes; and that explaining why \u201cinside the Planck scale phenomenon\u201d and \u201cinside the black hole phenomenon\u201d are the same thing. Now the way this model can elegantly describe the hawking radiation or quantum tunneling as the property of the particles inside the black holes to appear outside the black holes as quantum vacuum field fluctuations-(the reason such systems are described as quantized at the Planck scales can be better discussed by explaining the Schwarzschild radius); And this does not violate information conservation. And black holes turn out to be converting matter into vacuum energy diluting the energy in our universe.\r<br>\r<br>An unanswered question: revisiting group splitting\r<br>All along this time, we did not answer why the particle inside the black hole observes no other non-virtual particle. This idea is described using the splitting of a group; the central idea in this discussion. A black hole has the following property. Before entering the black hole, some matter can interact with each other in space and are described as being in the same system in the \u201cvolume neighborhood\u201d or less seriously-space. A black hole can split this system into many systems that cannot interact in the \u201cvolume neighborhood\u201d. According to the idea of group reconfiguration, space-time is the geometry of group configurations while volume neighborhood or dimension is one such configuration. However, the particles may interact in \u201cother dimensions or neighborhoods\u201d, and hence appear as virtual particles to each other in the volume neighborhood, and are able to convey gravitational influence as they continue to have defined geometries of group configurations- or less seriously interactions with space-time. According to the evolving dynamics of group reconfiguration, the virtual particles come into existence and cease to exist. \r<br>\r<br>But what happens when all black holes run out of food to eat? \r<br>The universe could be left with just vacuum energy field fluctuations with virtual particles popping into and out of existence. Our universe\u2019s geometry to interact in volume-neighborhood could be gone while the energy of our universe (as particles) may continue to interact in other configurations and neighborhoods.

Just like that. Our universe is 3D and the another universe is rotated in a 4D world which is put through our universe when a black hole is formed. If u had to animate that stickman on the page and allow him to walk towards that line. He won&#39;t just pass it, but he will go to the other page that is at a 90 degrees angle. So if we have to go through a black hole, we&#39;ll actually end up in another whole universe. But for that we&#39;ll actually get a chance to travel through a 4D world just like the stickman did on the page when he traveled to the other page that was at an axis that he didn&#39;t ever experience before, &#39;The Z axis&#39; ...

Mysterious stuff. This video is pretty old by now, but i still like to write a comment and say what i think black holes are. Because i dont have so much time i just make it short and compact. In my opinions Black holes are like plantes. Of course not like our beautiful little earth we live on but like a moon for example. I think they are not fluid or gas they are solid because of the gravitation. In my opinion they are not black, they are any other kind of colour, they are just black because their gravity is so strong that light can not escape it so you cant see it because the light can not reflect back to your eye. This is just an example they probably are not like a planet but I just wanted to tell you guys how i think they are or look like in my opinion. So I think they are like planets with strong gravity and not like a portal like hole. Just a round and probably almost perfect round ball because of the immense gravity that would pull everything towards it so that no mountain like pillars could exist on it. Many people think of a real hole in space like a hole in a wall when they hear the word Black Hole but they are round like our earth (fuck you Flat Earth Society) You must think of a 3D object when you think about black holes they ar just a ball with massive gravitiy flying around in space and they are black because light doesnt reflect back to you because their gravity keeps light from escaping. The Planet/Moon thing i said is just an example how i Imagine a Black Hole. Maybe everything I say is true but maybe its wrong, we dont know, but as loong as no one proves ther opposite everything I say is true and wrong at the same time.

Gravity is the consequence of the curvature of space-time.  It may be possible that the structure of space-time itself could be warped without the presence of mass.  Space-time has been shown to react like a fabric by warping, twisting, and propagating independent of mass. These properties have been proven with observations of gravitational lensing, frame dragging, and now gravitational waves. Fabrics can be stretched, pressured, and/or heated to the point of deformation. Such extreme conditions were all present during inflation, so it is plausible that space-time\u2019s elastic nature could have hit its yield point and permanently deformed. Therefore, if gravity is the consequence of the warping of space-time, and fabrics can be permanently deformed, then a deformation could create a gravitational effect independent of mass. Thus, the unidentified dark &quot;matter&quot; that seems to be so elusive to modern science may not be matter at all but merely warped deformities causing gravitational effects.  DM could be a microscopic black hole with no mass at the center...<br>Prediction: Spacetime&#39;s elastic property hits a yield point, so only that part of geodesic&#39;s &quot;stretch marks&quot; would remain after inflation stopped.

At that moment, the star collapses under its own gravity, crushing every atom into something so small it&#39;s indescribable. If the star is large enough, it&#39;ll become a black hole. <br>we know that gravity works kinda like a spandex sheet - if you stretch it out over something like a few chairs and set something in the center, that&#39;s the star. if you take something smaller like a marble compared to a bowling ball, and toss the marble across the spandex a bit away from the bowling ball, the marble will orbit like a planet to its host star. if you replace the bowling ball with something much heavier, like say, a large ball of pure iron, it&#39;ll break the spandex. if you take the same marble and spin it the same way, it&#39;ll orbit and be pulled by the gravity like spandex surface into the tear in the spandex. <br>that&#39;s how black holes work as well, right? the tear in the spandex is a black hole, and the marble is literally anything that exists. if close enough, it&#39;ll be pulled in, and to escape it has to push against the spandex, which is impossible on its own. <br>so what I&#39;m implying is, the universe is like an ever expanding sheet of spandex, and black holes are the tears in the spandex. physical tears. except, there&#39;s no end in the black hole, just a singularity that rips things into nothing, and spews them back out as radiation. not a wormhole, just destruction. <br>so I&#39;m basically saying the universe is torn because a star becomes too heavy, and physically rips it apart. <br>probably incorrect but hey, it&#39;s fun to speculate.", "comment_date": "2017-12-14T05:58:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KillerGamesYT", "comment_text": "There are not only black wholes but white holes, They do the opposite of a black hole", "comment_date": "2017-12-14T04:51:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NoriMori", "comment_text": "This is the first time I&#39;ve actually understood what Hawking radiation is.", "comment_date": "2017-12-13T02:31:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeweler :p", "comment_text": "i have a tough question.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>if heaven and hell would exist what would happen if you were dead and you will be in heaven or hell while a black hole is eating <br>the earth?!", "comment_date": "2017-12-11T18:55:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G.O.

Time almost stops for a person traveling at the speed of light, and that person ages very little compared to a person standing still. <br><br>We cannot travel through a black hole because at that great gravitational pressure we would be converted into pure energy and lose our mass. Instead, there is another way to travel through time while keeping our own energy and mass: harnessing Dark Energy and creating wormholes in the fabric of space-time. <br><br>You see, the multiverse is nothing more than parallel universes all functioning in unison, in the here-and-now, in layers of one dimension each, like a string. Wormholes will allow us to move instantly to any part of a universe of our choice, and time. Space-time is the same everywhere at once. <br><br>The multiverse cycles over and over again by energy and mass conversion, and re-creation, in an enormous sphere with no beginning or end. However, relative time or clock time only moves in the place you are in at the moment. Once you move out of that place in space-time, and return to your original place, your relative time continues at the precise clock time where you left it originally. When you travel at Gravity Hyper-velocity speed or Dark Energy speed, space-time stops or can go backwards. Quantum mechanics has proven that things can be in two places at once.", "comment_date": "2017-08-30T22:16:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harisgok", "comment_text": "one direction jokes incoming", "comment_date": "2017-08-30T11:55:15Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "JosephGallagher", "comment_text": "&quot;We&#39;ll explore these in part 2&quot;<br>Two years later I had to come looking for this", "comment_date": "2017-08-30T11:45:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Error 404", "comment_text": "I do not understand hawking radiation what so ever.

The problem of course is to focus on an audience: a public with no scientific background at all (beginners), a public having some scientific background (medium) or a public of scientific expert (not specially in the domain, but having good scientific culture). One idea would be to have a small logo indicating the targeted audience. From the graphical and motion design point of view, I find this video very well done. <br>However, when it comes to the narrative, I find the explanation a bit hectic with certain elements like talking about life and death of living organisms, such as a human being, not very pertinent. There are, behind the concept of black hole, some philosophical, actually metaphysical issues that would have disserved some attention in this video. Remember, a black hole is not only black because it does not produce any light, it&#39;s black because, for the time being, we cannot explain it from a scientific stand point. Another point to remember is that the current estimate of astrophysicists is that the universe is made of a bit less of 5% baryonic matter (the matter we know today, made of electrons an protons), 24% of black matter (the only thing we know is that this matter is different from the baryonic one) and 71% black energy. In addition, Albert Einstein\u2019 theory shows the correspondence between matter an energy (E=mC2).

Pure fiction. <br>It is obvious for the more observant people how main streamers are constantly trying to explain the universe and the being with the invisible and elusive for the sophisticated modern scientific equipment phenomenas such as black holes (occult symbols of the lawlessness and destruction), dark matter and energy (dark cult), hidden dimensions (mystification), infinitely elastic geometric (not physical space), virtual particles such as mythical higgs boson, etc. Because they want to hide something from the people,  and to focus their attention in the wrong direction. The true science is based on the scientific facts, obtained by direct observation and experimentation on the physical environment at the present. So their theories are not scientific, but anti scientific philosophical speculations, which ultimate goal is to exclude the true living God of the absolute truth, love and justice from the people live. Because the modern philosophers speculators descendants of the ancient Babylonian shamans, want to take the place of God in their live. <br><br>The truth is that black holes does not exist in the physical reality. This fictional phenomena exist only in the imagination of the  successors of the babilonian shamans. And the reason for this is simple as usual. First because the order in th universe can not be established and supported without absolutes, which are independent from the time and the space location. And second because the theory of general relativity, from which is derived the theory of black holes, is fake from the beginning. The mathematical apparatus of this philosophical theory does not operate on the real physical space - the physical vacuum of cosmic space, which is embedded in the geometric space of the universe and have physical properties and limitations. Instead it operates on some kind of abstract geometric space without such properties and limitation, on which can be performed arbitrary mathematical operations or transformations. <br>Ant third in addition, many of the mathematical definition in this theory have logical errors, one of which leads tho devision by zero. In this case the proponents of this false theory says that the fabric of space is broken - singularity.  <br><br>The theory of general relativity has no scientific value. Its only purpose is to justify the moral relativism (lawlessness) in society by  presenting it to the public as something that occurs naturally in nature. <br><br>The truth is that the universe is created and very precisely tuned by our almighty Creator and supporter. The absolute Who created all visible and invisible and Who gave meaning to everything. There is no consequence without and greater than its cause.

With this in mind the gamma earthing and emission that we are as atoms and particles and a great barrier of water are radio affirmed and radio reaffirmed of late when the twins Einstein saw coming crossed our path , as the galaxy core was touched the burst that manifest that was a gamma stream a galaxy long was a huge event yet as they felt us we Gama occluded to vacuum as if our poles were two  giant springs that has bought a huge calm over earth as we ourselves became akin to the diffusion of Andromeda, as its poles closed and the innards shine bright , we have been calmed radio reaffirmed in every atom to core vacuum occlusions. This then brings another theory that as anything were to try to breach the radio bubble of the galaxy on a long trip out the radio bubble will either displace the craft and send it back like a boomerang or as it breaches the bubble it will burst as the radio skin of the atoms its made of diffuse wildly and lose cohesion.

The event horizon is the point at which time stops. Once you reach the event horizon (note, you can&#39;t actually cross it, it can only expand around you, as the asymptotic nature of time approaching the event horizon would mean you&#39;d take infinite years to actually cross it, and the black hole would evaporate before then), that&#39;s it. Particles that are in the event horizon are held in stasis because no time is acting on them.<br>Granted, there is not consensus on this, but I have yet to see any evidence disproving it. Hawking radiation... meh, I disagree with that theory in part as well. You do not need to have particles crossing the event horizon to cause evaporation of a black hole, as the mass necessary to maintain the event horizon at its current state is held outside of the event horizon itself, in very very slow, and very violent descent towards the horizon.<br><br>Within the event horizon, I see no reason that there should be a single point that is a &quot;singularity&quot; so much as very very dense matter, that can still take up volume. The reason light can&#39;t escape the event horizon isn&#39;t because gravity exerts a force on light, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s because it stretches out space infinitely. I think that light can&#39;t escape, because time is stopped, and since light (like all things) moves as a function of time, it doesn&#39;t move once it reaches an event horizon.<br>Now, the locking doors idea can theoretically generate a similar result, but would require dynamic events outside of time, which.... we have never observed. Oh, the M theorists will tell you about the interaction between a host of different dimensions, but we have not observed proof of any of that. Time stopping is a much simpler and more elegant solution.<br><br>Perhaps I am mistaken on an assumption that I have made, but I think my understanding of relativity is accurate on this point. Maybe Hawking is right, but I think they&#39;re overlooking the obvious. The fact is, if movement outside of time is impossible, the above theory that I stated holds very strongly, and also explains the conical shapes of radiation released from black holes like nothing else does.", "comment_date": "2016-11-14T09:30:05Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Noa Sundqvist", "comment_text": "Soooo does Hawking radiation break law of physics?

I could almost accidentally step across it, right?  And once I do this, even though I&#39;m still alive and well, and conscious and everything... you&#39;re saying I <b>CANNOT</b> turn around and walk back?  Like, at all?  It seems so strange - this black hole is so big that right at the event horizon, you probably wouldn&#39;t even know you crossed!  It seems so spooky.... what if you were floating around in space really slowly, then couldn&#39;t turn and walk back... you might be really scared, &quot;did I just cross the event horizon?  I can&#39;t turn back!  OMG!&quot;<br><br>2. What if you passed the event horizon but someone gave you a rope so they could pull you back?  Then what?  Gravity doesn&#39;t become unbearable for a while, so you could float towards it for some time, and I don&#39;t think the rope would snap.<br><br>3. What would you actually see once you were at the event horizon, or just crossed?  Time works differently there, so you would see the universe in fast forward??  This is so incredible to think about.  So you would be able to see all your loved ones - and their children - and their children - and their children... all living, dying, living, dying.... and to them, you would just be a still image?  But time is going so fast you might even see stars slowly starting to go out, and the heat death of the universe.... you could see the death of everything within a few minutes.  Is this right?  You&#39;re watching the universe die long after every single person who could ever have known that you even lived, has died.<br><br>4. Could civilizations survive even beyond the heat death of the universe, if they cultivated power generated from these black holes??  Imagine that heat death has happened... but black holes are still around.  Could an advanced civilization maintain itself using these as a fuel source somehow?  I can&#39;t imagine what the universe would look like... you&#39;d look up, and there&#39;s be no stars on a clear night.  Everywhere you look,  just total blackness... ah!  It just now occurred to me!   There&#39;d be no day!  Only night, all the time... pure, black, empty, and eternal night.  But you&#39;re still alive somehow.  Utterly alone.  And cold.

If the Cosmos is an infinite phenomenon of expansion is it illogical to believe that it also reproduces? I&#39;m no quantum physicist but whem the big bang occured, the entire universe expanded into existence from a single point and has continues expanding at an ever increasing rate. So where does all of the mass and pure existence come from? Is it possible that a black hole is a way to recycle matter and energy so that the Cosmos can exist eternally?

Sense I did not have a lot of prier knowledge on black holes it was all hypothesized. So here is my explanation first the idea that a star&#39;s core becomes unstable resulting in a collapse were the surface area of the spherical star changed but the mass did not. So then I thought okay what does this mean, I then refereed to a balloon, penny, and a needle. As if the surface of the balloon is the fabric of space and a star is a penny, you take a the balloon you press the penny on the balloon representing gravity and the balloon does not pop, now take the same force but use a needle with the same mass instead the balloon will pop due to the higher concentration of surface area on the balloon. Same concept with the relations of stars to black holes same amount of matter in a star that has a surface area of 7.06 X 10 to the 15 power km and then try to fit that mass into an area of 1 cubic inch&lt; or less, Black holes are literally 3 dimensional spherical holes in the universe. An that take you to another theory of mine  that all of the matter in this universe has been transported by a past universe and the matter that was in that universe was transported there by an even older universe and so on.  <br>older universe &lt; Old Universe&lt; CURRENT UNIVERSE &gt; New Universe&gt; newest universe and the matter continues for ever that can explain were the matter that gets absorbed by the black hole goes and and where our universe came from and why it grows.", "comment_date": "2016-05-10T03:40:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Washyour Fruits", "comment_text": "As it is, There are those that still debate that virtual particles are &quot;real&quot;.

Maybe matter, but not the force that supposedly drags space out to thin out the universe in an accelerated manner. Thing is that because of how we are currently still developing better tools and still learning more about how these things work, i would more than not put my personal bet on that it is not accelerating. The rotation of the earth, rotation of telescopes, tilt of our planet, the orbit of our planet in our solar system, and lastly our position in our galaxy all serve as a change in position. Compensating for all that ontop of also remembering that if a big bang took place then that additional speed of debris getting propelled out from the core of the event.. All of this was compensated for and cross-tested right? If the case then still is the same and the universe is still expanding. Ok.

If you have 2 objects with equal mass but one object has 1 billion times less volume than the other, wouldn&#39;t it have stronger gravity?

This isn&#39;t really true.

When an object is approaching a black hole, the distortion of spacetime in its vicinity gets bigger accordingly as the object gets closer and closer to the black hole. Since the distortion in spacetime increases, the object passes longer distances at any given time, which means the object moves FASTER and FASTER as it gets closer to the black hole. The event horizon is the point where the velocity of the object becomes equal to the speed of light. When the object CROSSES the event horizon, its velocity becomes greater than the speed of light and therefore it goes back in time to  moment BEFORE it crossed the event horizon. In short, the moment you enter a black hole, you will immediately find yourself OUTSIDE the black hole. You won&#39;t die,. Simply you won&#39;t be able to enter a black hole because nature doesn&#39;t allow it!

Well all what you are talking about is true ,because my rule is &quot;everything that comes out of the brain was in the brain from the first &quot; that means we are not thinking we are remembering data that is in the brain from the first..Our brain is just like a hard disk full of data, collected from minus infinity of time and dimention and our DNA have it all so what makes us remember is the motivation that is made by the system we live at the greed to make money that is good and another example like crisises like world war 2 .well that means that negativity and positivity are the answer to have a battery here comes religion im sure you dont believe in god while i do, he is not the limit of thr brain while he is not what religions talk about GOD AND SCIENCE ARE ONE. not differ .ok god made religion for the brain sake while as you know most people on earth never kill or comit crime or suicide because they are affraid of hell and do good things because they want heaven thats true, while superior ethnic educated people dont commit crime ,some because of laws and prisons and some are wise, that means this world is just like home then a school then collage , so religion is parmenant but God will stay he is our connection to the universe who is the plus infinity of time and plus infinity of dimention, we are just like him told you before nothing comes out of the brain is what we invent its inside so what im telling you is from my brain we all are gods a walking universes but we need to connect our brains together to form a bigger universe of ours and later to other evolved creatures in the universe that we call alians and later more universes ,,,the first evolution is the internet but we need more . most countries and scientists keep their inventions as a secret for profit and world dominations=(greed)well this also is good =competition ,so as i told before negativity= (devil )is good for us.we are far to become gods told you god says in qoran &quot;\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a\u0646\u0627&quot;  it means i created you  just like me, by the way, i was ethiest before but when i found many secrets of the universe inside the qoran ,i found that this book is coded numbers with letters (it will take me some time to uncode it., as i told you abouy my first rule this book came from the brain with the help of god . So more you dig inside your brain you will find the data you want . So movies that we watch about science fiction is true in other dimention thanks for the directors who seek Millions of dollars (motivation) for example Matrix the movie had happenned before also lord of the rings ,,etc , since there is plus infinity of possibilities of time and dimention.

I lack the mathematical skills to express it in the context of an equation, but from what I have gathered on the subject, it leads me to believe that black holes \u201cexist\u201d to generate and emit what scientists refer to as \u201cdark matter\u201d.<br><br>Science has noted that dark matter is what comprises the majority of the \u201cspace\u201d in the universe. It could be likened to the ocean, where the galaxies and stars are suspended and float through \u201ctime\u201d, witch is an expression of the rate of the decay of matter, as it flows towards the center of the galaxy, only to be swallowed by the hole, and then radiated out as more dark matter.<br><br>It seems that the time/space continuum is comprised of the dark matter and energy emitted by all these black holes out there, and that\u2019s what holds it all together. It\u2019s the gravitational compression of the invisible dark matter on visible matter. It is the darkness, compressing the light that creates this reality we perceive through our consciousness. If you removed all the dark matter, all matter would disintegrate. The irony is; it doesn\u2019t really exist at all. <br><br>Dark matter and the powerful force it emits is the result of its non-existence. But this \u201cnothing\u201d has volume, and therefore a presence. It is the fluid in witch the galaxies and stars float. It is the force that binds all matter together, right down to the atomic and quantum level.<br><br>This could also explain why the universe is observed to be expanding. Black holes, spewing out more dark matter, more \u201cspace\u201d for new stars to be born into, more \u201cnothing\u201d, the fabric of the universe. <br><br>Ultimately this leads to the question: Would the universe exist if there were no consciousness to perceive it? It\u2019s just something for you to ponder, if you have the time to spare. I&#39;m a philosopher, not a physicist, and any philosophical thought on the matter leads into \u201cinfinity\u201d.

Ms. Scientific Buzzkill here to point out errors in the video.  Apologies in advance, etc.<br><br>Fortunately, there are only two notable mistakes.  However, one of them is a major mistake.<br><br>The major mistake: <i>&quot;as you enter the black hole you&#39;ll see the world around you speed up&quot;</i>.  This is 100% false, and it isn&#39;t surprising that Shortspeak oopsed on this one because this is an extremely common misperception perpetuated in science fiction (many physicists mix this one up, even).  Here are the facts.<br><br>While it <i>is</i> true that somepony watching you from a distance will see time appear to slow down for you, the traveller sees no relativistic effects of any kind.  Why?  It&#39;s because you&#39;re currently in free-fall.  Consider standing on Earth: the pressure from the ground is accelerating you away from the center (the normal force counters the gravitational force).  This causes time to pass at a different rate for you\u2014it&#39;s not just the gravity making time pass more slowly, but the normal force opposing the gravity that causes you to constantly &quot;accelerate away&quot; from the center of the Earth.  That constant acceleration <i>against</i> gravity is what produces the relativistic effects (such as time passing more slowly in a valley than on a mountaintop).<br><br>If you were falling into a black hole, it would be possible to see time speed up, but for that to happen you would need to <i>accelerate away from the singularity as you fell in</i>.  That acceleration would change your inertial frame of reference and produce the relativistic effects you would typically associate with acceleration.  You actually <i>would</i> be aging more slowly than the world around you.  If you stood on the surface of a neutron star (forgiving the extreme impossibility), you would also age more slowly and see the universe age more rapidly, but again that&#39;s because the surface pressure would be accelerating you.  Gravity by itself is always finite and only accelerates you at a finite rate, even for a mass as large as a black hole.<br><br>The reason for the disparity in the observer&#39;s view and reality is that the appearance of time slowing down for an observer on the outside is strictly an <i>illusionary</i> one.  It is not a true relativistic effect.  Rather, it&#39;s caused by the interference between the gravity of the black hole and the ability for the light of an infalling object to reach your eyes.  It&#39;s easy to get these confused because people are often taught about relativity using examples that are familiar, such as imagining a clock slowing down as it moves away from you faster and faster because of light propagating more slowly to your eyes.  (This is a completely false thought experiment, because the speed of light relative to the viewer doesn&#39;t change no matter how fast the object moves.)<br><br>Think critically for a moment to confirm this.  Nothing slows down because it&#39;s approaching a singularity.  The same laws apply as with any gravitational mass: the black hole has finite mass, and it accelerates you toward it at a finite rate of acceleration.  That can be used to calculate precisely when you hit the singularity, which must occur within a finite period of time.  For time to stop you&#39;d have to accelerate to infinite speed, and clearly that never happens.  This should provide insight into the fact that the visual appearance is an illusion, rather than actual time dilation.<br><br>To sum up: yes, an observer would see you slow down and never enter the event horizon (and consequently, you never end up seeing yourself enter the horizon, either, but that&#39;s a much more complicated lesson).  However, this is an <i>illusionary</i> effect and, not a true relativistic effect!  After accounting for the time it takes light to reach their eyes, the observer would correctly deduce that you had long since passed through the event horizon and struck the singularity.  The traveller would see no speed-up of time whatsoever, although the sky would end up getting smashed into a thin line perpendicular to the direction of travel (but again, that&#39;s a more complicated lesson).<br><br>The second mistake is much more subtle.  The circle you see is not actually the true event horizon of the black hole.  Black holes appear larger than they are, in some sense due to visual effects; but even when you account for that, the boundary you are looking at represents the photon sphere rather than the horizon.  Light that enters the black hole from the outside the black hole won&#39;t appear within that boundary because light doesn&#39;t change direction on its own, and it was headed into the black hole when it was emitted.  However, if you see matter fall into the black hole, it will pass through this boundary and still be visible for a while.  That&#39;s because light reflecting <i>off</i> of the matter wasn&#39;t headed into the black hole when it was reflected.  :)  That light is headed in the opposite direction, away from the singularity, and until you hit the event horizon that light is still going to reach you (even though light already headed <i>toward</i> the black hole at that point is doomed).<br><br>As always, I only nitpick because I love.  &lt;3  Keep making great videos!", "comment_date": "2015-12-20T20:27:07Z", "likes_count": 1252}, {"comment_by": "BANG Bang", "comment_text": "thanks for Vietnamese sub ^^", "comment_date": "2015-12-20T20:26:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MattCarter1999", "comment_text": "Hungarian subtitles???", "comment_date": "2015-12-20T19:58:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grisillo", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-P5IFTqB98&amp;t=2m41s\">2:41</a> Dr.Who :D", "comment_date": "2015-12-20T19:53:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MultiMediaMan", "comment_text": "part 2 ?", "comment_date": "2015-12-20T19:51:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kopper", "comment_text": "grate... and in the future we will have black-hole bombs...

Where does the hole part of a black hole come from? I mean, the most logical explanation for what a black hole would be would be a clump of matter that is dense enough to prevent light from escaping or that puts light into an orbit around itself. So where does the hole part come from? If I&#39;m indeed correct in my assumption there is no hole. The matter is still there but no light gets emitted. It doesn&#39;t mean that it all gets condensed into a single point, just that any light that gets reflected from it can&#39;t escape, meaning that the clump of matter is simply invisible to us.<br><br>I also think that my idea about light ending up in an orbit would be a very likely explanation. Think about it for a moment. For light to be travelling away form the black hole at the speed of light and reach us it would have to be emitted by us. Otherwise it will be entering and exiting the area around the black hole at an angle, (meaning that it will be going alongside the black hole and have a large chance of ending up in an orbit) or would never reach us because it did a 180 degree bounce. And assuming that the matter in the black hole is near infinite density, it would make it very unlikely for anything more than the occasional particle of light to hit us because it would be very rare for a particle to bounce of the area with actual matter without ending up in orbit.", "comment_date": "2015-12-20T02:27:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Axel Pollet", "comment_text": "Awesome explanation but can someone tell me HOW the universe becomes uninhabitable?

As stated in this video the motion of an object falling into the black hole is slowed down when observed from a distance, the outside observer never sees the object reaching the event horizon. Same applies to the material forming the black hole, it would take an infinite amount of time for an outside observer to see the formation of an event horizon. So how does the Hawking radiation work then? How can a black hole evaporate if it cannot form in the first place? Infinite time is a long period, there might not be a universe around the black hole, what does the outbound particle go into? Lets think about it. Say a virtual pair forms close to the &quot;would be event horizon&quot;. Since the pair creation is outside the event horizon it would take a finite amount of time for the outbound particle to escape the gravity, the inbound particle will be part of all the inbound material whose motion towards the event horizon has been infinitely slowed for the outside observer. After a certain (large but finite) amount of time, we&#39;ll have a number of outbound particles having escaped the gravity - the Hawking radiation, and the same number of inbound particles that still have not reached an event horizon. Isn&#39;t that a contradiction by itself? Even from the perspective of the point where the virtual pair forms, no matter how close to the &quot;would be event horizon&quot; that formation takes place (and it must be a finitely small distance for the outbound particle to be able to escape into something), it would still take an infinite time for the inbound particle to reach the horizon. Doesn&#39;t that contradict the delta(E)delta(t) uncertainty principle? This is where general relativity and quantum mechanics need to work together, but they don&#39;t, so how can the Hawking radiation work?", "comment_date": "2015-12-17T21:06:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vtgrokz", "comment_text": "I have a question.

If we were to believe that black holes have no volume and be a singularity, then we can infer it would have no radius as well (Volume = 0 = 4/3 * pi * radius^2 -&gt; radius = 0).<br>2. If it applies to Newton&#39;s universal gravity law (g = -G constant*Mass/radius^2 * &lt;r&gt;), its gravity force would probably be infinite because it would end up in a division by zero. <br>3. Since Force = mass * acceleration, no matter how massive an object can be, you&#39;d be accelerating towards the black hole at infinite meters per second.<br>4. This means that on 0 seconds, you&#39;d go from any velocity (even 0m/s) to infinite m/s towards the black hole.<br>5. This also means that you&#39;d go inside the black hole instantly, therefore we all would be inside the black hole, and therefore dead in 0 seconds flat.<br>But you&#39;re pretty much alive, just as I am and everyone else in the universe we know of their existence. This could mean two things:<br><br>A. We&#39;re inside a hyper massive black hole, with the mass of the whole universe, and the time dilation is so big that the ripping process might also be extremely slowed down, maybe even stalled, and some sort of gravitational interaction is what makes time happen. I don&#39;t think this makes too much sense even if I could have explained properly.<br><br>B. The most logical explanation to me is that maybe black holes don&#39;t slowly collapse in a singularity, but they reach a point in which they can become stable and stop contracting, just like neutron stars do. However, black holes&#39; are small enough (they have a radius less than their Schwarzschild&#39;s radius) to exert enough gravity so that light cannot escape. This would mean that there should be a force we don&#39;t know about that somehow is able to overcome the gravity force. <br>This could mean that if black holes get extremely amounts of not-dense materials, the gravity force it would exert would start to weaken since the radius would get bigger in a faster rate than mass would do, maybe to a point in which light could escape back again.

Also CO2 levels have been going up and down between ice ages for millions of years. Aren&#39;t the CO2 levels we measure at the moment just the natural cause of earth and a sign that we are heading toward the next ice age. What I would like to see in the video is your view on our fossil fuel consumption contributing to the global warming.
