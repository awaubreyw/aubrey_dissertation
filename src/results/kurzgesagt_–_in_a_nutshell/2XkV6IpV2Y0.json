It will happen sooner or later, whatever we&#39;ll do something or not). Because of it, glaciers will melt and the sea level shall rise up. Then, after lots of years, it will freeze in the next ice age, and it will do it over and over again - that&#39;s the natural balance, so don&#39;t worry about this.<br> It will be looping until a one billion years from now. But then our Earth will get totally unsuitable: the temperature will rise up so intensely, that water will start to evaporate and will get locked in the clouds, that will be getting denser and denser, admiting less and less sunlight, until there will be completely dark, but also cloud layer will be making greenhouse effect stronger and stronger, so as longer it is, the faster it will be. The clouds will also start to connect with sulfur, making an acids, that will fall from the sky like a rain, devastating what&#39;s left on Earth.<br> Water will be also evaporating into steam, making Earth&#39;s atmosphere more and more dense. Rising pressure will destroy human&#39;s infrastructure and other things as well. Like clouds the steam will also be creating acids, making the atmosphere unable to breathe.<br>The process will be pursed until the last water on Earth will evaporate, and there will be no more live on Earth. Now it will be the next Venus, which will also have crushing pressure, unable to have live on and completely dark at surface.<br>To don&#39;t make disappointed, there is also a romantic part of this future.

Out of an explosion came oxygen to breathe, a male and female of every kind, the natural and perfect food chain among animals, trees and plants producing healthly food for humans to eat, water to drink in the rivers, bees for honey, rain to spread water over every plant, and every living thing in the world, humans, plants, animals, etc suddenly had a perfect dna code written. This is the same thing as a book falling out of the sky and as it fell, the words slowly came together to form a complete story with pictures, page numbers, and a title page. Nothing was left out.<br><br>And people actually say that a God creating the world is ridiculius?! The same people believe aliens exist. Aliens are possible but God isnt? <br><br>There are no atheists 5 minutes after death.<br><br>Please consider your eternity if you dont believe in God. There is a God and He loves you and wants you to come to Him. He knows your pain and suffering. But because we have broken His rules and have sinned, we are subject to the punishment. Just like a person who committed murder would stand before a judge in court and be sentenced for his crime, and NOT be judged for the good things he did in his life. God is our judge, however, he gave us a way to be redeemed in his court. He gave us Jesus Christ who came to this world and shed his blood and died as a sacrifice for all the sins of the world. It is up to us to accept that gift and follow Him. He is all LOVE and TRUTH and LIGHT.  Repent of your sins and come to Him. He is waiting.", "comment_date": "2019-01-17T17:14:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Failsafe", "comment_text": "You are true!", "comment_date": "2019-01-15T19:44:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gege Strnad", "comment_text": "That&#39;s a scientific way to motivate you to ask that girl out..", "comment_date": "2019-01-15T17:35:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RAYMATOAD 1", "comment_text": "I was born to late to explore the world and to early to explore space but just in Time to lay around all day and do nothing", "comment_date": "2019-01-15T15:12:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gon\u00e7alo Oliveira", "comment_text": "But heat death is 100% sure and it will happen evolution Soo probably we will know more and more things and probably one day we can prove that heat death is wrong or right", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T00:04:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZeroLovesPC", "comment_text": "anyone got the name of this track? i cant find it on epic mountains soundcloud and the link to the itunes page isnt available in my country.", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T13:51:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cheese Meister", "comment_text": "This assumes that we understand our human origin.

All absolutely flawless. I dare say this is the absolute best piece of media one could ever produce, since it&#39;s built so perfectly to the tiniest detail while talking about the most astronomical thing: us, as beings that fully understand our place and perception of time itself in the universe, which is Existence Itself, which we all share, since we are part of the same Universe that was formed from vaccum space. Maybe a couple Gazillions of years after Our Universe dies, another Universe may be formed, and maybe it will lead to the eventual creation of entirely different beings, Or MAYBE it will be the repetition of our eventual existence, as we know it.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Maybe what we call &quot;different TIME-LINES&quot; are the numerous repetitions of this cycle of beginning of life and its inevitable death, so maybe there has  been (or will be)  a Universe where EVERYTHING that went down in History went EXACTLY the same way as in our current Universe, but YOU decided not to get out of bed this morning, whilst considering that in OUR timeline, you did indeed get out of bed this morning. Now imagine the INCOMPREHENSIBLE amount of combinations of Universes that could EVER exist, until EVERY possible scenario has happened before! Would that mean something? Would that be some sort of goal? Maybe there are similar TIME-LINES where everything goes down EXACTLY the same way, with the utmost detail. Comparing this phenomenon to rolling a number of dices: the more dices you have, the lower the chances you have of getting the exact same combination of dices, but that is indeed possible. Now think of each dice as an atom, for example, or rather, the smallest form of matter: there would be a combination of Universes where each of the smallest forms of matter would react in a different way, resulting in this Infinite TIME-LINE theory, in other words, I&#39;d be much more inclined to the theory of the Universe where it is constantly dying and coming back to life, because it is possible: it would probably take an &quot;INFINITE&quot; amount of time between the pawn of EACH Universe, but what can we take out of all this?... Probably nothing useful, but it would be pretty neat to know in which loop of the Universe we are!... If it were possible to know what the start is: WHEN did it start? What happened before the spawn of the VERY FIRST Universe? Maybe there were never the conditions that allowed matter to be produced by the 4 Big Forces of the Universe (if I recall that name correctly, there is Gravity and other three), so maybe yes, there might have been a beginning of everything, unless something happened before the FIRST Universe EVERY appeared longer than INFINITY, which happens to be the limit of our capacity as Humans: T I M E. We don&#39;t know how long there is between the spawn of two different Universes, so we can&#39;t know if something happened before the spawn of the First Universe because, for all we know, we MIGHT just be the First Universe, just to put this in perspective, and our perception of time is so RIDICULOUSLY MINISCULE that we can&#39;t either grasp the amount of TIME that went by Before the spawn of Our Universe nor the time that needs to pass After it Dies until a new TIME-LINE would be created. So, in theory, time travel would be possible if we could jump from a Universe to another, where events went down a certain different way, but it&#39;s probably impossible for us to grasp a way to make this seem even logically possible to execute, so I&#39;ll refrain from going further than this.

In other words, we exist in the 1st galactic generation.<br><br>Furthermore, life on Earth is already more than 75% through its lifespan; we were born deep into the waning half of Life\u2019s dominion on this planet. The Earth and the Sun are both nearly halfway through their lifespans. By the time the solar system (and therefore the Earth) dies, it will have been around for approximately HALF of the universe\u2019s existence. In other words, we and our solar system belong to the universe\u2019s 2nd generation of solar systems (assuming systems like ours existed during the first 9 billion years of the universe). And even with all this (assuming \u201ca few trillion years\u201d to be 4 trillion for the sake of calculation), the universe is not even ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT through its productive lifespan of creating new stars! This means that, after this second generation of solar systems comes to a close, the universe still awaits at least more than 400 subsequent generations of solar systems to follow. <br><br>I imagine each of these future generations of solar systems will have a similar capacity to generate life; to be the cosmic progeny to our OG status.

Who created it? we did of course, it started out simply as the internet, but it evolved way beyond anybody&#39;s current imagination to ultimately be our saviour, the one who would show us how to reverse entropy by demonstration. That manifestation is everything you see, nature, biology, all of the evidence that we need in order to give continuity to preservation of existance, forever and ever in endless cycles, dimensions and randomness.

It&#39;s all there, it all adds up perfectly. No matter how you look at it, no matter what lens or eyes you want to use to understand it, no matter what metaphor or story, it&#39;s all the same.

Now before I go off on my little rant, let me first point out that I am a bit biased in this but that I also respect people for having their own opinions and beliefs. I am going to start off with how wrong most of the conversation in the comments have been; I just keep scrolling down, further and further, and I keep seeing the same thing: a person that believes in evolutionism, stating their opinions about the video, are being attacked by people who do not believe in the same thing. This is definitely not the case for everyone or every comment, but it is a recurring theme the I have come to dislike. Evolutionism is just a theory for people to believe and an attempt to explain where the universe&#39;s origins lie - and the people who state this are being outright attacked by some people. I am by no means discouraging discussion or debate, but rather just stating a personal feeling and I want to get but one point across: if you want to try to get your idea of how the universe came to be, then attacking the opposition will only harden their hearts and that will just fan the flame for an online battle. So please, be respectful of other humans - intelligent life forms that have a mind of their own and their own respective opinions to accompany them - and come about this in a more respectable manner and not put each other down because of mere opinions! I beg of you that if you read this, keep this in mind the next time you want to attack someone with a different belief, be in this very comment section or in politics, take heed of my advice.

If the galaxy were to repeat itself would everything happen again? Or would it happen differently the next time (Or at all)? Eventually, to my knowledge, everything ends. But haven&#39;t ever been asked by myself, does everything Begin? Or Re-begin? Were made of &quot;Star stuff&quot;. But could you considerably claim so is everything else? With the Big Bang we have no human being who has seen what happened and only have an idea what happened beforehand through studies and theories. We do however know the basics of what&#39;s happening now, in our own little world. We can make ideas and put it out what may or may not have happened. The idea of having a &quot;Now&quot; is pretty complicated in itself, are we experiencing something? Or is it our brain piloting a slab of meat, being able to create and destroy, replicate itself. If emotions were not implemented into our brain would we be ourselves? Time is created by us, Nothing in the Universe gave us time, there is no big clock anywhere floating in space (to my knowledge) that is created by the universe itself. Unless we, considerably are apart of the universe being made out of the stuff creating it. In that case, are you manipulating, expanding, creating the universe with your bare hands? Are we going to keep learning, exploring, creating wars, peace. Only to have it all end, or to be just restarted over again? Personally, Religion seems like a net. It&#39;s a way to make us feel more comforting about what happens when we end. Or when we see each other end. I personally am Christian but from the facts I&#39;ve heard and the theories I&#39;m not sure what to believe. Will their be punishments if it turns out a religion is right and I&#39;m wrong?

Being infinite, there will always be more stars and planets existing or being crated somewhere. We ofton forget that the universe is much bigger than what we can ever observe or even imagine. We live under the illusion that what was created by the big bang is all that exists, but for all we know there might be hundreds of big bangs happening right now, creating uncountable galaxies, only too far away to have any afect on us. Even sientist sometimes underestimate the size of space. The universe may not be able to implode because it has no beginning, end or center. Neither can it expand, solarsystems and galaxys inside it can expand for some reason, but the universe itself is already infinite.

Here one finds shocking laws and traditions that are obviously criminal and inhumane \u2014 but for some reason accepted \u2014 in our otherwise humanistic culture.<br>While non-Muslim scientists invent new fantastic medicines and technologies daily, discover the most amazing things about the universe, its building blocks and inhabitants, and Western voters and politicians have created the most humane, rich and free societies in world history, most Islamic countries are still amputating limbs for theft, stoning women and homosexuals, heavily inbred, denying people free speech and democracy, and contributing absolutely nothing when it comes to science, human rights or peace.<br>What are the cultural psychological factors making Islam able to stay medieval for 1,400 years?", "comment_date": "2015-10-02T07:45:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jaefaed", "comment_text": "20st Century at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XkV6IpV2Y0&amp;t=1m39s\">1:39</a>", "comment_date": "2015-10-02T05:43:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mikey M Marszewski", "comment_text": "I love this channel", "comment_date": "2015-10-01T22:48:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MR.

It stretches out, and then it comes back in, like an acordeon, or a beating heart. That would also explain what there was &quot;before&quot; the Big Bang, just another iteration of our universe bouncing, and so on. Another thing I&#39;d like to point out: &quot;time&quot; is a property of the universe, our fourth dimension if I&#39;m not mistaken (and there&#39;s like eleven of those mind you, according to relativity and string theory, but us hoomans only live in four of them). No universe, no time, so if we&#39;re not going to go with the Big Bounce scenario, talking about what there was &quot;before&quot; the Big Bang is pretty pointless.

also that it is a &quot;tangible&quot; that assures us that we exist, but also a rational and deductible that time is real evidence test, because if time were only measurable, then we would ourselves not just something measurable and tangible, as we think it is time, but that intangible that shows the time it is due to its interdimesnional duality.<br><br>One example is the way that has been suggested is better measure the second, and use it as the basis of universal understanding, is the vibration of the atom, let alone particular item, and you can always find one that has way to overcome another in the measurement and not suffer from some variation during its existence and in a measurable time itself, this tells us intuitively and heuristically, that time itself originates in the same evolution of matter, from the big bang, as we saw in the video, and since the formation of hydrogen until the evolution of heavier elements, although the fact that it evolved into heavier elements, not give him a fresh start in his real existence, just is one or several transformations, but inside are the original Protios that gave rise to that other element that has evolved in this moment of time, and making up the total mass in the universe.<br><br>And as we know the material has a behavior superposition of states, according to the classical paradoxes of quantum physics and that this superposition of states, has a speed exceeding that of light, so it is impossible for our instruments know when it&#39;s cool, but for our instruments is always corpuscle, so the theory of wave function collapse, and that same understanding, vibrations or corpuscular behavior of materials used in the use of atoms to measure time, especially the second, but obviously you have some intuition to understand that inside of the matter is the true origin of time, and this time to have its origin in matter itself, so does the limit the expansion of the universe from its origin, and the whole matter itself, wherever you are, what also makes me conclude that the time in practical terms is absolute = | T | from the evolution of matter, but relative to the human understanding and use DT`= DTi / sqroot 1 / (v ^ 2 / c ^ 2).<br><br>Then the time would also become a paradox, since it must be included in the superposition of states of matter<br><br>But if we solve one of the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, we resolve all because basically all paradoxes suffer from the same problem, and I mention this in case you had not realized that fact, the paradox of the double slit, Cat Shoringer (wave collapse), Behavior overlay States Quantum Computer (quantum computers), The EPR Paradox, principle of locality, Quantum Entanglement, The Time, this last I included it, for obvious reasons.<br><br>The only way they can solve, for example: the superposition of states of matter to store information in a Qubit, interpreting their behavior and can be deduced from the way we use atoms to measure the second, for his vibration or corpuscular behavior, and sensing the wave, is its counterpart in their dual behavior, we can deduce heuristically that matter itself it has a counterpart or opposite, and that also we know, and antimatter.<br><br>* IIf that&#39;s true, you might ask why there is so much antimatter in our universe to handle it ?, and the answer is simple: This in a higher dimension.<br><br>** But they may arise other questions, for example: If we include the higher dimensions into the equation, and according as we always have described what they know and understand the dimensions, is a geometric complex manner, as we include antimatter in all this?<br>The answer is simple: We are describing only partially the third dimension when we explained geometrically, and really bad when we see the fourth or higher dimensions and more complex geometries, complex that only has the appearance, as only seem geometric shapes fractals, to go up in size.<br><br><b>*</b> So the premise is: The dimensions are material, non-geometric shapes, but help to understand the universe, do not explain properly, so always fail in the way we understand the universe, even time itself.<br><br><b>**</b> This leads to understand that if there are parallel universes, especially the antimatter, but we were a little way to explain it properly, and obviously, there must be a better understanding correct about this, because still missing information. It is logical.<br>\u00a0<br><b>***</b> If there is a parallel universe, then the time it should operate in that universe?<br>I think the answer must be based on the concept of the evolution of matter itself, not out of that understanding and proven, and understand that behavior depend, as we understand the duality, which I call: duality matter-antimatter, and in our universe or dimension we call: Space-Time, it seems intuitive call Time-Space, precisely based on their charges and atomic valence.<br><br><b>****</b> So, what is the Time-Space?<br>It is the place where time is zero, and time is space itself, and that space anywhere in the universe, where there is no past or future, only the present: Absolute Time.<br>The relative time, that what we use is only a fraction of the absolute time.<br>(For me it is the present, and the present is in our dimension, the barrier of the speed of light, and that barrier is the dimensional border between the duality of matter and antimatter: The present time, travels at the speed of light)<br><br><b>*****</b> Now, could you accept that conclusion as possible?

And if that is true, then who&#39;s to say when the Universe dies and the Nothingness returns that history won&#39;t repeat itsself? And the reason why I brought up this theory is because I&#39;m guessing that you think the Universe is finite because it&#39;d have to be in order for it to die on its own. If something is infinite then there&#39;s no possible way of it ending or stopping all by itsself without any type of intervention but even if it can be tampered with there&#39;s very little that can be done to stop it or destroy it since it IS INFINITE, which means whatever your destroying will never cease to come back and you&#39;ll be destroying it for an eternity.<br>So the bottom line is, that either way, finite or infinite the universe will never ever be gone forever. <br>", "comment_date": "2015-05-22T16:28:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZallCaTor", "comment_text": "I&#39;m only 19, and I&#39;ve seen the rise of pocket computers, DvDs, touch technology, YouTube, drone technology, 3D printing, the pixel art fab, and much much more.", "comment_date": "2015-05-22T16:23:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charles Watson", "comment_text": "the idea that the universe as we know it will die at some point in <b>time</b> assumes the existence of time beyond human perception.

With it&#39;s help, that last one blackhole, raised from all the others blackholes, will evaporate reaching a certain limit os mass. When that happens it will not just keep evaporating untill it vanishes completely, like a pool of water, it will explode billions of times more dramatically than a supernova, and (I really believed this), the Universe will raise again, like a Fenix does from it&#39;s own ashes, and how the hell will happen after!<br><br>So, what you guys think about that?<br><br>Bruno Pr\u00edncipe \u00a0 \u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-12-22T13:10:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "o--Kane101--o", "comment_text": "This is awesome.
