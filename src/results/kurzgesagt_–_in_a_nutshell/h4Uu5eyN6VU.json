This concerns not only sanctions, but literally everything.The goals of US policy in Europe are: centrally through the EU AND EURO CURRENCY to plunder Europe with the help of numerous financial pyramid schemes and frauds, and the main pyramid was and remains the US dollar; to pit Europe and Russia against each other and cause a new big war that saves the United States, and then write off all its debts FOR WAR, build new Marshall plans, plunge war-torn Europe into a new debt bondage. today&#39;s strengths and capabilities.I want to emphasize this with a thick red line - the United States is openly and purposefully preparing a global war, this is their only alternative for today, and a world war, so that it really is a world war, can only break out in Europe as a clash between Europe and Russia. That is why the attention of thinking people all over the world is riveted to the war in Ukraine, which is conceived as a fuse for the war in Europe.<br><br>He said this in 2014, and apparently he was right.<br><br>Over the moment, an oligarchy has developed in the United States, which is one of the forms of autocracy. Scholars Martin Gilens of Princeton and Benjamin Page of Northwestern University conducted a study that showed that the policies of the United States government are in the interests of the rich and their influence groups, and not the wishes of the majority. The scientists note that \u201cthe main conclusion that follows from our study is that economic elites and organized groups representing the interests of business have the ability to significantly influence the policies pursued by the US government, while groups formed to protect the interests of the masses, and ordinary citizens have little to no influence.<br><br>The real income of the average American has not risen for several decades, despite the fact that GDP per capita has been growing during this time. The oligarchs benefited from this growth, while the Americans got nothing. In 2011, according to PolitiFact and others, the top 400 richest Americans &quot;have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.&quot;<br><br>Although the United States is the largest economy in the world, it still does not have free medicine and higher education.

And the people have no real power. In the USA, it is an autocracy, while in the EU countries they are actually colonies of the USA and the power there does not belong to the people, but to the USA, or rather to the American oligarchs.

Since the founding of the European Union, it has been in everyone\u2019s interest to make sure that the EU stays united, and acts with regard to everyone\u2019s opinion. However, the expansion of the EU in the 2000s has led to the integration of many states which, to a great extent, still feel detached from the EU. Even in the founding Member States, citizens still feel that their votes are not enough to influence the decisions of the European Parliament.<br>This is closely correlated to cultural integration into the EU, and figures show that some of the basic steps towards a united EU and the enforcement of democracy are missing. For example, despite an average of 40-50% of citizens throughout the EU feeling \u201cEuropean\u201d along with their own cultural ethnicity, up to 10 years ago, the majority did not know their rights as EU citizens. This result varied, with countries such as Italy, France and Greece having low percentages of citizens who know their rights, with some as few as  \u2044  .Although these figures have risen, a parallel rise in Euroscepticism, the feeling of doubt towards European Integration has led to citizens demanding more from the EU. The Special Eurobarometer survey on the Future of Europe in Autumn 2020 highlighted the vast majority of citizens wanted their voices to be heard, regarding the future of the EU.<br>Furthermore, the feeling of being detached from the EU can also be justified when looking at the internal structure of the European Parliament. Newly-integrated states have consistently had less of an impact on decisions of the EU, something which stems from and, at the same time, causes low voter turnout in many states. If we examine the Distribution of politicians in leadership positions in the European Parliament, we can clearly see a difference between Member States,reflecting this democratic detachment. Therefore the influence and power of each Member State might not be distributed equally amongst all states. Specifically, Germany, France and Italy together have 160 officials in such positions, while Latvia, Cyprus, Slovenia, Lithuania and Croatia have 10 officials combined. It is in our best interest to let these countries, and everyone that feels democratically detached, make their voices heard as this would not only benefit them, but the EU as a whole, as we know that all of us together can achieve much more that any of us alone.<br>         <br>Stakeholders and measures in place<br><br>The European Commission (EC) proposes changes to the Parliament. Apart from the campaigns aimed at increasing voter turnout in most EU states such as Greece or Hungary, the Commission recently established one of the most important measures towards increasing the democratic representation of all EU citizens: The Conference on the Future of Europe. It is defined as \u201ccitizen-led series of debates and discussions\u201d, with the goal of offering dialogue directly between citizens and the EU. Initiated by the Joint Declaration on the Conference on the Future of Europe,. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von de Leyen, says that by implementing the conference, we \u201cinvite all Europeans to speak up\u201d. The conference will take physical and digital formats all across the EU, with one of its most important features being an online platform that is to be set, allowing citizens to submit their ideas on current affairs and issues that concern them. It is up to local authorities and governments to also organize related events and invite young people to participate. The EC along with two other stakeholders, the Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament, represented by their leaders, make up the Conference&#39;s Joint Presidency.<br>The Secretariat-General of the EC is composed of top-ranking officers that are elected. It supports the whole commission and oversees the coherence of its work in shaping new policies. Therefore, it is the main body responsible for making sure that all policies equally affect all member states\u2019 needs and that they are applicable in all scenarios.<br>The \u201cEurope for Citizens\u201d initiative is a EU funding programme for \u201ccitizens to participate and engage in democracy at the EU level\u201d.. It has funded more than 1,700 projects, with Slovakia, Hungary and Italy being some of the most funded countries for 2014-2018, showing demand to combat the low turnover in votes and participation in EU elections.<br>The Directorate General for Regional Policy of the Commission, is in charge of the EU\u2019s Cohesion policy. The Cohesion Policy, aimed at establishing the harmonious development of state, has as a goal to increase democratic participation in EU matters and the decisions of the Parliament. For example, the Directorate General recently approved and funded the Youth in Action for Cohesion Policy (YACOPO) Project, which is aimed at increasing youth participation in the design and implementation of cohesion policy in the Italian region of Sardinia. The interest of the EU in involving citizens also resulted in the recent high-level conference \u201cEngaging citizens for good governance in Cohesion Policy\u201d, held in February 2020 in Belgium.<br>When considering the economic reasons behind anti-integration policies by most right-wing nationalist parties, a new stakeholder enters the conversation, the World Trade Organization. One of the main reasons countries want to leave the EU, is the policies it holds on trade. Being one of the areas the EU has exclusive competence in, the conditions for trade in each country have to adhere to EU laws, with the exchange of free trade between Member States. If a state such as Britain decides to leave the European Economic Area of the EU, would have to trade under rules set by the WTO. Many small traders and businessmen in heavily taxed countries that need to respect the laws of the EEA feel like their needs are being ignored, thus economic reasons become the driving force behind some anti-integration policies. <br><br>Key conflicts<br><br>Inclusion vs Sovereignty: There has been continuous conflict between supporters of the EU and nationalists that want the EU to be the only sovereign body that can take decisions. The issue ofEU democraticanditsdefactoroleasafederationhasbeenapparentsinceitsinception,inthe late 20th century. In the status quo, national parliaments remain the legitimate representative bodies in Europe\u2019s transnational structure. The competences of the EU are limited to international relations, monetary currency and fundamental rights and right now, relations between EU states are considered matters of international diplomacy. However, the current model of law-making in the EU also allows for inequalities between Member States withstate governments having most control over issues that concern the people. Although it can be argued that all states democratically authorize their government to act upon their behalf, many Eurosceptics argue that their representation in the EU parliament is not sufficient to put forward their needs. A form of direct connection between the EU, the Council and the citizens might be a beneficial approach, but it also faces financial and bureaucratic restrictions.<br>Another similar conflict could be centralization and state authority. The European Parliament\u2019s Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy party, although now defunct, proved that the years a er the economic crash of 2009 were not very easy for all EU citizens. Loans were issued and taxes increased, resulting in anti-integration policies being adopted by many populist politicians across the EU. These people argued that state authority must be increased and that the EU\u2019s plans did not equally benefit all Member States. The trend of centralization in the EU\u2019s decision making goes against this, as the decision structure of the EU gives significant policy-making strength to institutions whose power does not come from national elections, such as the European Commission or the European Central Bank.<br>Many have accused the EU of being a federation, and have criticised its decisions to push Member States to give up some of their sovereign functions, mostly those in the areas linked to the single European market, including regulations for trade and competition. Moreover, many states have given up monetary policy sovereignty and are part of what we know as the Eurozone. All these measures allow for the EU to take decisions and influence the economic functions of states which has potential for many beneficial functions, but also gives critics the opportunity to accuse the EU of infringing on the states\u2019 rights. Therefore, the current state of the EU projects some opportunities and obstacles which you, as delegates, have to discover, and avoid, respectively.", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T18:20:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "James Dinius", "comment_text": "I like how the UK just floats away.", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T13:45:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stari 6", "comment_text": "EU is maybe kind of democratic but democracy isnt best thing on the world becouse not always you are in the majority so you just let others to do what they want", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T12:37:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max lopolo", "comment_text": "Oh this is horseshit.<br>No, it is not.

If you empower the EU and diminish the power of the member states and their leaders, you will end up most likely with a monolithic government like that of the current United States - trending towards being one people instead of many. This means a strong central government that can do more, but is also more bitterly fought over for control of it... so don&#39;t be surprised if you choose this option that you will see a partisan, polarized EU in the future like what America currently &quot;enjoys&quot;. The upside (sort of) is this means a more cohesive state, but EU bureaubirbs who you may not like or know at all will have more power over you, and individual freedom of the states and possibly the citizens themselves will be less than the following possibility.  <br><br>However, if you vote for individual member states and heads of state to retain their power and influence, you will most likely end up with a union or coalition with strong what we call &quot;state&#39;s rights&quot; in the USA - which can be good or bad. Depending on how far you go with this, you can still end up with the modern USA government, or another form of government that didn&#39;t do so well... I&#39;ll get to it in a bit. State&#39;s rights in their current form means that Americans can choose on a state level if they want, say, recreational or medicinal marijuana to be legal, which I think is a good thing. However, this also means that individual states can do bad things and even the President can&#39;t do much about it, like the recent Republican efforts to &quot;clean up voting&quot; in the USA after Donald Trump lost the 2020 Presidential election - many having a large outcry over this attempt to make voting harder, mainly affecting Democratic voters like the poor and people of color. But partially because of state&#39;s rights, President Biden can&#39;t do much about it. Congress has to act at a national level to prevent such things, and this is unlikely given the Senate is currently split 50/50 between Trump leaning Republicans and Democrats.<br><br>If you go too far with state&#39;s rights, you end up with a Confederacy, where the states are very powerful and independent, where the central government does not hold much power at all. This was tried twice in American history - once at a national level, under the highly ineffective Articles of Confederation, which did not even give the national government to raise taxes at all if I remember correctly, and then in the American South, when states split off and formed the Confederate States of America. Due to its very nature, ignoring all industrial disparity in the war between North and South, the CSA was not a very functional state; for example, in the waning days of the war, they repeatedly requested more men and supplies for the Civil War from the member states... only for many members to refuse, saying basically &quot;I don&#39;t want any of our Texans dying to defend a bunch of Virginians.&quot; There may be some upsides to a confederacy, but it is unlikely that either the USA or the EU will ever see this type of government ever again, given modern trends towards more state power and centralization.", "comment_date": "2021-04-12T23:00:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BlueEngland", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Uu5eyN6VU&amp;t=2m00s\">2:00</a><br>lmao uk just flies away from the eu", "comment_date": "2021-04-11T23:22:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian McDermott", "comment_text": "UK be like <b>Ight imma head out</b>", "comment_date": "2021-04-10T21:47:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter T\u0159ebensk\u00fd", "comment_text": "European Council and Council of the EU<br>I wouldn&#39;t come up with more confusing names myself", "comment_date": "2021-04-10T13:18:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Idk", "comment_text": "Sus", "comment_date": "2021-04-08T13:06:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adamender909", "comment_text": "I like how Manx people were technically a country\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf2 in a country\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f in a country\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 in a country\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa", "comment_date": "2021-04-07T18:55:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eistee Pfirsich", "comment_text": "The EU sucks", "comment_date": "2021-04-06T14:17:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucas Wendel", "comment_text": "And thats why I vote Volt Europe \ud83d\udc9c", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T22:34:53Z", "likes_count": 21}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Marshall", "comment_text": "As a Canadian  i have only one question.....whats the point?", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T12:54:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vojtech Cecka", "comment_text": "I can confirm that for czech translation you chosen the best youtuber you could.", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T17:37:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Godwill Galit", "comment_text": "I HOPE UNITED KINGDOM JOINS THE EUROPEAN UNION SOON", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T02:24:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jimmothy Pakistan", "comment_text": "That isnt anarchy thats kleptocracy", "comment_date": "2021-03-30T23:55:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Creative 8D", "comment_text": "Yes<br>No <br>Vote now on ur phones", "comment_date": "2021-03-30T00:07:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lukas_flipgrath", "comment_text": "What if you took all the lightning in the world and made it a bomb", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T23:28:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aidenjames youtube", "comment_text": "The uk \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 has left since this vid", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T11:47:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel H", "comment_text": "I&#39;m French, studied the European Union politics and laws at university... the pros vastly outweigh the cons.

Nations like Germany, France, Denmark etc are applauding themselves for their reduced emissions, the same nations that are quick to scold the newest member states for their pollution and carbon footprint. Essentially not allowing developing nations to industrialize, completely ignoring the fact that these nations have historically polluted orders of magnitude more than the countries they are scolding.

You could give it the power of legislative initiative or the power to appoint and dismiss the European Commission on its own, similar to the parliaments of member-states. The big issue with that reform, though, is that doing so will empower the EU to make and pass laws binding all EU citizens without the consent of the member-state governments. <br>\r<br>This is what happened in the US. Originally the only part of the American federal government that was elected by the people was the House of Representatives. The Senate was elected by state legislatures and the President was elected by the Electoral College, whose members were appointed and told how to vote by the state legislatures. This gave state governments a lot of power over the federal government and kept the country largely decentralized. But after complaints from voters about the undemocratic nature of the Senate and Presidency, a series of reforms were passed in the 19th century. The President is still elected by the Electoral College, but now state governments organize elections for President and require their representatives in the College to vote with the plurality of their state&#39;s voters. The 17th Amendment to the Constitution was passed, which made Senators directly elected by the public. These reforms have made the American federal government far more democratic, but they also severely weakened the state governments. There is now no branch of the American federal government that derives its power from the state governments, which means it can pass laws without having to consult with or get approval from the states.\r<br>\r<br>Now, I personally believe that, in general, the more democratic a system, the better. I much prefer today&#39;s federal government structure over the original form. But it still came at a cost to American federalism. These democratic reforms have made the federal government far more powerful at the expense of the states, which is not what the framers of the Constitution intended. I personally don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad thing, but many Americans do. The European Union is now facing that same conundrum. Which is more important to EU citizens: making the EU more democratic or preserving the powers of the member-state governments?", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T18:54:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thierry Boulette", "comment_text": "Polska \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Uu5eyN6VU&amp;t=3m13s\">3:13</a>", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T15:31:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B\u00e1ch L\u00e2m T\u00f9ng", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Uu5eyN6VU&amp;t=2m02s\">2:02</a>: Britain with Brexit: <b>floats away</b>", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T10:42:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Thierry Boulette", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Uu5eyN6VU&amp;t=4m57s\">4:57</a> the old but gold &#39;euro-peein&#39; joke is back :)", "comment_date": "2020-09-27T21:11:56Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Thierry Boulette", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Uu5eyN6VU&amp;t=4m24s\">4:24</a> Ye Olden Days includes the 90s.

The Directive would create strong automatic exchange of tax information laws that would expose literally trillions of hidden funds that the rich and famous avoid taxation by using the UK\u2019s banking system to access them. The Directive was very unique, and like its predecessor, applied to all these places because, although not in the EU, the UK is directly responsible for them, and by virtue of its constitutional relationship with them, has direct access to their banking systems unlike any other country on Earth.<br><br>I say it is now clear, because the Companies Act 2006 has now been amended by the (UK Exit) Regulations, which expose exactly what was intended, such as allowing companies to avoid using auditors authorised within the EU, who are not obligated to abide by its standards against tax evasion and avoidance, including the EU Savings Directives. The many explicit amendments there make it very clear now what the intention was all along, and it makes sense when you put all the pieces together.<br><br>It was proposed in 2014 (i.e. when the referendum talk all started) and was to come into force in 2016 (i.e. when the referendum was to take place). Naturally, it was backed by MANY rich and powerful tax avoiders around the world, including the likes of Rupert Murdoch \u2014 who controls the British press \u2014 rich politicians like Boris Johnson, and NIgel Farage: who is a rich banker who worked for Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnaise for many years, naturally gaining many contacts ready to back him. <br><br>The majority of the European Research Group (ERG) are also very rich, using the tax havens in question to avoid paying due tax \u2014 Nigel Farage has even admitted to this. Of course there is tax planning, which many rich and famous use, but the danger here is tax evasion: which currently, the UK\u2019s tax havens are very easy to take advantage of in order to do so; the EU Savings Directive 2016 would have exposed all their tax avoiding/evading schemes, and made them susceptible to paying UK tax to the order of trillions of pounds per year.<br><br>Those at the top of the BBC, such as Robbie Gibb, were also in on it, being wealthy and actively trying to adjust broadcasting so as to convince the public that Brexit was the right thing to vote for. Rupert Murdoch had the country in his hand, and could use his press to convince the country similarly. The rich politicians had the power to implement the result. Since all of the tax havens linked to the UK, when considered together, count for more than half of the world\u2019s tax havens, there is no doubt that wealthy people around the world rely on their secrecy in order to avoid tax, and therefore have been backing Brexit so as to avoid being discovered by the EU Savings Directive. This is why we had a variety of very rich people coming out as in support of Brexit, including Donald Trump, although he also admitted he sees the EU as competition, and therefore inevitably would like to have the edge over it again, by seeing the UK depart, and once again seeing the USA as the world\u2019s most powerful single market again over the EU.<br><br>The real issue though is, why didn\u2019t anyone come clean with the truth about the cause behind Brexit? If there is a real benefit to avoiding the EU Savings Directive for the UK, in terms of money it makes through the banking system with the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories, then why not say so? Or is there really no benefit to it, other than to the rich and famous, who can keep avoiding paying UK tax? Although, when you consider the huge amount of tax that would become due under the EU Savings Directive, bringing billions of pounds to the UK, it is hard to see how anything could possibly counterbalance that and potentially have a greater benefit to the UK.<br><br>So the problem therefore is that they intentionally planned this together \u2014 the media, politicians, and financiers \u2014 but did not tell anyone the real reasons behind it, or that they were even working in tandem. It became pretty explicit how Nigel Farage was working with the Conservative Party ERG at the end of the show and the 2019 election, but was never explicitly mentioned, and it is only through whistleblowing MPs that we know about those complicit at the BBC, such as Robbie Gibb, who at the time, had transferred from the BBC to the Conservative Party press team, through links he had with ERG members.<br><br>This is beginning to look like a scandal more and more. The BBC should be neutral. The press should report the news for the benefit of the reader, not to ensure the rich mogul at the top keeps his billions by influencing the audience to vote for it by telling them a whole host of different reasons why they should, EXCEPT the real reason. <br><br>The British people deserve better than this. I hope the contents of the Companies Act (EU Exit) Regulations becomes more widely scrutinised, and that the people of the UK find some way of discovering truth. My only fear is that with the press entirely behind it, capable of convincing the people to do what they want them to do, for their own benefit, rather than informing them of the truth \u2014 and with politicians also readily telling their constituents they are acting to their benefit, when really they are purely acting in their own interests \u2014 and the interests of those financiers who pay the MPs to implement laws to hide their money: the UK people may not discover the truth for many years to come. The truth behind Brexit is something that sadly, will only be the topic of historical case studies, and not present day justice.<br><br>Edit: apologies for length.

It is why the EU is not a democracy at all. <br>A nondemocratic government could be filled with good intention and act for its population and prosperity as its priority. This is not the case with the EU, the laws there are restricting the freedoms of the citizens in terms of speech, in terms of entrepreneurship in the profit of a few large corporations, that does not even create jobs here in EU but outsource their production. Our tax money goes to these EU based corporations. The rest relies on mass immigration to enforce cheap labor for the remaining jobs the citizens cant do due to their level and needs.<br>The EU is a social-liberal theory that is in the end a monster of a bureaucratic machine that doesn&#39;t even act in favor of the people.

With many new training places - more private property - much better infrastructure and many satisfied young families. With a lot of money we have developed the foundations for very good photovoltaics, the best wind turbines, heat pumps, inexpensive and scalable electricity storage, revolutionary electronic components for power electronics and much more. By stopping the energy revolution (many bankruptcies in photovoltaics and now just starting in the wind industry) in favour of a few oligopolists, Mrs Merkel and her helpful Mr Gabriel have prevented a model of energy supply that is changing the world. Everything can be financed by the saved gas, oil and coal. It&#39;s not just traffic - heating and cooling devours far more energy. We also have solar-powered air-conditioning systems - operated by tube collectors - driven with hot water from 80 degrees out of solar heatpipes - without an compressor. We have redox flow batteries and other chemical batteries such as sodium hydroxide etc. etc.. Solar systems and house batteries instead of emergency power generators are a worldwide and a future market. Many years ago, Mr. Schremp and Mr. Piech already closed the most advanced battery factory in the world at that time - possibly because Qatar and other oil sellers had significant stakes in both Daimler and VW. A world that would only have half the current consumption of gas, oil and coal within two years would be a different one. We could have served as an example - now China is doing it under much worse conditions. Not only our car managers - who are only instruction dependent - but also our politicians have made the world worse than it should be caused by lacking foresight.", "comment_date": "2019-07-12T11:59:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gal Rozin", "comment_text": "Please make hebrew captions for this video.", "comment_date": "2019-07-12T06:46:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gal Rozin", "comment_text": "Hebrew captions!", "comment_date": "2019-07-12T06:45:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frog", "comment_text": "Yes.

If the EU Parliament were to gain a stronghold of power in the EU, and completely dominate the decision-making, then I fear the EU would become more of a single state than a varied mix of independent states. Up until relatively recently, the only common interest binding the EU 27 together was economic, with peace, co-operation and basic democratic and liberal ethos providing a foundation for unity. A recognition that harmony and solidarity would strengthen defence against certain foreign powers (*cough* Russia *cough*) was also a factor. However, it was always agreed that the sovereignty of the member states came first. To allow the EU Parliament (a body directly elected by hundreds of millions of people across 27 nations) to assume the majority of power is to disregard the diplomatic relationship between states and essentially merge 27 countries into a single, all-powerful state. I\u2019d prefer to keep the relationships diplomatic, thanks. Ireland (where I\u2019m from) would get trampled on in any international election, pitting our meagre 5 million people against Germany\u2019s 80 million and France\u2019s 65 million in a battle for resources, infrastructure and laws.

Are people educated and responsible enough to make such important decisions? Maybe not but let&#39;s get one thing straight - until people aren&#39;t directly involved in voting in and changings laws, this system that we currently have in place will remain a form of\u00a0technocracy.", "comment_date": "2019-05-26T02:39:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stassis", "comment_text": "Why can&#39;t they all be independent countries?

Basically, we can agree on a lot of things, especially pertaining to what the laws should be.  The EU, however, is composed of nations that have been killing each other for hundreds of years, and have lots of cultural differences between them.

I <i>do</i> think it is important to recognize the sovereignty of the individual nations and afford them a large degree of autonomy.  This would also be more democratic, as it would place more control over a country in the hands of the voters within that country.  Honestly, even in the US I&#39;d rather see less power in the hands of the federal government and more power in the hands of local governments.<br><br>I also disagree that the affairs between states were &quot;anarchy&quot; and undemocratic before organizations like the United Nations and EU came along.  When those countries became democratic, they gained the opportunity to vote for leaders who would or wouldn&#39;t go to war, and surprisingly powerful nations aren&#39;t always full of voters who are okay with conquering other nations and taking their stuff.  This goes double if the profits of war are going to enrich the politicians rather than the people, as is often the case.

A great example of this is the varying legality of cannabis products at the state level (some have legalized while others not), while the substance remains federally legal.

The fact that this is downplayed is an incredible testimony to bias.   Let&#39;s go over what was just said.  The birds say that today the parliament must approve binding laws and the budget.   That means that very recently they didn&#39;t have a say.  That means that the only part of the federation that you elected was there to sit pretty and make a show of democracy with no power whatsoever,  but wait now they can disagree so it&#39;s democratic.   Fuck off.  Do we have no idea how the state operates?  There are no lobbiests in parliament?  Is there a single member of the parliament in question of the working class?  Is the position and election not downplayed to obscur the role and its consequences.  Is there even on vocal, populist actor in parliament,  count just one?   No?  Then that is very curious.  <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Uu5eyN6VU&amp;t=5m00s\">5:00</a> is such a disgusting argument.  It assumes the complete stupidity and ignorance of the audience.   Who in government makes the law?   PARLIAMENT.   Does it not seem weird that the EU should name its only elected institution parliament despite the institution lacking any attributing characteristic of a parliament?  But the birds will have us believe that only a disgruntled minority believe that a parliament that can&#39;t also make law is anti democratic.   You may have missed the slight of hand so let me say it again.  <br><br>The only institution that has the power to make law in a democracy is parliament.   The only institution that has the ability to make law is a democracy is parliament.   If that is not the case than the government in question is not democratic.   It is not a question of should the parliament also get to make law.  No if you have an unelected body making law you don&#39;t have democracy.   <br><br>Unelected bodies making law is a big fucking issue.  In America it&#39;s the fcc telling telecommunications companies they can do whatever they want.  It&#39;s secret commissions pushing the TPP with oversight and with no ability to even see the contents of the thing.  It was suggested before the contents were leaked that it was crazy  assume anything senister about the TPP.   The EU was involved in the TPP.   None of the member states or the people had say.  It was handled by a body of unelected officials.   So the next time your state tries to pass a popular law based on the popular will of the people and the EU and an international court stuffed full of capitalist pigs tell your country that they can&#39;t pass that law and can&#39;t represent the popular will of t people because it goes against capitalist interests you can explain to me how the ripe bloody fuck that&#39;s democracy", "comment_date": "2019-05-20T17:24:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MasterSamus", "comment_text": "Why is a science education channel making political content?", "comment_date": "2019-05-20T17:24:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pete Jensen", "comment_text": "Your description of Anarchy feels... lacking.

Something either is, or is not democratic, so the question demands a yes or no answer, and that answer is emphatically no, it is not.

Now ask &quot;Is the EU commission democratic?&quot; Being an appointed, and unelected body, the answer is obviously &quot;No.&quot; Therefore we can conclude that the policies of the EU are not democratic because they are decided by unelected commissioners. Therefore, the EU is NOT a democratic institution. Whether those policies are then voted on by the elected representatives makes no difference, as they are only able to discuss and vote on what was dictated to them by those unelected commissioners. This would be like the house of lords deciding what the commons can debate, with the lords setting policy and dictating the function and form of any legislation, then instructing the commons to approve or disapprove it, and decide what colour and flavour it should be.

I am NOT ok with a centralised federal government with its own powers of taxation, military control and control over all import/exports. Britain voted against a federal Europe but bit by bit that is what it has become. Federalism by the backdoor, a small group of politicos decided they could profit from a single centralised government and when it was voted down they went ahead and did it anyway. When unified monetary policy causes entire countries to go bankrupt the EU response is ever closer unification, with a power grab over sovereign powers of taxation and a threat of financial punishment to any county that doesn&#39;t obey. By forcing a single currency and monetary policy they have forced a rigidity to the system that removes the flexibility needed to cope with changing circumstances. When the stresses of forcing incompatible peoples to merge results if the rise of far right extremism and racism, the EU&#39;s only response is to ignore the stresses and push forward while branding anyone who questions the rise of a massive centralised government as a Nazi nationalist, pretty ironic as a centralised control of the European landmass was exactly what Nazi Germany wanted, just exchange racist monsters for corporate opportunists. <br> Lets face it the E.U. is not a collection of democratically elected leaders, it&#39;s France and Germany dividing up the landmass between them with Germany making a tidy profit by lending cash to countries crippled from E.U. control and France getting political control that it has no right to. The poorer countries may have joined up in the hope of a cash boost but it was just a bribe in exchange for their sovereignty, bit by bit their governments will be pushed to the sidelines and more and more control will be ceded to Brussels. Sovereignty forged in blood and war given up for a financial bribe and the promise of peace in exchange for obedience. Goodbye Italy, Greece, Spain pretty soon you&#39;ll just be local states of the mighty E.U. empire held in permanent debt to ensure your continued cooperation with a massive E.U. army at the ready to crush anyone who wants local control back..

Eastern Europe is integrated into the German manufacturing supply chain such that if the defy Germany they can expect to get rekt economically, such that commanding Germany&#39;s vote hands you Eastern Europe&#39;s votes as well.  Germany plus Eastern Europe gives you de-facto power to nominate the European Commissioner and control the Executive of the EU. Having the Commission in your pocket lets you buy votes with patronage appointments and decide the legislative agenda, kneecapping the Parliament as a way of checking the power of the Executive.  So de-facto, control of the SDP can be leveraged into control of all the chambers of the EU and once you have that you can shape EU policy in a way that solidifies your power within the SDP in Germany.

If you&#39;re a Europeanist, you&#39;d likely think that the EU Parliament needs greater power to act as the primary body of the EU, much as a parliament in a Member State would. If you&#39;re a nationalist, you&#39;re probably okay with the current state of affairs or want more power to rest with the Council and the Member State governments, since voting for them is how you&#39;d see the EU being held to account. A regionalist would want more power to the Committee of the Regions and devolved power, for example. &quot;Democracy&quot; being left undefined leads to a lot of room for interpretation and it means different things to different people, especially when it comes to something as convoluted as the EU.

And this option is not really a option most support. And that is cutting you self off international politics. And there is very few that want to cut them selves off completely. The only nations on the planet that have really had this as a somewhat active quasi voluntary goal is North Korea. And even then is debatable how willing there isolation is. But it is a option. You cut you self off from the world and try to be as self sufficient as you can. You still have to watch out a bit that you do not step on someone else toes or you might end up with a war. I am not sure if any nation could pull off this policy well in our modern era to be honest. Though maybe a very large nation that has a lot of natural resource like USA could.

Treating them all as one people results in some not getting what they want or need. If you think the EU is fair and equal, you&#39;re sorely mistaken. The EU is run on tyranny and brutality. Step out of line, you get sanctioned. They operate by getting Eastern European nations addicted to the money they steal from Western Europeans like a pimp gets their child sex slave addicted to heroin to make them fuck old men to not suffer withdrawal. They treat Eastern Europe like a pimp treats their child sex slave, and they pay for it by stealing from Western Europe. This is not a healthy relationship to have with The EU at all. Either they&#39;re your pimp, or they&#39;re your thief stealing your shit. Either way, the EU sucks dick. Eastern European countries have Western European companies going in there and preventing Eastern Europe from being self-sufficient by preventing them from setting up their own companies by making sure they&#39;re too powerful to compete with.

Yes, this is correct. The EU isn&#39;t stopping this. The invention of nuclear weapons (with their downsides, I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re necessarily great, at least not in every way) stopped that. In fact The EU is a product of not wanting to blow each other up with nukes, but we don&#39;t need The EU to work together. The nukes ensure we would work together anyway, and they ensure that the EU isn&#39;t the reason why we work together, as well. The EU is pointless extraneous bureaucracy and light (increasingly less so) socialism.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s ridiculously complicated.&quot;<br><br>Exactly. It&#39;s opaque. The more complicated the bureaucracy, the less efficient and the more expensive. The less bureaucracy the better. If you have little-to-no bureaucracy, that&#39;s when your country will do the best.

Don&#39;t let your own politicians off the hook. Both your own governments and The EU are to blame for your country&#39;s problems. Leaving the EU would merely be step one towards possible future reformation because other countries can&#39;t abuse you by outvoting you. You&#39;re own government will still abuse you. There&#39;s nothing you can do about that, unless if there&#39;s candidates who offer something different, and even then they can lie. All leaving The EU does is take away their deflection shield. They have no on to blame. It all rests on their shoulders, and now they must take full accountability. That&#39;s all it does...<br><br>It doesn&#39;t matter how you vote.

A lot of criticism is often levelled at it for over interpreting EU law (particularly very carefully negotiated treaty articles) and adopting an approach that is skewed towards promoting further integration. If the ECJ does effectively extend laws then that&#39;s quite a big weight on the non-democratic side.

The combined trade position and defense of the EEG (originally just coal and metal if I recall correctly)  was a perfect position to stay put in. Unfortunately the EU is trying to undermine the very foundation of everything that makes any of it&#39;s members a nation in the first place: Their culture. <br>Worst bit? It would not even surprise me if it were unintentional. The public leaders I&#39;ve seen over the past decade seem incompetent above all.

There are forms of legal corruption within the EU parliament for which there&#39;s no ruling organ to keep it in check. Extra fluff for big corporations, which hamper citizens. Incompetence remaining a ruling factor.

Sure, it is made up of heads of state, but each head of state is answerable only to their own citizens.

The point is that while voting looks like the only option in making global decisions, on some (personal) issues, global decisions should be never made. Democratical systems are hoping that this will be granted by wise enough majority, however looking and practical politics, this assumption is quite questionable. In EU, this is a level higher -- there is a difference between &quot;the majority of states can outvote minority of states on issue X&quot;, or &quot;representatives of every state can decide issue X on their own&quot;.

Several pieces of research (Kluver, Braun and Beyers, 2015 gives a good overview of the research here) show that international corporations, and in fact many smaller interest groups now jump over national parliaments to lobby and instead put influence on the appointed members of the European Commission, who have far less scrutiny put upon them, and are far easier to get an impactful result. To hold them to account, voters essentially have to be investigative journalists in their own right, not only finding out who each commissioner is talking to and being influenced by, but also then try and lobby/influence their own government AND representatives to counter those interest groups, which is beyond the resources of most citizens.

Thusly, the structure is oligarchical in structure as a whole and by design. Furthermore, it is dishonest to represent the power structure as different. The EU does as it wishes, regardless with the will of its member states, with the exceptions of ones which are powerful within it, such as France, Germany, and Italy.

Many of your problems with the EU is the problems we have with the UK, but tenfold. And unlike the EU, reform is abundantly clear not possible within the UK.<br><br>Each member state has their voice heard in the council and commission equally, regardless of population, stopping countries like Germant from having all the power. Each country, again regardless of size, can VETO legislation, opt-out policies and responsibilities and can altogether postpone requirements indefinitely without problem. And although the commission is elected indirectly, they\u2019re at least held account by member state\u2019s leaders and the parliament that gives them power. Each member state can hold the EU accountable for problems, and leave whenever they choose. Whilst all power lies with the EU member states giving devolution to the EU, which can essentially be revoked entirely if the EU fails it\u2019s population, which so far it\u2019s not nor seems to be in the near future, objectively.<br><br>None of this is true for the UK. Despite having a devolved government in Holyrood, it can be overruled, and has been multiple times, by Westminster without warning nor notice. England holds an overwhelming majority of the seats in Westminster, and can therefore unilaterally decide on laws that impact or overrule the other countries of the UK. There\u2019s also a rule that if a law is considered to only affect England or impact majoritarily on England, that no non-English MP can vote. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if it was only English laws, but it\u2019s not - it\u2019s subjective. Meaning if the majority of MPs think the law affects England the most, which given there\u2019s already a majority of English MPs, they can block non-English MPs from voting, even if the laws impact on Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This section has only been introduced under David Cameron, so is relatively recent and has only ever been used a handful of times, which given its potential, it can cause drastic democratic ramifications. Scotland also doesn\u2019t have a VETO (can be overruled), can\u2019t opt-out (like the bedroom tax) and must forwards its responsibilities (contributing \u00a32.2bn in tax more than it receives in expenditure). The House of Lords is completely unelected, and doesn\u2019t require being held accountable of those that appoint them, unlike the Commission - once a lord, always a lord essentially. The Conservative Candidate for North Perthshire in Scotland was made a Lord, despite LOSING the election to the SNP - meaning despite losing the vote, he was given a permanent voice in the House of Lords. Not to mention comparatively with the EU and the UK - the majority of laws and regulations are controlled by Holyrood if independent within the EU to the tone of around over 80%; versus being outside of the EU within the UK at the tone of less than 20%, which so far is decreasing by the day as devolved powers are being revoked. And to make it worse, we have to have permission given to us in order to leave, again from England with the majority of MPs; try telling Hungarians or Greeks that they no longer have a VETO, need Germany\u2019s permission to leave, have their parliaments stripped of powers, made to pay more than they ever receive AND have no benefits of contributing more even if they do, and Germany, France &amp; Italy are given enough seats to hold a majority over all other EU states out together; and then being told that despite voting for one thing, they must follow what Germany has voted on and is told it\u2019s the will of the people of Hungary and Greece too because they willing voted to remain in the EU - see how quickly they want to leave.<br><br>Even the most Eurosceptic individuals must understand that your complaints and issues with the EU are the exact reasons why the UK is such a problem for us, but imagining those problems amplified and on steroids. And knowing that no matter how many compromises you propose and how many false promises they make, there\u2019s no longer a possibility at reform. And to us, the EU isn\u2019t perfect, by no means, the CFP is an example of this which although a good idea, was executed so poorly and needs reform; and exactly that, the EU can and has been reforming and evolving ever since it was created.<br><br>I believe in an independent Scotland within the EU, working with our European counterparts.

Of course there are other things that should be adjusted within, such as: no bureaucratic systems (for some reason the US has bits of these around and they&#39;re undermining our representatives), hard, and enforced, term limits (so as to avoid &quot;career politicians that insist on keeping their ass in their chair until they die, and damaging the government they&#39;re in/represent), no gerrymandering (for some reason that was allowable in our system and it&#39;s begun to create issues; and I haven&#39;t really seen much good come from this).<br>Appropriate adjustments should be made, representing that of the EU members, as of course the Constitution specifies the US (the names can be changed as necessary), and that certain aspects may not be as acceptable by the citizens of the EU nations.<br> I feel that a more protected republic that the US follows, would be very beneficial to the EU. This should also help to improve their economies overall, but, personally, I feel that returning to their sovereign states would be more beneficial than to remain part of a bigger, unwieldy, government.

Very educational. This is more similar to the US government than I thought. The US government was founded on a covenant between state and federal legislatures. Checks and balances were put into place so that one doesn\u2019t become more powerful than the other. Unfortunately, like it says in the video, people became lazy in voting and the people who saw to take advantage of that did. Some checks and balances have been amended, causing a shift in government powers to favor federal. Despite what people think, the US government isn\u2019t what the founding fathers envisioned it to be. A problem with democracy is that some people need to be more visionary and image how laws can influence future generations. Humans generally are impulsive and want things relatively instantaneous with little or no thought to the future \u2014 causing a ripple effect throughout the nation over time. The citizens of the US became annoyed by being denied what they saw as their rights and voted to remove the only safeguard to the future with the 17th amendment. Moral of the story: vote for local authorities. Even though you can\u2019t vote for EVERYTHING, you still have indirect control over everything that\u2019s going on. The more things you have the ability to vote for, the less you\u2019ll honestly vote. The US can see who voted for what, too, but most people are too lazy to check it. Politicians aren\u2019t always the most honest people in the world \u2014 fact checking is extremely important.

The reason this came into being was a) that long ago only few were educated enough to be able to take up such a task and b) a central government is able to gather and use information for the better, that would otherwise not be possible. Although in practice these ideals are not always executed in that exact fashion, it is still the basis for democracy. Secondly, the EU was started as an economic union to raise prosperity. Only after the EU grew and its economic footprint and impact grew, it also became an economic power.

All three of these institutions have failed to maintain peace, because they have never had and never will have any real power.\r<br>\r<br>Likewise the claim that the EU was created to maintain peace and prosperity is not accurate.\r<br>\r<br>The EU did not spring out of nowhere:\r<br>\r<br>1949 the &quot;Council of Europe&quot; was formed\r<br>\r<br>1950 the CoE becomes the &quot;European Coal and Steel Community&quot;, consisting of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, (the founding members).  This was partly caused by some political pressure from the USA regarding Steel - you could (perhaps should?) do an entire video on that one alone, and yes I am aware that we (UK) dropped the ball on that one - how things could have been different.<br>\r<br>1957 the ECSC becomes the &quot;European Economic Community&quot; - and this is important because this is the organisation that most current members actually joined.  It was not created for peace, but for economic power.\r<br>\r<br>1987 the Single European Act is passed.\r<br>\r<br>2007 the European Union was finally formed.\r<br>\r<br>And the above is only a very very very high level overview, there are plenty of other events that led to the creation of the EU - and all of them are vital to understanding the EU, what it stands for (or doesn&#39;t).  But to make the claim that it was created to maintain peace and prosperity is total codswallop.  There are several conflicts that can be laid right at both the EEC and EU&#39;s feet - just like any other political power.\r<br>\r<br>Also, is there any reason you left out EU directives in your video?  They don&#39;t get voted on, we don&#39;t get to say YES or NO to those, nor do our representatives.\r<br>\r<br>Yes the EU is democratic, when it wants to be.  It can also be a power hungry oligarchy, when it wants to be.

Take a bunch of independent sovereigns and unite them to make the collective better as a whole while still maintaining each &quot;state&#39;s&quot; sovereignty. This creates a problem though. How much power do the sovereign states get and which takes more precedence? The State&#39;s sovereignty or the main government? In the US that was decided through the war between the states and the head government took more or less full control over the states. With the EU that question was never truly settled, but for the majority of it&#39;s existence it has seemed to walk the fine line of complete control and state sovereignty quite well, but like all sovereign entities, they slowly try to achieve more and more power. It&#39;s actually something that has been an issue in the US for quite a while where the government has been slowly trying to gain more power over it&#39;s people and the states. This is why some have felt that Britain should leave the EU and why others from different EU countries have felt the same way. The EU in recent years has been slowly creeping into that &quot;complete precedence&quot; area and some believe that it wasn&#39;t what they signed up for so to speak and want to leave. <br><br><br>On the issue with your vote counting or not is kind of complex. The US government took the approach that the people&#39;s vote is very much important but at the same time, what legislation is established and who is elected into power can not be left up solely to the whims of the people and the &quot;uneducated&quot; majority. That is why there is the electoral college, both a house and a senate, and the Supreme court which people can thank Alexander Hamilton for this idea for. It is also why the president has veto powers over congress, mainly the house of representatives which are directly appointed by the people&#39;s vote. Now I&#39;m no expert on how the EU is setup but I imagine that it is very similar to how the US government is set up in terms of things like having a senate and supreme court and an appointing group like an electoral college who are supposed to be the educated elite and are above the whims and rabble of the people and I imagine this is why some may feel that their vote doesn&#39;t matter all that much. In reality Alexander Hamilton was more or less correct though. Something as important as the head of state and major legislation can not be solely left up to the whims of the people. The biggest thing with the EU is that they make sure they do not overstep their bounds as throughout human history, the majority of major sovereigns crumbled because they took too much power over their states and the people.", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T16:31:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Penah \u0130brahimbeyli", "comment_text": "In fact, EU is a modern german empire)))))", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T16:31:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Matkin", "comment_text": "You guys remember when Leftists were against the EU, how times have changed.", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T16:31:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Black", "comment_text": "so let me get this straight...<br>you vote a person in power to vote a person in power to rule the country how you want.<br>sounds like delayed democracy to me. if the entire government went mad with power &quot;cough, cough, Germany&quot; it would take some time for citizens to start replacing politicians from the bottom up. possible long enough for the democracy itself to be removed: Hitler did this.<br><br>Of course being an Anarcho-Capitalist I must leave with saying this: if people are to unintelligent to rule over themselves, then they have just the right amount of intelligence to be ruled over.", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T16:31:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pigsareit", "comment_text": "This video is going too fast", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T16:31:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mmpmaldo", "comment_text": "democratic does not equal good", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T16:31:11Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "A G", "comment_text": "How about just get money out of politics? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T16:31:00Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "itz nani", "comment_text": "why am i here i\u2019m american", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T16:30:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fresh regele junglei", "comment_text": "De la Jimmy Hex", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T16:30:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allyson Mora", "comment_text": "Those birds are adorable!\ud83d\ude19", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T16:30:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Honeybadger21st", "comment_text": "When will people realize big government is not good and small government is better.

The problems and how it works, completely not.  <br><br><br>I do appreciate you telling people to vote though. That is useful. <br><br><br><br>(Also I would get into huge trouble for using many of sources used, looking at you  Wikipedia and over use, of newspapers! Looking at European website, will not high many issues, but is great for explanations.)<br><br><br>1. For the main debate about if the EU is democratic lot, really depends on what you view as democratic. (Which in politics is a huge and very controversial debate). The debate is really if the EU is legitimate.  And if Output legitimacy = legitimacy or if Input Legitimacy =Legitimacy.  Or if voting and representation is what gives you legitimate, therefore the EU is not legitimate. For if Outcomes are good enough.  <br> <br>2.Furthermore the EU was designed to REMOVE democratic decisions from states in the economic and political sphere by following the enacts of Hayek&#39;s Interstate federalism. This was design to stop inference with the market, and limit the scope of democratic decisions which is fear to bring nationalism and unlimited democracy.  (Bonefeld, 2017, Hayek, 1949; Streeck,2015) (This is but one argument of several, their are of course others. )<br><br><br>3. The debate about the EU is about who benefits and why. Larger Nations have more votes at the EC, for instance. The Eurozone heavily favors France and (especially)  Germany due to the changes in exchange rate. As the EuroZone was suppose to complianst a few goals.<br>A make businesses more simple across the region<br>B Make the countries more economically equal<br><br><br>A has been achieved. B has not. In fact Germany for instance, due to the Euro being lower in value than the Deutshmark would be, means that they can produce high goods and low ends goods at competitive prices, therefore being able to compete in markets they should be. This have resulted in the PIG nations being less compeetive before the Euro than prevoiusly, which is a problem. The Euro alos crated bad incentives for poor nations, by creating a moral hazard where hey couls borrow at amounts lower than they should have. This was the main casue of the Euro-zone crisis in 2010. (Varoufakis, 2015) <br><br><br>This is just a small sample.

One of the most prominent is that the European Parliament does not have powers to influence some of the most politically salient topics, at all. Many of these topics have started to be governed by the EU as a result of the member-states&#39; governments signing laws at the EU-level and transferring powers to the EU. Consequently, these powers and laws can no longer be altered by a normal majority vote in any kind of parliament, as in order to change these laws or powers the countries need unanimity. This can lead to a situation where member states have agreed to sign a law about health-care, immigration or public security (three of the most politically salient topics) and the European Court of Justice interprets the law in a way that 27 of 28 member states dislike. They cannot change it, however, as 1 member state d\u00f3es like it and it does not want to budge to amend or nullify the law. The European Parliament only has powers to approve/amend laws about internal market law. This is one of many reasons why the EU is seeing a lot of pushback from lots of political parties across Europe and the next EP elections will mark a radical increase in votes for populist parties, entirely because of the way the EU functions.

Of course, I&#39;m just spitballing here. I&#39;m a US citizen, and I know our form of government isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s better than the EU in terms of how democratic it is. If you think about it, the US started as a loose union of independent countries that eventually formed a strong central government while allowing the remaining legislative power go to the member states.

Sure, there are democratic elements, and ultimately (although several layers down for most positions), all EU politicians are directly or indirectly democratically legitimised. But to call this state of affairs &quot;democratic&quot; misunderstands the point of democracy. The point of democracy is primarily to protect the people from the ruler by giving them control over their government. The EU fails at this task in several different ways.<br><br><b>1. Institutions</b><br>By far the most powerful EU institution, the European Commission, is made up of members sent there by the individual countries&#39; governments, which in turn have formed from the representatives in parliament, which in turn were voted on in elections. Sure, you could say that this makes this democratic (after all, there was a vote involved at some point), but it obviously fails at giving the citizen control over the ruling body. The Commission is controlled by the rulers, not by the people, making it undemocratic.<br><br><b>2. Elections</b><br>The only truly democratically elected EU body is the parliament. However, restriction on how democratic it is still apply. For instance, there is no way to exert control over a politician from another country. This can be a problem, since individual MEPs can become quite powerful if they occupy an important position. Again, you could argue that this is kept in check by party politics which kind of can be controlled by the vote of the citizens, maybe...? But once again, this leaves the actual control firmly in the hands of the rulers, not the citizens.<br><br><b>3. Size</b><br>Size is always a problem for any democracy. The size of parliaments is pretty much constant, no matter how large the population they represent is, since it is limited more by the physical restrictions of how many people can talk to each other in a productive debate with limited space and time than by population size. So the larger a democratic system is, the more people are represented by each individual MP, which leads to misrepresentation of minority groups and poorer representation for everyone.<br><br>I didn&#39;t mention the many examples of simply redoing a referendum when a treaty was rejected by a member country, since these are not inherent flaws with the EU structure - but they still speak to a disregard for democratic decisions by at least some members of the EU institutions.<br><br>These undemocratic elements are understandable in the context of the history of the European Union, being originally designed as a trading union. Trading partners may have to coordinate regulations in order to facilitate trade, so they have to have a body that members delegate sovereignty to - but having every little decision be democratically legitimised in coordination with every member state would not really be feasible. This system is more reminiscent of a constant negotiation between sovereign countries rather than an actual government, so democracy is not really needed. However, the EU has departed from this function and is now drifting closer and closer towards a European superstate, regulating all kinds of things, spending a budget in the member states, with many EU politicians explicitly calling for further integration with the aim of forging one single nation out of the union. In this environment, when the EU really does have its own power and exerts a direct influence over its citizens, this general lack of democratic control and legitimacy is very relevant indeed.", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T15:41:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ricardas Ricardas", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t think a science channel should get itself involved in politics...", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T15:40:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Peracality", "comment_text": "Even if that vote dosnt count but my upvote counts", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T15:40:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperSmileyFace", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Uu5eyN6VU&amp;t=3m04s\">3:04</a> I see England going away", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T15:40:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Solanacia", "comment_text": "It&#39;s just weird how brexit was passed democratically in the UK, but the EU wanted another vote, and when it failed again, they wanted another vote, almost as if the sovereignty of their nation is second-class to the superstate that the EU wants to build.

One of the few examples of democracy in history was that of the ancient Athens, in which the people (the one who had the right to vote, in reality) could vote directly on each law. Those who decided to vote received compensation for the day&#39;s work lost. The ancient Greeks also knew our form of government, which they called Oligarchy. The oligarchs did not make unpopular decisions.. They only believed that the people did not have the skills to take part directly in the decision-making process. How were the oligarchs chosen? Based on their power, that is almost always based on their wealth. Of course, Athenian democracy was often criticized by the oligarchs. It was said that a simple expert orator was enough to bring the masses to even vote against the vital interests of the city. Surely, in part, they were right. Today we know very well that ours are not perfect democracies and that in part we live in oligarchies that counterbalance each other. We give an ideological value to simple tools for implementing the popular will. Is a government more &quot;democratic&quot;? Then it is more &quot;good&quot;. Is it more &quot;oligarchic&quot;? Then it is more &quot;bad&quot;. But i see that the choices taken by Europe have effectively ousted and humiliated the cradle of the concepts of &quot;democracy&quot;: Greece. That those choices helped to destroy the middle classes in Spain. That those choices are squeezing the welfare state in northern Europe. That those choices have made the job more precarious in France. That Europe is raising funds to create an european army.

What are the differences? The concept of modern nation post-war is a positive solution: a homogeneous population in a shared territory where social conflict and dialectics can take place it is a truly democratic structure for society. Now as an european I see a political and economic core, France and Germany, and the other are just colonies.<br><br><br>2)About peace: let&#39;s consider the &quot;anti-war&quot; aspect only. Solidarity and cooperation aside. EU did nothing to stop France or the UK in Libya. The most stable nation of the whole Africa is now a nobody&#39;s land and it has caused thousands of human tragedies in the failure to manage irregular migrants. Malta and specially Italy paid the price for it. <br>Intra-europe we have the example of the Kosovo War (1999, fairly recent) a non-sense war of aggression. <br><br><br>3)Political legitimation, how to deal with different topic and priority from all over the Union: a complete fiasco (they can&#39;t come up with a decent solution or they didn&#39;t want?).<br>It&#39;s a problem for many aspect:<br><br><br>- EU parliament is the only european politcal organ that we vote. We can vote only for our national parties, but they have to form an eurogroup within i think at least 7 country or they loose many parliamentary right. It&#39;s a comprimise of the comprimise. But now the total absurdity of the thing. The parliament has no legislative initiation power. Only the council of the vary EU Minister has it.<br>How does the Council work? We don&#39;t know, there are no documents about them freely available. So laws are decided from Ministers (imho just a few), but in the last ten years single nation like Greece or Italy haven&#39;t got the right to choose their Government via National Vote. I&#39;m talk about M. Monti (European Commissioner) and L. Papademos (BCE) &quot;Technical Government&quot; in the 2011. Strong pressure from the BCE (an indipendent organism) even last year. There was a veto on the proposed Italian financial minister, P. Savona and our Republic President deny the formation of the new government after regular votation in March 2018 just for his view on economics. De facto our actual minister G. Tria is an imposed one. The same thing said M. Renzi ( the ex italian council president) about his financial minister P. Padoan (from OCSE) in 2015. <br><br>The fourth Nation in EU by GDP has no right to choose the most important Minister according to the national consensus. If there are pressure even in other country, we can say that the Financial Council (where decision are made) are out of the reach of the voters. Monti once said in an interview: &quot;The European institutions have accepted the burden of unpopularity, being sheltered from the electoral process&quot;. <br><br><br><br>- 70% of the new Italian laws promulgated by the parliament come from European directives. A directive is not &quot;as it is&quot;, a nation can make some changes to it, but always in a legislative framework that is pretty confusionary. Talking about the Article 13 is too easy. It has been discussed by third parties enough and has had a remarkable media coverage, thus creating a knowledge base on which to decide. What about all the other laws? Our national parliaments have difficult to stick with local laws and reforms because they have to study something who came from outside the country, understand if it&#39;s something that can be positive or negative and then start the usual legislative process. And many, many, many times are dangerous thing, like the Bail-In (BBRD).<br><br><br>- incompatibility between European treaties and national constitutions: a crucial aspect, but long to explain. Briefly we see many rights denied that our constitution took on after the defeat of fascism. One example is: we cannot pursue full employment (Article 4 of the Italian Constitution) because there is a threshold set by the ECB (this year 9%) which we cannot overcome. unemployment becomes a structural fact and no longer temporary.<br><br><br>In conclusion I think that this actual European Union is not democratic by design, and there are no way to &quot;change it from the inside&quot;. However the next vote will matter, and I and I invite you all to vote because we need a democratic and controlled demolition with the restauration of the old European Community.<br><br><br><br>Sorry for the bad english, I used this space for practicing it too.", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T15:01:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Timmy", "comment_text": "If you going create an EMPIRE, you might as well make one that is favorable to the people, instead of establishment elite.

I know because, I ask my people about candidates and, the only knowledgeable ones are people involved with a campaign, and I love politics and discussions there in.

Sometimes not everything is available at the chosen resturant, sometimes its too expensive for one or more people, sometimes others can&#39;t make it to that resturant and even if you find a place where everyone can eat what they want at what they can afford then you sometimes find that people are still upset becuase they had to sit next to somebody eating a food they didn&#39;t like and at the end of the night everyone ends up arguing about who ate what and you find some people haven&#39;t even paid for what they did eat and have  gone home.

While we do not have to arrive at the same conclusion, I am very disappointed in you with how you have decidedly handled this. If you were more interested in the issues of the EU and Democracy, you would have painted a BETTER picture of the pros AND the CONS. Cons such as ultimately, member nations forfeit their sovereignty. The EU is the de facto government of its member nations, its decisions are final. The real question is then democratic for whom? As these decisions can be at complete odds with a given nation&#39;s interest. And No! We cannot just say in the beginning of this video there is no coherent &quot;people&quot; as a sleight of hand to benefit your faith in the EU, and then start going on about democracy. The very idea of democracy is that there is a majority will of the people. Are we honestly to brush aside the ages long idea and importance of self-governance that people have fought for? How does this not undermine the very idea of a nation, a people, a culture? It is not like the same checks and balances are in places that the United States has with its de facto federal government over its member states. Do not get me wrong it also has its issues, such as its commissions, but the level of accountability in the EU is far less.

Lots of people like to blame the federal government for everything that goes wrong, right around election time in particular, even though as pointed out in this video, many times these are the same people already involved in formulating federal law by being our house and senate representatives.  Only in rare occasions do you see people thinking their states shouldn&#39;t be part of the US, like crazy Texas or Alaska secessionists (like Sarah Palin, who then ironically went on to claim how much she loved America when she wanted to be V.P. of it).  America is also full of very diverse people and regions much like Europe, although I recognize that Europe probably has much more defined boundaries of its different peoples, which might create issue when voting on certain topics.

However the people are catching on, fighting to break through, but the top won&#39;t share cake without a fight. The &quot;reasonable center&quot; parties have sold out a long time ago so people go elsewhere.

This should raise major red flags for anyone who lives in eastern europe. <br><br>2. The EU breaks its own regulations over and over again in favour of certain countries. Case in point, the Nordstream 2 debacle, in which Romania has rightfully drawn attention to the fact that the project does not respect EU regulations, only to be ignored and then threatened with Article 7, which further reinforces my first point.<br><br>3. European parliamentarians have openly stated their desire to further centralize the union and dissolve each country&#39;s sovereignty (Juncker, Verhofstadt, Merkel). On top of it, the EU now boasts a project to build an army, which serves to further strengthen their grip on the union and give them the authority to be considered a super-state.<br><br>4.

However, even on democratic grounds it is way more shaky than this video suggests. For example, the appointment of the European Commission president is done typically through back room deals and negotiations involving pan-European political parties and others. It&#39;s not a transparent process and this has been criticized throughout the EU&#39;s history. <br><br><br>The president of the European Commission is the head of the executive body of the European Union, so yes it is a problem that this person has no &quot;popular mandate&quot;, which is the democratic test. Jean Claude Juncker is no mere regulator or civil servant, his commission wields quite a large amount of power over the lives of more than half a billion people, and he has no popular mandate from even a constituency, which heads of national governments do.<br><br><br>Adding to that fact as mentioned in the video, the European Commission is the body that under normal procedure initiates legislation (rather than the actual legislative body, which is directly elected),  it makes it even worse that the President of the commission has no popular mandate from any of the people. You kind of just gloss over this as if it isn&#39;t a problem in this video.<br><br><br>Another issue is where you said &quot;if you don&#39;t like what the EU does on something like copyright, then you can look up how your representative voted and vote them out&quot;. This is true (though only every five years which is the MEPs election cycle, this length of time is too long IMO since the European Parliament is supposed to be the closest body to the people) and it is also true for national representatives. However, what are you chances of reversing policy by not voting for that MEP the next time around? They are EXTREMELY slim. Far more slim than electing a nation government and reversing policy.<br><br><br>And on that, the EU makes it so that even if the public was to essentially replace its whole government, that new government may be unable to reverse the policies of the old, which does to some degree diminish the power of your vote. Does it not? (see poland and the argument over migrant quotas for example)<br><br><br>Another issue is when things become a European competence, national representatives (who are endorsed more in national elections than MEPs are in European elections) can be very limited when it comes to aiding their constituents. Case in point, a British euroskeptic called Jacob Rees-Mogg was contacted by a constituent years ago seeking redress of grievance. The issue was that the man was a farmer, and a cow had died on his farm. He followed the procedure with paperwork and mailed it, reporting the animal had died and how etc. Because this happened at Christmas, the postal service was slow and the paperwork arrived late, and the farmer was fined.<br><br><br>This is a clear case where you should be able to contact your local rep and get this fine thrown out, because the man did nothing wrong, the failure was with the post office. Rees-Mogg sent a letter to the agriculture minister at the time, who refused to help. Rees-mogg was insistent, writing a second letter telling the minister that this man has done nothing wrong and this fine has to be thrown out, it&#39;s unfair. The response he got was essentially that this was an area of European competence, and he has to abide by EU rules and that if the UK failed to fine this man, then the UK itself would be reprimanded. So, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who represents a mostly rural area, could not help this farmer with this injustice even though he was his local elected MP with a popular mandate, and as his MP, he is the man that constituents are supposed to contact when seeking redress of grievance. Now of course people will say that maybe the MEP should be contacted, but actually the MEP can&#39;t do anything either since its technically the UK that has to enforce the fine. That&#39;s a good example of how the EU effectively suppressed one of this farmer&#39;s most important rights, the right to seek redress of grievance and have such a matter resolved by his local MP. <br><br><br>You also didn&#39;t address the democratic deficits in terms of referendums in the EU. Not just the phenomenon of the neverendum that the Irish have experienced a couple of times and so did the Dutch (at the hands of their pro-EU governments who didn&#39;t accept their decisions) but the fact that referendums are discouraged. Even for a major reform treaty, like the Lisbon Treaty, only the Irish voted on it (and rejected it). I remember hearing crazy positions from pro-EU politicians and bureaucrats after the Irish vote like &quot;how can a couple of million people decide for 500 million?&quot;. I agree, so why didn&#39;t the other hundreds of millions get a chance to scrutinize and vote on the institutional, structural, legal etc. changes that Lisbon made to the existing EU treaties? It&#39;s actually even worse than that because in terms of content, it was essentially the European Constitution previously rejected only three years before by the French and Dutch by referendum, just repackaged and named as a treaty. The French and Dutch who rejected the EU Constitution, which in content was largely the same, were denied a chance to vote on Lisbon by their pro-EU governments. <br><br><br>I think it is telling that your video completely ignores referendums entirely because the track record of the EU is bad. I also don&#39;t want to hear the typical go to excuse of &quot;but it was national governments who held the referendums more than once or ignored them&quot;. Yes, it was national politicians who are pro-EU who ran them again or ignored them. Effectively telling the people who vote against the EU that their vote doesn&#39;t count. Many of these politicians are part of pan-European political parties. It IS the EU rejecting referendum outcomes because of that fact, and I see no resistance from Brussels bureaucrats to this practice. Politicians like the EU because it is a potential source of employment. Lose in a national election? Run as an MEP! European Commissioners have lost elections in their own countries, rejected by the majority of their own voters, and then were appointed as Commissioners to effectively legislate for them anyway. This is why there is a such a divide between the public and the politicians / bureaucrats on the EU, the latter has a strong interest in keeping the EU going. A strong personal interest.<br><br><br>But I have gone on waaaay too long here so I&#39;m sorry for the length of the comment but this video is made by people who are clearly pro-EU and trying to influence the upcoming elections. The details you left out were kind of important, and I also don&#39;t think the issue of &quot;whether the EU is democratic or not&quot; is the primary reason why euroskepticism is on the rise. People don&#39;t like what they see as a relentless push toward essentially federalism. You have EU politicians like Martin Schulz or Guy Verhofstadt talking opening about effectively turning the EU into a de facto country. EU militarization is now mainstream politics (being pushed for aggressively by people like Macron etc.) even though it was dismissed before the Brexit referendum in the UK for example, as a fantasy. That was only three years ago. There is also the lingering effects of the Euro which Brussels celebrated last year on its 20th birthday for the &quot;prosperity&quot; it brought Europe, seemingly in a very Soviet-like manner forgetting the hardship it brought to millions in the EU. There&#39;s also immigration, questions about global trade and whether the EU is using tariffs and single market regulations to push out competing products and raising costs on consumers etc. It&#39;s WAY more complicated than democracy.<br><br><br>Sorry for the length of this comment!! lol.", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T13:46:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JERP ER", "comment_text": "I love those little birds", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T13:46:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "saksham gami", "comment_text": "When they say they are simplifying things<br><br><br><br>It makes me feel stupid", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T13:46:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evan C.", "comment_text": "The EU is like what the US did in a slightly different way.

To say the EU is democratic because the EU says it&#39;s democratic is ridiculous tautology, and not an honest appraisal. The issue is not with the fundamental nature of the system; most voting systems work very well when you only look at the advantages and elect not to cover the drawbacks or major complaints against them. Let&#39;s look at the ACTUAL criticisms of the &quot;democratic&quot; EU:<br><br>Firstly, you swiftly ignore the fact that the heads and ministers of the member states who work in the ECouncil and the CotEU are NOT democratically elected; in almost all of the member states, the ministers are appointed by the head and people have literally no control over who that is. In many of the member states, even this head is not elected, and so saying that the people have &quot;a say&quot; in the decisions of the ECouncil and CotEU is extremely unfair. The EU claim to democratic legitimacy is based on grossly undemocratic institutions which themselves are almost always either bipartisan and thereby unrepresentative (e.g. the UK) by exclusion of views, or highly conflicted (e.g. German coalition) and thereby, again, unrepresentative by exclusion of top members of the other parties. <br><br>A second major criticism of the EU is the centralisation of power. Even if the EU were completely 100% voted in, this does nothing to address the systemic democratic injustices, classism, and cronyism which is present in the highly-powerful Western political systems (and I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s better anywhere else in the world). Even the basic SYSTEM of how the EU should be run was never voted upon, but was created by the very elites that people are currently voting against all over the world (see Trump, Brexit party, right-wing rise through Europe, etc.). <br><br>Now, you touched on this last point briefly by saying that voters can &quot;vote&quot; on what they want the continued structure of the EU to look like... but that&#39;s not really the case, is it? What actually happens is that people are forced to vote for parties who represent a single specific issue, because the EU is so ridiculously huge, by lieu of the legislature being designed to cover literally every topic, that nobody can actually vote for structural changes without voting for various other reforms they may or may not want. This is the exact same issue with a two-party system, except, here, it&#39;s on an even larger scale, because voters have to balance the effects of EU legislation on the whole against the effect it has on their own country. In other words, voting reform is effectively impossible without also suffocating your own sovereignty. This is a nifty little trick of having an all-powerful supranational government.<br><br>Finally: you never address the fact that people literally do not have the time in the day to research all of the issues which are constantly being discussed in and about the EU. This is the same tactic that has been used, is being used, and will always be used, by state governments all over the world to pass legislation which the people do not actually want. There is no NEED for there to be a European government; it is a flight of fantasy which was designed with a purpose. It&#39;s not an institution founded of/by/for the people, it&#39;s a rich club of crony corporatists who want to create a European superstate -- you even state this in your video without ever mentioning that this is the MAIN reason people dislike the EU. Its very existence erodes national sovereignty, regardless of if their heads of state or ministers can vote in it. <br><br>You should take this video down and actually speak about the democratic concerns that people REALLY have with the EU, instead of pretending to ask a question and then answering with the standard EU laundry list of explanations.", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T13:43:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harry Harson", "comment_text": "That&#39;s not what anarchy means", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T13:43:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eoghan", "comment_text": "The question is should the E.U have all these institutions and power in the first place?", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T13:43:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chen Jackie", "comment_text": "I love Kurzgesagt !", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T13:43:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vladutz19", "comment_text": "8.8 Million Subscribers?

I may be completely wrong, but to me, the fact many of the EU&#39;s institutions are run by the member states rather than the parliament doesnt make it any more or less &quot;democratic&quot;. As you said yourself, democracy means it&#39;s run by the people. Cool, all european member states have democratic governments, elected in more or less well handled elections*. Thus, even if the entirety of the EU institutions were run by the member states, they&#39;d still fall under the category of &quot;democratic&quot; - though very indirect. But presumably we&#39;re mostly fine with indirect democracy, where we elect representatives who do the actual decision making for us. It&#39;s how most countries are run. Having those representatives choose their own representatives one level above is just another layer of representative democracy. And just because you add a layer of representation doesnt make the system inherently undemocratic : in the US, no elector directly votes for the president, they choose super electors who do that. In Germany, one of our chambers of parliament is made up of people chosen by the states&#39; governments, which are of course also elected one layer down. Also in Germany, we dont elect a president at all, rather it&#39;s the parties who do so - with the mandate of having been elected themselves in non-presidential elections previously. All of these procedures are considered democratic.<br>Oh, and for the record : Im not saying that this system or the examples I provided were perfect or even good systems to be kept necessarily. Especially the US presidential and the EU institution election systems are in dire need of a complete rework - BUT, Im disputing this idea that having them be chosen by elected representatives is undemocratic. It&#39;s less direct and thus more complex.<br><br><br><br>Also, this is the bottom line of many problems of the EU : not that it&#39;s undemocratic, but it seems that way. Let&#39;s face it, most people think about politics very rarely and dont understand the systems that rule them or the very elections they participate in. They also oftentimes have a very hazy view on the issues they are asked to decide on. That&#39;s also how one gets shitty results like the Brexit vote - yes, the british people are very euro-sceptic, but they were also very uninformed (generally and specifically). The point is, it&#39;d be much better to restructure and simplify the european institutions. Give more power to the parliament, have some sort of elected &quot;face&quot; for the EU : a chancellor to the parliament, a directly or indirectly (by the parliament then) elected president, something like that. That way, people would know who is doing things in the EU, they could be talked to by those who take the decisions, that would be discussed more and maybe understood better. Also, it&#39;d be easier to identify with a human group rather than the current rather lifeless entity that we got...<br><br><br><br><br><br>*The question of how well these elections are run, how good each system is and if some member states fail at some of the democracy-rules is quite another topic.", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T13:28:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brigham richins", "comment_text": "As a U.S. Citizen, this waa a good breakdown as to what&#39;s going on across the pond, thank you.", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T13:28:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suraj Grewal", "comment_text": "America-each state with it&#39;s own law having greater influence<br>Eu-forget what the countries say...

There may have to be a second referendum. If there is a No-Deal brexit then there will be a run on the GB pound(\u00a3) as the UK&#39;s external debt is US $ 8 Trillion. Honda has recently announced that it will close its car plant in Swindon by 2021. Thomas Cook, the world\u2019s first holiday company, announced recently that they lost \u00a31.5 Billion in the last 6 months due to brexit, BMW have now stated that if there is a No-Deal Brexit they will stop Mini Cars production in the UK. If there is a No-Deal Brexit that means that 80% of the UK\u2019s exports to the EU are service products which can be blocked legally because there is no international legal protection for service products. That means that \u00a3200 Billion a year to the EU would be lost and an extra \u00a3300 Billion a year of service product export to the rest of the world. All countries needs loans and investment to function and if the UK does not want access to the Single Market that means they will lose their financial passport which will deny the UK to sell the service products to the EU. In October 2016 the UK external debt was US $ 9.5 Trillion. Over 2 years it has been reduced by nearly US $ 2 Trillion. All countries needs loans and investment to function and if the UK does not want access to the Single Market that means they will lose their financial passport which will deny the UK to sell the service products to the EU. To pay for foreign imports the UK must pay in US Dollars($), Euros, Chinese Yuan, and Gold Bullion, but NOT GB pounds(\u00a3). The UK will not be able to pay back their external debt of US $ 8 Trillion let alone service this debt, and all countries borrows hard currencies especially US Dollars($) for their economy to function smoothly.\r<br>\r<br>If there is a No-Deal Brexit the World Trade Organisation(WTO) comes into force. The UK will then have to give a confidence and concession schedule whereby they list the amount of goods they are prepared to import per year. Then the rest of the members of WTO which about 164 countries will be given 3 months to object. But 20 countries which includes USA, Canada, Brazil, Russia, Australia, Argentina, and New Zealand within one hour will put their objections. Then they have to await for the WTO Adjudication for four years. In the meantime they will flood the UK\u2019s economy with cheap food and cars. This will destroy both the the UK\u2019s farming and car industry.\r<br>\r<br>Britain &#39;will run out of fish and chips&#39; under no deal Brexit\r.
