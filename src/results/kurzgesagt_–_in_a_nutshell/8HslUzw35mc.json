The odds ratio for the 26 good-quality studies was 1\u00b766 (1\u00b733, 2\u00b708), and that corrected for publication bias was 1\u00b778 (1\u00b703, 3\u00b710). Four studies on the effects of a single remedy on seasonal allergies had a pooled odds ratio for ocular symptoms at 4 weeks of 2\u00b703 (1\u00b751, 2\u00b774). Five studies on postoperative ileus had a pooled mean effect-size-difference of \u22120\u00b722 standard deviations (95% Cl \u22120\u00b736, \u22120\u00b709) for flatus, and \u22120\u00b718 SDs (\u22120\u00b733, \u22120\u00b703) for stool (both p&lt;0\u00b705).<br>Interpretation<br>The results of our meta-analysis are not compatible with the hypothesis that the clinical effects of homoeopathy are completely due to placebo. However, we found insufficient evidence from these studies that homoeopathy is clearly efficacious for any single clinical condition. Further research on homoeopathy is warranted provided it is rigorous and systematic.", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T11:36:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Impaler", "comment_text": "Homeopathy is nothing but quackery at it&#39;s highest level \ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T10:22:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "KUB M4S", "comment_text": "Homeopathy works effectively... for the farm companies", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T07:57:07Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "slackerdc", "comment_text": "I once over dosed on homeopathy.

Sure there is a placebo effect, SOMETIMES.   And sometimes, a simple remedy actually works.  AND has been KNOWN to work for many many generations.   <br><br>Example.   I recently discovered black elderberry juice is a natural anti viral.  What I&#39;ve read about it, stuff coats virus making it harder to get into a cell, and it coats cells also making it harder for a virus to get in.   One video said it&#39;s like hitting the virus with a paint ball gun pointing the way for your own immune system to attack it.   Asked a pharmasist about it and got back, &quot;well the FDA has not evaluated it, might make you think it&#39;s working but there is no science behind it.&quot;   Nevermind it&#39;s been in use FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS!   Figuring it can&#39;t hurt, I bought a bottle.  First sign of a cold or flu took some.   By morning I was fine.   Same for my husband.  Knocked out a coming cold again, overnight.    And not just once, I&#39;ve kept it on hand for several years now.  Gotta take it at the first sign of feeling sick.  So keeping it around is good. <br>When covid hit, he came home complaining he thinks he has walking pneumonia.  Smoked all his life, he&#39;s had this before.  He told me this AFTER we greeted, and then we both took a shot of elderberry juice.   He went to a doctor and the next thing I know, they put him in the covid ward after he tested pos.   Sent him home the very next day, they called me every day for weeks since I was &quot;exposed&quot; but I never got sick.  He got well from his pneumonia on his own.  (Michigan, ANY treatments were banned by or idiot gov.)  Hospital gave him NOTHING.   <br><br>So did the juice work?

As a student of Medicine, who has studied Organic Chemistry, while also actively being in Corporate World and having ties in the medical industry, I just wanted to mention a couple of things:<br><br>1. Water does remember what you put in it, as long as certain conditions are met. You made &#39;water remembering what you put in it&#39; sound like magic yet talked about horses having placebo effects as if its science, there is bias in that. Hydrogen bonding is very much real. Homeopaths dont just &#39;shake&#39; water rigorously like you made it out to be. You&#39;re amazing when you do your research so I urge you to look up concepts of enantionmers and diasteriomers. Orientation is huge when it comes to organic compounds.<br><br>2. &quot;We have proven with 100% certainty that homeopathic medicine has 0 effect&quot; is same as saying &quot;We have proven with 100% certainty that day by day each modern medicine&#39;s treatment is becoming more harmful and less successful.&quot; You look at treatment for even the simplest of issues and you&#39;ll see that modern medicine has 40-60 (and sometimes 49-51) ratio of help v. harm. I&#39;m not even talking big diseases like cancer but take even small tooth pain for example: who is to say that the remedy isn&#39;t more painful than the problem itself? Not to mention recurring. A patient cured is a customer lost.<br><br>3. Placebo Effect. You talked about placebo effect as science lol where it is all psychology with no equation to prove its validity. You&#39;re saying the human brain is so powerful that it can heal itself - this is science. But homeopathy, which has active ingredients, is not science. I mean I completely agree that human brain is so powerful that it can heal itself (I do meditate and know powers of meditation) but how does our confidence in a medicine translate to our dogs/horses getting better? Purely from our body language? That is 3rd party transfer of emotions and sure, if that works - I fail to see how <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HslUzw35mc&amp;t=1m10s\">1:10</a> or 1:100 potency doesn&#39;t work. Have there been studies to show 100% effect of placebo in 3rd party individuals?<br><br>4. You showed MRIs/biotech side of medicine but failed to grasp how modern medicine also has horrible chemicals where the side-effects are never ending. Its not a competition of homeopathic&#39;s fake cure v. medicine&#39;s perfect cure; the competition is between minor cure + no harm v. better cure + more harm.<br><br>I have friends/family in medicine (nurses, doctors, PAs) and doing PhDs in medicine, cancer and biochem......while I almost became a doctor; the one sidedness in this video is crazy...modern medicine isn&#39;t some golden bullet and homeopathy isn&#39;t 0 effect.

I couldn\u2019t except this as true I was only 19 which is to young to be told that unless I was gonna die or something. I decided to look into homeopathic medicine and I started changing my diet and stretching more and I changed the way I exercised. I ate foods that encouraged my body to digest better and stayed away from foods like cheese because they made me feel bad. I don\u2019t have IBS anymore all of the health problems I was having are completely gone. And I feel great! No sugar pill just a change in my life style. However I have noticed that when I start to eat unhealthy, and if I stop my exercise routine. after about a week I start to get some of the health problems I was having in the past. One bad meal or one missed day at the gym doesn\u2019t effect me. The consistency is when I notice the biggest effects.

They didn\u2019t feel seen, they didn\u2019t feel safe, and a lot of times black women\u2019s medical concerns about their pregnancies were dismissed, or even made into points of ridicule (yes, even to that point. For one example, a woman had a stillbirth, and was told that if she screamed from pain, she would not receive any painkillers. That\u2019s like, a whole other level of fucked up). And if you wanna get into stats, not just anecdotes, black women are twice as likely to die in childbirth compared to white women, even if they\u2019re the same economic class. Black babies were three times as likely to die, even when taking into account things like genetics or other things that are out of the infant\u2019s or their mothers\u2019 control. So yeah, black women were, and still are, more likely to go to licensed midwives (especially trained ones, a lot of midwives need licenses in nursing), because of those fears and risks of race based mistreatment.

I have been using Homeopathic remedies for over 50 years. (I also do believe that vaccines are effective and am fully vaccinated + booster). I agree that Homeopathy has become big business. This has not always been the case. I watched the transition take place as Boiron became a &quot;market player.&quot; In fact, there was no &quot;market&quot; before Boiron began packing the Homeopathy advisory panels with their members and strongly advocating for practices that benefited their brand. They also pushed the use of C potencies, which were not widely available to the general public before Boiron made them available. Boiron&#39;s aggressive tactics have influenced the demise of at least one very old and established company, and seem to have caused others to change their policies. So, I agree that Homeopathy has become big business and that the profits have driven many decision about the remedies. Second, I agree that using 30C+ remedies does not make sense. Until Bioron&#39;s marketing made it difficult to easily get lower potencies I never used a C dilution. I do not know how they work, and I cannot say I have ever seen definite results by taking one. I have many years experience using 6X dilutions and have seen their effectiveness in a number of instances. The most notable is the use of Arnica 6X for pre and post- surgery, and for burses. I believe that there are double blind clinical studies that support this use. If you mix these studies in with others you get an &quot;average no effect,&quot; which as Kurzgesagt knows well has no meaning. The question is not &quot;do all Homeopathic remedies work&quot; but &quot;do some homeopathic remedies work for specific conditions.&quot; The answer to the first question is almost certainly no.

Homeopathy with reiki is a perfect match because it looks for behaviors, fears and anxieties, more like psychologist than a doctor.

It really comes down to what we believe, in a sense. I&#39;ve even seen studies where the placebo effect was shown to occur even in patients who knew they were getting sugar pills. A person can know that in order to feel better, they need to believe in the placebo effect, and then bam, they improve. The thing is, not everyone believes. This is where I&#39;m gonna sound a little out there but I really do believe that not enough people believe in their own worth and their own power and they don&#39;t see that their power of belief can bring about their healing and wellness, even just by slowing their thoughts and calming their nervous system, which will in turn reduce inflammation and promote healing. So sometimes the first step of helping someone believe they can get better is the hardest step of all. And psychologically speaking, most people can&#39;t get themselves to believe on their own and they need a &quot;professional&quot; to tell them something will work. They WANT to spend $100 on a bottle of sugar pills because it comes with that endorsement from someone other than themselves. In general, we feel foolish if we try to believe something on our own. We feel deluded into thinking we&#39;re just making it up and imagining false possibilities, like a daydreamer, almost like we believe we don&#39;t deserve the healing unless we&#39;ve paid someone for it. But we need to realize that we don&#39;t need to spend hundreds just to consult with someone who tells us &quot;this will work, you will feel better&quot; when we could be working on ourselves internally to get to a point where we see our own power and worth and are able to conjur that belief on our own.

All such ingredients can be found in many drugs or products.

Any time you mix water with another hydrophilic substance you no longer just water in the substance. It\u2019s constantly moving every second.

When herbs are used for 100s of years which are documented and then are deemed not researched enough by today\u2019s standards seems a bit like an emotional ploy of big pharma. No homeopathic medicines don\u2019t solve everything but neither does your regular pill. It\u2019s just that it is a very good preventative option and I believe the placebo only is due to the fact companies don\u2019t pay for research and don\u2019t want it to be researched. You cannot patent many homeopathic remedies in reality. As well we live about the same amount of time as previous generations.

Just like the idiots from the church that decided that Galileo was wrong about his perception of the solar system, so too are we under the present day religious like belief that science finally knows everything about every thing.  Homeopathy is a complex art form, that as a practitioner, takes many years to learn.  It is a system applied correctly, that shores up the whole system, and is not for curing a specific disease.

They strictly say that don&#39;t consume alcohol and meat for few days, drink plenty of water.

It is used as encouragement so the patient will take their medicine on time. No different from how modern medicine doctor use it. <br><br><br>3) Both works. But as you can see potency of Homeopathy is very less so it takes time to cure whereas Allopathy&#39;s is much higher bcs of which it instantly works but also has side effects and so must be taken with caution.<br>Also both works and acts differently from eachother. <br><br>4)I have seen doctors from both field recommending eachother&#39;s medicine depending on the needs and requirements of the patient. <br><br>Take medicine that cures you not that you believe in.

Ik wist intu\u00eftief waarom homeopathie werkte - het is inderdaad een mentaal proces, dat je eigen lichaam aan het werk zet. Ik zwans niet als ik zeg dat covid-19 een waarschuwing aan de wereld is, niet dat we bang moeten zijn dat het een verkapte ebola is, wel dat we ons bewust moeten zijn dat we ons eigen immuunsysteem kapot aan het maken zijn en, omdat ik veel te laat besefte dat mijn lichaam dodelijk ziek was (ALS - en die is al in 1995 bij een routine onderzoek geconstateerd), maar alles bij mij tergend langzaam evolueert, ben ik gaan LUISTEREN naar wat mijn lichaam mij vertelde. We moeten overschakelen naar een pro-actieve geneeskunde, want niet alles is voor geld te koop en ook al gebruikt men het maar al te graag als verkoopargument, mensen zullen blijven ziek worden en dood gaan als de kosten de baten overstijgen. Omdat dit een geluk bij een ongeluk was, werk ik mijn bevindingen verder uit en dan kunnen de studenten erover discussi\u00ebren - mijn eigen generatie (ik ben 61 jaar oud) zit al vast in een denkpatroon, dat ons meer kwaad dan goed doet en dat mag ook wel eens gezegd worden. Baas over mijn eigen lijf - waarom VRAGEN we het de mensen niet op voorhand, voor we ze de bekende weg hebben opgestuurd, want eenmaal in een neerwaartse spiraal, dan zijn verliezen ook definitief. De INTEGRALE GENEESKUNDE houdt met alles rekening, het lichamelijke (acceptatie), mentale (niet accepteren) en het psychologische (de balans tussen acceptatie en niet accepteren) en zo krijgen we een stukje zelfbeschikking terug, dat we aan de intellectuele narcisten hadden gegeven in ruil voor een langer leven. Alles in mijn leven is gekeerd om mij duidelijk te maken dat ik niet dit ene lichaam ben of dit ene leven. Ik moest uit mijn comfortzone om mijn stem te durven gebruiken, want nu eens echt alles wat ik voorstelde werd met een slap handje van tafel geveegd. Het verwonderde mij zelfs dat ik pas nu van mijn lichaam kan houden, ik heb geen wagen gekregen, maar een tank en toch wordt het stilaan tijd om volledig voor een ander leven te gaan - Karen staat voor Welzijn en Educatie, Sophia voor de Creatieve Kunstenares ... dingen gebeuren omdat ze moeten gebeuren op het moment dat ze moeten gebeuren en je weet niet wat er achter gesloten deuren gebeurt als je alleen de fa\u00e7ade ziet, maar \u00e9\u00e9n ding is duidelijk, we zitten veel mooier in mekaar dan men ons doet geloven en ook al is de mens een sterfelijk wezen, het organisme (waarvan we allemaal autonome cellen zijn) is al een tijd onsterfelijk, dus moeten we bepaalde zaken gescheiden houden en oppassen dat we het niet gaan invullen voor anderen, want we dwingen hen vaak om iets te doen, wat we zelf het liefst op veilige afstand houden en dat is we heel hypocriet als je het mij vraagt!", "comment_date": "2021-10-29T06:36:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roy Harkov", "comment_text": "Homeopathic works by placebo.

It&#39;s disappointing to see this channel repeat the same old tropes against homeopathy. Yes, the theory doesn&#39;t make sense, but that could simply mean that our theory is not to an appropriate level as yet. <br><br>Argument against water having memory: the video explains that if water has memory, then it should have memory of everything and there should be an essence of everything in it from poop to salt and toxins etc. But the water we drink is not simply filtered and diluted. It&#39;s treated by quite a number of methods before pumped into our pipes. <br><br>Placebo: so many people have been suffering from all kinds of chronic ailments, going to all kinds of doctors. Yet placebo never helped them then. Yet when they go to a homeopath and their ailment happens to get cured, then suddenly placebo kicked in only then? <br><br>Nice homeopathic doctors: There&#39;s plenty of really good doctors even of conventional medicine throughout the world especially in private practice. Yet these good feelings didn&#39;t cure certain ailments. What is so great about a homeopathic doctor that the placebo he imparts is practically miraculous healing? <br><br>It doesn&#39;t cure cancer: That&#39;s an unfair comparison. Homeopathy does not claim to cure cancer. Paracetamol doesn&#39;t cure cancer either, yet it&#39;s not invalidated based on that. Most conventional medicine doesn&#39;t cure cancer. A medication must be judged against what it is claimed to cure, nothing more. <br><br>Anti vaxxers and anti conventional medicine: False equivalency. I&#39;ve never met a homeopath who discourages vaccination or any conventional medicine for that matter. At most, I&#39;ve met homeopaths who discourage use of anti-biotics for silly things like influenza, which is what most modern doctors discourage as well. <br><br>Big pharma: That&#39;s blown way out of proportion, and encouraging selective skepticism. Every industry has lobby groups. <br><br>Homeopathy persists because it works for certain ailments. There&#39;s no way it would persist for so long and at such a large presence if there was no bottom line of it working for many patients. There&#39;s numerous other alternative medicines that really are on the fringes, but homeopathy still persists in large presence. There&#39;s even lots of GP&#39;s who recommend it for certain things.

Making the educational environment hyper competitive and stressful is one way to weed out people at the college level. Increasingly difficult/competitive entrance exams are another way of selecting people out of the system. A friend of mine recently passed the bar and it was one of the worst and most traumatic experiences ever even though he passed. The system is literally designed to pummel you and beat you senseless until you don&#39;t know which way is up. The end result? Those who made it through have higher wages and more job security. However, no one talks about the fact that to make these environments so selective and hyper competitive requires money which makes training a neurosurgeon, for example. extremely expensive. This, in turn, increases medical costs (or legal costs) not to mention the fact that you end up with fewer doctors in the workforce.

I am a part of a community that participates in native American and South American ceremonies where we injest peyote, ayahuasca and other entheogens. The healing that people experience from these is astonishing at times. I forget the exact issue this older woman had, but it had persisted for years. I sciatica issue? I can&#39;t remember, apologies, but after an ayahuasca ceremony her condition improved significantly over the course of weeks that it had not during her years of standard medical treatment. Her doctor even wrote a letter commenting on how significant her improvement was and shared it around his peers. The placebo affect is real. That has been proven. Studies have been done that show a positive attitude and belief can lead to rapid healing. This is going to sound totally bogus, but absolute faith in something makes it &quot;real&quot;. Our minds are so powerful. We can create or eradicate conditions just on belief. People who have had traumatic experiences can develop psychosomatic conditions. Such as someone who has never had a leg injury in their life can suddenly become crippled because of a strong belief. They create an actual pain response in their body even though no actual physical damage has been done and then if they believe or realize it was in their head they can walk again. My grandma thinks herself sick all the time. Modern medicine often treats symptoms, not the cause or origin. When done in the proper setting Psychedelics open up our minds to healing. The shift in perspective is so radical that we can start regenerating our minds and bodies by belief. Like I said, it sounds bogus, but I have seen it personally many times and now too have some medical professionals. As I said though doing these in a proper ceremony space with guidance makes all the difference. You can abuse any &quot;medicine&quot;. I feel the goal of medicine should be to remove the need for it. &quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&quot; I try to stay away from conspiracies, but the US is a capitalist country. Of course the pharmaceutical industry wants to make money. Treating symptoms instead of causes is a great way to do that. These ceremonies are about connecting with the strength inside you, your higher self, God, source, the universe at large, whatever you choose to call it, to promote your own healing. I &quot;beileve&quot; (haha) that we have everything within us already to he healthy and happy. Often times the cure to many medical issues is to eat healthy and exercise. We are constantly consumming things that negatively impact us: media, junk food, sexual partners, gambling, intoxicants. If we would spend a little more time in nature, eating healthy and taking care of our minds and bodies we would find we needed less and less medical treatment. Kinda seems obvious, huh? Anyway! I just wanted to share my thoughts. I&#39;m not encouraging anyone to eat an entheogen or to disregard medical science, just to know that you are a beautiful miracle who is capable of more than any of us truly realize yet.

Just because official alopathic medicine can&#39;t explain and prove the efficacy of homeopathy, which apparently helps people who have been unable to help official medicine, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a placebo. Homeopathic treatments are not cheap, but homeopathic drugs are relatively cheap and available, and are much safer than alopathic drugs, which have many side effects and can&#39;t heal much, but maintain the existing condition by alleviating symptoms. Homeopathy works more according to the principles of quantum physics and encourages the body through immunity to self-healing. These are complicated mechanisms, which cannot be proven by some comparative studies, blind and randomized, because each patient is a special story. Patients with the same symptoms will receive two different medications because they are treated individually, holisticly. The therapy is not determined by diagnosis but by symptoms, which are different in each patient.<br>The efficacy of mass vaccination has never been proven, but it is carried out and has survived for so many years. Despite much evidence of harm. Mass studies have never been done. In Switzerland, where people are not vaccinated against measles, there has never been an epidemic. People are misled by the medical community and others who do, but many people don&#39;t question it because that&#39;s what the profession says.

So if a wholistic practitioner ignorant to this fact recommends a herb or food to two separate people who suffer from the same affliction one person may use said plant or herb as recommended that while natural isn&#39;t in agreement which their predisposed genetics so their symptoms may get worse or they may gain another aliment and say homeopathy doesn&#39;t work while the other one who is predisposed to that plant may have their symptoms cured and/or experience and boost in the vigor and swear homeopathy works. I&#39;m just a guy but for those interested in natural remedies I strongly encourage taking your genetic roots into account when searching for remedies. Side note: please be aware that just because a herb or plant grows in your genetic region doesn&#39;t mean it naturally occurred there and could&#39;ve been brought there by explorers, nomads, settlers, colonizers, etc so it may have a negative impact on you despite being listed as naturally occurring I encounter this multiple times when looking into native african foods and herbs. For example I was born in Amerika (the K was deliberate to recognize this system was built on top of a already existing civilization but doesn&#39;t practice its traditions or recognize their native knowledge thus creating a different America) but my genetic roots are in Africa and before I took this into account was eating things like potatoes, white rice, organic sugar, red meat, eggs etc and had lower energy and I&#39;d wake up tired even though I went back to sleep and often had this kind of mental fog that made it difficult to think but in me cutting out those things and tapping more into dietary knowledge centered around African health the effects took place within a few days I notice when I woke up instead of that tired feeling that had me sleep until past noon I was actually up and energized as well as I no longer have mucus build up anymore (legit like none so far just smooth inhale/exhale) and what I find most interesting is not only is it easier to think but my mental attitude is consistently calm when put in situations that would make me react before I actually couldn&#39;t care less about now I can actually sit back and see the bigger picture rather than just react to the most prominent detail. There are other factors when comes to health like water and air quality and things like that but I can say taking my health into my own hands has been very beneficial to me and a lot of the aliments I thoughts were just facts of life haven&#39;t bothered my sense so i do recommend this to others and would even dare to say that if this method isn&#39;t working out for you then you&#39;re probably doing it wrong or have had you&#39;re immune system devastated by the medical industry but that&#39;s a whole other topic that most would rather say I&#39;m wrong than learn if what they&#39;re told is right.", "comment_date": "2021-05-27T03:01:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0410\u043b\u0451\u0445\u0438\u043d", "comment_text": "\u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0441\u0446\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435.<br> \u041d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e \u0441 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0438: \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u043b\u0430, \u0438\u0437\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0431\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043c\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0411\u043e\u0433.", "comment_date": "2021-05-27T02:32:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Link", "comment_text": "I cured myself by licking RAM memory sticks containing pictures of the disease!

He told me to take one pill after every meal with, suck on it for a while and then drink warm tea. Also gurgle with salt water twice a day. It went away within 3 days. Crazy, right? The next time I had a laryngitis I did the same and it went away pretty quickly. The third time I had one I didn&#39;t buy those pills because they&#39;re pretty pricy. I bought some caugh candy instead, did the same and gurgled with salt water. Went away pretty quickly again. I saw my doctor again to tell him that since I get a laryingitis pretty often if I should be worried. He sent me to a otolaryngologist and asked if I wanted more of those pills and I refused politely. Then he surprised me with &quot;Yeah, they don&#39;t work anyway. It was better than giving you antibiotics, though.&quot; <br><br>I didn&#39;t ask why he recommended me those homeopathic pills, but I wish I did. It was such weird decision and I&#39;m kind of mad he made me waste my money on a placebo - like 20 \u20ac for 18 sugar pills. I can only assume he did it because he thought I was expecting antibiotics which I wasn&#39;t. That first laryngitis was just really bad and wouldn&#39;t go away, so I was kind of scared. However I can confirm those pills were just a placebo and warm tea and salt water are all I need for a laryngitis. The otolaryngologist didn&#39;t find anything, not even allergies.

Do you know what homeopathy is? Homeopathy claims to cure by diluting certain substances so much that the active substance is no longer present at all.<br>The most common dilution they use is D60, that is, such a dilution is as great as one molecule of active substance in 20 trillion times the contents of all the oceans.<br>This is dilution 10^-60<br>At dilution 10^-80 there is 1 molecule of the active ingredient to all matter in the universe,<br>And to take the antifreeze drug Oscillococcinum, this is a dilution of 10-400 of duck liver and duck heart. <br>So a dilution of one molecule in 10 ^320 universes, a 10 with 320 zeros times the universe. Do you really think this is effective?<br><br>Let&#39;s do a thought experiment,<br>We&#39;re gonna make the assumption that water actually has the magical memory property. And we&#39;re going to make Oscillococcinum.<br>We slaughter a duck and take some of its heart and liver and leave it for 40 days. We filter and freeze-dry that, and we&#39;re going to dilute it. We take some water, add it to it, shake, take a little of the solution and dilute it further with water. This we repeat until we have the unimaginable dilution of 10^-400<br>Now I wonder, how do you know what you have diluted? The duck&#39;s liver? Yes, but what about the contaminants in the water? You have a place where you are pouring and diluting, the air is full of dust, bacteria, viruses, fungi and even algae spores.<br>Even in the most modern chip factories, they are only able to remove everything from the air to a certain degree. What about water? How do you know that your water does not contain other trace elements? Or has it? Water is almost as old as the universe, so it has had quite a few bedfellows in its existence.<br>And the bottles you are diluting it in?<br>They all bring traces, albeit small ones.<br>That the duck&#39;s liver is an active element in flu medication is therefore unlikely, not only because of the dilution, but also because it is virtually impossible to know what else has been infinitely diluted.<br>And then you&#39;ve done your best to keep your preparation pure within certain limits and then you put the solution on sugar, sugar is hygroscopic and draws moisture from the air. Does that moisture also have a memory and what does it contain? Your Oscillococcinum goes into plastic tubes.<br><br><br>That package breathes in and out with changes in air pressure, yes that is little, but more than 10^-400<br>People open it and take 2 on their moist hand (sweat) in which again all kinds of things are infinitely diluted and take it in their mouth, that saliva and your body fluids also contain all kinds of infinite dilutions<br><br><br>I also find it amazing that people place more value on unsubstantiated promises than on objectivity and reason. That if you make the case for objectivity and reason you are attacked for that, without being able to present arguments, and that people think they have a good story with homeopathy, but if you point out serious inconsistencies in that story they so easily step over it.<br><br>The story makes no sense, it is impossible to point out the active substance as the active substance because you always dilute many more things infinitely.<br>2. Because the dilutions are infinite, you can never objectively do quality control. You would have to test your production method, whether you actually reset the memory during the preparation, so make it with and without resetting, shake it 10 times or shake it 100 times and see if that has any effect. I mean, how do you do quality control in a factory of homeopathic remedies. How do you determine if the dilution is really 10^-400, or 10^-500 or 10^-50?<br>None of that can be measured because there is not one molecule of the active ingredient in it. <br><br>This should give even a supporter of homeopathy some question marks, but it doesn&#39;t, why not?", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T15:42:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Line", "comment_text": "Fuck homeopathy.

Naturally any doctor I speak to about fatigue diagnoses me as depressed the moment they learn about that. So, in order to pursue any &quot;other options&quot; I had to first try antidepressants for 3-12 months. I had to &quot;prove myself&quot; to each and every doctor. Oh, and If I moved and had to talk to a new doctor? <br><br>Shit, I had to restart the whole fckin process over again. Despite modern medicine being modern medicine; my only affordable path was &quot;Take these pills for depression everyday for a year or two and we can look at other options if that doesn&#39;t work&quot;.<br><br>Combined with moving every couple years... I found myself in a scenario where I was having the same conversations with different doctors. Always getting processed and not listened too. After all, I am the patient, I don&#39;t know shit. Every doctor needed me to prove to them that taking antidepressants didn&#39;t fix the issue. Repeat it. Try again. Repeat it. <br><br>Then homeopathy comes in. Talks to me.

Hospitals want to hire as few people as possible and have them be as efficient as possible to make as much money as possible. Consults and visits do not generate nearly as much revenue as procedures, treatments and tests.

The sources of the documentary say it all: they only quote Internet pages of a German lobby called &quot;Gesellschaft zur wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung von Parawissenschaften&quot; or &quot;Information Network Homeopath&quot;. Here in this commentary I will only stop at the few documents from reputable sites and skip the blog pamphlets. <br><br>1. In the video, classical homeopathy is mentioned, however in the desription cheatingly puts a meta-analysis published in 2017 by Mathie et al that does not evaluate classical homeopathy, but non-individualized homeopathy. The meta-analysis published in 2014 by the same author on individualized homeopathy is ignored:<br><br>&quot;Medicines prescribed in individualised homeopathy may have small, specific treatment effects. Findings are consistent with sub-group data available in a previous \u2018global\u2019 systematic review. The low or unclear overall quality of the evidence prompts caution in interpreting the findings. New high-quality RCT research is necessary to enable more decisive interpretation&quot; (2014).<br><br>Someone might criticize the conclusion on the grounds that it mentions that the trials were of low quality, but this refers to the evidence in general (both positive and negative). Even with this limitation, the meta-analysis was able to show that the set of higher quality trials with lower risk of bias demonstrated a robust and consistent effect greater than the placebo. <br><br>2. Kurzgesagt team cite as support the review published in 2015 by the Australian government, but ignore that in 2019 the director of the NHRMC was forced to acknowledge that: &quot;Contrary to some claims, the review did not conclude that homeopathy was ineffective&quot; (Source: Second Report released). The correct interpretation of the second report that the evidence was not &quot;sufficient&quot;, this statement is very different from the one spread by the media saying that the report &quot;had shown that homeopathy is placebo&quot;. This report was included in a systematic megareview, along with all global meta-analyses, and did not affect the outcome. The authors concluded: <br><br>&quot;In conclusion, evidence for the effectiveness of human and veterinary homeopathy in general, and in particular, of homeopathic treatment for infections, is available. Especially, individualized homeopathy demonstrates effects at all quality levels according to Cochrane criteria, even in the methodologically high-quality studies. As in most areas of veterinary medicine and medicine, further good/excellent studies are necessary&quot; (2020).<br><br>3. The EASAC report is cited as support. It should be recalled that this report was not peer-reviewed and, suspiciously obviously cites the Mathie (2014) meta-analysis. At the time, Peter Fisher showed that the report had no scientific basis, but mere cherry picking:<br><br>&quot;The EASAC statement \u2018cherry picks\u2019 the evidence, systematically selecting negative publications and citing almost exclusively hostile commentary and opinion pieces. To take a few examples: in 2007 Homeopathy published a special issue on \u2018Memory of Water\u2019: this included 13 scientific papers.2 Of these, the EASAC statement references the only one which took a sceptical view. In claiming that there is no evidence beyond placebo the statement ignores the 43 published systematic reviews of homeopathy as a whole, individualized, or for specific conditions or groups of conditions. Of these 21 were clearly or tentatively positive and 9 inconclusive.3 It discusses only the Shang meta-analysis, ignoring the fact that it failed to meet elementary standards of quality and transparency.4 It did not reference the publications on which it was based; on the contrary all clues to their identity were removed. In another fundamental flaw the data were \u2018dredged\u2019: during the review process the inclusion criteria for study inclusion were changed from \u2018high quality\u2019 to \u2018larger high quality\u2019. It has since been shown that, had the goalposts not been moved and the meta-analysis conducted as originally intended, the result would have been positive.5 Its negative result was almost entirely due to a single large trial on prevention of muscle soreness in long-distance runners.&quot; (2017). <br><br>4. Finally, an article written by David Robert Grimmes and published in the Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies is cited. This article is not an experiment, but merely an essay attempting to demonstrate that it is &quot;physically impossible&quot; for homeopathy to work. The author starts from a faulty premise and selectively cites evidence that suits him. The article was published in 2012, it is quite widely outdated. The latest systematic review of the evidence to debunk the David Grimmes&#39; nonsense was recently published. The review showed that there is evidence of high methodological quality that has been reproduced:  <br><br>&quot;To conclude, the most promising techniques used so far are NMR relaxation, optical spectroscopy, and electrical impedance measurements. In these three areas, several sets of replicated high-quality experiments provide evidence for specific physicochemical properties of homeopathic preparations (2019).&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-04-08T07:14:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Owen Toad", "comment_text": "Yunno, they probably dilute it because \u201clike cures like\u201d is the dumbest thing I have ever heard in my life.", "comment_date": "2021-04-07T02:13:24Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tommy Vercetti", "comment_text": "Yeah, I was at the public hospital and they kinda rushed me when I had a stomach ache because there had been a multiple car crash or some shit like that so now I reject modern medicine and instead drink sugared water to cure my tuberculosis.", "comment_date": "2021-04-06T23:40:01Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "doors", "comment_text": "That clock is legendary", "comment_date": "2021-04-06T15:21:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Light Fall On The Head", "comment_text": "best alternative medicine is actual medicine, cause if something is proven to work as medicine is most likely used as a medicine", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T14:21:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pyq Shawn", "comment_text": "<b>Placebo effect.</b><br><br><b>i can beat cancer.</b><br><b>I BEAT CANCER!!!!!!!!!</b>", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T11:32:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sim Star", "comment_text": "Jan 11 2021<br><br>Earlier today, the Professional Standards Authority (PSA) announced\u00a0it had suspended the accreditation of the Society of Homeopaths (SoH).

TADA there you have it folks. btw the excretion or removal rate of the alkaloid toxins as proven by a brilliant scientist is 2% per day. taking an entire 45-90 days to detoxify the blood and the fat cells (etc). my research found that you can (quite homeopathically) drink intense amounts of water causing the blood stream to flush poisons or toxins out of your body at twice the rate. be sure not to take on more water then your abdominal aorta can store, or as much as your kindeys and liver can pump out your bladder in one go. i am lacking one kidney and so i can only drink and urinate for about ten seconds. i can safely assume you can gulp 20 gulps of water and be fine with a normal human physiology.<br><br>and one more thing. i use wormwood to cure diabetes regularly and can safely enjoy buckets of ice cream and 1 and a half pizzas any day of the week i choose(horrbile tasting tincture tho xD). however if your non diabetic or have preference to it i recommend honey, as its crystals decimate bacteria and parasites (NOT FOR THE YOUNG WHO HAVE NO NATURAL BACTERIA ESTABLISHED YET and must receive it from mothers milk).<br><br>why would i mention that last statement btw? because for further reading about wormwood, poultice and milkl and honey. you should probably read the largest fact book known to man and hu-man, the basic instructions before leaving earth.

I agree you have to take meds to solve your cold, but you have to remember that our bodies aren&#39;t things like machines which you can just input some pills and say &quot;yay, it&#39;s cured&quot;. And I&#39;m saying it because I don&#39;t want people to go to extremes and think you should banish alternative therapies that have some prospects on helping or relieving people&#39;s daily suffering- I repeat, it DOES NOT CURE YOU, but it at least helps you to get by in life, and, sometimes, that&#39;s all you need to definitely recover from it, rather than solve it one time and have to repeatedly return to the hospital, cause you&#39;re too stressed.<br><br>In cases like autoimmune diseases, managing your emotional side is the best you can do to cope with the flares AND the amazing side effects of the meds you take. It&#39;s a personal experience, and really, I almost fell into depression if it wasn&#39;t by homeopathy. Placebo effect is all about faith. And it&#39;s not religious faith, it&#39;s faith in a sense of getting yourself straight and believing in your own recovery.<br><br>So, my message here is: please, do not admonish it too much. Our so godly adored science isn&#39;t omnipotent, and although I love it (to the point I got into college to major in Biology) I won&#39;t stop someone to do whatever they need to obtain a healthy life. Though, I will scold someone if they are being too impetuous  about something (like, consuming miraculous recipes instead of going to the doctor? That&#39;s a big no). My policy is, do something safe first. Go to the hospital. If it isn&#39;t solving, if you are in your dead end, if there are no more alternatives, if you&#39;re suffering from it, then you should go look for alternative therapies, complementary or not.<br><br>The world isn&#39;t all about scientific proved facts, as much as it isn&#39;t all about secret magical energy vibes.

They are biochemically inert, and have no effect on any known disease.[8][15][16] Hahnemann&#39;s theory of disease, centered around principles he termed miasms, is inconsistent with subsequent identification of viruses and bacteria as causes of disease. Clinical trials have been conducted, and generally demonstrated no objective effect from homeopathic preparations.[17][18][19]:206[20] The fundamental implausibility of homeopathy as well as a lack of demonstrable effectiveness has led to it being characterized within the scientific and medical communities as quackery and nonsense.[3][21][22]<br><br>After assessments of homeopathy, national and international bodies have recommended the withdrawal of government funding. Australia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France,[23] as well as the European Academies&#39; Science Advisory Council, and the Commission on Pseudoscience and Research Fraud of Russian Academy of Sciences each concluded that homeopathy is ineffective, and recommended against the practice receiving any further funding.[24][25][26][27] Notably, France and England, where homeopathy was formerly prevalent, are in the process of removing all public funding. The National Health Service in England ceased funding homeopathic remedies in November 2017[28][29] and asked the Department of Health in the UK to add homeopathic remedies to the blacklist of forbidden prescription items,[30] and France will remove funding by 2021.[31] In November 2018, Spain also announced moves to ban homeopathy and other pseudotherapies.[32]", "comment_date": "2020-09-10T12:54:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Harpreet Singh Dhandwar", "comment_text": "My younger brother has asthma since childhood and after taking a  year homeopathy median everything gone. same happen with me I had asthma started 4 years ago and after 2 years I took Homeopathy for  year now my heath is very good.

As always, critics boil it down to: Its too diluted therefore it cant work. I urge anyone who wants to escape chemical medicine, to trust their own experience, not what some ill-informed talking head says. But I will address the points.  <br><br>KV&#39;s first simplistic point is that a substance like Belladonna which causes fever will cure a fever.  That is allopathic (conventional) medical thinking; match the drug to a few symptoms. Homeopathy is matching on the unique constellation of symptoms - mental, emotional and physical - that an individual is experiencing. Only if a remedy&#39;s symptoms match the individual&#39;s symptoms well, on all levels will it be effective. <br><br>Immediately KV jumps to Potentization, the process of dilution that is used to create remedies. Dr Hahnemann practiced long before he started diluting the remedies and he had cures with homeopathic (similar) medicines.  Dilution is not necessary but makes the remedies more effective without the toxicity that accompanies all medicines.  The dilution process is performed with distilled water and purified alcohol, not toilet water and ocean water!  <br><br>Anyone skeptical of the effectiveness of extremely dilute remedies can perform a homeopathic proving which is the scientific foundation of homeopathy. Volunteers take an unknown remedy repeatedly over several days and the new never-before experienced symptoms - mental, emotional and physical - are carefully recorded. These are the  constellation of symptoms that this remedy will cure in a sick person. After the volunteers stop taking the remedy the new symptoms eventually wear off, leaving them as before.  This is a repeatable experiment that anyone can try to experience remedies&#39; power for themselves. <br><br>Homeopathy has been successful not just in comparison to the lethality of 1800&#39;s medicine but also compared to modern conventional medicine.  Homeopathy has 220+ years of well documented cures around the world with millions of doctors and patients, of even chronic diseases considered incurable by conventional medicine. Anyone doubtful can sit in on the clinics held by doctors and homeopathic medical schools and see the wide range of humanity cured of everything from hangnail to, yes, even cancer. <br><br>Hahnemann did impose very strict limitations on what his patients consumed and did, under his treatment. And present day homeopaths do discuss the same issues with their patients. But they have found that it is not necessary to be so strict.  We can even work with patients who are taking allopathic drugs, and see results that the drugs cant account for. <br><br>Our modern healthier lives are Not primarily due to modern medicine&#39;s diagnostics, double blind studies and scientific evaluations.  Read what Dr Ioannidis, Dr Horton (Lancet) and Dr Angell (New Eng Journ of Med) have written about the abysmal current state of medical science research, perhaps 50% of which is untrue!  We live healthier because of cleaner air, water and better food - better lifestyles. And those gains are now being reversed by chemical ag and junk food.<br><br>There are lots of studies that show that homeopathy works better than Placebo. Conventional &quot;Scientists&quot; look at all those studies and say &quot;that\u2019s bad science&quot; and ignore them. Homeopaths look at the studies that supposedly show it doesn\u2019t work and say &quot;that\u2019s bad homeopathy&quot;. The two sides are never going to agree in this arena. That is why I urge the readers to experience it for themselves. <br><br>Organic farmers and ranchers use homeopathy on their plants and herd animals. I don\u2019t think you can seriously make the case that this is transferred placebo effect. Farmers have to make a living and don\u2019t risk it on something sketchy. Ranchers don\u2019t have time to tuck their herd in bed at night. <br><br>The argument that it is only time that is working to the advantage of homeopathy is specious. The definition of a chronic illness is an illness that doesn\u2019t spontaneously recover - its chronic! Yet homeopathy has a long well-documented history of cures of serious and incurable chronic illness, and rapid cures of serious acute illnesses.  For example during the Spanish Flu 1918-20, homeopaths documented a 1.05% mortality rate out of 26,000+ cases while conventional docs had a 10-30% mortality rate. <br><br>As for homeopathy being &quot;Big Pharma&quot;!  It\u2019s the size of a pimple on the ugly monster of truly &quot;Big Pharma&quot;. <br><br>Homeopathy is bad for public health!? The USA has the most expensive medicine with the worst outcomes in the industrialized world largely because there is no serious competition for allopathic medicine. A robust competition from other forms of medicine such as homeopathy, herbalogy and naturopathy would be nothing but good for the public&#39;s health.", "comment_date": "2020-08-31T19:09:26Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Abelhawk", "comment_text": "Man, Kurzgesagt for president.

Another example is how my 5 yr old son gets cured of fever, cold, stomach upsetness, diarrhea, etc. Instead, it won&#39;t work with me. I had to use allopathic medicines to get ok. I think the real reason is one of the unsolved mysteries. So it&#39;s better to stop blaming each other over this.

Just 2 years after my polyps came back with full force and my condition was worse than before. I met the same doctor and he said I can&#39;t undergo further surgery as removal of more nasal linings will lead to cancer and other complications. He just prescribed me fluticosteroids and antibiotics which did no good. Finally I researched homeopathy once again. This time I did my own research using materia medica and after months of research shortlisted 3 homeopathic medicines for my nasal polyps - Teucrium MV, Lemna minor and Sanguinaria. I took 30c potency of LM &amp;  SC but took CM potency of TMV. Just 4 days into homeopathy repeat just 4 days I regained my lost sense of smell after like for first time in 3 years! After a week my polyps shrank so much that it wasn&#39;t visible with a torch (my polyps were visible by just looking into my nose it was horrible). Just last month I did a CT scan and my allopathic doctor was surprised at the results. I didn&#39;t tell him anything of my homeopathic treatments. Now I&#39;m so relieved after 3 yrs that I could find my cure in homeopathy which the steroids couldn&#39;t help.

Protons spin as 3 quarks which is 9 points of light. The same goes for neutrons. Electrons spin as 1 point of light.  This means we are eternal energy and light or holograms constantly being created by our literal souls. These souls are breathing us, pulsating us and spinning us into constant creation. Their constant focus on creating us is what spins and vibrates those waves of energy and light at the core of this existence.

As a much cheaper affordable alternative medicine it has been a first line of defense for many, in my family itself people recovered from chronic ailments through homeopathy where allopathy not only failed but had worsened the patient. The Film says homeopathy works because of placebo, I wonder why are the rates of placebos so much higher with homeopathy. it cannot be just explained by a superior doctor patient relationship. A severe eczema on my neck for which I had gobbled so many allopathic medicines and applied hundreds of creams given to me by my Doctor friend, I had full faith in him was unable to cure it. It was cured by a homeopathic doctor in just 3 months. Placebo should have been the same in both the cases.<br> If anybody who has been to a homeopathic doctor or knows even a little about homeopathy would know that it will never we able to pass the double blind test as treatment differs from person to person  who may seemingly be having the same symptoms.<br>Sadly homeopathy now days has began imitating Allopathy and Doctors with little knowledge are trying to treat patients in a similar way, apparently there are apps and software that decide what medicine to be given. Now days there are few homeopathic doctors who really understand how to treat, homeopathy requires far more understanding and experience in how to treat, it is a different kind of science. <br> Allopathic system has made an extremely important contributions to mankind but has also overshadowed alternative systems like Ayurved and Yunani that may more safer and effective for certain diseases.

Tried EVERY eye drop suggested by the Doctors, but all in vain.<br>Left with no options, I switched to Homeopathy and in 1 month, there&#39;s 99% relief. Now I just feel a bit uneasiness in eyes when I wake up in the morning, but it stays for only a minute or so.<br>Many of my family members are doctors in various specialities, and a close friend is also an assistant to a renowned Eye Specialist of the country, but everyone had only one solution of my problem: Eye drops. From 2 drops twice a day, it went to 2 drops in every 1 hour, and being a student it had started to affect my studies too.<br><br>What I&#39;ve realised is Homeopathy is all about the experience of the practitioner. I&#39;m an Indian and here in my city, there are many Homeopathy doctors who, in the name of social service, provide homeopathic treatment at less than $1 price. At the same time, there are many who don&#39;t leave a single chance to suck every penny you have. And I feel, Western world is full of such scammers, there&#39;s dearth of real homeopathic doctors. Even if they are genuine, they would be heck expensive.<br>For me, luckily I got a genuine doctor, who had recently graduated but had a lot of knowledge. After 2 trials of different medicines, he managed to get the perfect match as per my body composition. My treatment costs me less than $3 a month, which is even lesser than the cost of most of eye drops out there. I couldn&#39;t ask for more! Really grateful to the doctor. \ud83d\ude4f<br><br>In case of serious illness, it might take several rounds of trial and error to reach the single most suitable medicine. It&#39;s during this process, people start feeling that homeopathy is a waste, and only during this time you&#39;ll feel like doctors are just looting you (which they might). I&#39;ve been to homeopathy doctors with over 20 years experience and their fees were really high, they mainly charged for their experience and goodwill. Otherwise, even a recent graduate doctor can suggest you the same medicine, which doesn&#39;t cost much, at least here in India these homeopathic medicines are cheaper than allopathic medicines. <br>There are many medicines in homeopathy that work instantly. Recently my doc suggested me a medicine for my severe cold, and in just 1 day, I felt relief in the symptoms. I could have a sound sleep after 2 days.<br><br>If science has not been able comprehend the working of Homeopathic medicines yet, that doesn&#39;t mean the medicines are ineffective, or Homeopathy is a placebo.<br>It&#39;s not only with Homeopathy, science is yet to fathom Ayurveda, Acupressure, Reiki. I&#39;ve first hand positive experience with all these alternative medical approaches. These treatments mainly depend on the practitioner, and it&#39;s a really tough task to find a genuine one, even tougher if you&#39;re from Western Side of the globe.<br><br>Thanks for your time. <br><br>\u262e\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-04-06T08:36:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crux161", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HslUzw35mc&amp;t=5m39s\">5:39</a> <b>Don\u2019t hug me I\u2019m scared...</b>", "comment_date": "2020-04-06T07:59:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I Love My Everything", "comment_text": "Such a shitty video, just wasted 8.31 minutes of mine, just to hear some biased idea about Homoeopathy<br>And for the record Homoeopathy is NOT a pseudoscience \ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2020-04-05T21:22:36Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "I Love My Everything", "comment_text": "Dude, what the hell...

Painkillers were not working along with other analgesics...on the bed, unable to move her  head, even to the side, for the entire night.

After 4 months I clearly feel the result, continued for another year everyday it gets better and better. Now I totally get rid of that. Now I realised it&#39;s nothing but sugar and water but then I don&#39;t. I call it completely placebo effect.

People who are unhappy and stressed out get sick a lot more than people who are happy and relaxed. Similarly people who are depressed has less chance of surviving something potentially deadly than someone who really likes being alive. There is a lot modern medicine still doesn&#39;t understand very well. Because it often treat patience&#39;s like cattle, and especially in the US where the healthcare system is privatized, it can actually cause so much stress that it makes people sicker much like barbaric practices like blood letting. No wonder homeopathy is so big in the states, doing nothing is better than doing damage after all. Treating just the body while ignoring the mental and spiritual health of the person just puts a bigger strain on the industry as it ends up making people sicker in the long run. So even though spiritual practices might not do anything physical they&#39;re still far more effective at getting people into a state where they&#39;re more capable of healing themselves. Trough their sense of well being their immune system improves and they&#39;re more inclined to do things that would generally be good for them like exercise and quit smoking or whatever. Science is good at manipulating the physical world, but it sucks at motivating people,. giving them purpose, cultivating self love, and so on. So I really wish people stopped treating science as the end all be all religion of the modern world. Soft science is not science and it never will be, the more people try to put these things into the box of science so it will fit with their faith the more it harms these things. Areas such as psychology and politics and sociology are clearly not gaining anything by pretending they&#39;re science as they where better before we tried to sufficiency them. Soft science is a lot like a church trying to be scientific, it&#39;s a joke. Trying to fit everything into a science perspective is religious nonsense that worships materialism and ignores half the human experience in order to force a square peg into a round hole.", "comment_date": "2020-03-03T08:44:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lan Dewell", "comment_text": "Me: Mom, I need medicine because I have fever.

She also spent probably the last of her money on &quot;CBD oil&quot; claiming that she would &quot;get over&quot; the cancer that way.

It&#39;s a non invasive way of self healing which most of you Smarties will laugh at or frown upon,  but those who have experienced these know the miraculous effects it can have. Yes there are many things homeopathy cant treat and you have to approach allopaths for that. But for smaller things like body aches, a non invasive medicine would be a lot healthier than shoving down painkillers that suppress your nervous system. Also, i have experienced that a long term allopathic treatment for my long term sinusitis did nothing but suppress the problem which now has resulted in severe headaches and inability to breathe. On the other hand homeopathic treatment of about a month cleared my sinuses. It is a placebo effect doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t treat your disease........in fact it acts on the roots of the disease. And anyway, at the end of the day I want to see the results and as a patient i wouldn&#39;t care whether it&#39;s a painkiller that stopped my bodyache or a medicine with a placebo effect lol. By the way, there are also Homeopaths who let the patients know when the problem cannot be treated by homeopathy, which is why I like the Homeopaths more than allopaths. I rest my case here.

Anyone who has ever seen the magic of Arnica for swelling after trauma, or Chamomilia for teething of a baby not susceptible to placebo will have a quick conversion. The ocean analogy is absurd. The process of trituration is very sophisticated. Homeopathy is still used by the Royal Family in England and many of the wealthiest people because they know it works. Moreover, homeopathy got its fame during cholera and whooping cough epidemics because the mortality rates we&#39;re so much lower among patients using homeopathy. Having said all that, two problems plague homeopathy: the first is that it&#39;s very difficult to learn as it is sign and symptom specific. No two cough remedies are alike. The second is that there is no money in the remedies as they can&#39;t be patented and protected, so pharmaceuticals have absolutely no interest in \u201dorphan drugs.\u201d All the snide comments about stupid people using it only reveal how ignorant people are, and how superior many people feel despite their own superstitions about other things.

Homeopathy is diluted? Yes! But there is information imprinted in substances, more than the chemical information, many theories suggest this, Holograms, Morphogenetic fields, etc... There is frequency, vibration... not only chemicals. <br>So what they leave in the water through the dilution process is the waveform information of the substance, the trace, and that waveform of that substance interacts with the waveform field of the individual, and can create RESONANCE (constructive interference in the waveform), this way you get out the opposite which is DISSONANCE/DISEASE (destructive interference in the waveform). This is not new agy kind of conspiracy theory, this is physics... People don&#39;t understand it, but it is as simple as that... So you enter in that holographic reality, a waveform healthy state. In main stream medicine they never treat the cause, they treat the symptoms, what they don&#39;t understand is that the cause is in that waveform reality, if they keep giving radiotherapy to a person with cancer they will not always solve the problem, the cancer will come back many times, because they are not really healing the cause.<br>I&#39;m from Cuba, they use homeopathy a lot there, and it is not a business over there, it is free...", "comment_date": "2019-12-03T02:38:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gxuum", "comment_text": "Is this why whenever I get the a cold I eat lollies and get better later that day or the next day ?", "comment_date": "2019-12-03T00:14:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ThatOtherAndrew", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HslUzw35mc&amp;t=6m22s\">6:22</a> <b>Ah, yes. 911 is calling you.</b>", "comment_date": "2019-12-02T20:28:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "41 Sourav Satish Joshi", "comment_text": "earth will become a black hole<br><br><br>if a pill \ud83d\udc8a can why not earth", "comment_date": "2019-12-02T15:48:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luxury Angelo", "comment_text": "most of my family love the homeopathics and so i end up getting given homeopathic medicine all the time, and might i say... the sugar balls taste pretty nice", "comment_date": "2019-11-29T22:02:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashish Singh", "comment_text": "Make a video on Ayurvedic Medicines .", "comment_date": "2019-11-29T19:02:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doctor Joby", "comment_text": "Great video with a GREAT point at the end about the virtues of homeopathy, they listen to the patients, spend time with them, treat them likes humans.", "comment_date": "2019-11-29T14:20:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Corvus Hyperion", "comment_text": "Kudos for coming out strongly and exposing the great fraud of homeopathy", "comment_date": "2019-11-28T22:32:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Technically T-55", "comment_text": "Spasibo effect", "comment_date": "2019-11-27T09:00:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Superseaslug", "comment_text": "Time is confusing, and i am a clock.", "comment_date": "2019-11-27T07:16:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adrian Benson", "comment_text": "Lots of homeopathy is a scam, but the stuff that actually has some potency can cure some stuff.

The first and most surprising thing that I noticed right away was that she was not even sitting at the table when I came in, she was standing next to the door, holding it open for me. Then, instead of sitting on her table opposite of me, she sat in a chair right next to me, facing me. That felt more personal then ever, and I felt as comfortable as I could ever be.

In  broad  sense   others   two  medicine  have  these  symptoms   ,  are, obviously  Sanicula, and Insulinum .\r<br>THYROIDINUM  is  one  of  the  most  essential  medicine requires in  our  daily  practice more  particularly  , we,  who are  treating  the  pediatric  cases. The  application  being  extended  from  the  treatment  of  babies  even  when  in  intra-uterus   -- to  the   days  of  termination.  But  the  use  always  wanted  some  close  consideration  ,  because  it  is  not  a  well  proved  drug . Its  applications  only based  on  some  clinical  verification  ,  and  to  some  extend  by  this  author  also..\r<br>Below  I  am  giving  some  indications  ,  on  the  basis  of  which  I  prescribe  this  remedy  almost  regularly\r<br>1) We   thinks  about  Araricus M.  when the  patient  came  with weak , mental defect,  mistake of learning and spelling mischievous  rage, strength increased when ( Bell), chilly , must stay near to stove ( Tub Bov ) . Awkwardness   ,jerking twitching while awaking ( Ignatia  ,  Ferrum  P), convulsion when awake, convulsion with frothy discharge from mouth . Fearlessness  is a  symptoms  of Agar.  ,  but  in  Kent\u2019s  repertory  there  is  nothing  such  rubrics ,  probably  it  is  related  with  destructiveness  with  rage. (  Carc.  ,  Stram.  Proteus  etc.  )\r<br>2) We  do  consider  Baryta Carb , when dwarfishness  became  more  prominent  in  both  psycho-somatic  level, dull  mentality  is  the  key  symptoms  of  Baryta Carb.  Here late walking   not  due to  any  weakness , but due  to  the  process  of late learning . Prone  to  glandular enlargements , chilly .  Premature  old  due  to  prolonged  mental  work.\r<br>3) Calcaria  , maximum time  late learning to walk due  to  bone  weakness,  maximum  time  flabby,  constipated, sweating  profusely on head, fear  of animal, craving of egg, fond of swimming  etc. Calc Phos is thin, Calc Sulph , Calc Iod  are  hot,  where  as Hepar Sulph  is the  chilly  sensitive cruel  calcaria..\r<br>4) Natrum  Mur  mainly late learning to talk , has  remarkable  craving   of extra salt, bitter ,  fear  of  sound/noise, lightning , obstinate painful constipation.

Triglyceridemia, early  grey  hair  etc)  being  present  and  so called  symptomatic   are  failed ; or as  an  inter-current  of  thyroidinum .\r<br>7) THYROIDINUM  is  another  remedy   of  this  group  mentioned  above  where the application was necessitated in some particular conditions as stated below :-\r<br>A) Family history  of Thyroid dysfunction  , Insulin Resistance State, Different  Uterine -Ovarian complaints, Diabetes , Hypertension,  Mental problems etc. \r<br>B) In maternal history  of gestation   hyper emesis  gravid, pregnancy toxemia,( edema  , albuminaturia  - hypertension - eclampsia ) ; skin  diseases , different uterine disorder as fibroid   in ovaries ,premature labour, threatened abortion  often being present   strongly.\r<br>C) All  the  psycho-somatic symptoms  of  hypo/hyper thyroidism      as  large  eye, ectomorphic / endomorphic  ,  abnormal tall limbs , fingers  and  toes (arachnodactyly ) , ectopia  lentis   i. e. features  of   features of  Marfan^s  syndrome , dwarfism, thickening velvety skin of neck (acanthrosis  nigricans ), goiter / enlargement of thyroid gland (with or without changes of hormonal level ), exophthalmic eyes either uni/bilateral , goiter, like  constitution being  present.

For example, you may have a fever most likely not due to belladonna poisoning, but since belladonna creates the same symptoms, it&#39;s believed that your body can help itself by adapting to those symptoms.

This is one example, and it has to do with seizures in pets, which normally does not clear up, it gets worse over time. My friend had an elderly dog that was having seizures several times a day. She had been giving the dog some remedies from the vet but they did not work, and they had nothing else to offer her. I happened to have an unopened homeopathic remedy I had gotten for my cat but never used, as she died. I gave it to her. My friend did not know about homeopathy at all. But she gave her dog the liquid drops during the first episode afterward, and she called me the next day, saying, &quot;I don&#39;t believe it!&quot; She said the dog stopped seizing immediately, and he only had one seizure since. She gave him the drops three times a day on my recommendation. He never had another seizure as long as she gave him the drops. I think in six months time he only had one other one. I have cats. I have gotten more of this medication, but by another manufacturer. My cat was having seizures about once a day or every other day for about two months, and they were getting worse in intensity. I started putting the drops in their food and mashing it around. The seizures stopped within 24 hours. It has been about 5 months now, and the seizures are gone. I keep putting a few drops in their food every morning. If you go to a website that sells real homeopathic remedy for seizures you will see testimonies that are just like mine.

There are tons of documentaries and studies on this with physicists, doctors, etc. so start looking into it if you want to learn more. Something that has been proven is how our intention, emotion, and conditioning towards something changes its physicality in a dramatic way. So if water truly does retain information, as any other substance would being that we&#39;re all vibrating photons and quarks depending on how you look at it, would that not imply that by drinking or ingesting that water it would positively impact us with the vibration, or with the essence of the intention, emotion, conditioning etc.? <br><br>I don&#39;t know anything but I am fascinated by all of this and love to learn about it.

Beeing born in germany I got a lot of homeopathic treatments as a little kid from around the age of 8 to about 16. The reason why it&#39;s called an &quot;alternative medicine&quot; is because it&#39;s a nice substitute for real medicine. Of course it doesn&#39;t help shit, but instead of taking antibiotics which are proven to be really bad on the long run I always took my sugar pills when having a bit of a headache or something minor. It&#39;s especially good for kids who hurt themselves while playing outside, you just give them a plaster and a sugar pill and they&#39;re happy. I&#39;d never in my whole life come to the conclusion that it&#39;s in any way ok to resort to homeopathy when beeing really sick like having fever or something like it, but IMO taking real medicine for every itch you have just isn&#39;t the way to go.<br><br>And don&#39;t ever underestimate the placebo effect on the human mind, especially when it comes to allergies like hay fever. I have hay fever since I can remember, so bad that they acutally told me on a scale from 1 to 10 I was the 11th. So my go to doctor at the age of 13 always used to just write some strange kind of rune behind my right ear with a pen, which is complete nonsense, and I know that. But it helped so much, even a bit more then conventional &quot;cetrizin&quot; which they also gave me. I strongly believe that homeopathy on it&#39;s own doesn&#39;t cure shit, but thinking it would can help many people to feel better, and in my case, even to completely supress the symptoms caused by allergies.<br><br>That said, any parent who doesn&#39;t get their kids the treatment they need when they are really sick and need to go to the hospital but resort to homoepathy should not be allowed to raise kids, that is the real danger that comes with a pseudo science like this.", "comment_date": "2018-05-06T00:42:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cristian Hernandez", "comment_text": "Make v\u00eddeos in spanish pls \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "comment_date": "2018-05-05T02:45:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kusal Pradeep", "comment_text": "Science is not developed enough to find molecules in higher potencies", "comment_date": "2018-05-04T18:34:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Harris", "comment_text": "URGENT: A VIDEO ABOUT REIKI, JOREI AND OTHER &quot;ENERGY TRANSMITIONS&quot;.

The problem with Homeopathy is the people who believe in it.

Anti-Vaccination heightens the chance of outbreak through transmission, the placebo effect isn\u2019t always 100% reliable, and the belief the prescription actually works causes misconceptions. Placebos don\u2019t always work and in my opinion for them to be truly be integrated in modern medicine doctors would need to find a way to see if a patient is\u2014 and by how much\u2014 susceptible to the effect and prescribe accordingly.

However, &#39;modern medicine&#39; just threw freaking chemo therapy at me like it was candy. When that didn&#39;t work, they gave me some stuff that literally murdered my liver and made me gain 20kg withing a matter of weeks (with stretchmarks to prove it). <br><br>My doctors didn&#39;t listen to me at all. When I quit taking their medicine which actually made me feel worse than my illness did, I started changing my lifestyle and have overcome my illness 3 times now. A few people however, heard about me and asked around to get my contact info.

You&#39;re not allowed in if you don&#39;t... Thing is, the whole flip of my lifestyle was extremely tough and I would not have had the energy for it while on the medication I was given. The medication was seriously a lot worse than the illness itself. I&#39;ve had like 6 different doctors over my life and none of them ever actually listened and most of them gave very bad advice. The one doctor I actually liked and that listened to me got a good talking to because she was too personally involved with her patients.<br><br>So yes, in a way, you&#39;re right that investing time into patients may make a bigger difference, but not any of my doctors ever even dared to stray from that oh so amazing medicine which gets shoved down your throat. The fact is that my illness has been cured in 2015 and they are keeping that medicine away so they can make more profit out of throwing chemo at people.<br><br>Yes, I trust the OBJECTIVE medical science. No, I do not trust the medical system.<br><br>Also, a lot of medicine is actually based on natural remedies. The thing about homeopathy is that everything gets shoved into that category while only one part of homeopathy is what all of it gets criticised for.<br><br>Besides this, the science isn&#39;t always that great. There&#39;s a lot of medicine out there that actually does more harm than good. Also a lot of information about lifestyle and food etc. The medical science has had to take back a LOT of statements that had been made over the past decades. Eggs are unhealthy, eggs are healthy, eggs are unhealthy because they contain cholestrol, oh wait, there&#39;s 2 types of cholesterol! Oh wait, eggs are good for your heart! Oh, meat is bad! No, meat is good! -- It&#39;s not exacty that perfect just yet, allz I&#39;m saying.<br><br>Besides this a lot of medicine is actually based on homeopathy and herbal medicine. Just... chemicalised for cheap mass production and dosage control.<br><br>There&#39;s also a VERY big movement against smoking. At the same time they are trying to recreate the effect of smoking for actually taking in medicine. Nicotine has been proven to do wonders for your bowels and helps a LOT with things like Crohn&#39;s disease. However, nearly nobody knows this.

So it turned out to be just an allergy.<br> I had two doctors that failad to see this, and for what i know, i could still be on medicine today if there would be no internet.<br>They could dismiss the root of problems by looking at my diet, but instead they decided to treat my symptoms from my food allergy.<br>This is why i have so much doubt in the modern medicine, they dont cure anything, or research the root causes of diseases, just how to treat the symptoms so you can go back to your old lifestyle(which most likely is part of the reason why you are sick).<br><br>Honestly, best doctor hands down i&#39;ve ever had, was the one who made me realize how important exercise was.", "comment_date": "2018-02-26T09:21:53Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "ERG", "comment_text": "Homeopathy kills people", "comment_date": "2018-02-26T08:58:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "albe khan", "comment_text": "&quot;Every sip of water is a super charged homeopathic coctail...&quot; \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2018-02-26T08:49:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ANSH PARIK", "comment_text": "Plz can you do in hindi , i love ur videos", "comment_date": "2018-02-26T08:36:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yehya Hattem", "comment_text": "I love this channel \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e", "comment_date": "2018-02-26T08:21:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isaac", "comment_text": "I dont even understand this but I watch it to feel smart", "comment_date": "2018-02-26T07:44:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "sealestiale", "comment_text": "So what I got out of this was a doctor tells you you feel better, 2 seconds later you do?", "comment_date": "2018-02-26T07:41:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "psbretones", "comment_text": "More content like this is urgently needed in German.

Taking a pill for every little thing trashes your system, of course this does not apply to everyone.

Hospitals cost too much and have little incentive to find ways to cut costs. Many medical techniques such as x-rays are proven and useful, though the technology is so old at this point the actual cost of the device and treatment is highly questionable. Then you have the medical fields like Multiple Sclerosis and it&#39;s associated symptoms where doctors basically prey upon desperate people selling them snake oil. If you have optic neuritis for example you could be charged $2500 a visitation to sit in a machine with the advanced technology of flashing LED lights. At some point somebody will try to sell you Interferon, or you will given repeated dangerous doses of prednisone(don&#39;t do this). For some patients none of this helps, and its questionable to me whether the ones that do get better were helped by their treatments at all. I doubt whether homeopathic medicine does anything either but at least it won&#39;t cause more damage and be dramatically cheaper. In conclusion it is the medical industry&#39;s unethical practices that give rise to alternative medicine.

It seems, as if no one here is in favour of it, and thats probably because those who do are already used to being offended and would watch a video like this very rarely. I see, this is supporting you saying that they are naive, stupid, ignorant or whatever, but I would like to tell you something:<br><br>I was brought up without vaccinations (well, i had one or two, but than I had a very bad reaction to one of it and the doctor my mom took me too did nothing to ease it, she was more like: let&#39;s see if she makes it through the weekend) and basically just homeopathy (which mostly did me good). But <del>might seem surprising</del> I wanted to be a doctor since a very young age, and using and believing in homeopathy has not affected my interest and trust in modern medicine. I understand that its effects are proven and I strongly trust science. I am fascinated by the power of modern medicine, I am really pro-medicine. But still, I would use homeopathy for some things. For example, if you have a skin issue, it might have a psychosomatic reason (and that&#39;s real science! ;) ).  Everyone would appreciate applying cortisone-lotion on it to ease the symptom, but I would go to my homeopath (who is a &quot;real doctor&quot; as well) to help me deal with the reason of it, hoping that it doesn&#39;t return. Yes, I could accept that I have neurodermatitis or something and I have it forever, BUT homeopathy holds the chance that it might never return.<br><br>So, maybe you yourself could be less ignorant and acknowledge that some people, in their despair or based on their experience, decide to use homeopathy; either because regular medicine can&#39;t help them or because they have lost their trust in that and still want to do something.", "comment_date": "2018-02-24T09:49:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mayonnaise", "comment_text": "DHMIS Reference?", "comment_date": "2018-02-24T09:39:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "White Flower Bodywork", "comment_text": "I used allopathic medicine for years, I got sicker had more surgeries and eventually was house bound.

Examples of the references to low doses occur in the article published in Hufelands Journal in 1796 announcing the similia principle, and in the first edition of the Organon published in 1810 (para. 247). His requirement at this stage is simply that the amount of medicine used should be the smallest possible to produce the required therapeutic effect. Both Haehl&#39;s biography of Hahnemann and the writings of Hahnemann himself imply that his aim in this was the reduction of the toxic effects from overdosing with medicines for which he frequently criticized other prescribers. This intention appears to have directed Hahnemann&#39;s work for several years. A development of his theories and practice became evident about six to eight years later. In 1812 he is recorded as using Arnica 6c and Nux vomica 9c for an epidemic of intermittent fever. Two years later, we are now up to 1814, an article published by Hahnemann on the treatment of typhus fever shows a further and notable change in his developing ideas about such microdoses. Here he states that the therapeutic effects of medicines are not directly related to increasing doses, but that conversely greater benefits can be obtained when they are used in diluted or refined states. This means that even at this relatively early stage in his work, only 4 years after the publication of the first edition of the Organon, Hahnemann states that low doses of medicine are not only less toxic than the higher doses for which he has often castigated his colleagues, but they are also more effective therapeutically. Two closely related discoveries appear to have led him to this statement. One was the improved therapeutic effects of reducing the dosage of previously used medicines. The other finding was that substances such as salt or lycopodium, not previously identified as medicines, became therapeutically active when used in microdoses. After such observations Hahnemann increasingly referred to these minute doses of medicinal agents as &#39;power developments&#39; or &#39;potencies&#39;, implying the therapeutic potential that he had found was enhanced or released by their reduction.", "comment_date": "2018-02-24T06:48:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cartman", "comment_text": "Massive doses of homeopathy cured my dehydration", "comment_date": "2018-02-24T06:48:16Z", "likes_count": 31407}, {"comment_by": "It'sFlair", "comment_text": "OHH FUCK FUNK", "comment_date": "2018-02-24T06:47:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian Rea", "comment_text": "If homeopathy worked it would just be called medicine.", "comment_date": "2018-02-24T06:44:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antarctican 919", "comment_text": "The clock guy was from Don&#39;t Hug Me I&#39;m Scared, nice cameo!", "comment_date": "2018-02-24T06:38:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "joshua law", "comment_text": "Would you stop a wildfire by torching it with a flamethrower?

According to homeopathic principles, remedies with the greatest dilutions have the greatest therapeutic effect, despite the virtual absence of molecules (based on Avogadro\u2019s number) in the remedy.<br><br>SO READ IT - <br><br>Any wave-like phenomena can create an interference pattern, including light and radio waves. Because laser light is an extremely pure, coherent form of light, it is especially good at creating interference patterns. It provides, in essence, the perfect pebble and the perfect pond. As a result, it wasn\u2019t until the invention of the laser that holograms, as we know them today, became possible. A hologram is produced when a single laser light is split into two separate beams. The first beam is bounced off the object to be photographed. Then the second beam is allowed to collide with the reflected tight of the first. When this happens they create an interference pattern which is then recorded on a piece of film. The threedimensionality of such images is often eerily convincing. You can actually walk around a holographic projection and view it from different angles as you would a real object.<br><br>Similarly, when a remedy is made, the dilutions receive succussions, which create interference patterns. As we know frrom holograms, the part always contains the whole. Thus, we see that the entire nature of the original substance is recreated in the potency and this explains the range of action of the homoeopathic remedy in a simple and easily understandable way. Hahnemann did not know about holograms, but his intuitive understanding of the nature of the potencies gave him a means to describe them in terms we can still understand today. <br><br>The \u201cwhole in every part\u201d nature of a hologram certainly seems to explain how so much of the visual cortex can be removed without affecting the ability to perform visual tasks. If the brain is processing images by employing some kind of internal hologram, even a very small piece of the hologram can still reconstruct the whole of what the eyes are seeing. It also explains the lack of any one-to-one correspondence between the external world and the brain\u2019s electrical activity. The point to keep in mind is the electrical activity of the brain. In the same way as the brain has electrical activity, the remedy displays an electromagnetic wave, which is precisely what is passed on from potency to potency, as I have explained in my previous article on the nano-phase potency production. This wave, when undergoing succussion, naturally produces interference waves, which in turn display the entirety of the original substance, because the electron which has been rubbed off the molecules, carries a negative charge, which contains in essence all the properties of the original substance. <br><br>Thus, when a potency is made by trituration \u2013 and even when a tincture is diluted and succussed without trituration preceding this process \u2013 the electromagnetic wave, created by either trituration or succussion is the \u201cenergy\u201d that creates the interference waves which in turn produce the holographic \u201cimage\u201d of the original substance.<br><br>In the homoeopathic potency, we discover a similar \u201cthreedimensionality\u201d to the hologram, in that the entire original substance, with all its properties, is present in the potencies. It is not so much that we can \u201cwalk around it\u201d, but in the proving, all the properties will come to the fore, some more prominent than others, all the while displaying the entirety of those original properties. Thus, the remedy Arsenicum album will display all the properties caused by poisoning with Arsenic in the symptom picture, although the dose is so small, that actual poisoning does not take place. This \u201cthreedimensionality\u201d of the properties of Arsenic is without any doubt present and shows in the totality of all the provers the entire range of action of the original poisonous substance \u201cholographically\u201d.<br><br>The fact that a single drop of each potency will produce the entire pattern in the next potency \u2013 albeit in weaker form when not succussed \u2013 and the fact that succussion will augment that threedimensional picture into a recognisable reaction when taken sufficiently often by a prover, shows that there is a holographic property in homoeopathic potencies. Of this there cannot be any doubt, since the entire pattern of symptoms can be reproduced by a proving in any potency.<br><br>Research conducted by Pribram revealed that if he removed as much as 98 percent of the part of the brain that receives and interprets what the eye sees, he found it could still perform tasks requiring complex visual skills. Similarly, if 98% of the original substance has been removed by dilution, we find it is still capable of displying all the complexity of the original substance.<br><br>The brilliant Hungarian-born physicist and mathematician John von Neumann once calculated that over the course of the average human lifetime, the brain stores something on the order of 2.8 X 1020 (280,000,000,000,000,000,000) bits of information. This is a staggering amount of information, to say the least. In the same way, the remedy can store information in the potencies that lies in an order of magnitude far surpassing that of Von Neumann&#39;s calculations for the brain, which frankly speaking is in my opinion but a tiny fraction of what the brain is capable to store.<br><br>The holographic idea offers a further analogy for the associative tendencies of memory. And it also gives rise to the notion of the memory of water, which is capable of storing information. Although in my understanding water does not possess a \u201cmemory\u201d, but instead is an information storage device much like a RW-CD \u2013 meaning the information can both be stored and wiped or replaced by other information \u2013 the analogy is apt enough. Since the remedy is a holographic image of the original substance, the water must be able to store that information in the form of electromagnetic wave interference patterns, which have been augmented or amplified by the process of succussion. In fact, succussion is the creation of interference patterns.<br><br>If you look at a hologram it seems to have extension in space, but if you pass your hand through it you will discover there is nothing there. Despite what your senses tell you, no instrument will pick up the presence of any abnormal energy or substance where the hologram appears to be hovering. This is because a hologram is a virtual image, an image that appears to be where it is not, and possesses no more extension in space than does the three-dimensional image you see of yourself when you look in a mirror. Just as the image in the mirror is located in the silvering on the mirror\u2019s back surface, the actual location of a hologram is always in the photographic emulsion on the surface of the film recording it.<br><br><br>Similarly, the energy of the remedy cannot be detected by means of instruments of classical physics, because it is not detectable by such means. As in the wave-particle physics of quantum mechanics we can either detect the wave or the particle. Dependent on what the observer wants to see, so in a hologram, we see only an image when the light of a laser beam strikes it at the right angle. Similarly, in detecting the energy pattern of a remedy, we can use several means, such as piezo-electric measurements, MRI and Raman Laser Spectography, but these means tell us that there is something there, which is only \u201cvisible\u201d when the right \u201cbeam\u201d has been directed at it, of which RLS is the one most resembling the visibility of the hologram.<br><br>This also explains the inability of the skeptics to perceive the reality of the homoeopathic potencies, because they refuse to \u201clook\u201d at them and so for them, these phenomena cannot have any real existence. Rooted in classical physics, they cannot comprehend that anything exists outside the \u201cphysical reality\u201d of Newtonian concepts. Since they cannot be forced to look at something they perceive mentally as not having any existence, their limited and narrow worldview cannot comprehend anything beyond classical physics. They have not yet graduated to the \u201chigher thinking\u201d of quantum physics and thus we should actually pity the poor sods. As always, I stoically accept my continuing role as the voice in the crowd that bravely notes these \u201cemperors\u201d have no clothes.<br><br>One startling discovery made by quantum physicists is that if you break matter into smaller and smaller pieces you eventually reach a point where those pieces\u2014electrons, protons, and so on\u2014no longer possess the traits of objects. For example, most of us tend to think of an electron as a tiny sphere or a BB whizzing around, but nothing could be further from the truth. Although an electron can sometimes behave as if it were a compact little particle, physicists have found that it literally possesses no dimension. Thus, homoeopathic potencies, in which electromagnetic energy is passed from potency to potency, no dimensional properties exist, although it has been found that in some potencies there exist still submolecular \u201cparticles\u201d, which seem to behave just like the electron and are only \u201cvisible as particles\u201d when we direct our attention to them. This is difficult for most of us to imagine because everything at our own level of existence possesses dimension. And yet if you try to measure the width of an electron, you will discover it\u2019s an impossible task.

Allopathy on the contrary treats the symptoms and in due course of time, the body&#39;s resistance increases &amp; so does the dosages.. with allopathy, a person being treated for diabetes or blood pressure will be on medications for his entire life however I have personally know individuals who have gradually reduced their dosages of allopathic medicines to completely getting rid off it with parallel homeopathic treatment.. <br>You need to find the right doctor as treatment is specific to the individual and the same medicine doesn&#39;t apply to the same ailment.. <br>Further there has to be an unbiased scientific research on this subject as many government/private studies are funded by vested interests.. just take the example of alcohol lobby&#39;s fight with weed..

And &lt;b&gt;NO, IT ISN&#39;T PLACEBO.&lt;/b&gt; When you feel you are being burned alive while poisoned  24/7/365 you distinguish what works and what doesn&#39;t. Not to mention that I, and again, many others didn&#39;t believe shit in this medicine or others when we tried it. <br><br>A few things to be addressed speciffically:<br><br>1. IT ISN&#39;T PLACEBO. First, after six years of suffering that demands a real solution fast, you know what works and what doesn&#39;t. I&#39;ve tried lots of medicine and disciplines, both established and accepted, and alternative. Second. I didn&#39;t believe in this medicine. Why would I? I have no faith in any medication nor discipline. I take it. And if it works, it shows, and if it doesn&#39;t it also shows. I just took it, in desperation, not expecting a lot or even anything... And damn...it works. It really worked. A LOT. IN ANIMALS AND KIDS IT&#39;S THE SAME. Parents go to the homeopath after normal medicine hasn&#39;t worked and don&#39;t expect from it more than from normal medicine. I&#39;m pretty sure similar things can happen with pets. You take them to the doctor not expecting a lot and after seeing normal doctors.<br><br>2. HoMEOPAHYT ISN&#39;T BIG PHARMA. Homeopathy is a small fraction of what big pharma is. My doctor charges me $25 USD for a consultation that isn&#39;t limited by time, and &lt;b&gt;IT INCLUDES ALONG WITH IT MEDICATION FOR ONE AND HALF MONTHS. IMAGINE THAT IN STABLISHED MEDICINE. SPECIALLY IN THE US. &lt;/b&gt; It&#39;s super-cheap, even for my country (Mexico). I can also reach him at any time during the day. He&#39;s also the most humane doctor I&#39;ve found, and also probably the best human being.  (And no, this isn&#39;t part of making me feel better either. I&#39;ve met other great doctors of other discplines, and their remedies just haven&#39;t worked as effectively.)<br><br>3. It isn&#39;t congruent with current established physical or chemical  science. &lt;b&gt;NO. WHO CARES. &lt;/b&gt; That&#39;s a contradiction to be solved eventually by scientists and researchers. The discipline delivers what it promises, and that&#39;s what matters to patients. I&#39;M NOT THE ONLY CASE. IF THEY TAKE THIS FROM ME THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY CONDEMINING ME TO A MUCH MORE TERRIBLE LIFE. MORE HARDER THAN THE ONE I ALREADY HAVE. And I&#39;m still disabled.<br><br>Even my doctor jokes about this extreme dilution thing and tells me how when he was studying he was also skeptycal about it. How can you actually believe that a solution that&#39;s 1/1000000000 active substance is actually doing anything?  He&#39;s also very confident about his discipline: you take the remedy and don&#39;t believe anything about it, it will work.", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T16:13:45Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "p1gnone", "comment_text": "treat a cold and be back to health in one week, do noting and it will take seven days.", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T16:13:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "p m", "comment_text": "Wow so many illeterates who are brainwashed by big.

Just sharing a perspective.<br><br>Modern drugs, while effective, are quite invasive and not without their drawbacks. They all come with risks and side-effects that take their own toll on the body and can in fact be very dangerous. Such complications can be hard to predict as different people will have different sensitivities to various drugs. Not to mention it is possible to be allergic to certain types of drugs with possibly fatal results.<br>That&#39;s a major attracting factor to homeopathy that is not being mentioned here, the lack of such risks. This is especially attractive to people that have had negative experiences with modern medicine (such as severe or unpredicted side effects, drug poisoning, allergies, you name it). <br><br>My mother for instance suffered from drug poisoning at one point in the 70s and has since lost a lot of trust in modern medicine (though medicine has probably come a long way since the 70s). She appears to have a high sensitivity to many drugs, as do her children to an extent. She is luckily not at all one for the stupidly expensive homeopathic stuff but yes there&#39;s a lot of the bach flower remedies and arnica montana going around. She isn&#39;t crazy, in the rare occassion that she has a really serious illness then she&#39;ll use regular drugs. But she&#39;ll always try homeopathy first because modern medicine does truthfully mess with her system a bit more than it normally should.<br><br>While I wouldn&#39;t personally do it that way (I don&#39;t believe homeopathy works beyond the placebo-effect, in which case you could probably find something cheaper), I think it&#39;s fairly sensible to try a placebo before trying something that has the potential to mess with your system (in not directly life threatening cases).", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T15:03:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "liquidminds", "comment_text": "homeopathy is a good alternative.

There is no fight between the two. Homeopathy is a very old form of remedy and of course it is not capable of dealing with emergency cases or healing very fast because during those times there were no such concepts. Homeopaths don&#39;t hate mordern medicine nor do they claim that it&#39;s horrible or should be avoided. You can&#39;t avoid modern medicine.  There are many things which can only be done through allopathy. <br>What I can gather from the video it&#39;s that homeopathy is being blacklisted as &#39;fake&#39; or ineffective just because of the shear lack of knowledge about it. <br>(Not the mention the fact that allopathic companies which should be called giant pharmacies if homeopathic pharmacies are to refered as big) <br>The concept of &#39;like cures like&#39;  is so different from what you explained. <br>If you have malaria  and the symptoms are ABC and the antibodies produced for it are XYZ <br>What homeopathic actually does it gives you a substance a very low quantities which will produce similar symtoms to ABC (eg.A1B1C1) and the antibodies produced will be similar to XYZ (eg X1Y1C1). X1Y1Z1 are easily able to overcome A1B1C1 because they are so less, and then help in fighting ABC, and as these are produced by the body itself, it helps improve the immune system of the body.<br>Unlike allopathy which just gives medicines to suppress the infection and not helping your body cure it on it&#39;s own.<br><br><br>Each person is free to have their own opinion and preferences.

However, I don\u2019t doubt that the scientific evidence shown in this video is true. I just want to share my experience with homeopathy and how much it has helped me. <br><br>1. Food intolerance evaluation. <br>While not everybody believes in the validity of the food intolerance evaluation, I went in to try it after visiting numerous doctors about awful, persistent migraines. It concluded that I have an intolerance to all fruits, exempting melons and tomatoes. Now, I only have a brief understanding of the science of how this works, so I\u2019m not even going to bother trying to explain it, as I\u2019ll probably say something horribly contradictory to what my doctor had told me. The interesting thing I experienced was that as soon as I cut these foods out of my diet, my migraines began to disappear. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s as a result of the placebo effect, mostly because I went from having migraines every day, to not having them at all. I could be wrong though. <br>2. SIBO test. <br>For years I had struggled with awful digestive issues, making it feel like my intestines were on fire sometimes when I would be using the bathroom. After visiting my main practitioner, he just told me \u201coh, you have IBS, and there\u2019s no cure so you\u2019ll just have to try one of these diets and then MAYBE it will go away.\u201d <br>This, no doubt, made me very frustrated. So I contacted my N.D about what I could do to solve this. She provided a breath test for me which could be send in to test for Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth(SIBO). After I completed this test, it was then sent I to a lab where it was tested for the amount of hydrogen and methane within the test tubes (in ppm). Now, while this test is still in its infancy, it did prove to me that there was an excess of hydrogen, and thus I most likely had SIBO. This made it possible for me to obtain an antibiotic through my main practitioner, which, is in fact not naturalpathic medicine. <br>I wasn\u2019t really trying to disprove this video or the scientific research behind it in any way. I just wanted to explain how it has helped me, and how sometimes it can be a good way to get the medicine you need through tests that aren\u2019t even administered in western medicine. <br>If anybody has any thoughts or info on this, please let me know and I\u2019d be glad to discuss them.", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T13:32:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Jacobovitz", "comment_text": "Can I upvote this more than once?

Are you being funded by the petrochemical/pharmaceutical industry?<br><br>For starters, 89% of newly developed pharmaceutical drugs are <b>direct copies</b> of naturally occurring compounds (they need to use synthetic copies to increase profitability ie it\u2019s illegal to patent naturally occurring compounds, and people won\u2019t buy drugs for thousands of dollars if they can grow a safer and more effective version for a couple of bucks at home). And on that point you also deliberately mislead people into thinking that the decentralised \u201chomeopathy industry\u201d (aka people who grow plants) is part of the centralised pharmaceutical industry (this is a complete lie) and is worth a few billion dollars globally, and while that monetary figure may even be accurate, you fail to point out that the multi-trillion dollar pharmaceutical industry is highly centralised and is part of the multi-multi-trillion dollar petrochemical industry (which again views these natural compounds as a massive threat to their extremely profitable pharmaceutical industry, for the reasons I outlined previously).<br><br>So as well as overlooking these glaringly obvious FACTS, you have also incorrectly defined what homeopathy is. Homeopathy (which has been practiced for literally all of human history, not a couple of hundred years like you erroneously claim in the video) is nothing to do with using compounds that cause symptoms to treat symptoms, that\u2019s industry-funded disinformation, it just means \u201cthe same\u201d (homeo) \u201cpathy\u201d (way) because all life on earth is made of the same compounds we are. That\u2019s why natural compounds like apple cider vinegar have amazing antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties. This is largely being attributed to a whole new class of naturally occurring chemicals in plants that have recently been discovered called \u201cphytonutrients\u201d, which are basically natural/plant based compounds that protect plants in the wild from disease, fungus, bacteria etc. It\u2019s now scientifically established that our human immune systems actually utilise these compounds at a cellular level and are essential for maintaining a functional immune system.

(not treating someone just means they go to another doctor and then another and then another and then another and so on endlessly - it would be far MORE efficient to help them the first time than to put them through ten office visits and two hospitalizations in a single year without anyone lifting a finger to help - sadly, speaking from experience here). This can leave patients feeling alienated and desperate for answers or help from ANY source, no matter how crazy or stupid. And the &quot;get the patient to come in for unneccessary office visits&quot; is a frequent scam run almost universally in the medical field. Need your prescription refilled? Oh, you&#39;ve been on it for years and have no problems with it and your life depends on it? Too bad. You need an office visit for a refill anyway (because the doctors have to &quot;make their money&quot;, and they often admit this straight out). Holding vital medicines hostage, lack of diagnostics skills outside of invasive and sometimes INCREDIBLY damaging medical proceedures (often being unneccessary, as well), and the general lack of any form of compassion, empathy, or even basic responcible care from physicians weakens trust in their services, as do excessive bills and underhanded debt collection techniques (such as holding medicines or medical records hostage for payment). Add to that the fact that doctors frequently falsify medical records to cover their butts when they act like idiots, and a LOT of people start losing faith in them and looking elsewhere. If people felt their doctor cared and that they could trust them to understand their patient&#39;s needs and be helpful and compassionate, there would be far fewer flocking to snake oil salesmen like these homeopaths. The simple fact is that there&#39;s just no way to get good medical treatment for certain illnesses, in America at least. <br><br>And I speak from a MOUNTAIN of experience (over a decade of experience being a medical lab rat... in 7 different states...). To give  you just one example, the Mayo Clinic in MN diagnosed chest pains that stab in time with one&#39;s pulse, cause weakness in the arms and legs, coldness, difficulty breathing, and are only made better by laying down or going to sleep as... heartburn (with a side order of supposed &quot;panic attacks&quot;, though I&#39;ve never had a panic attack in my life and the chest pains, if anything, make me too tired to feel anything but calm and very very sleepy). They patronizingly responded that &quot;Well, you don&#39;t want it to be a heart problem&quot;, and then added that I was just a women (and all women are overly emotional) so I must be having panic attacks (because all women do, apparently). Nope, no sexism here... (Oh, and the only thing they did to investigate the chest pains was order a pap smear... on a virgin... If you can explain that one, you are smarter than me...) But that&#39;s just one horror story. I&#39;ve entered an ER writhing in pain and left with permanent nerve damage from their treatment (which put my life in danger). I&#39;ve been drugged up with huge doses of morphine and rushed hundreds of miles to a bigger hospital, only to have them refuse to treat me (because of a false piece of information inserted into my medical records by a well-meaning but misguided doctor I&#39;d seen before the incident). I&#39;ve had doctors withold vital anti-seizure drugs to extort on office visit from me, without any consideration of the fact that I can&#39;t drive or walk and lived over 30 miles away. How was I supposed to get there? It&#39;s not like there&#39;s public transit in the US! Had I not stockpiled enough medicine to last me until I could convince a doctor to write a prescription, I could have died, and my doctor didn&#39;t care at all. <br><br>TL;DR - Callous, abusive behavior by physicians undermines trust in them, not homeopathy. The simple fact is that homeopathy is just riding the coattails of a problem the doctors THEMSELVES created with their so-called &quot;efficiency&quot;, something that leaves many patients suffering needlessly just so doctors and hospitals can line their greedy pockets.", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T06:14:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HisRoyalCarlness", "comment_text": "The second one, mostly.

Contrary to common misconceptions we do not have a placebo wing in tests to account for the power of belief, but to account for the participants biases as well as extraneous factors that may not have been accounted for in the test. A common example of placebo is pain reduction. Pain is a partly subjective measurement and is difficult to measured objectively, so it is usually measured in patient reporting. Thing is, patients have a subconscious expectation that their treatment should have an effect and have a tendency to exaggerate their reports in that direction even if they feel just as hurt. This is what placebo means. It does not mean wish power or the power of belief. There are no experiments that show placebo to actually have any physical effects other than maybe the personal perception of pain or minor and temporary effects on stress or muscle tension as would be expected of a mental state.

The \u201cplacebo effect\u201d is well-documented evidence that people can activate their own body\u2019s healing ability through intention alone. \u201cScience\u201d still does not know how this happens on a biochemical level. All we know is that it does, over and over\u2014but it\u2019s also not reliable &amp; is affected by many variables that are hard to control for. This is the exact same case for homeopathy. Elaborate &quot;proofs&quot; that homeopathy can&#39;t work on the chemical level are pointless. Nobody ever said it worked on a chemical level. It works by the same unknown-to-science mechanism that the placebo effect works by. Practitioners of energy medicine study, refine, and develop methodologies to increase that effect\u2014the body\u2019s ability to heal itself\u2014and homepathy is one of them. <br><br>It\u2019s hard to prove that they are more effective than the \u201cvanilla placebo\u201d effect in any scientifically \u201cvalid\u201d way because in a study of how intention affects healing, the intention of the researchers and subjects affect the study itself. And the intention of researchers is generally to look for a chemical effect, and there is no chemical effect, so they don\u2019t find one. They get exactly what they are looking for: a result that fits their worldview. (If you are arguing that pets &amp; kids &amp; patients get better because the doctor believes they will, you also have to accept that subjects in a study may not show any effect because the researchers do not believe it\u2019s possible for there to be any effect.)<br><br>In essence, it\u2019s very hard to scientifically show the effect of intention on health because humans always have intentions and they are not objectively measurable. So we have no way to reliably measure if imbuing water with the healing essence of a plant through this process increases the ability of that water to activate healing, if that water is always administered through a scientific model by people who believe only chemical effects are real. (The healing essence of a plant can be thought of as that plant\u2019s \u201cintention\u201d \u2014 only humans as far as we know can will their intention, everything else is just intending to be what it is, on an energetic level). So essentially this video only proves that homeopathy is not chemical medicine (but nobody said it was), and that science can\u2019t prove it works (but that\u2019s obvious if you understand that science can\u2019t measure energy medicine in general because it has no way to neutralize the intention effect).", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:38:23Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "CockSmasher9000", "comment_text": "So that&#39;s how Potions/Mega potions are made in Monster Hunter World", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:38:23Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "David Holtjer", "comment_text": "Shout out to the clock from don\u2019t hug me I\u2019m scared \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T21:38:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mazen Maznouk", "comment_text": "Can you please translate this video into Arabic....

So my dad decided to take me to a homeopath. He described what it did and they talked etc (couldn&#39;t understand most of it as it my 2nd Lang that they talked in) and after a while he gave me a 2 lots of pills, 1 to take once a week and to take the other 4 times a day.<br>Tbh at the time I thought wow this new medication might actually help me (again, I didnt know what exactly homeopathy was I&#39;d only heard of it and in my mind it was a reliable type of medicine, then I googled it when I got home and found out that there&#39;s a lot of controversy behind it and was basically all shambles, which disappointed me quite a bit<br>So fast forward, I start taking the pills, the actual pills tasted of sugar so they were like free sweets tbh, but initially I thought they were a waste of money and there&#39;s no way they&#39;d work.<br>Id noticed whenever I took the first pill (once a week) my skin would flare up immensely like never before (there was 1 day where my whole face looked swollen and I didn&#39;t even want to go school because it was so painful to even touch my eyes) but I noticed a few days after these flare ups my skin would become clearer than before (as it was normally very red, painful and itchy). A few weeks later (after the course) I was pretty much completely eczema free and it wasn&#39;t until after that I realized what the homeopath said was true, after taking the pills I woud flare up a bit and it would get better. I don&#39;t think it was the placebo effect (as I believed the steroid creams were working but my eczema would come back after stopping, and because I spent most of the time eating the pills thinking there&#39;s no way in hell this little sugar pill will do anything)<br><br>So, whether the pill actually helped me or not, I don&#39;t know but that was my first and only experience with homeopathy so I&#39;m skeptical to believe homeopathy is complete bs (which it does sound like, logically). Since then (this was 7 months ago) my eczema has gone up and down but never as bad as it used to be (my face, arms, neck, back and legs were constantly red/itchy) however it has recently been flaring a bit more so I am thinking of going back for another course", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T18:52:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Billy", "comment_text": "Love how you brought old intro theme back", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T18:52:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashton", "comment_text": "first", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T18:52:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gl Gaming", "comment_text": "I think there&#39;s a small error in the video.

So that when you in a later time do end up with a 10ml &quot;bite&quot; from a snake, you might actually survive it. <br>Isn&#39;t this the purpose of Homeopathy? Start with a non lethal dose of some sort of thing that may kill you in a larger dose, to prepare your body to face the real thing later on.

This is something in that even well informed skeptics agree. The scientific explanation is, as this video states, the &quot;Placebo Effect&quot;. But, as nobody knows in scientific terms how this Effect actually works, I feel myself very unsatisfied with this pseudo-explanation that &quot;explains&quot; an unknown through another unknown... <br><br>2- Homeopathy adherents say they can prove it works because it can be used with good results on children and animals, that can not &quot;believe&quot; in Homeopathy to activate the Placebo Effect on themselves. Skeptics (and this video) say the Placebo Effect can be &quot;transfered&quot; to others. Again, as the Placebo Effect is a scientific unknown, their explanation has to construct &quot;properties&quot; (as &quot;capacity to be transfered&quot;) for that unknown can work. This bothers me, because it&#39;s a pseudo-scientific answer from the scientific field.<br><br>3- But let&#39;s imagine this &quot;transfer&quot; is possible. How it works? This video (and informated skeptics) suggests that fathers, caregivers and veterinarians that use Homeopathy treat children or animals in some way &quot;better&quot; than that who use scientific medicine, &quot;inducing&quot; in them some (unknown) variation of that infamous Placebo Effect. This is too much out of line. This is not a scientific critique. It&#39;s simply not true that the owners of animals (mostly farmers) treat in some way &quot;better&quot; their animals when use homeopathic treatments than when they not. And if you say that, you have to prove it. You (the skeptic) have put the burden of proof over your own shoulders, and you have been in some sense backfired. You have not proved anything.<br><br>And that bothers me, because the enigma remains unanswered. Does Homeopathy works? I some sense, yes it does.

SO just for their mental satisfaction or to make them feel better (mentally) PLACEBO is given. IT HELPS IN STRESS DUE TO ANY IMAGINARY PROBLEM. BUT NOT ALL HOMEOPATHY IS BASED ON THE &quot;PLACEBO EFFECT&quot;.  PLACEBO IS NOT GIVEN ALL THE TIME AND HOMEOPATHY IS NOT BASED ON IT.<br>I tend to think due to rush in making this video the Supervisor of the channel FORGOT to put CLARIFIED INPUTS AND SUBJECTS. In homeopathy we do take a certain amount of clinical Consultation for every single patient. OUR WAY TO PRESCRIBE MEDICINE IS WAYYYY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER PATHIES. our consultation includes, physical and psychological observations. Kind of mix for basic physicians and a therapist. THAT DO INCLUDES VARIOUS medical TESTS PRESCRIBED BY US. YES more than just blabbering.<br>THE HOMEOPATHY HAS CHANGED BASICALLY FROM BEING A BIT PHILOSOPHICAL TO TOTALLY SCIENTIFIC. Every medicine goes through a certain DRUG PROVING PROCESS. which PROVES if it is suitable for the disease or not. it has many levels of proving and testing.<br>THE MODERN HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINES ARE BASED ON A VERY COMPLEX PROCESS WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONE MEDICINAL SUBSTANCES AND WORKS IN A TIME SPAN OF ANY ALLOPATHIC MEDICINES. I AM NOT SAYING THAT ALL HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINES TAKE SAME TIME AS ALLOPATHIC. THE POTENTIZATION IS IN FACT, IS DONE TILL A LEVEL OF THE THE POTENTISED POINT IS ACHIEVED. That level is based on the medicine. <br>THE OLD HOMEOPATHY, was wildly based on philosophical evidences which has changed till now. But the Oldest books (Fragmenta de viribus) is highly based on proved evidences which did got modified. THE ORGANON OF MEDICINE IS THE PHILOSOPHICAL REASONING OF THE LOGICAL FACTS. Which is by the way we study because we are practitioners. AND WE DO EXPERIMENTALLY PROVE IT, TOO. <br>Homeopathy has its limitations. it never says that dont go for surgical treatments or emergencies if its the immediate NEED.  WE DONT SAY THAT DONT GO TO A SURGEON IF THERE IS A BULLET IN YOUR CHEST OR THERE IS AN EMERGENCY CASE. WE DONT MIND A DAMN VACCINATION, DUH. HOMEOPATHY ALLOWS IMMEDIATE NEEDS.

I know that homeopathic medicine from the past won&#39;t work and there&#39;s companies part of &quot;big pharma&quot; who sell synthetic food supplements, powers etc like GNC etc and that&#39;s perfectly legal but there&#39;s no regulation on it in the US and it does nothing it&#39;s just sugar soy pills that adds nothing to a person&#39;s health.

They know if people find out that there is a middle point between natural and modern medicine and that point is what will change the medical industry forever. That exist a industry which  doesn&#39;t profit off of making people sick or covers the symptoms or just prevent illness. But can bring scientifically based, lab tested natural based medicine. There are even technology and medical procedures that are less invasive for cancer patients like advance thermal therapy and that&#39;s just one of them. There is so much information out there  but people we live in a very biased scientific world not a progressive one and that&#39;s the problem. The scientific Community needs to be more open-minded and start realizing there isn&#39;t an us versus them situation there needs to be more cooperation. The pharmaceutical industry is proven medicine but it&#39;s not the only 1 there is a thing called natural modern medicine which also have been proven to work just as good as Pharmaceuticals and if in a few cases much better.

But its no-one&#39;s fault, so I thought I&#39;d settle this.<br><br>Vaccines are injections of a <b><i>non-live virus</i></b> . They are not active and cannot do harm to the body. They are specifically weakened, so that the immune system can produce the <b>antibodies</b> necessary to kill the virus in a safe manner. What&#39;s important about this is that the body does <b>not</b> know what antibodies to produce, so it produces a whole bunch and hopes to accidentally produce one which works (in a manner of speaking). Eventually, a correct antibody will be produced and it can fight off the virus. The cells that produced these antibodies remain in the blood, and this is important because if the virus were to reinfect in the future, the immune response is <b>much faster</b> because we already have the cells that can produce the antibodies necessary to kill the virus. This is factually and experimentally based.<br><br>Homeopathy does no such thing, after all, the substances which you place in your body are not things for the immune system to deal with. In the case of poisons like belladonna, for example, your body undergoes multiple procedures to flush out the poison, such as sweating, vomiting, diarrhoea, etc. None of these are systems which require the substance to be &quot;killed&quot;. There is no reaction in the body which strengthens it against more of the same in the future.<br><br>I hope this clears it up slightly, for actual biologists, feel free to nitpick.

Here&#39;s my point of view:<br>In my opinion homeopathy is OK as long as the illness you&#39;re treating with homeopathy is not going to seriously injure your body. As an example: If some1 caught a cold and says homeopathy helps him more than modern medicine: Go ahead and use it.

Take warfarin, for example, a commonly-used rat poison before it lost effectiveness due to evolution. It&#39;s still currently given to patients by doctors to help prevent blood clots, because that&#39;s what it does: it stops blood from clotting. A high dose (50mg or more) is lethal, but very small doses (less than 10mg) are safe, and even then they have to be carefully balanced with tests every week because it&#39;s still dangerous.<br>So knowing that very tiny doses of poison aren&#39;t automatically as lethal as high doses, all you need to do is mathematically represent &quot;a thing causes a symptom&quot; as X/1, and then perform a failure of basic math and think a smaller dose is the same thing as the opposite, 1/X, and suddenly you think &quot;if X/1 causes symptom, 1/X cures it&quot;, and poof, you suddenly have an entirely wrong-headed and incorrect idea of how to cure disease.<br><br>Cue the dilution thing as a method of reducing doses, which is a further mistake in not understanding how chemistry works. Tylenol doesn&#39;t become more effective if you drink five gallons of water with your pill, because no matter how much water you end up drinking you&#39;re still only getting 325mg of Tylenol/paracetamol/acetaminophen from the pill. If you dissolve the pill, it doesn&#39;t matter; if you drink the entire thing, you&#39;re still only getting 325mg. If you only drink a single drop of five gallons of water with one pill dissolved in it, you&#39;re getting almost no medication whatsoever, which means there simply isn&#39;t any acetaminophen affecting your body chemistry to have an effect. The idea that water magically knows the medicinal properties of whatever medicinal (or in the case of homeopathy, non-medicinal but believed to be so by imbeciles) substance you&#39;re sticking in there is absurd. If it were true that water takes on the medicinal properties, then simply taking more medication would have the same effect; if a dilution of 500mg of Tylenol is twice as effective then taking two pills would match it perfectly, but in reality a dilution is less effective. If dilution truly <b>increased</b> the effectiveness, then you should regularly see overdoses from homeopathy patients who are taking an amount of medication greater than the spherical volume of an entire star system. It also begs the question of where <i>water</i> got its medical degree, to know that medicinal properties are good but things like taste and color and non-medicinal toxic properties shouldn&#39;t be &quot;remembered&quot;. Water, it shouldn&#39;t need saying, does not have a medical degree.<br><br>The stupid doesn&#39;t stop there. If homeopathy had any merit, then taking extra-strength Tylenol should be less effective than regular strength, because 500mg is more medication than 325mg and according to homeopathy less is more effective. This should be true of all medication, in fact; merely scratching a single particle of dust off of a pill and breathing it in from across the room should be infinitely more effective a treatment than an IV drip. You should be able to perform surgery on someone merely by telling them &quot;Hey, painkillers exist&quot; instead of knocking them out through anesthesia.<br><br>The only effectiveness homeopathy can ever truly claim credit for belongs to the placebo effect, and as someone astutely pointed out, <b>real medication has the placebo effect too.</b> The difference of course is that real medication has an additional, real effect, whereas homeopathy does not.<br><br>Essentially, homeopathy is entirely based in a misunderstanding of pretty much everything to do with chemistry and medicine and even mathematics.

Homeopathy, which I&#39;ve never studied does sound like hogwash. But alternative medicine is not. Nutrigenomics is a relatively new science that informs us that nutrition and our genes react to foods in a way that suggests natural healing through food is possible. It also suggests that many forms of alternative medicine, like the Dongui Bogam of Korea, understood this centuries before us. This is real science based on observation and tests. And although writings like Dongui Bogam are outdated and a result of their history does not mean they were stupid. They recognized diabetes, high blood pressure, and even dangerous pregnancies centuries before we could and handled their patients survival successfully. So, no, not all alternative medicine is hogwash but homeopathy isn&#39;t alternative medicine. It&#39;s literally a placebo.

There needs to be a mixture of empathy and efficiency in order to attain the maximum possible standard of care.

We can also nurture people&#39;s mentalities properly as to inform them about the proper clinical trials, in order to avoid misconceptions and curb the many immoral and unethical random clinical trials that have been done over the decades (Willowbrook Hepatitis Exp., Stanford Prison Exp., World War II Japanese and German Human Exp., etc.), as well as abolish the autonomy-paternalistic contract just because doctors are considered as high-class professionals. This could lead to less vaccine scares and more informed decisions on medicine and healthcare for each family.<br><br>And although there still exists the problem of a profit-based health sector, I still believe that healthcare is a global right, and that the compensation for it is still a big issue to be talked about otherwise.
