The moon is a gravity well, not an easy rest stop.  Also, a moon base would need to have everything delivered to it and it would be competition for funding.

Over evolutionary time, Earth would never have evolved the way it has had it not been for the various large icy and metalic asteroids populating the rest of the proto-planetary disk and early solar system, so to be more accurate we&#39;d have to say that the &quot;Sol solar system&quot; is 99.9999% self-contained and self-sufficient&quot; (leaving aside a tiny fraction to reflect the chance that the organics or other trace elements which proved to be crucial to life on Earth were introduced after the early Sol molecular cloud began to form into a pre-Solar nebula.\r<br>\r<br>All of which is to say: depending on the time-scale and physical-scale there actually is no such thing as a completely self-contained and self-sufficient ecological framework, but this is primarily an academic point to clarify the caveat that: most arcologies which we might imagine producing within the next 1,000 or so years, will only approach true self-contained self-sufficiency never actually achieve it.\r<br>\r<br>In sum: the degree to which &quot;off-world human habitation or settlement&quot; is self-contained and self-sufficient reflects a set of objective physical and operational parameters which can easily be quantified and aggregated into a score and compared to Earth itself, which achieves 99.99%. Endurance, i.e., the timeframe during which such an off-world settlement can sustain life and normal operations without introduction of supplies or assistance from Earth would also be part of such an assessment.\r<br>\r<br>My understanding is that the ISS achieves only about 1 to 5% self-sufficiency over the time frame of 1 to 2 months. Beyond that endurance range the facilities capacity to sustain human life and normal operations will decline without replenishment from Earth. So, that is the level of our ability to actually do what Musk projects doing: create a colony on Mars.\r<br>\r<br>Personally, I would like to see humanity become a true multi-world species (which is not the same as multi-planet and is a more inclusive concept, which is to say: space habitats may well be a much more sensible approach than &quot;colonizing&quot; any of the presently accessible planets or moons apart from Earth). So I appreciate Musk ostensible vision and goal. But his approach to it is ridiculously simplistic and dumb.\r<br>\r<br>We may eventually have the ability to create self-sustaining self-contained habitats on Earth which in the 6 month endurance range, and that would be a good &quot;first step.&quot; A good second step would be to improve reliability, efficiency and redundancy in those initial designs and to extend them to harsh Earthly settings like Antarctica where the prospect of a catastrophe does not equate with death of all personnel. Once such a phase two arcology achieves a high level of self-sustenance for something like 9 to 18 months; it all depends on what systems exist to provide rescue and the timeline of affording such under worst-case scenarios. In short, the settlement should be able to cope with worst-case scenarios long enough to be rescued, whether that means at least 6 months or 24 months of endurance at 99.99% self-contained self-sufficiency.\r<br>\r<br>Once the design works in one of the harshest contexts on Earth--relatively controlled and safe conditions--then it would be replicated/adapted for an orbital habitat. Once that showed success for a sufficient period of time, then the next logical step would be to produce more, bigger and better orbital or LaGrange facilities where centrifugation can provide &quot;normal&quot; gravity and to explore scaling up the designs. A parallel track could also pursue applying the proven arcology technology, designs, principles, protocols and processes to a Moon base, which could then eventually lead to further elaborations for more remote and inhospitable locales.", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T15:28:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Johnson[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKGREZs6-w&amp;t=3m45s\">3:45</a> xenomorph!<br>Or whatever it\u2019s called.", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T12:47:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nothing", "comment_text": "What if kurz is a serect org of birds that are periviously humans from mars (homo kurzians) and want to help homo sapiens avoid the same fate- civilation dying?

Mars needs to have something Earth wants/needs and it has to be easier/cheaper than alternatives, especially if it&#39;s something Earth also has.  Humans didn&#39;t expand on Earth just for the fun of it.  There were social, economic, and political reasons.  The Central Plains of the US were actually skipped over for the better soil of the west coast until  newer farming techniques were developed and laws were passed that made open range ranching feasible.  They could graze cattle on land they technically didn&#39;t own, so it became profitable.  The fact is that the most uninhabitable places on  Earth are more conducive to human life than Mars, the moon, a space station, etc.   <br><br><br>Yes, a research outpost might happen, like Antarctica.  Permanent colonization is extremely unlikely.  First, we don&#39;t even know if human birth is possible in such low gravity.  Add in the absence of all the necessary bacteria required to support life on Earth.  Even if that&#39;s all were overcome, there&#39;s the fact that people born on Mars or who&#39;ve lived there for years probably could never return to Earth due to their weakened skeletal systems and an immune system that&#39;s compromised due to living in recycled air.

Studies show that kids raised on farms have lower instance of allergies and asthma from those raised in cities, especially without pets in the household from an early age.

In terms of plant needs - Mars can supply the perfect light conditions, heat and gas mixture for optimal growth, as long as power is free. Sodium, LED and halides could provide all the light needs for the plants, as well as heat, but the nutrients would have to come from Earth. Most likely bio-tech as well, which is another matter. In dehydrated form these nutrients could be very cost efficient. Aeroponics negates the need for soil - it&#39;s only a substrate with a variable properties after all.

Really?  To what end?  For what purpose?  What is the end-goal for building a Mars base?  Do you even know?<br><br>Seriously, there is nothing on Mars of any interest, it is a completely dead rock, through and through.  Even its core has cooled and solidified.  Humans cannot survive there, not even in a habitat.  As, even in a habitat the humans that went there would be blasted by solar radiation on a regular basis.  Here on Earth we have a magnetosphere that protects us from such radiation.  Without that our planet would quickly look like Mars.  On Mars all it would take to kill every human on it is a single solar flare.  Here on Earth that would be practically nothing.  On Mars it would just be the end, full stop.<br><br>Not only that, but the soil there is straight up deadly.  Even if the planet was terraformed(impossible by the way), the soil there would still keep people from going outside.  You can&#39;t breathe it in, hell, you can&#39;t even get it on your skin.<br><br>No way to make food, no way to where to get drinking water.<br><br>Humans will die so fast that in order to keep a presence on Mars we will have to send millions of people there in a never ending string of missions.  One mission takes off here and there better be a rocket waiting to go, to be launched immediately afterward.<br><br>Oh, and that isn&#39;t even mentioning the perfectly normal rape and murder that will have to be done, in the name of survival.  Oh yeah, this just got dark, real dark.  But true nonetheless.<br><br>See, humans can&#39;t survive on Mars.  Not as we are today.  We evolved to survive on <b><i>THIS</i></b> planet, specifically.  We are specialized to live here and <b><i>ONLY</i></b> here.  And at that, we have only actually evolved to live on exactly 30% of this planet&#39;s surface, as we have not yet evolved to survive in our oceans, which makes up the remaining 70% of the Earth&#39;s surface.<br><br>But we do know how to breed and evolve.  But you are not going to like it...  And &quot;Gruesome&quot; doesn&#39;t even come close to describing what is necessary.<br><br>The very moment a female reaches puberty, no matter her age, she will have to be impregnated, even she doesn&#39;t want to, even if she doesn&#39;t fully understand what is going on.  And the males, age is irrelevant, as long as they are the strongest against the Mars environment, will have to be the only ones to do it.  And they too will have to do it, even if they don&#39;t want to, even if it is against their will.  On Earth we call that rape.  On Mars that will just be survival.<br><br>Further, all of those that are weak against the Martian environment must be euthanized.  As you just simply can&#39;t have them breeding in the genepool.  You <b><i>MUST</i></b> move forward.  You cannot afford to have any accidents, no unsanctioned breeding.  Such a thing would have to be punished by death.  Here on Earth we call that murder.  On Mars that will just be survival.<br><br>All of this with the sole goal of breeding a human, the first human, that can actually survive in the Martian environment.  A human that is immune to the Martian regolith, can survive in the massive dust storms, can breath in the zero air atmosphere and is immune to the raw solar radiation.  And more.<br><br>Personal feelings, emotions, desires, none of those will hold any meaning on Mars once people get there with no way of getting back.  It will be either breed up then die, or just die.<br><br>The first creature Earth that crawled out of the ocean and onto the shore, it immediately died.  But they kept on trying and eventually one survived.  That one eventually found another one and they kept on fucking till they had babies that could live on land.  And so on and so forth.  That is how Mars will be.<br><br>Wrap your your privileged mind around that!!  Seriously, there are 7.7 billion people alive today.  And there were an estimated 107 billion that lived and died before you to make the world what it is today.  They all endured what you would consider Hell on Earth to make the world what it is toady, just for you.<br><br>And what you are asking is, for another 107 billion people to do it all over again, this time knowing what lies ahead, but are likely unwilling to do any of that yourself.<br><br>And here I thought you were smart.

And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

On the years long voyages, distillation plants would extract valuable commodities like water and oxygen, carbon could even be extracted as a construction material.  Once at Mars, the tankers would eject their cargos to bouy up the thin Martian atmosphere while simutaneously increasing the planet&#39;s temperature by means of the greenhouse effect. The tankers would reserve enough mass to return to Venus and repeat the cycle until a viable atmospheric density is acheived.  Mar&#39;s mass would be increased as we mine the asteroid belt.  Exhausted asteroidal waste would bombard the surface in controlled sequences (goodbye, Ceres).  Though the increase in mass would be minute, the heat of the collisions may have positive benefits releasing water vapor trapped in soils and fusing large amounts of dust.  I&#39;m hesitant to believe Mars has enough gravitational mass to maintain a permanent atmosphere, so periodic shipments would be brought in to refresh mass stripped away by solar winds.

No amount of training we can do here on Earth can ever prepare anybody for this kind of psychological horror.

It\u2019s not because we are abandoning earth, it\u2019s because we care about it, and because that is simply what life does. It grows, it\u2019s consumes resources, it gains complexity, and it spreads. From the smallest bacterial cell, all the way up to the oldest trees and biggest animals, that is the basic directive of life. We are smart, and much more complicated than other life here on earth, but that doesn\u2019t quite mean we can just opt out of basic life tendencies. Not unless we wish to go extinct. Yes, we can absolutely do things better on earth. And we definitely should. But if we want to continue as a species, colonizing mars is probably one of the most important feats there is. Even with the most efficient technology possible, earth will at some point be unable to support such a large amount of life. Planets are basically a host, and life is the bacteria. But that doesn\u2019t mean we have to be a deadly bacteria. We can be symbiotic. We just have to spread out to equalize or lower the proportion of resource usage and growth rate. When you say that we should just stay on earth and forget about mars, you are saying we should all stay on earth, continue destroying it, and die. Earth will recover, but we will all suffocate. Keep being eco friendly, and doing everything you can. But that isn\u2019t a permanent solution. It\u2019s a temporary stabilizer, giving us the time we need to expand before it\u2019s too late. Being pro-mars means being pro-earth, and pro-human. Since you are all living beings, and you all consume resources just like everything else, this outlook is your most primitive and necessary duty.

There is no planet B.<br><br><br>I love Kurzgesagt, and have been subscribed since the first video. But recently they seem increasingly obsessed with colonisation and &quot;progress&quot;. Overproduction and colonisation are arguably the worst parts of humanity and I don&#39;t think they should be spoken about with such enthusiasm. Humanity will never reach Mars unless we first solve the problems we have here on Earth. How do we pool resources to sustain a second planet when we can&#39;t fairly pool resources to sustain the Earths population?<br><br><br>Mars, as stated in this video, is a horrible place to go, and terrible at sustaining life. Earth, however, is a haven, in fact, THE haven for humanity, we thrive here. Earth has everything we need, Mars has nothing. Yet this type of colonisation and progress, (through extreme capitalism); is destroying Earth (a haven for humanity), turning it to a desolate wasteland; in order to go to Mars (a desolate wasteland) and (maybe) turn it into a haven for humanity. This is the craziest gamble we can make.<br><br><br>Mars will never give us what Earth has, and making videos like this encourages thoughts of giving up hope on Earth in order to reach for the stars. These type of videos encourage over-production and waste of resources. We will never have the capacity for space travel without first solving the environmental and socio-political problems we face on Earth.<br><br><br>I don&#39;t want to take a Nihilist approach to the climate, and so I will say this; humanity can do great amazing things, and we have in the past, but every amazing thing we have done before was possible because of the bountiful resources on Earth. We will do amazing things more, but only if the first of those amazing things is to protect and re-think how we treat the greatest gift we have - Earth.<br><br><br>I would love to see a Kurzgesagt video about how to save Earth, and how much we owe our planet.

For instance, scan the dimensions of the cave and tell the robot to change an existing area withing certain parameters. This could go on four hours, days or even weeks before the need for another set of commands. (again, with well developed AI)<br>  \u00a0Once we have a good knowledge-base of the chemical makeup of the cave, we could develop a spay-on, protective layer if needed, to prevent exposure. ...probably polymer based but whatever is effective. This way we can have a much larger habitat than could conceivably be carried to Mars, with the need for only two artificial walls. At minimum, one for the entrance, exit and ventilation (if needed) and another to complete the ventilation cycle and/or to connect the devices that produce the atmosphere for the habitat and collect or evacuate depending on the needs of the inhabitants.<br>  \u00a0The Biosphere II experiments have been somewhat successful in teaching us how to make a closed cycle system using plants &amp; animals except that they massively screwed up by allowing the concrete to be exposed to the system which leached oxygen from the enclosure. Having the habitat deep under ground also mean less fluctuations in temperature and air pressure.<br>  I think simulating an earth environment in a Martian cave is the cheapest route with the least likelihood for cabin fever but it still poses challenges we haven&#39;t solved yet.", "comment_date": "2019-02-07T10:29:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nord Bjorn", "comment_text": "Respect for not stretching the vid to 10 min, Kurzgesagt! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "comment_date": "2019-02-07T10:26:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wild Boar", "comment_text": "NASA madness, let them go there :)  Those buraucrates cant get a base on Moon and want to start far out there, sounds real fishy, NWO depopulation agenda?", "comment_date": "2019-02-07T10:25:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "qnaman", "comment_text": "Why those people needs to be pure humans?

Go next down the comment section if you don&#39;t have much time.\r<br><br><br><br><br>I want to share my story with you. (the whole point of the comment is try to unite some people together)\r<br>At first I want to say that I believe that some people search for information because it maintains their worldview. There is a lot of reasons, but this is just one of them.  Many people know that science changed the world, it changes it right know and it will changing it in the future, and that&#39;s one of the reasons they are interested in science - because it can solve humanities problems. Many of those who have such worldview  face the one big problem - the information is not in the one exact place - it is scattered across the internet. To reach that knowledge you have to work hard, you have to visit a dozens of videos or websites to assemble the puzzle, so that the main picture will be seen clearly. For some topics the dispute is going, so, again, it is difficult to process all the opinions and arguments from both sides of dispute. And sometimes the information is basicly restricted. For example, I once tried to download a book from the internet, but I found that there is no free, or &quot;pirate&quot; version.\r<br>That&#39;s all above as you may already understand is a big problem for me. I am feel unfulfilled when I lack some essential for me information. Also, I have no much time to do all the things I want to do and at the same  time search for the information and it&#39;s evidence  literally for hours. I was recently pondering about why do popularizators of science just doesn&#39;t unite together and write a comprehensive book or article about, for example Evolution. How it exactly happens, the main misconceptions floating around it, all the evidence of it, the debunking of arguments against evolution, and debunking of counterarguments and so on. Why doesn&#39;t they just make a <b>one, comprehensive source of information</b> , and after that only adding a new &quot;patches&quot; as times goes on and new knowledge pops in. If they do so, everyone, creationist or evolutionist can see the whole picture, without struggling while searching for the information for weeks or even months and years. \r<br>So, I have also struggled a lot. And what I wanna do is to create a group on the internet to unite people. In this group they can search for evidence-based information all over the internet and then working together to make a comprehensive articles on different topics with all the evidence needed. I really believe that &quot;two heads is better than one&quot; (in my case, a few tens or even hundreds of heads is better than one)\r<br>United with someone, you can reach a bigger heights.

The survive-ability of any human on Mars, particularly in the early attempts, is , of course, doubtful.  Send older people.  Do not intend at first to return them.  Much of your provisions and supposition is based upon explorers going home.  Please forgive me for using cold logic, but that is an energy, equipment intensive,, uh,, dumb idea.<br><br>If money is the fuel,, and it most certainly is,, If it cost one dollar to get a human to Mars, the cost of returning that same one person is 7 or 8 dollars.  And ESPECIALLY in the earliest attempts, where a launch of 5 tons of beans could be done for 8 or 10 cents,, returning the &#39;used computer&#39; to Earth is impractical, expensive, unprofitable, and just plain wrong. Realistically look at the odds of success for either idea.  1/3 of all Mars missions have utterly failed,, that 1/3 failure rate will not magically disappear because now we have live humans aboard.  On the surface of Mars for an extended stay, i/3 to 1/2 of all explorers will die of a dust storm, a suit leak, fall from a cliff, a power coupling failure,,, ,, and then comes the big one.  Launching from Mars to return to Earth,, with zero support infrastructure in place on the ground.  Zero rescue possible.  Zero ground control.  Zero maintenance or repair facilities.   2/3rds failure rate minimum.   So look at the cold hard facts and statistics.  Under your plan there and back, if you send 6 missions of 5 people each.  a total of 5 to 7 people will ever make it home,, and those radiation damaged by 4 years of in flight and on the ground.  23 to 25 dead.   Under a no return plan, at 1/2 the cost, send the same 30 people,, but older explorers, 20 will land safely and 10 will still be alive and working 5 years later.<br><br>So, send older people.  Bone density issues, if staying, are a non issue.  Radiation and cancer are less risky for an older person. Tougher, mentally and physically.

The gravity well is just too small for a blue mars to last very long. Terraforming existing planetary bodies just isn&#39;t very efficient use of what&#39;s there. Venus could be terraformed much easier. Just block out the sun completely until it cools off, use the blocked sunlight to power operations in space, use the existing heat on Venus for powering air colonies (like geo-thermal generators), and then when its within range of earth normal, use the giant eclipser to artificially create a more suitable day/night cycle on the planet. But realize that Venus won&#39;t ever be a water world unless we smack it with giant snowballs. And whatever is wet on Mars will start to melt into space if we heat it up to earth normal. <br><br>It would be so much easier to build giant structures in space, use centrifugal gravity to simulate earth normal, and just nudge them out of the way of any incoming bogies, natural or artificial. Controlling a completely artificial environment is preferable to terraforming for human habitation, no quakes, no volcanos, &amp; if it&#39;s done right, no flooding. It&#39;s highly efficient, it&#39;s comparable to driving a car versus taming a horse. These planets are wild mustangs, you can break them, saddle them up, but they&#39;ll always be a little wild, naturally unpredictable &amp; perhaps desperate to reestablish the natural states that we&#39;ve found them in. We can do better than that. I&#39;m not opposed to going to Mars or Venus, I just see them more as a place of limited scientific research, and perhaps to make spare parts for space cities than places that need to be terraformed because keeping them terraformed will be nearly as hard &amp; expensive as terraforming them in the first place &amp; even then the environment will have its extremes, all the kind of things that create absolute disasters on earth. In space, the only environment in space we have to master is the heliosphere &amp; and there&#39;s plenty of things we can do, and relative positions we can park on in the solar-system where the future majority of humanity could orbit in extreme safety from the heliosphere.  &amp; as opposed to sending our best &amp; brightest to distant worlds, on world living is where they will very likely send people they can&#39;t stand.", "comment_date": "2019-02-05T13:52:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dark Star", "comment_text": "You must think we are all retarded.

Imagine nuclear bombs going off in the atmosphere no matter what you do. I hate this colonise space bull crap. It just makes people think theres an alternative after we destroy earth. We dont have to terraform earth. We only need to fix it, without earth we are all dead. There is no where else in the universe we can live besides this one beautiful blue rock. No one should ever think they can be absolved from sin by creating a place we can go that will absolve the sin of destroying earth. I hate you all and you should hate yourselves for making this video. No amount of dreaming will ever change the truth that earth is all we will ever have and we kill everything on it. We are next. When we all die something will take our place. Once all geothermal activity on earth ends all life in the universe will end will a saga in time that no one will be around to remember. Why do you think we sent a golden cd into space in case we are all destroyed by an asteroid. Just so some race out there knows we existed. Maybe theres nothing and its floating out there so we feel like we left something behind. Our entire species and 4 billion years to send a gold disk into space. Think about it science.

No civilization before us has ever succeeded. The arrogance to think we are the first people from Earth to do this. With how much time has passed, and all the great empires that rose and fell. WE, this generation, are the ones to piece history together, and colonize space. We should have been born into a colonized solar system already. NOBODY has ever made it off the planet? You can&#39;t believe people were just thumbing their ass for thousands of years on record and 100&#39;s of millions+ off the record. Applying a time line to the earth period, is also a fallacy. WE HAVE NO IDEA.<br>     Also, based on the simple facts of human behavior, If we could get there, we would. Greed, strategic position, ect. No country would hesitate. Whoever gets there first wins the Earth. You spend a few hundred million to get back trillions after some mining, but nobody does it? Stop. Nasa will just string this entire generation along for another 50 years, and repeat with the next generation. Passing the torch to Elon is just another reset. There&#39;s still people from the 60&#39;s waiting for the moon colony they were promised. Lack of funding is also not an argument. What&#39;s next? The ISS is blown up in a false flag, and &quot;sorry folks, it&#39;ll be at least another few decades.&quot; Meh. As long as the majority believes, the lies prevail. It&#39;s that simple. But it only lasts so long. When people wake up, we will either be free for the first time since our origin, or be totally destroyed. Which is more likely? There&#39;s a reason everything is dead around us.<br>     Now, I could have left it there, but I&#39;ll open myself to even further criticism. What are the reasons for our failure?<br><br>1. We always destroy ourselves with technology before colonization.<br>2. The Earth periodically brings everything to near extinction. Often enough to prevent our escape. And we&#39;re overdue.<br>3. We get invaded by hostile aliens.<br>4. We are not allowed to leave the planet by either aliens or God? either for our own protection or something else&#39;s. Similar to keeping a dog in a yard.<br>5. We are in a simulation that doesn&#39;t have the vastness of space programmed, and our limit is our immediate surroundings. Answer to Fermi paradox.<br>6. There is no space, because we are in an enclosed environment as shown in common flat earth models. Which also answers the fermi paradox.<br>7. The Earth is SO HUGE. And we share it with multiple intelligence&#39;s that don&#39;t want us to know, for many reasons, perhaps disease exchange. So our portion of Earth is basically like North Sentinel Island. So they had to lie about the Model which confuses flat Earthers.<br>    <br>     More, and maybe a mix of several. Either way. Which one helps you sleep better? It&#39;s picking your poison at this point.<br><br>     I WANT to be wrong. But I&#39;m not gonna hold my breath either. I wish everything was cut and dry, there were no conspiracies, and I can be immortal flying my own UFO around the cosmos. But unfortunately, this isn&#39;t a fantasy. You can either agree or disagree. But somehow I&#39;ll still get attacked lol. But don&#39;t worry. If we never go to or other planets. And you wake up one day feeling sorry, I already accept your apology. We&#39;re cool. If I&#39;m wrong, I hope you&#39;ll accept mine. :)", "comment_date": "2019-02-04T19:50:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u30c4Adorj\u00e1n Bal\u00e1zs", "comment_text": "Give them video games / VR , they will never be bored again", "comment_date": "2019-02-04T19:50:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "arcanics1971", "comment_text": "Well that&#39;s thoroughly depressing.

The problem with Mars is that, because it doesn&#39;t have an ionosphere, it cannot be terraformed. You would either have to create an artificial ionosphere which would be extremely energy expensive (but technically possible)  or create a series of habitat domes, which honestly would be better off under ground because they are going to need artificial lighting anyway.<br><br>A much better option would be Venus. Yes, this would actually be more difficult upfront than Mars, but Venus actually has more than one option. You can create cities in its sky where humans could where humans could live, and unlike Mars you can actually terraform its surface.<br><br>Venus doesn&#39;t have an ionosphere either, but it has a different reason for that. In the case of Mars, it used to have an ionosphere but when the core cooled down it ended. In the case of Venus, it has both a molten core and a molten surface. All you have to do to get the ionosphere going is to cool its surface which seems like a Monumental undertaking and it probably is, but at least that&#39;s possible to do which seems like a Monumental undertaking and it probably is, but at least that&#39;s possible to do.<br><br>The approach that I would take would be to intercept one of the many near-earth asteroids and as part of a long-term project outfit it with a series of thrusters in order to slightly alter its orbit around the sun. if you get the math right you can steer it into Venus. if you do this with more than one you can have one of them skim the atmosphere and another crash into the surface providing immediate Cooling. the seems sci-fi, but we have the technology to do this. <br><br> now, the stripped off atmosphere won&#39;t be significant enough and it will reabsorb most of its lost atmosphere over the course of a year.  however, in this window of time there would be just enough time to see the planet with a genetically modified cyanobacteria give an extra tools to survive the higher temperatures.  you might even throw in some halobacteria for good measure.  the difference between them being that cyanobacteria share a common ancestor with the chloroplasts of plants and halobacteria had an alternative mechanism of photosynthesis that made use of retinol.<br><br> in any case, with photosynthesis taking place on Venus and the temperature is cooled down we should be able to terraform the surface within a few Generations tops.<br><br>You could instead try to terraform more slowly from within a cloud city,  but the problem with this approach is that as the terraform continues your city will start to fall from the sky and given the number of generations it would take the odds of a future civilization willingly destroying their own civilization in order to make the surface of a planet Earth like is pretty low.<br><br> That all being said, I do think that underground Mars colonies are a good idea.

You are doing great and much needed job popularizing science!)<br><br>About the Mars base... you are right that it is a horrible idea, but it is very important for broadening our scientific horizons and having a better chance at unifying us as species (although Moon base should be a foremost priority for multiple reasons, mostly to significantly decrease the cost of the Mars missions and increase their payload). <br><br>The colonizers should expect this to be a one way mission. Also, one with likely a short life span due to harsh conditions. You have hinted this in your video, as well as the fact that there are plenty willing and qualified people who are ready to commit themselves to these conditions, so this is hardly an obstacle. <br><br>Energy wise, unless there is a drastic breakthrough that can compete with nuclear reactors they are the ONLY reliable source. Anything else at this point would be experimental and considered mostly for emergency situations. Nuclear fusion is relatively inexpensive, reactors can be sufficiently miniaturized to serve such remote outpost and made to be mostly fully automated. We can also send multiple reactors in advance of manned missions to wait for human arrival. They can be activated as needed, once the current reactor fuel supply has ran out (something tells me it would be easier to make them for a single use, for practicality and spent fuel utilization purposes).<br><br>Location of the base should obviously follow the water deposits, but to consider a base near polar caps is folly. Polar regions are significantly colder and would not allow for much of the surface exploration. Equator, on the other hand, may enjoy periodic shifts of temperatures above or near zero C&#39;, which would make surface missions much more feasible. I keep bringing up &quot;surface mission&quot; point, because the base itself and majority of the mission should be carried out below the surface. As you have mentioned as well, burying the base would offer protection against the elements and allow to build a much more robust outpost with greater flexibility and lesser risks at similar cost. While picking up the spot with natural caverns is reasonable, any custom tunnels for the base can be made in advance by robotic missions, controlled from Earth (yes, it will be much longer and likely more expensive than having humans on the ground, or in this case below it, we would save on building a temporary human habitat and risking lives). Humans are very fragile outside of our own environment, so we will need to go and stay deep (in hopes and as one of the primary goals to reach &quot;geothermal&quot;, for a luck of better word, heat source), even though it means limited &quot;outside window time&quot;, this is a necessity to insure a survival. If there are any reasonable hopes to terraform Mars there should be expansive subterranean presence in a first place.These tunnels can be expanded further by colonizers once initial bases are already established.<br><br>Fresh food - see the tunnels referenced above. The base/colony should be self-sufficient, with enough crew to overlap all required knowledge and skill multiple times, and in order to feed them a large system of underground farms will be required. Aside from conditioning the local soil to be useful, there is plenty of existing knowledge on how to create autonomous closed loop farms (e.g. &quot;farm in a box&quot;) with high crop yield, and advancing fish farms to a &quot;space&quot; level can be achieved when needed. There is also dehydrated space food rations that can be used for emergency supplies and to add a variety to the diet, that can remain fresh for years, if not decades, and which should be sent in abundance to the future base site well in advance of any human missions.<br><br>And last and not least - 3D printing of everything that can be achieved with local materials, or recycled from those brought in by colonists. This is equally a crucial point, since bringing spare parts from Earth/Moon is not efficient and ability by the Mars base to manufacture them can be a matter of life and death. Existing 3D printing technologies should be perfected to suit requirements and source materials on Mars.<br><br>So, to summarize - Moon base first (even fairly basic one, comparing to the one planned at Mars), then lots of robotic and cargo supply missions at a chosen spot on Mars and then we can send several groups of brightest and bravest from around the globe, to stake a new ground in the name of Earth :)", "comment_date": "2019-02-04T05:14:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SpEcTrAl Ops", "comment_text": "Sounds cool and all, but let&#39;s focus on beating t-series first.", "comment_date": "2019-02-04T05:14:00Z", "likes_count": 23}, {"comment_by": "One human", "comment_text": "This reminds me of the Mars One project.

Only governments and the richest can currently afford the launch costs of $3000 to $18,000 per kg. This cost must come down to something like $200 per kg. Space elevators, stratospheric\\ mesospheric launch systems ( both balloon based and with special aircraft designed to carry a spaceship ), and reusable rockets all can reduce the cost of sending people and cargo into orbit, which is mandatory if Luna, Mars, etc are to be populated by civilians.<br><br>Second - make spaceships with faster propulsion methods. 6 to 9 months for a one way trip to Mars would expose people to too much radiation and microgravity. What&#39;s the point of sending people to Mars if they&#39;re laced with cancer and unable to walk when they land?<br><br>Third- perfect survival and self sufficiency. Martians will have to grow their own food, build and maintain their own pressurized and radiation protected housing and other buildings, make water potable, etc. For the basic first phase, it might be better to send robots to build the first habitat and make it liveable, complete with food and breathable air. The robots could also start the basic infrastructures a Mars village or town would need, mainly communication dishes and radio towers to more effectively stay in touch with Earth.<br><br>Fourth- other things. Once the basics are sussed out on Mars, it&#39;ll be time to think of ways to make the martians more comfortable. One consideration is entertainment. Part of the Martian village or town can be equipped with recreational facilities, at first, it will likely just be a hangout area with games, books, tablets, and maybe a TV. Later, bowling alleys, fitness centres, pools, artificial lakes, etc could be added. Another consideration is making more workspace and making it more comfortable.

The elements are in the cave system because lava is produced deep within a planet then they are brought up by geological activity like volcanoes and lava caves to which they are deposited in.

I would not be surprised at all if a large amount of babies born on mars would be degenerated. All in all, chances of reasonable way of living on Mars are slim. Even if a meteor&#39;d hit earth, likely Earth would still be way more habitable than Mars. Human biology is not prepared for space, because it had no reason to evolve for that and our technology, as amazing as it is, is still nowhere near good enough to bring earth-like conditions to other places in the universe. The only other option would be genetical engineering (and we&#39;re still far away from that). All in all it&#39;s a bad idea and waste of money, trying to build human colonies on Mars. There are some technologies that if developed for the mission to Mars, could be useful for Earth, but why not just fund those because they&#39;re useful for Earth?

Many of you think that Venus is a hell scape with temperatures higher than melting point of lead, and you are right. However Venus also has an atmosphere 90 times denser than Earth&#39;s, which means that we can EASILY make habitats float there. Breathable air filled airships would float somewhere between 50-60 Km. And at these heights, specifically 55 Km, Venus is VERY much habitable. <br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKGREZs6-w&amp;t=1m05s\">1:05</a> &quot;Cold&quot; - Mars is extremely cold at nights and warm during days. Temperature usually goes between -90 C to +20 C. That is a 110 C temperature difference day and night, which would harm equipment. A Venus colony floating at 55 km would be at a comfortable 27 C degrees. And Venus doesnt have any temperature difference between day and night and it doesn&#39;t have seasons too. <br><br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKGREZs6-w&amp;t=1m50s\">1:50</a> &quot;Mars is Very Energy Poor&quot; - Venus is much closer to Sun which means you can harvest solar power effectively there, on top of that its dense atmosphere allows the harvest of wind power. <br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKGREZs6-w&amp;t=2m35s\">2:35</a> &quot;Mars&#39;s atmosphere is 1% as dense as Earth&#39;s&quot; - While floating at 55 km Venus&#39; atmosphere is roughly at the same density as easths. So you won&#39;t have to worry about your habitats exploding. While going outside for maintenance, the astronauts can just wear thin clothes that will protect them from scarce amounts of acid found in the air. They won&#39;t have to wear massive suits that will keep them pressurized. Remember the movie Martian? In the movie a small leak causes a whole part of the station to blow up. <br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKGREZs6-w&amp;t=3m03s\">3:03</a> &quot;Mars has deadly radiation&quot; - Venus&#39; thick atmosphere protects humans from solar radiation, on top of that Venus has a induced magnetosphere that further blocks radiation. <br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKGREZs6-w&amp;t=4m58s\">4:58</a> &quot;Martian poles has water&quot; - It is true that water is easier to come by at Mars, but that would mean your colony has to be near the poles, which barely gets any sunlight. So any hopes you had left for solar power is gone. Venus&#39; atmosphere has trace amounts of water vapour, which can be filtered. It will be slow, but colonies can recycle water so that there will be minimal loss of water. <br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKGREZs6-w&amp;t=5m40s\">5:40</a> &quot;Mars barely has any gravity&quot; - This is the most serious issue about Mars. We have barely any control over our biology. And our biology doesn&#39;t allow humans to live in low gravity environments for long. Some scientist believe that babies can&#39;t develop correctly in low gravity, which means a truly self sustaining colony, a colony where people can live and populate is impossible on Mars. Venus&#39;s gravity is roughly same as Earth&#39;s so none of these problems exist on Venus. <br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKGREZs6-w&amp;t=6m55s\">6:55</a> &quot;Narrow travel windows&quot; - You can travel to Venus every 584 days, while for mars you have to wait for 780 days.

However, with a proper mindset and analytical disposition, I can definitely agree with Kurzgesagt that colonizing Mars is probable. The calcium perchlorates near the Curiosity landing will be an especially complicated task in terms of isolating it from the colonization pods. However, through my own research in a biochemistry lab, I do think that it is possible for methanogens and haloarchaea to enumerate under similar conditions. As a high school student, I currently examining how these microorganisms utilize ClO4 in their metabolic pathways and then trying to genetically engineer them via site-directed mutagenesis to make them tolerant to the conditions on Mars. After this experimental process, I will then try to construct photovoltaic cells using the rhodopsin proteins found in specific haloarcaea (they act as optical light-harvesters) by immobilizing them into Au anodes. Despite the lack of solar UV emittance from the sun on Mars as well as dust storms, this method could significantly improve the quantum efficiency of the solar cells and hopefully lengthen the time of solar energy utilization on Mars (with the alternative usage of nuclear energy).

Undoubtably such would be a driver for expansion, but viewed through this lens I think expansion ultimately would be a crutch to our inability to live in a sustainable relationship with a planet; it would give us an easy way out of a do-or-die predicament, surely, but to simply continue unsustainable living on another planet would be through and through morally indefensible to me.

Even in severe dust storms solar cells will still produce a moderate fraction of their usual power. This means that a solar power array sufficient to generate return fuel will be able to provide plenty of power to just keep the crew alive in the event of a prolonged dust storm. There won&#39;t even be unexpected delays in the return flight so long as there is a BFR-full of fuel stockpiled.<br><br>*Windows will still be fine because radiation coming in at steep angles will pass through much more atmosphere, even on mars.

However, why could they not employ lead lined glass (or acrylic) as is used in nuclear storage facilities, medical rediological imaging, those large full body security scanners, etc, to provide windows? It shouldn&#39;t really be a weight issue if they&#39;re launching from the moon. Additionally having moon launched missions means that some thicker shielding for the bases wouldn&#39;t be too hard to send, either already integrated into the structure or as a sort of cladding that gets attached on during deployment (keep in mind that it&#39;s unlikely that a mars base would be deployed in the way depicted, but rather it would likely arrive in parts or partially disassembled on a larger more durable ship). The dust is definitely a major issue though, as currently our solution to dust problems on mine sites and such is to spray it down with water, which isn&#39;t exactly a viable strategy there. Finally, I&#39;m not sure what type of nuclear reactor you assumed they would use, but refueling every few years sounds like it&#39;s of the old solid state fuel uranium fission reactors we use now, which would really suck tbh. I think it&#39;s more likely that they&#39;d use either an array of RTGs or possibly a molten salt reactor as these are much more fuel efficient nuclear energy sources (and safer in many regards).

For instance, space habitats might be cheaper as we can start building them incrementally, piece-by-piece. As we did with the ISS, we can lego-build it. Another important aspect might be health: with space habitats we can decide how much gravity we want. There are cheaper techniques where we could wire up an initial station to a wire, and put a weight (or another small station) at the other end, have them spin around to reproduce gravity. Then we can move these pieces closer to asteroid belts to get resources. A planet on the other hand is a gravity-well: it will always cost us energy and money to get out of such wells.

In fact it is counter-productive. It takes just as much energy to go from Earth to surface of the Moon as to the surface of Mars. This is because Mars has some atmosphere and you can use it for aerobraking, while on the Moon all the breaking must be done by rockets only - super expensive<br>* there is no point in making habitats on surface of Mars due to radiation and temperature, so even first habitats will be underground with a few above-ground modules for sightseeing and transfer to surface. CO2 ice will just evaporate during the day. 2-3 meters of Mars ground easily reduces radiation down to the same as on Earth. Surface exposure for a few hours a day is negligible, unless there is a solar storm<br>* pressure is not a big problem, especially if habitats are pressurized to less that 1 atm. Tires on earth easily maintain several atm of pressure with tiny rubber walls and gas storage tanks can hold tens of atm of pressure easily<br>* solar power is going to be primary on Mars because it is much easier to send a 100 tons of solar panels and few inverters to Mars than invent a new nuclear reactor that will be able to work without maintenance there for years - we do not have such nuclear technology at the moment. Also do not discount wind - despite pressure being low, the wind speeds sometimes compensate for that and with proper design wind power could be competitive with solar and will at least easily cover the deficit during dust storms. Or we can just stop the methane conversion factory for the duration of the storm<br>* there is plenty of water deposits almost everywhere on Mars just a few meters deep, there are craters that are literally filled with water ice. this allows settling further away from poles and nearer more interesting mineral deposits and more optimal landing sites<br>* perchlorates are easily washable with water<br>* research so far seems to suggest that even lunar gravity is sufficient to make bodies work fine, it is microgravity (like almost zero) like on ISS causes big problems over long term", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T15:36:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Riccardo Panozzo", "comment_text": "Aqua Is coming", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T15:36:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aerozord", "comment_text": "I appreciate the heavy implication, if you don&#39;t have a moon base don&#39;t even bother with trying for Mars.\u00a0 Starting with Mars is a phenomenally bad idea", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T15:35:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rider Death", "comment_text": "We can&#39;t make our planet green,  how can we make mars?", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T15:35:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SUPERNIX", "comment_text": "so sending robots will be good option instead of humans", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T15:35:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Donal", "comment_text": "I love your videos so goddamn much it hurts :)", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T15:35:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cam-Asher Bond", "comment_text": "Here&#39;s a hard challenge for stubborn humans: save Earth.

Mars is covered with canyons and mountains that can easily protect you from the radiation associated with direct sunlight. As for your greenhouses, use plastics we&#39;ve already developed on Earth that screen out the harmful wavelengths and use strands resistant to radiation. <br><br>Second, you would not need &quot;constant supplies from Earth&quot;. This isn&#39;t the 1960&#39;s, we have 3-D printers that can take raw materials and create almost anything we need on Mars. New designs can be developed on Earth and simply uploaded to our colonists. <br><br>Third, while nuclear is the most reliable energy option, solar energy is quite plentiful on Mars. Though it does receive 40% of the sunlight Earth does, it also has a MUCH thinner atmosphere meaning more of the available sunlight actually reaches the surface. Dust storms obscure the surface for sometimes months on end, but enough batteries could compensate for that. Automation could produce literally endless solar panels providing all the energy our colonists need. Also, geothermal has hardly been ruled out as a viable energy source as the core of Mars is estimated to be 1230 C or  2246 F. While probably not enough to power a robust industry, it is certainly enough to heat our colonists through the cold Martian night. <br><br>Finally, perchlorate salts can LITERALLY be washed deep into the ground with water. Nitrogen can LITERALLY be pulled out of the air for crops. I get that you guys are trying to make an interesting video that draws a lot of attention, but please keep the sensationalism to a minimum.

I was writing this to a certain guy on Youtube I used to watch, thought I&#39;d share it with you too.<br>I used to work on a farm (and I still am) without any access to PC or a laptop, the only things I had were my old cell phone and my tablet. So I thought to myself &quot;Well, I can at least write something on the Internet.&quot; Thus, I began to start translating some books and stuff (there was a time when I used to make subtitles to the anime and TV shows). Wanna hear how many people have read it? 15.. On a fully fledged book I spent a whole month translating.<br>Depression took me over. I couldn&#39;t do anything for at least couple of months. Then, while surfing the net, I found these cool free books called Programming Intro, volumes 1 to 3. I didn&#39;t know anything about the author, but when I did I was shocked. It was a professor of one of the most prestigious universities in my country, and he was putting up his books _for free_! It&#39;s unbelievable!<br>I began studying from the basics. How PC works, CPU, RAM, Linux... Then it went to Free Pascal, assembler, ANSI C, how the net works, a bit of C++... Then 2019 took over. I was finally enjoying something. So many ideas were boiling in my head, I even wrote some lyrics to the future songs (wanna hear some? I could share with you on Twitter), took a month off and went back to my hometown.<br>When I got back, I knew exactly what to do. Spent some money on RPG Maker, saarched for some pixel art tutorials and then... I realized I couldn&#39;t do it. Never in my life I had thought I needed to draw something. It was too hard for me. Words like &quot;anti-aliasing&quot; sent me shivers down my spine. But I was still determined to make it. I took some all nighters, made the skeleton of my story, wrote down all the dialogues and jokes. I was basically ready.<br>Somewhere in the middle of making my game I got sick, my throat still hurts a bit, and what&#39;s more funny is that they&#39;re saying it&#39;s gonna be up to -45 C next week (when I neet to go to a dentist). I still kept going no matter what. Finally I was done. It was only a week but it felt like eternity. My old laptop was freezing like crazy (which isn&#39;t surprising, considering I haven&#39;t upgraded it in 7 years). What&#39;s more funny is that I couldn&#39;t even run my game properly (I guess my rocking 256 MB graphics card can&#39;t afford it), so it felt like a living hell beta testing it. I made an account on itchio, added some screenshots and published it. One person even downloaded it on the very first day and... that&#39;s it. No matter how many times I was begging in the youtube comments or on reddit no one was willing to play it.<br>And now I&#39;m writing this to you. I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m doing this. Maybe to share my experience or to relieve my burden just a little bit. It doen&#39;t matter now. I&#39;m gonna move out again in weeks and I don&#39;t even know when I&#39;m gonna be back.

I was raised as a round-earther from a young age. Since my first year in school as a five year old, I was taught by my teachers that the Earth is round. That the Earth revolves around the Sun. That this is the reason for day and night. Brainwashed. Today I am going to dispel belief in those theories once and for all. I would like to emphasize my word choice of \u201ctheory,\u201d because that is exactly what they are. Nobody that is reading this page has ever been to space. Nobody has seen evidence of any of these theories first hand. Why do we choose to believe the government on these matters \u2013 the same government that has lied so many times and in so many ways to us. This is the same government that just so happened to neglect to tell its people about the heinous atrocities committed in Vietnam. I want you, as readers, to view misinformation from the government with a cynical eye, doubting everything and anything you are told. So, enough about me. You are here to see my proof that the Earth is flat. I am going to start with the basics of the belief. First, we will start with the widely recognized premise that the universe was created in a massive explosion of highly compressed matter. \u00a0This explosion sent matter flying outwards at a rate of acceleration of exactly 9.81 meters per second squared. Now, how does this explain flat earth? Imagine a boat sail, pushed by the wind. Does the boat sail suddenly form a ball shape when blown on by the wind? No. It does bend slightly, but this is because of uneven pressure caused by the boat going slower than the wind that propels it. In the frictionless vacuum of space, it wouldn\u2019t bend at all. So, what would make one think that matter would suddenly and randomly form a perfect sphere? It simply makes no sense at all. Another thing that needs to be established is that there is no such thing as gravity. The feeling of so-called \u201cgravity\u201d is in fact the Earth accelerating constantly away from the center of the universe. This is similar to when you push on the gas pedal of your car and are pushed back in your seat. It is the same, familiar, principle of inertia on a macro scale. So, now to address the issue of day and night, as well as the moon in the flat Earth view. The first thing I would like to point out is that the sun is like a giant light bulb powered by ludicrous amounts of static electricity. It is a huge flat piece of tungsten that, as it moves through space (I will explain this later) rubs against the other particles and collects static electricity. There is enough static electricity continuously building up to \u201cpower\u201d the sun. One of the main arguments against this ideology is that the sun appears round to us. The answer is simple. Lightbulbs glow because of resistance built up by the tungsten filament. If you look closely at a incandescent light bulb, you will see that the area of greatest compounded resistance is at the center of the filament, where it is the brightest. The same principle applies to the sun. The spot of greatest resistance is the center, and it gets lower and lower as you move outwards, forming a circle of even radius that glows, hence the circular appearance. Now, how does this explain day and night? The sun was formed at the beginning of the universe just a split second sooner than the Earth, which means that it is further from the epicenter of the explosion. The Earth was formed immediately after the sun and directly between it and the \u00a0explosion force. The Earth shielded the sun from the continued push of the great explosion, and the sun continued to move at the same speed while the Earth accelerated towards it. It seemed like a collision was imminent. Luckily, though, the moon was formed behind the Earth and a little offset to the side. Now, as we all probably know, electricity of any kind moving through any material causes electromagnetic fields. The sun, with massive amounts of electricity moving through it, produces an equally as massive electromagnetic field. We also know that as easily as electromagnetism can pull something towards it, it can push something of the same charge away from itself. The moon is made of the naturally occurring mineral lodestone, which can be naturally magnetically charged. The moon\u2019s charge was opposite that of the sun\u2019s electromagnetic field. This caused the sun to push itself away from the moon and thus avoid the collision with the Earth. The sun would have sailed off into space, but the earth contains neutral ferromagnetic materials that caused the sun to be attracted to it. This caused the moon to stay close to the Earth as well. So, what happened next is what causes day and night, and the appearance of sunset and sunrise. The sun moved to the side of Earth and the Earth quickly accelerated past. The sun, now no longer shielded from the blast, got a boost of energy and accelerated upwards again, catching up with the Earth. Its \u201cfall\u201d from in front of the Earth gave it momentum that was then turned around, allowing it to accelerate faster than the Earth. Keep in mind that during this whole time, the sideways momentum of the sun caused by its disattraction to the moon is continuing. Once the sun passes the Earth, it again passes into its shadow and is no longer effected by the power of the blast. The Earth accelerates towards it, the moon pushes it to the side in a circle, always keeping the moon directly opposite of the position of the sun, and the cycle starts all over again, creating day and night. It is worth noting that the moon is made of a flat sheet of lodestone, and the circular appearance is caused by the circular beam of light let off by the sun. This is a similar effect to shining a circular spotlight on a flat wall. It makes a circle, not the rectangular shape of the wall. So now I have explained the basic mechanics of Flat Earth, but why would the government want to hide this from us? It is all based on crude oil. If you remember, back in the medieval times it was widely known that the Earth was flat. This is also the time when all machines were very simple and primitive. They did not use oil. The first machine to use oil was the simple steam engine. It used oil as a lubricant to ensure smooth operation of the pistons. The first steam engine is thought to have been invented in ancient Egypt, before the year 30 B.C. It was in practice a failure, but in principle it lived on. The technology seemed to stagnate for almost 1700 years until the first commercial steam engine was debuted in Europe in 1698. This is not to say, however, that the steam engine wasn\u2019t used between 30 B.C. and 1968 A.D. It was likely used in secret by European powers who, not wanting to reveal their advantage to rival countries, did not document its use. They likely would have quickly realized that as steam technology grew, so would the need for oil. Africa was already being looted for rubber necessary for war machines, and they realized that this would soon be the case for oil. Explorations by men such as Magellan and Columbus, were to find crude oil reserves, not just for the sake of sailing around the world Magellan quickly found that there were massive oil reserves in the ice caps that rim the flat Earth. (These ice caps make up Antarctica and the North Pole and circle all around the perimeter of the Earth, forming a massive ice wall. This ice wall does form a circle shape because of the concentration and qualities of the way heat spreads, so in that way the reachable Earth is a circle in shape) Countries knew that knowledge of this fact would make them rich and powerful, and did everything they could to keep it from others. Thus they invented the myth of the Earth being round. It is all a ploy to keep power in the hands of the governments in an age of oil dependency. The best way to keep people from finding out about massive oil reserves on the edge of the Earth is to make them not even believe in the edge of the Earth. This sham is kept up today, and will likely be kept up as long as possible by the governments, because to admit that they were lying for all this time would be a massive loss of face. Do you remember the Antarctic treaty signed by the 12 most powerful countries in the world in 1959? This wasn\u2019t just some inconsequential treaty about a barren plain of ice, but rather the most important economic agreement in the history of civilization. Want to go to the continent of Antarctica or the North Pole? You\u2019ll need a very hard-to-obtain permit for that. All because of the enormous greed of the leaders of our world.

Psychological evaluations. This is the most important part of the colonization effort. I would not want mentally unstable people and or incompetent people to colonize Mars. I think a potentially unique solution that we might just have in our lifetimes is direct neural interfaces. It could potentially lead to curing various mental illnesses and for maintaining people&#39;s sanity in space colonization efforts or for more efficient and superior education.<br><br>2. Nuclear power. If we ever develop nuclear fusion, it would make Mars colonization much easier as water can be easily broken down into oxygen and hydrogen, two things needed to ensure our astronauts can breathe, and terraform mars, and hydrogen which would fuel our rockets, land, and air vehicles, as well as our nuclear fusion reactors. We will need these if we are to terraform mars later. Plus fissionable elements are rare, expensive, and highly toxic.<br><br>3. Terraforming. Since Mars has a lot less gravity than earth does, we would need to encase Mars in a kind of airtight, world spanning greenhouse with orbital rings surrounding it to still allow for space travel and trade. This trade could also facilitate faster terraforming as the water ice and nitrogen brought from space. If we want to make Mars more like earth, we would have to make it more geologically active too. For this we could potentially funnel waste heat from our power plants and fusion reactors into the core of the planet. The planet itself could act as an impressive heat sink. <br><br>4. Mining. Dumping waste heat into the planet itself to stimulate geological activity would also strengthen mars&#39; magnetic field  which would mean that heavy radiation shielding could be mostly eliminated. Add to that reheating mars&#39; interior could also induce convection currents that would draw up all kinds of valuable minerals and ores that we could process for other purposes, which would leave asteroid miners to gather resources for other, more ambitious projects. Plus, mining on a lower-gravity planet is much easier than on a higher-gravity one. <br><br>5. Lower gravity adaptation. As far as we can tell, antigravity and or paragravity (gravity control) is simply impossible so we might have to go the transhumanist, augumementation route to adapt to changing gravity. We could start by creating a nanotech based process for making our bones and muscles resistant to degradation and or much denser and stronger. Plus we could go a step further and make ourselves much more resilient to cosmic radiation by increasing the amount of melanin in our skin or by other means.", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T14:50:19Z", "likes_count": 33}, {"comment_by": "Doge", "comment_text": "If Colonization on Mars would happen , i hope that no &quot;Red Faction events&quot; would happen", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T14:50:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Actar", "comment_text": "humanity just needs to cooperate.", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T14:50:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Flipinho alguma coisa", "comment_text": "cheguei antes do video ser traduzido. sou do Brasil e amo muito seu canal.", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T14:49:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u00c1rp\u00e1d Bl\u00e1zsik", "comment_text": "Please make a video on the colonization of Venus!", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T14:49:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mauro De Simone", "comment_text": "Doesn&#39;t seem like Mars is a good place to try to build a base.

They can be dialed up to any gravitational value (g) that we like (by centrifugal force), allow us to control the enviroment entirely and since we are standing inside a pressurized cylinder (on metal, dirt and whatever we need to recreate Earth&#39; climate at a small scale in an O&#39;Neill Cylinder), we are perfectly safe from deadly radiation (a surrounding asteroid shell might be a good idea anyway - just in case). Mars, if terraformed, might give us the living area of a bit less than the surface area of russia - but if we break it apart to get the raw materials for building O&#39;Neill Cylinders, we will get several deca-millions worth of earth living area (we&#39;re talking about quadrillions of people). No terraformed planet can rival that amount of living area, protection and comfort - no matter how close to Earth it eventually might be terraformed to.<br><br>Terraforming planets will probably be a prestige project for the wealthy, because in light of those space habitats, which are cheaper and easier to build, terraforming is a huge waste of raw materials. In comparison it will never be economically viable and takes ages to get it even vaguely habitable. I know people won&#39;t like that, but Space Habitat&#39;s like the O&#39;Neill Cylinder are just the logical way to colonize space effectively (another type would be a McKendree Cylinder - a truly huge structure that can harbor the population of an entire continent; millions of people and many times more massive than an O&#39;Neill Cylinder).<br><br>In a couple of centuries, most people will live in space habitats - and they will regard the concept of living on actual planets, as being rather odd and quirky.", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T14:18:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zenshy", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt is lv. 35 boss and The Infographics Show is lv. 1 crook", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T14:18:06Z", "likes_count": 30}, {"comment_by": "MISTEE", "comment_text": "I love things i don&#39;t understand because of my feeble mind kurgerzart  your vids are great", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T14:17:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ms10000123", "comment_text": "Why put down humans first?
