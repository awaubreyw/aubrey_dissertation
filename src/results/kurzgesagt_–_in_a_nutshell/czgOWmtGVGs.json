We&#39;re old.  We like traditions.  When we read scientific books, they used the style of BC (&quot;Before Christ&quot;) and AD (&quot;Anno Domini,&quot; in the year of our Lord).  As we got older, somewhere around 1980, the new style of BCE (&quot;Before Current Era&quot;) and CE (&quot;Current Era&quot;) was implemented in scientific publications, we think, by and for atheist scientists.  This expanded to archaeology, history, and apparently has slowly permeated all things academic. Since these new labels are concurrent with the calendaring system we use, nobody notices. But the newspapers don&#39;t seem to have adopted this so much, and the politicians aren&#39;t quick to change over either, and we think traditions have value.  If you asked 100 people, probably a lot of them would guess that the Holocene is a musical act with Selena Gomez.<br><br>2. We like smaller numbers.  Our generation probably wouldn&#39;t have generated the Y2K glitch if we didn&#39;t enjoy saving a couple of keystrokes here and there.  We don&#39;t want to tack a &quot;1&quot; onto the front of every year we write for the rest of our lives; we&#39;ll leave that to some future generation seven thousand years into the future and let that be their burden.<br><br>3. Just about any measuring system with a predefined origin or index value has some kind of logic to it; or it *should*.  Zero degrees Fahrenheit was a cold day in a certain town in Poland, according to an account we read, and normal human body temperature was almost 100F.  That&#39;s fairly logical.  Zero degrees Celsius/Centigrade refers to freezing water and 100C refers to boiling water at sea level.  These are important numbers to know for most of us in the same why that absolute zero is not, so Rankine and Kelvin are fine for certain scientists and the rest of us don&#39;t care and shouldn&#39;t care.  On the IQ scale, 100 is average -- no one has zero, no one has 300.  When we found out the credit ratings start at 300, we thought that was crazy --- but we had no input to its creation.  The very-recently-discovered archaeological find just doesn&#39;t work for us when concocting a new Year Zero.   Putting the index on (or probably near) Jesus&#39; birth seems fine to us, and we really don&#39;t want to wreck the calendar ship just to make buddy-buddy with the commies.  Atheists don&#39;t really want to kill us, commies don&#39;t really want to be friends, and changing the calendar or leaving it the same, is not going to change that arrangement.<br><br>4. If you want to go after the Gregorian calendar system, go for it; but, let&#39;s start with the weaker elements.  Why name the days of the week after sky objects and Norse gods?  Saturn-day, Sun-day, Mo(o)n-day, and then appeals to Tiw, Woden, Thor, and Frigg.

The original idea behind the calendar was that it started with the beginning of the Holocene, our current era. So H.E. can stand for Holocene Era, or Human Era. Adding 10,000 years to the calendar may seem arbitrary, but I believe it works. It does not really change the last 2020 years. It does not really require us to change our birth years. Instead of the United States being created in 1776, it would be 11,776. It would be inclusive of all civilizations. The Western, or Christian calendar is wrong. Jesus was not born in 1 AD (CE) or even 1 BC (BCE). The current evidence shows he most likely was born between 6 BC and 4 BC. The idea for the Holocene Calendar was proposed before new technology and information became available. Ice core samples have been used to place the beginning of the Holocene 11,700 years BP, Before Present, which is a set date of 1950. So the Holocene started around 9,750 BC. So it is a little off, but there are other factors to take into consideration. The oldest &quot;known&quot; proto-city, Jericho, was permanently inhabited probably no early than 9500 BC. And this is the earliest proto-city found, others came much later. The evidence for the Neolithic Revolution, true agriculture did not begin until after 10,000 BC. The same with domestication of animals, except for dogs. There is some scholars that believe that domestication of rice and the pig were earlier than 10,000 BC, but there is no physical evidence. It is hypothesized that it could have occurred earlier, but from what I have read the physical evidence for their domestication is after 10,000 BC. I feel that adding 10,000 years to the calendar would put it close to the beginning of the Holocene, before any true cities were formed, or even proto-cities, and before true agriculture began. I feel it gives us a little leeway if we find older evidence, but of course we could eventually find something older. It would, at least based on what we currently know, include all of human civilization, from farming and permanent settlements to today.", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T07:16:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bator Vator", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udc96", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T02:13:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LORD SOUL'DIER", "comment_text": "...well be dead by then", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T06:47:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LORD SOUL'DIER", "comment_text": "wow BLUE humans :0", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T06:46:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fred Weller", "comment_text": "Pol Pot tried that whole Year Zero reset.

And finished the 2nd. World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth.", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T20:27:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MightyMoose", "comment_text": "Life starts... humans evolve.. war... cycle begins again", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T20:42:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Titanic Big ship", "comment_text": "12 ,020", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T19:13:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "set speed", "comment_text": "predicting future is like using a engine that does nothing but waste energy. you, me no one living today will be alive that time. so why predicting the future when we can work our way out and make the future our selves?", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T16:56:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dayala Singh", "comment_text": "What is the building they&#39;re actually talking about<br>Edit: nevermind, it&#39;s G\u00f6bleki Tepe", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T14:53:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dayala Singh", "comment_text": "This is still probably my favourite kurzgesagt video.", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T14:51:27Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "\u0161u\u0161tar fuks", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czgOWmtGVGs&amp;t=6m34s\">6:34</a> bedrock is impossible to mine", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T14:31:48Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Lydiard91", "comment_text": "&#39;Christianity isn&#39;t relevant anymore, we should base our calendar on a 12000 year old temple buried for millennia instead&#39;", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T14:09:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marixell Reyes", "comment_text": "Owf", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T10:13:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anas Khairi", "comment_text": "Is our ancestors superhumans?

Those buildings show at least 13.000 years of rain water erosion. Also there is burnt ground layer, covering about 3/4 of the earth&#39;s surface, indicating a meteorite impact, that dates back to around 12.800 years ago. The impact crater was found a couple of years ago under the ice sheets of Greenland. The ground layer on top of that burnt layer, indicates an ice age that followed after the meteorite impact, that lasted till 11.500 years ago. I believe there was a more advanced human civilisation before the meteorite impact, that used those pyramids as energy generators by utilizing the flow and current  of underground rivers underneath the pyramids, and transforming the flow energy into electro-magnetic energy and then amplifying that energy. I think that meteorite impact was a global extinction event that almost killed off every species back then, along with almost all of that human civilization. Only few survived the impact and the following ice age. I believe this event set us humans back to the stone age and most knowledge, if not all, of advanced civilization was lost.

Here is how. We call a period of 10 000 BC to 1 BC 1st decamillennium and number years in it in chronological order. So it goes from 1 to 10 000. After year 10 000 goes year 1 of the 2nd decamillennium (same as AD 1). So we can say that we live in year 2020 of the 2nd decamillennium. It&#39;s the same as saying that we live in year 12020 HE but without needing a calendar reform. It&#39;s like we count years from the beginning of each decamillennium. Which may be a smart thing to do, by the way. Who said it&#39;s a good idea to have 5 digit year numbers? We can rewrite all the history literature for the previous decamillennium effectively fixing the issue with backwards running BC dates. I recently started a project. Address is holocene calendar org.

Spirituality does not need to go extinct in order for us to achieve greatness, we should embrace it, and steer it away from the controlling and repressive dogma&#39;s of certain religions. Spirituality and science are two sides of the same coin, mankind finding it&#39;s place in the Universe.

Our current, and  calendar, the gregorian calendar started in the year 1582 which means if we put our year 0 on that date we would be in the year 437 GE (Gregorian Era) and anything before that BGE (Before Gregorian Era) This way people wont have to keep changing the calendar farther back as research continues.

As well as killing the mega mammals and fauna of North America like the Mammoths, which were previously blamed on human hunting, which is total horse shit. There is direct evidence of this flood and we also have tons of independent stories and myths that depict a flood, like Noah&#39;s Ark and the Epic of Gilgamesh. Those individual myths are founded on a real massive flood. Plato said that Atlantis was city which flooded and was lost, and he said this occurred 9,000 years before what we now call 2,600 BCE. That dates the destruction of this so called lost city at around 11,600 years ago. Lines right up with this massive flood.

This is the start date of human civilization. This has nothing to do with humans as a biological species. It also doesn\u2019t matter that at some previous date, we lived in caves. To be a civilization, a society needs to make its own infrastructure (typically in a fixed location), not borrow something else. So ants, honey bees, and termites are really hive-style civilizations (anchored in the genome software, which determines major behavior categories). Being social is not what makes civilization, its building (which works a lot better if you happen to be social). When animals in a civilization are not cooperative, they are typically behaviorally decoupled in some manner that preservers the integrity of the entire civilization.<br><br>Second, this date is always understood as an approximate date.

Human history gets very murky before that point so most of the calendar would be really shittily defined, whereas our current spot for year 0 is well defined. It&#39;s good to have a starting point that&#39;s... actually at a specific event instead of some vaguely defined point. And what happens if we find some even more ancient ruins and discover human civilization stretched further back? Would we keep changing the dating system because of that?<br><br>2. We already have BC so that history would still be notated with a date. It&#39;s not as if that history doesn&#39;t exist it&#39;s simply notated differently in the calendar, and the people alive then have been dead for thousands of years so it&#39;s hardly some offensive thing. I just really don&#39;t see much of a point behind doing this.<br><br>3. The current scheduling is already culturally enshrined with cultural significance, what with 2016 Jokes, &quot;the eighties,&quot; &quot;the twenty first century&quot;, like extremely culturally enshrined around the globe, beyond the point of being connected with Jesus, so it would just be impractical to change it up when our current system is so culturally enshrined.<br><br>4. There are so many documents, legal, historical, monuments, etc that would need to be reworked, people reading documents or works or viewing videos that originated before this time shift would be confused as all fuck, and it would be extremely impractical, costly, and take a lot of work to try and change all the necessary legal documents and historical/informational/educational works, and would continue to be an inconvenience for a rather lengthy amount of time.<br><br>5. You would never get the whole global community to agree to this so it&#39;d be a gagglefuck. You certainly wouldn&#39;t be able to implement such a system in the US with the Republican party certain to view this as an inexcusable attack on Christianity, or other countries with strong Christian presences, and with the vast number of countries in the world a huge number of them certainly wouldn&#39;t agree to this. It would be impractical to get the global community to do this, particularly when a lot of countries already have their hands full with real issues and wouldn&#39;t want to deal with the upset caused by them needing to change all of their documents and shit.<br><br>The whole thing just seems like a really really impractical symbolic gesture with no real tangible benefits, and the only people who would actually find anything of value in this policy are people with some OCD fixation on getting a specific dating for humanity or anti-religous people who want to shit on Christianity, and neither of those things are worth the inconvenience and upset such a change would require.", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T20:25:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Profligate", "comment_text": "came here from deep town", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T19:47:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "axel9641", "comment_text": "The Olmec culture in South America?\ud83d\ude36", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T19:06:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryan White", "comment_text": "wish you guys would make a poster showing from 0 all the way to 12017 or maybe past that with predictions and have it illustrated with facts and notes, i would happily pay $200 plus for that, hopefully it is less but i know the color, ink, paper, time, work would be expensive", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T18:53:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Hinkley", "comment_text": "You should put jokes in your calenders", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T17:45:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stellarion Prime", "comment_text": "we use this calender because jesus was not the son of god but the ``son`` of LOVE .... or is Love = God ???? well well .... you know with out desire (love) nothing would happen , no one would do anything ... not even the START OF CIVILISATION.", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T12:42:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Based keb Keb", "comment_text": "The first city was uruk in presented in Iraq <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czgOWmtGVGs&amp;t=3m31s\">3:31</a> and the first civilization was in Iraq ", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T07:52:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex197914", "comment_text": "Wow calling for a new year Zero , anyone remember how the last year zero that was applied went for humanity in Cambodia.", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T06:00:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vast Blu", "comment_text": "I wonder what a caveman what think of me playing games and sticking some sort of tablet in my face", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T03:29:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michele Fornovo Tapia", "comment_text": "I love these videos even more than those stupid biased History Channel documentaries.", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T02:57:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patralgan", "comment_text": "We could make a religion out of this.", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T00:40:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Barr", "comment_text": "Gobekli Tepe?", "comment_date": "2017-06-08T22:26:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tracy Brown", "comment_text": "Any1 else notice the clock from don&#39;t hug me I&#39;m scared", "comment_date": "2017-06-08T20:42:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tisha W", "comment_text": "Who&#39;s watching in 1,000?", "comment_date": "2017-06-08T19:20:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Master Yoda", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czgOWmtGVGs&amp;t=3m11s\">3:11</a> oh god its the clock from the creepy ass show called Don&#39;t Hug Me Im Scared", "comment_date": "2017-06-08T18:15:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dany_rulez", "comment_text": "I love the song in this part <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czgOWmtGVGs&amp;t=2m12s\">2:12</a>", "comment_date": "2017-06-08T17:11:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WHEN THE", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czgOWmtGVGs&amp;t=3m07s\">3:07</a> Stay out of this, creepy clock person from DHMIS!", "comment_date": "2017-06-08T04:55:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elie Rathon", "comment_text": "I love Kurzgesagt with all my heart.", "comment_date": "2017-06-07T22:16:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex", "comment_text": "If we find a site older than G\u00f6bekli Tepe, what do we do?

Calendars have to be useful for a long time, but the pace of scientific discovery of past events makes the &quot;beginning of the Human Era&quot; an unfixed and constantly receding target.  Just look at our current standard calendar - it was theoretically supposed to target the birth of a single individual, but we know now to an absolute certainty that if that individual&#39;s life story is to be believed, it is completely impossible for the identified year 1 to be the first year of his life.<br><br>The problem you&#39;re trying to solve here is, to put it simply, that stupid people don&#39;t fundamentally grasp how quickly technology progresses in the modern world as compared to how it&#39;s developed over the total course of human history and prehistory.  Changing the calendar is certainly an option for fixing that, but it seems like it would be better to ensure that everybody gets properly educated.  It might not be the absolute pinnacle of &quot;cultural sensitivity,&quot; but I find reshaping our mechanical metrics to accommodate the subjective egos of others distasteful.  We&#39;ve got a reasonable calendar to work from and people have an intuitive grasp of its scope, so leave it alone.  If that means that significant achievements happened in 10,000 BCE...okay.

They are only prehistoric, nomadic or illiterate. They have adapted to their environment (both natural and human) successfully to a greater or lesser extent just as civilized and historical people do.

It is the oldest one we know about, but what are the chances that we have found the first? There may be other, older sites that have yet to be discovered, and even THEY probably wouldn&#39;t be the first. Evidence of the first large scale human engineering project most likely has not survived to modern times. It was made of material that just didn&#39;t survive this long (like wood) or was completely destroyed by time.<br>    Most of all, this shows that people already knew HOW to make large long lasting. Most likely the first attempts to build on this scale failed, because the people did things that didn&#39;t work. This also means they were communicating well. These attempts would need to be recorded and the reasons for the failure investigated to avoid repeating mistakes.<br>   By the time this &quot;temple&quot; was built humans already knew how to build it.<br>    On top of that, why are these old archeological finds associated with religion? My nephew, at the age of 3, made an observation that blew my mind. We were looking at an old Native American site and they had these little animals made from grass that had been found in a cave. The label said they were used in religious ceremonies to help bring a successful hunt. My nephew called them &quot;toys&quot;.<br>    This got me to thinking. The site had been abandoned hundreds of years before Columbus as the climate changed. The people didn&#39;t all die. As the site became unproductive the people living there would have packed up and moved away. <br>   Stone aged people do much the same things as people do today when they move house. They pack up what they want to keep and give away or throw out those things they don&#39;t want to bother taking with them.<br>    Important religious artifacts would surely be some of the things you&#39;d keep, but the toys your child has out grown would be left behind.<br>    Is it so hard to imagine a man or woman taking the time to craft something just to see the delight in their child&#39;s eye when presented with the present? How much money do you spend on cool toys for your kids?", "comment_date": "2017-02-21T08:43:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abe Brunka", "comment_text": "fuck year 0 i like bc way more", "comment_date": "2017-02-21T07:53:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "n.steam", "comment_text": "This is about as useful as &quot;decimal time&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-02-21T04:09:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zack", "comment_text": "This had me sold to buy that calendar at the end.

If the calendar has a &quot;human era,&quot; I think it would be reasonable to begin the era at the beginning of humans, not stone temples. I feel like the date was chosen for the sake of ease of transition from the Gregorian calendar, but I don&#39;t think that should be valued over accuracy. Just like you said, historical ignorance can be propagated by calendar systems, specifically the dates at which they start; one that not only starts 12,017 years ago but uses the term &quot;human era&quot; seems like it might cause even more historical ignorance. Humans (i.e. organisms capable of producing fertile offspring with modern humans) likely began as early as over two million years ago. You actually made an entire video on the true chronological scope of humanity, and how for nearly all of human history, we were just bands of traveling hunter-gatherers and fishermen. So should we just make this year 2,252,017 HE? Well there are three big problems with that: 1.) We don&#39;t, and can&#39;t, know exactly when the first hominid who can produce fertile offspring with modern-day humans, at least at our current level of scientific ability. 2.) Even if we pinpoint that &quot;first human,&quot; we would eventually need to move the date further in the future, as eventually that &quot;first hominid&quot; won&#39;t have been able to produce fertile offspring with future humans. 3.) It is impractical to use a calendar with so many digits.<br>So what should we do? Well, I say just stick with the Gregorian calendar because it is what&#39;s easiest and most accurate (except Jesus of Nazareth was really born closer to 3 BC).", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T17:13:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stefano19827", "comment_text": "CORRUPTING SCIENCE FOR POLITICAL AGENDA IS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T16:49:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stefano19827", "comment_text": "nice animation<br>is there any actual proof of what you are blabbering about?<br>where is this &quot;first temple&quot; ? <br>this is why you are so despicable. corrupting science for political agenda is a crime against humanity", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T16:49:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stefano19827", "comment_text": "what about no?<br>try to focus on something meaningful you globalist scumbags", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T16:45:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liquid 4", "comment_text": "minoan masterrace!", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T16:40:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "skygh", "comment_text": "Sure I get it but couldn&#39;t this cause a world wide shortage of ones?", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T16:39:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I.M Gurney", "comment_text": "Kurgesagt, I&#39;m sure your capable of expanding your desire to restructure, any other suggestions?", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T16:04:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Game Empire", "comment_text": "welkom to the year 12017", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T15:58:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "holstered boar", "comment_text": "Nice DHIS reference", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T15:44:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rama", "comment_text": "Who&#39;s watching this in 12017?", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T15:25:58Z", "likes_count": 1254}, {"comment_by": "Ilya", "comment_text": "\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u0441 12017!", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T15:13:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Icas", "comment_text": "Who&#39;s watching in 12,017?", "comment_date": "2017-01-01T14:54:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GerikDT", "comment_text": "There really is no need for this.

According to H.E., Jesus was born around the year 9,996 (assuming the correct year of His birth is 4 B.C.E.). Everything fine.<br><br>Personally, I agree that some events in history before the time of Jesus could be best described in H.E. (e.g. the foundation of the Roman Empire happened in 9,973). However, after the time of Jesus, events could be best described with the C.E./A.D. (e.g. instead of saying that the fall of the Western Roman Empire happened in 10,476 we could simply say that it happened in 476). In other words, we can use the H.E. for events before the time of Jesus, and during and after His time we can use the normal calendar again. <br><br>Just sayin&#39;", "comment_date": "2016-12-24T01:54:09Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Francis", "comment_text": "WOW YOU GUYS ALWAYS GET SO MANY LIKES IT IS CRAZY", "comment_date": "2016-12-24T00:24:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cartman4wesome", "comment_text": "So Jesus was born in the year 10K?

Why truncate it to 10,000?? For easy calculation? For fear that adding a weird number like 12,000 would cause even more confusion and polarizing people hence rejection? If these are your reasons behind the change of 12,000 to 10,000, then you ARE being DISRESPECTFUL towards our true history. <br><br>You just change it at will, how is this being scientific? or standardized?

If something were to go awry, the fan would lose power, causing the plug to melt, draining the core, and preventing an accident. Similarly, if the core were to overheat, the plug would melt, and the fan would not be able to freeze the plug, therefore draining the core and preventing an accident.

I have been thinking about this topic for several years now about proposing an alternative benchmark based on using a more universal achievement of humankind, such as the 1st system of writing instead of using the outdated BC &amp; AD religious system introduced by the Romans. I 100% agree w/you that our current year scale benchmark needs to be changed to a more metric like system, instead of using the more imperial system of using a possibly controversial religious event not accepted by everyone living on this planet. I mean, come on! The fact that Jesus Christ was born several yrs before 1 CE already meant that the current system is utterly broken. However, instead of using a structure as a benchmark, why not use the 1st writing system? After all, the way we receive our history is through years &amp; years of documentation.

Where I understand the idea that of changing the existing calendars to reflect the start of what some scientists may believe humans first started to build larger structures and an age near the start of technological growth. However, has those dates been definitely pinpointed; for example, if those dates have not been exactly calculated to the day or are we just arbitrarily adding ten thousand years for the sake of rounding.<br>     Given the inaccuracy of just arbitrarily adding ten thousand years to the calendar, would theoretically eliminate the identification of BC/AD, BCE/CE. However,  we must also realize that the changing from the standard model of BC/AD to BCE/CE was purely out of political correctness, and irrelevant to what anyone traditionally called those periods; thus, it wouldn\u2019t matter what you called it those periods, it would still be a reflection of before and after a specific moment of time.  Where current calendars divide those periods on a  clearly defined on a specific moment, not a random date. Furthermore, even if we did change to the proposed calendar model how would we define moments that happened before year zero.  The answer would likely be by giving those moments an identifier similar to that of the traditional BC/AD, thus we would find ourselves in the same predicament.  <br>     Don\u2019t get me wrong, I personally love this channel, and fully appreciate all the work and contribution it offers our world.

These issues include:<br>The Anno Domini era is based on an erroneous estimation of the birth year of Jesus. The era places Jesus&#39; &quot;birth&quot; year in 1 BC,<br> but modern scholars have determined that he was born in or before 4 BC.<br> Emiliani argues that replacing it with the approximate beginning of the<br> Holocene era makes sense.The &quot;birth&quot; of Jesus is a less universally relevant epoch event than the approximate beginning of the Holocene era.The years BC are counted down when moving from past to future, making calculation of time spans difficult.The Anno Domini era has no year zero, with 1 BC followed immediately by AD 1, complicating the calculation of timespans further.<br>Instead, HE places its epoch to 10,000 BC. This is a rough approximation of the start of the current geologic epoch, the Holocene (the name means entirely recent). The motivation for this is that human civilization (e.g. the first settlements, agriculture, etc.) is believed to have arisen within this time. &quot; - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar</a><br>And we just have to add 10,000 Years to our System.", "comment_date": "2016-12-08T07:36:29Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Izanagi Izanami", "comment_text": "awesome content guys keep it up", "comment_date": "2016-12-08T07:36:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohamed Nasser", "comment_text": "i would like the video twice if i can", "comment_date": "2016-12-08T07:35:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zsombor Toth", "comment_text": "the pyramids are older than 12,000", "comment_date": "2016-12-08T07:34:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Red Guy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czgOWmtGVGs&amp;t=3m08s\">3:08</a> time is a ruler to measure the day", "comment_date": "2016-12-08T07:33:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nightfall Shadow", "comment_text": "America would never change the calander because 42% of our country&#39;s citizens and 99.9% of our government is creationists or pretend to be because JESUS!!!!!!!!! and the world is only 4000 years old as far as they are concerned.

It is a timeline in western culture that marks the period where Rome eventually would fall, where empires crumbled in favor of new ideas and new ages of progress in a world where said empire was already stagnating to the point of no recovery.  In the last 2016-17 years we have had more progress accomplished than the entirety of the ancient world from 12,000 years ago to that point in time (say what you want about the ancient Greeks supposedly discovering steam, they had no idea what to do with it beyond &#39;oh look, a pretty toy,&#39; and still relied heavily on lesser metals like bronze and iron, making the point moot).<br><br>I encourage the current era system, the same way I encourage the Chinese and their year system.

After the Ice Age ended (roughly 12,000 years ago, the exact same time that this site is dated) there was massive flooding and cataclysm as the ice sheets melted. This would have erased all evidence of advanced civilization before the flood.

Seth lived 105 years and begot Enosh&quot;, etc. etc.<br><br>So when you take all of that biblical text and you add it up, it comes to around 4000 years BC when the Earth was created. Plus another 2017 years and you get an age of the Earth around 6000 years old.<br><br>People like to laugh at that, but the simple fact is that it&#39;s what&#39;s recorded in the Bible. So Christians like myself who have faith in the Bible do not accept the ages put forth in this video.<br><br>The other problematic issue is that Paul said in Romans 5 that it was through the sin of one man that death came to all people and likewise through the resurrection of Jesus that life is brought to all people. Therefore the geneology from Adam to Christ is an important one for theological reasons.<br><br>&quot;Well you&#39;re just anti-science! anti-fact&quot; \u2014 Not at all.

Our calculations of time are constructs we created to assist our lives. Whatever we call the current year doesn&#39;t matter: 2016 or 12016. It still means this year. I don&#39;t think that simply changing wjst we call the year would accomplish this &quot;change in perspective&quot; that&#39;s intended. People who know anything about ancient history have an idea about the actual timeline of humanity. Most people know that civilization existed before what we currently call 0. A change of perspective requires much more than a change to the calendar. Personally, I am ambivalent towards this idea. If it&#39;s what people want, fine. If not, that&#39;s also fine.<br><br>P.S.

You have to understand that Social Sciences are based on the human on different orders, a subject that must be studied from different lenses than the ones used in the exact sciences. That being said, this is kind of ridiculous, really. We are doing exactly the same defining the year 0 here or there. Why? Because it is arbitrary. The building of what we think might have been a temple can&#39;t be described as the origin or starting point for humanity. There are several problems with this. In the first place, we don&#39;t know exactly if it &quot;started&quot; ten thousand years ago or nine thousand years ago, or eleven, etc. We have approximations that, let me comment, are built mostly upon the work of Social Sciences, not STEM. That means it can&#39;t be calculated very specifically, as we tend to actually look at the processes more than a mythical origin. That brings us to the second issue: We don&#39;t need a starting point from zero, to be honest. We can&#39;t, actually. Why is the first temple an origin? Why couldn&#39;t it be the  &quot;origin&quot; of the people who made it? Why is a building the starting point, why does that represent humanity, and not other practices? Why it doesn&#39;t start in the first human burials, for example, or the creation of the first tools? And, if a building does represent the starting point of humanity... how do we know that this is actually the first one? What if we discover an older one, since many of these discoveries are fairly recent?<br>The third point is that humanity did not develope in one &quot;line&quot;. We didn&#39;t built, farmed or develope science at the same time. Rome, Greece, the mesopotamian kingdoms, the Incas, Aztecs and Mayans did not develope &quot;civilization&quot; at the same time. They can&#39;t even be easly defined as Civilization, as all of them had different characteristics. The Incas for example never discovered or invented the wheel. Where they &quot;less advanced&quot; or &quot;late&quot;? No. They didn&#39;t need it. Their History started in another moment.<br>Making a new Universal Histoy starting point older than the Anno Domini is, in some aspects, good.

We can use things like sci-fi, but most of sci-fi is already just about possible with effort - the things that aren&#39;t are considered fantasy by serious writers and used as such. Even living in space will become a relatively bland engineering challenge once we have flexible industry there.<br><br>How &quot;sci-fi&quot; a culture is from our current reference has nothing to do with how a society functions and where it&#39;s going, and living in a future culture will never <i>feel</i> sci-fi except to the previous generation. So for instance, smartphones were a complete right-angle for the most part to a fully connected society - we have them, but they aren&#39;t used for the reasons we expected. There are uses for every single technology we&#39;ve gushed over that we never anticipated or if we did anticipate were misunderstood, either as too terrifying or too unlikely. So the prophecy we try to put sci-fi to work on is and has been mostly smoke and mirrors. It&#39;s 100% confirmation bias to pick out the ones that got it right and say &quot;Hey, technology is a ramp we can go up, and sci-fi leads the way!&quot;<br><br>Why is it that we have to be impressed by our past if we have no idea how impressive or terrible our future is going to be?

This pseudo science and evo-babble is very tired, and I can&#39;t wait for video makers to fine a new narrative to replace this dead one. Why should the unproven idea of one man be the basis of how calendars are re-calculated?<br><br>This video is correct about one thing; it would change the way people think about time, in this case, in a completely wrong way. We are in 2016 because that is how many years it has been after the birth of Jesus Christ. The way we count the years is very significant and related intimately with the truth about how the world was made, and who we are. This is why &quot;scientists&quot; today are so insanely driven to remove every reference to Christ, from change AD and BC to &quot;BCE&quot; and other brainwashing tactics so that no one believes in the actual history of the world. Having the date as 2016 is a constant reminder of Christ, if only on an almost subliminal level.<br><br>They want a &quot;New History&quot; to replace the true one. It is one that can never be proven and so anyone can simply adopt it without any evidence, and if you question it, you will fail your exams and be denied &quot;higher&quot; education. There is no need to make our past &quot;more impressive&quot; if you are not impressed already, there is something wrong with your sense of scale. All cultures are not equivalent, and some matter more than others.This is demonstrated by the exclusion of the Tabernacle in the Desert after the Jews left Egypt, a central part of history, and many others that are at the least, interesting.<br><br>Changing the way you calculate the date does not make the truth go away. It does not make evolution real, and does not remove the fact that there is a God, he made the universe and man, exactly as described in the King James Bible. Biologists and physicists who look at how nature actually works come around to understanding that there is <i>no way</i> our existence is a random event, and the deeper they look the more they are convinced that there is a creator. This is highly significant, because the thinking of some (mostly celebrity) scientists is held up as the way most scientists think.
