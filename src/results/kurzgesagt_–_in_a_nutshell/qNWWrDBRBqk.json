And I know I am 4 years old on this video sorry for that one.<br><br>Before watching this video if someone asked do you believe all species should be saved and all species have inherent value in simply being not extinct? What would have have said and why? After watching the video would your opinion and answer to this question change or stay the same why would it be that way?<br>In the United States of America \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 the endangered species act says that a species is valuable just because it is. All endangered species in the USA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 should be saved from extinction. The US government even gives funding to save species internationally with the understanding you cant save everything. There\u2019s a species of parasites that was on  the Californian Condor a bird that almost went extinct only a few Californian Condors were left at one point. Conservationists brought them all into captivity. In doing so they found a species of harmless parasites that ONLY lived in the backs of the Californian Condor. However that wasn\u2019t known at the time (I think). In doing so the conversationists made that parasitic species extinct.  Would they have done anything different if they knew it was harmless and only lived on the backs of the Californian Condor? One has to wonder if the species would still be around today had they had known it was harmless and only found on the backs of the Californian Condor? For sake of not feeling like I left facts out it\u2019s almost certain that both the parasites on the backs of the Californian Condors and the Californian Condors would be extinct had the Californian Condors not been brought into captivity. There\u2019s another thing I want to tell you about there\u2019s a species of fish and a species of parasite and some insects near both. (I don\u2019t temper where this is what the fish insects and or parasite is but it\u2019s all real) What do they all have in common? Remove one and they all die!  The insects are infected by the parasite that parasite makes the insects jump into the river to get eaten by the fish the fish poop out the parasite and round the cycle goes. It\u2019s estimated that the parasite infected insects provide around 80% of the fishes food. I could be wrong but the fish I think are food for other things as well. Some other questions I want to ask you. The parasites in this video are living species the endangered species act says all species should be protected because all species are valuable simply because they are what if these species were in the US how would they be affected by the endangered species act? (Let\u2019s assume it still got passed for this first question) Do you think if they were in the US and native to the US they would have had still passed the endangered species act in its current form? If not do you believed they would have passed it at all? Do you believe that if they had passed it in its current form anyways they would turn a blind eye to the extinction of them? Before reading this comment but after watching this video if someone asked do you believe all species should be saved and all species have inherent value in simply being not extinct? What would have have said and why?

In higher income countries, I suspect that the vaccine will have some amount of donations, especially for health-care workers, but I doubt it will be entirely free. Since it seems that private companies, probably being backed by the government, will be making it, they will need to make a profit since something of this scale being donated would cripple the company forever, despite the insane amount of PR they would get. All in all, I think that the vaccine would have an even higher amount of medical donations, as places across the globe, including some of the high-income countries, will require the vaccine to be administered to the populous.", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T00:47:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cringe", "comment_text": "&quot;We declared war on them, pleading to destroy them by 2020&quot; <br><br><br>2020: Aw man, there goes N.T.D. well we still have other options.", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T22:41:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "parni playz", "comment_text": "Us in 2020 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>C R O N A             V I R U S", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T17:54:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bbtmr", "comment_text": "bro @DailyStuff was right we should\u2019ve stayed at home", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T16:43:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caleb C.M", "comment_text": "i really think the most powerful creature is parasites", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T15:01:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alvaro's cancer \u0647", "comment_text": "SHOULD I BE WORRIED???

Often we see in news mostly worse things happening. Media represents things overly exaggerated like we are not progressing, things are going worse, everyone is evil or the world is going to end (2012?). But watching your videos in the middle of this representing topics not as beings bound by nation or race but beings representing humankind as a whole and representing a very unbiased point of view is just something we just don&#39;t get to see nearly everywhere else. I feel like if our community just stops differentiating over race and nations but rather move as a whole human community then who knows what we might be able to achieve. We need more people with an open mind like you guys.<br>Hope you will read it one day.<br>Thank you! &lt;3", "comment_date": "2017-05-07T04:14:30Z", "likes_count": 380}, {"comment_by": "The Charizard", "comment_text": "if i saw that blister on my leg then i would just cut my damn leg off", "comment_date": "2017-05-06T19:17:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Yanchev", "comment_text": "Its really sad that us, the bulgarians got weakened so much :( But its history and again, its going to be in my history horror forever.....", "comment_date": "2017-05-06T17:07:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tony", "comment_text": "I feel like I learn more from your videos than I did in high school", "comment_date": "2017-05-06T16:58:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shay Heist", "comment_text": "Why do you love Ducks?", "comment_date": "2017-05-06T09:19:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nikola Canov", "comment_text": "how can i know if i have ntd", "comment_date": "2017-05-06T08:56:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PopTartNeko", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNWWrDBRBqk&amp;t=2m24s\">2:24</a> Yikes.
