But now the caprock has several holes, filled by permeable sands -- the permeability of sand being part of the reason it works for retrieving oils and gases in fracking in the first place. It might not escape within the lifetime of the billionaires doing the fracking. But it will escape eventually. And because the fluid contains anti-bacterial substances, it cannot be naturally percolated by bacterial digestion as it rises, which means it cannot be fully purified via natural means either, not just by treatment plants. Eventually, it will rise into our groundwater and people will start dying en masse.

On top of that I even worked in the industry hauling what we called produced water basically the end result and thank god I was careful around it. my brother was on a fracking sight with a buddy when a hose broke lose pumping that water and it was only a second before it auto shut off but managed to quickly drench his buddy in god knows what they don&#39;t even tell us what&#39;s in there just call it produced water and he was rushed to the shower unit and had it all off in less then 3 minutes he went home fine and died that knight of unknown reasons.

I think none .  I have worked on 70psi and that was tuff. You see what a fire hose can do at 120 psi. Gas line at 200psi will pop threw a thin wall of a pipe like nothing.  A 700psi gas transmission line will tair a steel pipe wide open starting at a defect,  defective weld, or thin wall from corrosion or ware. It will literally tair a long section of pipe.

If a well needs to be fracked to make it flow there is really not enough oil or gas accumulated there to make it profitable &amp; what is there is better left there. Then there is not enough pressure for the oil or gas at the bottom of the pipe of the frack job to make it into the pipe to pump out, while the bottom side opens deeper &amp; the top side liquids drip down to the bottom. If it is a large hole full of liquid, then pumping material into the hole falls to the bottom &amp; traps the fluids at the bottom side. So fracking a full hole doesn\u2019t benefit anything, but fracking outside of a liquified hole might open another draw point to that hole &amp; spread the level lower &amp; to other places underground. Drilling through a water table can not create a seal with the cement, the bottom side under the water table fills with water &amp; dilutes the mix. Then the frack job can crack the seal around the pipe, and open the Geological spaces between Oil &amp; Gas bodies &amp; the body of underground water if too close to begin with. Contamination of large water tables &amp; underground water supplies makes it not worth drilling at those locations. Then there is the fact that Oil &amp; Gas can not compete in open free markets against better forms of energy, and causes higher cost of living through transportation needs, &amp; destruction &amp; lack of growth of many markets if exclusive policies are made to give Oil &amp; Gas energy supplies an unfair market dominance. Traveling underground energy forces also make stops and transfer energy to multiple drill site locations, to cause earthquakes at those locations, which could later cause larger cracks &amp; sink holes to form at those locations, especially when a hole is empty with cracks all around it.", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T06:38:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rakesh S", "comment_text": "Governments should grant subsidies and invest in battery research heavily.", "comment_date": "2020-07-24T03:25:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jaden M\u00fclke", "comment_text": "Ru Paul: \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc41", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T23:45:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jaden M\u00fclke", "comment_text": "Rubpaul STAYS QUAKING", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T23:44:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Raman chaudhary", "comment_text": "Invest in nuclear fusion <br>Silver bullet of energy sources", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T22:10:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zessa", "comment_text": "Im here bc of the bob and peppermint meme", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T16:31:23Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Duy Dang Hoang", "comment_text": "I have some questions relating to the future of human beings, they are also relating to artificial intelligence or AI:<br>1/ If AI is more capable and smart than people, what will we-humans- do with our lives?<br>2/ Computers and machines will replace people in mostly all the jobs we have now.

So where are we going to put all that nuclear waste?<br><br>-wind energy relies on well wind. It relies on how hard the wind will blow and when the wind isn\u2019t blowing then you basically have a big metal fan that is responsible for killing birds, hundreds of thousands so far.<br><br>-solar energy, seems alright right? Well here\u2019s the problem, besides being very expensive and materials lacking, they have issues on locations. If you live somewhere where it\u2019s sunny all the time and have the money and space then you\u2019re golden, but solar panels aren\u2019t 100% especially when it\u2019s cloudy. Again you\u2019re depending on weather for your energy. Not to mention there will be surpluses of energy and droughts, example, the winter solstice has the longest night out of the year, during that time you won\u2019t have as much energy, during the summer you\u2019ll have to much. Now you can rely on batteries and capacitors but then you\u2019re producing more problems since the manufacturing of batteries is more harmful for the environment.<br><br>-hydroelectric dams, now what could be wrong with water? Well again, relying on weather, the dams rely on how much it rains and that isn\u2019t very predictable. Sure the weatherman can say you\u2019ll get this many inches but how often will that be constant and how many times a year is it going to rain in certain locations? Not to mention building damns will destroy the ecosystem, you\u2019ll change fish migrations and destroy habitats for other animals and even people.<br><br>-geothermal, now this is interesting but its biggest draw back is location location location, it relies on hotspots to produce electricity so unless you\u2019re sitting on a mini volcano I doubt this will work for you.<br><br>-biomass, this is possibly the worst out of all. Relying on burning of bio products doesn\u2019t seem bad because hey we burn wood to make fires for warmth and to cook. Well you\u2019re also relying on burning plants, trees, crops, and yes, poopy. While burning things on its own is bad enough releasing toxins into the environment especially methane from the poo poo, it requires sole dedication to just that. More space will be needed to keep up with the increase in demand for trees and crops which would lead to deforestation and again destroying ecosystems not to mention how large the biomass plants will need to be.<br><br>Now the biggest 2 issues besides not being as constant and predictable as fossil fuels is THEY ARE FAR LESS ENERGY EFFICIENCT and REQUIRE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO OPERATE. Why should we increase taxes for energy that isn\u2019t reliable and can cause more harm then good? I\u2019m all for renewable energy that works but none of these will work. If you have a good renewable energy with little to no problems that doesn\u2019t rely on the weather and can be used anywhere in the world then please tell us because so far there is nothing that\u2019s as efficient or controllable as oil and gas. Does it have problems yes most definitely but it\u2019s cheap, can be used anywhere in the world, doesn\u2019t rely on the weather, doesn\u2019t need to destroy ecosystems, and it just works for more then just energy. All your plastics, are oil, your gas and diesel, oil, lubricants, oil, chemicals may they be household or industrial, oil, Hell even the roads we drive on are made using oil.<br>If you can come up with a better energy source please, let the world know and collect your Nobel prize.", "comment_date": "2019-06-24T10:39:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Collins", "comment_text": "It&#39;s quite &quot;fracking&quot; bad.", "comment_date": "2019-06-23T14:14:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allison Colby", "comment_text": "I really hate robot voices.

This video is so wrong on so many points.   &quot;The fracking revolution&quot; is a total misnomer.  It is a &quot;Shale Revolution&quot;.  We have been fracking for 70 years.  We have been horizontal Drilling for over 40 years.  We just started applying these to tight Shale....that is what is new.  The claim that using gas from Fracked wells for energy produces the same amount of  CO2 as from other fossil fuels is a complete fabrication.  For the same caloric output, Gas produces only 25-50% of the CO2 than Coal.  If the CO2 release from Fracking alone brought the total CO2 output from Fracked Energy usage to 100%, it would mean that the act of Fracking produces 2-3 times the CO2 than from burning the gas it produces, meaning you put in ~2-3 times as much energy as you get out...we would actually have less energy than we had before we Fracked, and every company that did it would have gone bankrupt years ago.  That is complete and utter nonsense.  The use of Fracking in tight shales to produce natural gas has lowered the US CO2 output far more than all our new renewable sources like Wind, Solar, Biofuels, etc. combined.  That is indisputable.  Also, that 3% loss of methane is dubious at best, and would be no different than conventional gas production.  Any gas loss has nothing to do with Fracking.  It was just a claim in the video that was completely unsubstantiated.  The Video also does not accurately represent what Fracking Fluid is.  In fact, Fracking Fluid is 99.5% sand and water.  Most of the remaining 0.5% is Guar.  It is a very common and safe thickening agent.  It makes the the fluid more viscous, which helps it fracture the rock and push sand into the cracks, when under pressure.  If Guar sounds familiar, look at a container of ice cream.  Chances are, it contains Guar Gum...the exact same thing that is in Fracking Fluid.  The rest of the fluid (usually less than 0.1%) is any of a number of chemicals that are typically less toxic than many components of the Geofluids that are naturally already down there, and they are in very small quantities.  Fracking fluid is also often recovered after use and recycled for use in other wells.  The video states that the fluid is highly toxic which is totally not true...Governor Hickenlooper from Colorado (Democrat) drank a glass of it at a Press Conference to prove this point a few years ago.  Hickenlooper is also a Geologist, so he knows the truth.  The Video also implies that the Fracking fluid has contaminated freshwater sources through fractures in the Earth created by Fracking.  This is a complete lie.  This has never happened.  Fracking cracks the rock only within ~50ft of the horizontal borehole.  We know this, due to geophysical monitoring of the process.  These horizontal bores are typically at depths of 5,000-10,000ft below the surface (1-2 miles below the surface).  Water wells and water sources are typically at depths of less than 1000ft. That means the 50-ft fractures occur almost 1-2 miles below these fresh water sources.  It is virtually impossible for Fracking (which can only produce ~50ft fractures) to create a 4000-9000ft fracture.  You would need nuclear weapons to do something like that.  Any contamination has happened from accidental spills at the surface.  It is very rare, and again it is not that toxic, if at all.  Fertilizer tankers and trucks spill all the time and are far more toxic than most Fracking fluid.  Yet I don&#39;t see anyone freaking out about them.  There is a risk with everything we do.  The idea is to mitigate risk as much as possible until the benefits far outweigh the risks.  This is why people don&#39;t freak out over Fertilizer trucks or car accidents, or riding bikes without helmets.  But Fracking is far more safe and far more regulated and scrutinized than any of the risks we live with happily.  It is because of politics, votes, virtue signaling, misdirected activism, etc.  There are so many other things wrong with this video, I could go on for hours, but I think you get the point.  This is an Activist video with little to no truth to any of their claims.", "comment_date": "2019-02-10T17:42:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LiNkified0", "comment_text": "We need to build electric cars!!", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T15:31:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tofer Kapeleris", "comment_text": "I would suggest watching the documentary defending tracking called &quot;fracknation&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T05:35:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iling tuan", "comment_text": "Who\u2019s in 2019??", "comment_date": "2019-01-31T21:27:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Mayr", "comment_text": "very nice videos! i love your channel!

Wells are not drilled by using hydraulic fracturing, we&#39;ll are drilled and THEN later they are &quot;produced&quot; by using various stimulation methods including hydraulic fracturing. Drilling and fracturing are two separate and unrelated procedures. If you tried to drill a well by using fracturing... well that isn&#39;t even possible... you need an existing conduit to channel hydraulic fracturing fluids- primarily made of jelly created from guar gum (made from beans) that stick to the rock and reduce its permeability, so then the &quot;hydraulic&quot; part comes in when you pump water down there... the jelly makes the rock less permeable so the water won&#39;t soak into it, instead it creates pressure which pulverizes the rock... aka &quot;fracturing. The effect is highly controlled and localized, as the fluids are channelled precisely through a pipe system. Then the hydrocarbons are now freed from the rock but are require some help to loosen them up, which is where &quot;pickling&quot; comes in. You say in the video they use &quot;chemicals&quot; as part of the process, this is slightly misleading because while brine and acid are technically chemicals... they call it &quot;pickling&#39; because it&#39;s not that far off from pickle brine.<br><br><br>This video is incorrect, misleading and dangerous misinformation. makes me wonder about the other videos on this channel I&#39;ve liked in the past... The fact is, Hydraulic fracturing is the best bet for America&#39;s energy needs and national security for the next 30 or so years until alternatives are viable. Actually, for the world&#39;s energy needs and security. Hydrocarbons are the most abundant energy source on Earth - no one should be fighting wars to secure energy.<br><br><br>Solar power for homes and electric for cars is still incredibly destructive to the environment, dangerous and exploitative because of the deeply flawed battery technology. Lithium is a much scarcer element than hydrocarbons, we&#39;ve already seen slave labor and violence pop up over control of lithium and other materials required for our current battery technology.<br><br><br>So, for now - hydraulic fracturing provides the world with a reasonable way to access untapped energy resources that are LOCAL. it&#39;s our bridge to the future.", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T15:41:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GAY GAY", "comment_text": "CYLONS", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T22:26:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prophet 111", "comment_text": "Lets trade our water (stuff we need to exist), for fuel (stuff we need to make life easier)...

Most people don&#39;t seem to realize just how far down thees wells go. The idea that the fracking fluid can come up into the water table is like saying that a glass of nasty water can seep through to the other side of a mountain, it cant. Fracking produces more productive wells, the gas can be extracted faster and a single well can extract from a very large area all to a single point while conventional drilling may need a new well every few hundred feet AND also uses dangerous fluids. The only place that the fluids have been able to contaminate the water is at the point where the drill hole crosses the water table and conventional wells will need to cross it many more times to get the same amount of gas out. The earthquakes only happen when drilling is done into an non-mapped fault line.  The reason the fluid is pumped back in is to stabilize the ground and not leave an empty void thus creating a sinkhole, along with storing the waste chemicals. To be clear I&#39;m not a fan of any kind of drilling for fuels but if you&#39;re going to do it (which we are) fracking is the way to go.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oil and gas geologist here. I completely approve. Few points that are not present in this video for some reason: <br>1. Oil and gas reservoirs are naturally sealed from any major water resources by very thick impenetrable geological structures which allow oil to form a deposit over millions of years. If there is no such structure, there is no deposit. <br>2. Usually we&#39;re drilling oil wells so deep that the only water we could expect at such depths is ancient &quot;buried&quot; water. It usually takes tens of millions of years for this water to reach the surface naturally. <br>3. Rock, which our Earth&#39;s crust is made of is a filter. And a very efficient one. Those chemicals would decay and get absorbed long before they see the surface. <br>4. The only real possible case in which groundwater might get contaminated is when well is not properly sealed due to major technological processes violations, or those chemicals are simply leaked or dumped on the surface, which has nothing to do with fracking itself. <br>5. Fracking has been around for 60 or more years now, tons of studies have been done, so this part of the video is a lie.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A common example many people post about regards the Cabot Oil and Gas incidents with the residents of Dimock, Pennsylvaniaand where their water started bubbling and hissing. As it turns out, there was methane, ethane, and propane in their water. This was a result of fracking operation that broke over 130 regulations. What they did was not defendable and did not reflect fracking. It reflected the outlier of human error involved in any industry.&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-07-28T05:12:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "a", "comment_text": "This is the dangerous way to mine natural gas<br>If you accept, like me", "comment_date": "2018-07-27T08:56:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andang Kurniawan", "comment_text": "If Thirdnesia do it, they will say it endangers climate and not eco-friendly.<br><br>When they do it, they say the risk is still unknown.<br><br>Wkwkwk", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T03:24:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tea wrecks", "comment_text": "Sources?", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T04:01:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Texas Forever", "comment_text": "This video needs to be updated.

That is: sooner or later, the earthquake would occur anyway.  So by inducing it now, you schedule a quake and diminish the severity of what might happen in the future.  There will be earthquakes, whether or not you frack, so blaming it on fracking is meaningless. We don&#39;t want to frack in the Yellowstone area and other areas because we don&#39;t fully understand the geology and the potential for a catastrophic event is too great.  It appears as though we may have an earthquake predictor with GPS sensors recording ground movement on the NW coast in anticipation of an overdue catastrophic earthquake.  If these prove to be a good predictor, they may find application in the fracking business, helping to predict the timing and severity of an earthquake.  As a result, fracking will also find application outside oil shale production as a means to manage earthquake events in earthquake-prone regions in the US.  As far as shale production in general, many more countries, including China, have oil shale.  Once the fracking technology and infrastructure is in place, oil will be as plentiful as potable water, and cost about the same as potable water around the world.

The other is mishandling the fracking fluids after being pumped out. Fracking has been proven a very safe way to retrieve energy that otherwise isnt accessible.

The only real possible case in which groundwater might get contaminated is when well is not properly sealed due to major technological processes violations, or those chemicals are simply leaked or dumped on the surface, which has nothing to do with fracking itself.<br>5.

I am trying to gain awareness of the overwhelmingly populated fracking wells in both my town and Weld County. I believe my community is greatly unaware of the dangers of Fracking and others and I want to get involved with spreading this knowledge of the potential risks that come along with fracking. I am posting this today to gain recognition of this problem and to hopefully gain support in our cause so that perhaps one day Weld County and even hopefully this state can once and for all BAN fracking. We plan on using our rights to protest to inform the public that this is a growing problem within our county and our state. As we gain support we plan to collect signatures in areas like Denver or Boulder to show that others agree with us. We plan to also go door to door of the residents of Weld County to inform about fracking and hopefully gain support for our cause. Please like our page to show your support and share this post to show that you want to get fracking out of our state!

Most hydraulic frac targets are kilometres deep, not metres. Frac fluid is 99.95% water, which is always taken from non-potable water sources. Drinking water sources actually do not provide a fast enough rate of charge to supply frac water supply requirements. 0.05% of the frac fluid is proprietary chemicals. Note this does not factor in the proppant, which is usually sand.<br><br>Note that all natural water sources also contain similar surprising quantities of toxic chemicals particularly heavy metals. This is normal in nature and when in small quantities, our bodies have the ability to tolerate it. But this is why water treatment is common practice in first world countries.<br><br>Furthermore, the average water use of frac wells is between 20,000m3 and 40,000m3 with a statistical mean around 32,000m3.<br><br>Most jurisdictions do not allow fracing anywhere near what is referred to as the &quot;base of groundwater&quot; which changes based on where you live. Most rules require that operators frac much much deeper than this safety depth, to prevent any hope of contamination. Consult your local regulator for info on this.<br><br>Finally, the movie Gasland which has stirred up most of the anti fracing sentiment, is largely fictitious, as admitted personally by the director of the film, who admitted that he aims to sell tickets as it is &quot;still just a movie&quot;.

There are also a number of Oilfield Service Providers that offer mobile purification systems at wellsites, however I won&#39;t go into the degree of water cleanliness derived from the process as any statement to this effect would likely be viewed as contentious.The point is that alternatives are available, although they are often more expensive and thus less attractive to many the smaller operators currently working in the US unconventional market.

Hydroelectric in many cases actualy produces more power than a nuclear reactor, but it causes many more imediate effects, such as land loss and wildlife damage. The best prosses when making hydroelectric power is to build many dams along the river as it minimalizes the effect done to other rivers. If you look at the coumbia river it has a dam at least every hundred miles apart. The river use to be clear, but now its quite muddy. However, rivers close to it such as the klicitat are undamed and very pure. Hydroelectric power is getting to the point where we can put generators at the sea floor that run off currents. They do not affect the vast ocean of its wildlife. In my opinion, that is the way to go.<br><br>Nuclear power is better for less populated areas as it takes at most half a square mile to make a plant, as aposed to  the dozens of sqare miles sam resivuors take.

When it states the seemingly large amount of water used by fracking, instead of actually putting it into context they just state the amount of people that would use the same amount for personal use. But what they don&#39;t put into context is that personal water usage, like fracking is a very small percent of total US freshwater withdrawals. The actual consumption of water necessary to frack all U.S. shale gas wells, for example in 2011 represented only <b>0.1 percent</b> of total U.S. freshwater withdrawals. Secondly There isn&#39;t a single confirmed, actually tested example of water contamination, only fear-mongering and ridiculous disproven anecdotes. Thirdly, the chemicals used in fracking have no chance of hurting anyone (not that they could), because the fluid is pumped under a mile of impermeable rock. For this same reason groundwater hasn&#39;t, and very likely won&#39;t ever be contaminated. Also pay attention to the line &quot;there are over 700 chemicals that <b>can</b> be used&quot;, meaning that 700 aren&#39;t used in the same fluid, just are known to be used in any fluid. Lastly to say that fracking has had a bad impact on greenhouse gas emissions is just laughable.

Let me lay out a situation that just happened to one of wells. \u00a0We drilled a well based on 3d and the arbuckle came in 5 feet high at a depth of around 3725 feet deep, set pipe, perfed 3 feet of top arbuckle, 4 shots per foot. Came back to stimulate the zone and clean up the mud with acid and ended up being super tight zone. \u00a0Put 1400 psi with 20% mud acid on it and fractured the zone. \u00a0The well came in like an ocean only water. Long story short we fractured the zone at least 5 feet deeper (5 being conservative the measurement 9 feet being liberal) than our perfs. \u00a0DEEPER. \u00a0Because the upper shale (or cap) with stood the pressures. \u00a0Usually the deepest drinkable water is around 250 to 300 ft deep and usual able water is 600-750 ft deep max. \u00a0 The KCC REQUIRES us to set (by cement circulated to surface) surface pipe, 8 5/8&quot; deeper than the maximum deepest drinkable water (320 ft in this example). \u00a0Than another set of production casing, 5 1/2&quot;, is cemented and it be set with cement at surface (cemented deeper than surface casing 340 ft or deeper and circulated to surface) and the bottom of the casing string to target zones and protect casing. \u00a0In other words two protective casing and two cement jobs to protect the surface water. \u00a0In other words a large frac jobs doing a zone at the depth of 3412 (taken from <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/e_ertwg_xwdd_nus_fwa.htm\">http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/e_ertwg_xwdd_nus_fwa.htm</a>), crude wells are even deeper you can find the stats on the site also. \u00a0 If you put 10,000 psi and being a 10ft vein per 1000 psi. you would liberally have 100-150 ft veins coming from your well bore. \u00a0So in other words you would have roughly 2500 ft of multiple zones of protection to any USABLE water and 2700 feet to drinkable water..... \u00a0that even for a shallow well. \u00a0Deep wells 4500+ have even more geological layers of protection. \u00a0I remember when the scare of cracking crude said it was going to &quot;down grade our quality of gasoline&quot;. \u00a0Trust me with the rules and regulations we fallow in the oil industry can be harsh with HIGH price tags of a &quot;little&quot; screw up. \u00a0Trust me theres still money to be made, but when we try to come up with new technology to increase our AMERICAN oil or become more energy dependent.... Every one cries in their beer about Rules and CANCER... NO NOISE POLLUTION THE BLADES NO!
