In this world nothing happens by accident and the so called Authorities are planning the deaths of Billions almost since time began and it only makes sense. Just take war as an example. Soldiers die in very high numbers on both sides, the only ones that rarely die are the people who send those Soldiers in to war. The up sides of war (from the governments perspective) are : Fear in the minds of people outside the war (citizens) so they are easier to controll and less likely to overthrow the government because they&#39;re hearts are struck with fear and bad news distributed by the media which totally happens on purpose. Then there is the big money factor which hides itself in illegal drug and gun shipments. The fact that &quot;neutral&quot; parties are supplying country&#39;s at war with guns just playes out perfect for the Government. This is simply so because a war without guns and weapons wouldn&#39;t really be a war or at least not one the government would be interested in. Plus war is the perfect cover up Story for selling weapons if you think about it. The next thing would be the drugs and that is pretty obvious ass well. Just take the vietnam war as an example. Soldiers completely faded and drugged up because they were to afraid of dying. Again This war makes  a  great cover up for all the drugs that have been transported from vietnam to the U.S. Then again you might say the government doesn&#39;t have anything to do with drugs but you should ask yourself, who is in charge over the whole war operation? It only makes sense that there are a few thousand that rule this world from the underground, because lets face it, if the government was gonna end the war on drugs they couldve done it allready, but for some reason the government likes to play dumb when it comes to drugs. Of course we have the oil factor which we can combine with terrorism. Its no secret third world country&#39;s are rich in oil. The russians tried to take those countrys rich on oil first in the russian afghan war. After the soviet union colapsed russia retreated and America made they&#39;re move on those country&#39;s. Its like two big cowardly bullies try to rape and then murder the home coming queen. Of course by doing that they spread hatred lots of hatred, which leads to terrorist attacks they purposly provoked so they can &quot;fight back&quot;, because when terrorist attacks happen the citizens of a country get scared and then they will demand they&#39;re government to do something, which only plays out just right for the cowardly officials. I think the reasons for people not believing this truth is that they are : a) to comfortable and hung up on they&#39;re dayli lifes that they simply don&#39;t want to face a harsh reality or b) they don&#39;t see the evil motives behind those corrupt actions anymore. And i don&#39;t blame them because we are hearing lies and being manipulated by movies, fiction, storys media... Every day through our subconscious mind, which sadly, makes all this even harder to detect. The devil hides in the detail and this quote couldn&#39;t be more true. Because i think that there&#39;s somebody in this world that want&#39;s the worst for us in every case. He can talk to you just like he can talk to me, you think it&#39;s you&#39;re inner voice but its not. Wake up there&#39;s evil around.

All of life on this planet is connected and it uses these mechanisms to communicate all and everything that\u2019s going on on this planet with all and everything that lives on this planet.

(In as much as gym equipment doesn\u2019t \u201eattack\u201c you, nor are you \u201einvading\u201c the gym. \u201eIllness is always an expression of an imbalance in the system. It always starts small, and if ignored or not rebalanced properly, grows. It can be passed on through generations, and \u201ebig imbalances\u201c can manifest in young children, where it\u2019s not at all obvious, where the imbalance should be coming from. And one child can manifest the imbalances of an entire generation (or generations) of a family. A genetic expression of Karma.) This system is the very reason life as we know it exists at all, and I don\u2019t see it as an \u201eattack and defend\u201c system, but more like a \u201einformation and cooperation and adaptation\u201c mechanism.

Since this is so, why would anyone go and give the immune system more combinations to synthesize by ingesting artificial substances like pharmaceuticals or artificial foods? Viruses are produced by the body and they don&#39;t attack the body, they clear out damaged and diseased cells. Everything we&#39;ve been told is very skewed. The body is even smarter than this video suggests - we share molecules with everything around us, and that have come into contact with us. So we are breathing air that was present in Africa last week and water that was flowing through Spain. Molecules that have come from far and wide all recorded by our DNA as well as all the molecules that our ancestors were exposed to.

There are things that our system cannot fight, and win against without outside help. This is why we have antibiotics, we look to fungi and bacteria to see how they defend themselves. For the rest that we can win, but our system has no idea what it&#39;s looking for and will likely respond far too late, we have vaccines -so that hopefully when the real threat arrives the immune system will recognize it quick enough. But even then, modern vaccines, don&#39;t teach the immune system much of anything. They promote the system to flood our bodies with an antibody, that is no more alive than virus is. It&#39;s of course  mechanical. It bumps into something that the keys fit into and it latches on, like a boot to a double parked muscle car. Gatcha! If this doesn&#39;t happen because the antibody never finds a place to latch on, and the virus finds a cell to infect first... The immune system may take too long to respond and by the time it does, a fast spreading virus SARS has already taken over. SARS also manipulates how cells signal for help, bending the calls to the immune system to further befit the virus. But also our systems don&#39;t make all antibodies all of the time, they switch over as time passes. Thus why we are pushing boosters so much for SARS, even if the boosters still only offer identification of Alpha Variant. T cells are the ultimate destroyers but take time to build up, thanks to that 2% rule. <br><br>The problem with even suggesting that we are immune to everything is misleading, far too many are dumb enough to take that statement at face value. So then we end up arguing with morons about microchips in the vaccines. <br><br>We have also learned, or rather been very recently reminded that just because the body doesn&#39;t see an infection as a threat, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s peacefully coexisting, and even minor threats like the cold have far more sinister plots to hatch. A certain water born virus, known to cause diarrhea, can also cause diabetes. Another very well know virus you might have just recently gotten over is implicated in 7 auto immune disorders. The immune system can run a foul but in my opinion, it&#39;s often mislead by bad actors, into attacking healthy cells and as we know, once this starts and the B-Cells have stored the data, the immune system will not stop attacking.", "comment_date": "2021-12-14T03:06:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "elated dkenn", "comment_text": "cells at work vibes", "comment_date": "2021-12-14T01:04:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Foss", "comment_text": "The things our immune system does to protect us and fight off disease makes the most violent battles of the past hundred years seem like a leisurely game of tag amongst kindergarten-age children.", "comment_date": "2021-12-14T01:03:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dark_Roblox", "comment_text": "Hmmm that sus", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T23:45:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Penguin Lord", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmpuerlbJu0&amp;t=0m41s\">0:41</a> SUS", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T23:10:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Bell", "comment_text": "Me watching this with a cold:  \u201cmy sinuses determined that this is a lie.\u201d", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T22:51:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shesha Hayat", "comment_text": "Brilliant &amp; educational \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4d<br>Great work. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4d  the colourful animations are so cute &amp; fun to learn,,,\u2026<br>\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T20:43:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EpicDude316", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmpuerlbJu0&amp;t=2m16s\">2:16</a>", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T20:31:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chill Bruh\u30b7", "comment_text": "THANK YOU FOR EXISTING!!!\ud83d\udc95\u2764\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc4f", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T20:30:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SeaFounder", "comment_text": "These are the kinds of videos that my teachers should\u2019ve shown me and other children.

Guyton, The Textbook of Medical Physiology*, Fifth Edition. <br><br>* World\u2019s most widely used medical textbook of any kind <br>* World&#39;s best-selling physiology book<br>---------------<br>How can we identify the extent of incorrect breathing?<br><br>By measuring &quot;the control pause&quot; and pulse. All known publications describe measuring of the control pause quite vaguely. Below is a clearer description:<br>The control pause should be preferably measured in standard conditions, after a 10 minute breath-equalizing rest.<br>Sit conveniently. Take a beautiful, correct posture, spread out your shoulders. The stomach will straighten up. Inhale normally, relax the stomach. Involuntary exhalation will come out by itself. As the exhalation is finished, note the position of the second hand visually and hold breath. During the time of measuring, do not follow the hand, just focus on a spot in front of you or shut your eyes. Do not breathe in until it gets difficult, i.e. until diaphragm&#39;s &quot;push&quot;  up. Simultaneously, stomach and neck muscles get push too: patients normally describe this condition as a &quot;push in the throat&quot;. Read of the second hand&#39;s position at the &quot;push&quot; point, and continue breathing. Do not inhale deeper than prior to breath-holding.<br><br>Thus measured pairs of stable values &quot;control pause - pulse&quot; determine the stage of your disease by the following rule:<br><br>- 1-10 secs. CP (pulse 100): severely sick, critically and terminally ill patients, usually hospitalized;<br>- 10-20 secs. CP (pulse 90): sick patients with health complaints, often on daily medication;<br>- 20-30 secs. CP (pulse 80): people with average health, usually without serious chronic health problems;<br>- 40-60 secs. CP (pulse 70): very good health;<br>- 60 secs + CP with the pulse below 70: robust health, when many chronic diseases are virtually impossible.<br>If the control pause rises to 90, 120 or 180 seconds, humans acquire a special resistance to hunger, cold, heat, infection, poisons and increased nuclear radiation.<br><br>Stability of values is the &quot;repeatability&quot; of such values within the range corresponding to a specific stage of the disease during at least several days.<br><br>There are cases of people who have poor results (less than 20 secs.), but who do not suffer from chronic diseases. Such people typically do not have a genetic predisposition to chronic disease. That said, low body O2 always compromises health and fitness, energy levels, and overall quality of life to some degree.<br><br>Some people can have abnormally large CP numbers. This can happen in cases of carotid body resections, denervation of respiratory muscles, and near-death experiences. People with sleep apnea and lost or blunted CO2 sensitivity, can also have exaggerated test results.<br><br>At the same time, cases of people with normal breathing (and normal body O2 content) who have low results for the CP test are virtually unknown.<br>---------------<br>The purpose of the Buteyko method is to normalize (or improve) your personal unconscious breathing pattern 24/7 so as to provide respiration in accordance with internationally accepted medical and physiological norms. Practically speaking, the method is designed to eliminate chronic alveolar hyperventilation (or too much breathing) and to restore the normal balance between carbon dioxide and oxygen in the lungs, blood and all cells.<br>---------------<br>For more information on the Buteyko method &amp; covid-19, please read the following 4 articles:<br><br>- Dr. A.

The phisical body that fuctions as the science says and the spirit half which helps it stay healthy. If science would go hand in hand with spirituality, there would be no more diseases at all. But if you introduce fear and stress that harm the spiritual half a lot more than the phisical half, then problems like depression, anxienty, etc appear which in turn make the immunity system weaker and more prone to viruses. It is also a well known fact in science too. And for the phisical side, if we eat unhealthy or do no exercise and do not take care of ourselves, that harms the body a lot. The junk food, the cigars, etc can really wear down our adaptive immunity until it finally is unable to protect us. And from that our mood drops and that makes us more and more ill. We need to take care of both of our halves. There only so much positive thinking and spirituality can do for your health. You need to help it with a healthy and natural lifestyle. If you do both correctly, you ll never have to worry about getting ill again. Please people, inform yourselves first from more than 50 sources, than decide to do something that will permanently damage your life. Stop being afraid of everything. Everything will be ok eventually. Be brave but also careful and listen to what is your body telling you indirectly. If you listen with all your heart and with no doubt, it will tell you what you should and shouldn&#39;t do.

When a misfolded prion protein encounters a normally folded protein, it catalyzes the normal protein to misfold itself as well. <br><br>A healthy immune system won&#39;&#39;t recognize these misfolded prions because the protein is supposed to be there, and in the process of binding to a receptor the protein stretches back into its expected shape. As far as your immune system is concerned, all normal. But even if it could, your immune system has no mechanism to handle rogue protein molecules. They have no receptors or surface to bind to. They can&#39;t be broken down into their component molecules because they are already a molecule. They are orders of magnitude smaller than even the smallest virus, smaller than most of the weapons your immune system can attack with.

You have to put in the effort to become that, and knowing us humans, that\u2019s a choice we make, and if we have a choice to ether make free money, or work to get free money, then, who will win, and what is the point of actually trying when free money is always given to you.

Since it doesn&#39;t react to anything, it becomes part of the 2% that survives. Come spring time, this cell freaks the hell out on contact with this type of pollen and your body launches an immune attack, assuming this threat is real.

The reason is because the adaptive immune system is SLOW. It takes about 2 weeks or more for the adaptive immune system to start spitting out antibodies that can have moderate effects against the infection. However, within these 2 week time, many diseases would already have enough time to cause significant damage to your body, and can even affect the antibody generation process itself. This is why COVID still kills because by the time our body recognise and ready to produce antibodies, it&#39;s already too weak to do so. <br>This is also why getting the vaccine is so important! Vaccines work by giving our body the training it needs to produce antibodies WITHOUT causing actual damage by the disease. So when the body actually encounters the disease, it&#39;s just ready to go! <br>You might think this is obvious enough but I have talked to many anti vaxxers who have absolutely ZERO knowledge of how this works, and zero training yet spitting out misinformation that they &quot;learned&quot; from Facebook university as if its all facts and argue with people who actually been trained for years. Makes my blood boil. I have zero sympathy for anti vaxxers and just hope they suffer for their stupidity.

It&#39;s called cytokine storm, and can be compared to nuclear arsenal of immune system, that is used as last desperate attempt to clear infection, but certain viruses can trick your immune system into using it early.", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T08:01:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erebus", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmpuerlbJu0&amp;t=0m38s\">0:38</a> jesus christ i cant escape them", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T08:01:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Extra_V_I_C_C", "comment_text": "BLESS THIS IMMUNITY", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T08:01:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M.A.R.S.", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmpuerlbJu0&amp;t=0m38s\">0:38</a> NONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONON-", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T08:00:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Iltarias", "comment_text": "Will there be a Hardcover version of the book in German? i looked everywhere and can&#39;t find it.", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T08:00:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elite Champion", "comment_text": "if immune against all disase then why need vacine", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T07:59:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thumper Dumper", "comment_text": "Thats all fake phonie", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T07:59:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kai Mono", "comment_text": "Just watch the show Cells at Work", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T07:59:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yes", "comment_text": "When the cell is sus", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T07:59:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LoFi", "comment_text": "Does the book &quot;Immune&quot; comes with text-to-speech by the narrator of Kurzgesagt?

A big section missing is allergens, that&#39;s when your immune system isn&#39;t attacking your own body or a enemy microorganism, but something otherwise harmless  if not for the overreaction of your body and often inert/not &quot;alive&quot;(not even in the virus sense) thus rather undestroyable. Especially how do allergens appear and how does your body learn to overcome them?  It&#39;s confusing because it seems exposer to common potential allergens can both cause allergies and prevent or cure them depending on factors.<br><br>             Another interesting aspect of the immune system is how the body learns when it <i>does</i> need to attack your own cells, like in the case of cancer. BTW AFAIK cancer is when cells death gene breaks. Most cells are designed to eventually die and be replaced, when cells become immortal because the mechanism for them to die breaks, and then divide making more cells that also don&#39;t die, you get cancer. Often our bodies are unable to know to attack cancer, but sometimes your body does attack cancer cells and many &quot;cancers&quot; come and go unknown to us for a variety of reasons, including our own immune system.", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T03:47:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "_Risen", "comment_text": "I learned more in this video than all 4 years of highschool science class", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T03:46:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mrfluffybeehive", "comment_text": "Do a video on quasars please", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T03:46:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zee Kyle", "comment_text": "Favorite page ever gonna ask for your book for Christmas!", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T03:45:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaditya", "comment_text": "Immune system =Task Force 141", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T03:45:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmpuerlbJu0&amp;t=0m57s\">0:57</a> Easier said than done.", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T03:45:11Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "\u300aEdward\u300b ANIMS Yujin Amuka", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmpuerlbJu0&amp;t=0m14s\">0:14</a> every boomers custom profil picture be like:", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T03:45:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "diffrent think", "comment_text": "Except COVID-19 <br>Make sure you take your booster cause the first set wanes.<br>So make sure you get your booster \u263a\ufe0f<br>Covid...20?<br>Well guys you heard it from your local sponsors.<br>This booster works, seriously.", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T03:44:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thatVRguy", "comment_text": "Oh no...Kurzgesagt, this title is pretty misleading, especially with all of the anti-vaxxers out there who probably won&#39;t finish this video.", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T03:44:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tarek Z", "comment_text": "Got my copy today!

I am so tired of meds that make me sick, while keeping me alive. One almost killed me. Another cost me my femoral heads 20 years ago.

That&#39;s a lot of keys your body has to have. instead of trying to pick the locks, your body makes a factory where it produces millions of keys, and each key is unique and completely random; after making sure each key doesn&#39;t fit into the locks of your own body, these keys are stored and saved until a new pathogen comes by that happens to fit the key.", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T00:20:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tornado", "comment_text": "I want to know more about this <b>&quot;Complicated Dance&quot;</b><br><br>Asking for a friend...", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T00:20:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hawsrule Begin", "comment_text": "If our bodies are so amazing how come we are generally a stupid race?

It&#39;s definitely quite a few orders of magnitude about a quadrillion.

One thing I&#39;d love to see you guys mention or cover at some point is the fact that mutations of pathogens are not certain to be bad for us.  Mutations can let the pathogens evade our immune system, but they can also immediately make the pathogen totally harmless, unable to infect human cells, unable to transmit from one human to another, etc.  It&#39;s entirely possible a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 could emerge that outcompetes existing variants, but also is far less lethal.

Now I can be around people with COVID and not get sick. That what happened when my mom had it twice. She was sick for like a month the first time, and I just got a simple cold for 2 days. She got it a second time 5-6 months later and was only sick for a week, and a lot less sick than the first time. I didn\u2019t even get sick at all from that one, even when we both went to get tested to see if she actually had it (while she was sick) hers came back positive and mine negative. <br><br>There was another time where my mom had the Flu, Bronchitis, and Pink Eye all at the same time. All I got from that was a simple cold that I had for 3 days. <br><br>I can be around people who have the flu and I touch surfaces they do, then forget to wash my hands before I touch my nose and mouth. I\u2019ve never had a flu shot (even when they were recommended with COVID) and I\u2019ve never had the flu. I will never get a flu shot. <br><br>I only got the COVID vaccine because literally everyone else in my family was going to get it, and my grand parents wouldn\u2019t have let me stay with them unless I was, so I was severely pressured into getting it. <br><br>Also on another note. Why did they make the COVID vaccine mandatory or you could get fired, but not the flu, chicken pox, measles, mumps, rubella, and tetanus. If you make 1 mandatory out of hundreds, then either they should all be mandatory, or none of them should. And the masks were wearing to \u201cprotect\u201d us from getting sick are actually making our immune systems worse because were not being exposed to sickness as much so our bodies can\u2019t learn to fight off the sickness.

In theory we are able to resist any diseas but time is a issue here as well how adapte the virus/bactarie is to the human body. <br>For the first example, it was mention it take time and yes and that is the reason why we get still sick and died because in case of corona it was new our body did not know it, and it really deadly, our body is not fast enouhg to produce the antibody we need before we died, thats why so many people died to covid.<br>Then there would be the adapation factor. Viren and Bactiria that are new to our body will always cause the stronges reaction. Since the Virus and Bactira need us as a host alive so it is not in it&#39;s benefits to kill us for reproduction. Thats why like the common cold only cause mild symptom compare to covid since over 1000 years the virus and the body could adapt to it. Of course there are Virus that can not repdrocue in us and that  need a different host like dog or cat thats why they can not make us sick as well since the can not enter our body cells or they don&#39;t have the need resource in us.

So the reason we still have to deal with the flu is what you say next, that it mutates every year, i.e. our adaptive immune system has to develop new weapons every single time, but our immune system can still tell the difference between friends and foes, it just isn&#39;t prepared for new foes.
