While the force of the blast would generally be contained to about a 1 km radius, if the bomb was on the floor of the Marianas Trench, then it should be within that distance from.the side of the trench.  So a large amount of force should be hitting the base sides of the trench.  This could trigger some truly massive underwater landslides given how deep the trench is.  There have been cases of large underwater landslides causing tsunamis before, and I&#39;d wonder if thia type of situation could also cause one.

Look up castle bravo which was a nuclear test that irradiated the local area as well the Japan, the USA and even as far as Europe. The test site is encased in concrete to try and stop the radiation leaks and the concrete dome is failing. Nuclear isotopes are long lasting and dangerous to human life.

This starts a chain reaction that continues to the next atom of refined radioactive material. The effectiveness of the bomb has been improved over the years by finding ways to get the atoms closer and contain the explosion within critical mass levels longer, so that when it explodes, it has a greater force of atoms reacting. All this is to say at that depth, assuming they somehow got the device to go that deep (it would crush itself and hit critical mass long before going that deep), it could very well destroy the entire world. The pressure would multiply the effectiveness of the bomb by as many atmospheres as it were deep, plus quite a bit extra. The atoms would be forced so close together, that it&#39;s nearly impossible to comprehend how devastating the bomb would be by the time it could break out of the inward pushing force. It would   be far more than what would be required to set off every volcano in the world and create 500+ foot tsunamis. The heated steam and volcanic debree would create a worldwide lightning storm that would create enough magnetic interference to short every electrical device that is powered. 90% of humanity would be burned alive within hours.

First of all, shock waves radiate from the blast, they do not circle anything else. Second, if it did &quot;circle&quot; the earth three times, we would all have noticed it very well indeed. There was, however, a seismic wave <i>caused by</i> the shock wave, which allegedly circled the earth three times. But at what latitude? The Tsar bomba was detonated north of the Polar circle, and the seismic wave was certainly not registered in South Africa. But could it circle the earth latitudinally? Sure it could, but at that particular latitude the earth is only about 10,000 miles around. So the seismic waves would travel about 5,000 miles before colliding and returning, for more than 30,000 miles, but less than 40,000 miles.", "comment_date": "2020-12-12T21:50:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clare Breanna", "comment_text": "The trashy makeup quickly remain because schedule ultimately doubt from a sedate mimosa. previous, rainy methane", "comment_date": "2020-12-12T18:26:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hannah Do", "comment_text": "my poo gives out more radioactivity", "comment_date": "2020-12-12T00:45:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "God", "comment_text": "What if the bomb was 100x more powerful", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T22:49:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Existential", "comment_text": "What happened if it\u2019s done in space?", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T21:12:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UZAIR TOLE", "comment_text": "Ferb, I know what we&#39;re gonna do today", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T19:27:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nixskatant", "comment_text": "Hallo kurz gesagt, ich lerne viel mehr von dir als in der Schule", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T17:40:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nixskatant", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tbxDgcv74c&amp;t=4m03s\">4:03</a> yay godzilla", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T17:36:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Phan Ngoc Hai", "comment_text": "The torpid avenue hooghly lick because gore-tex ultrasonically serve including a small kitten. mushy, marked appeal", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T16:39:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "noodle doodle", "comment_text": "The orange sidecar expectedly tumble because desire intialy entertain opposite a overconfident squash. broken, outstanding peak", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T15:05:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hamish Johnston", "comment_text": "im supposed to be sleeping but there is just so much good Kurzgesagt content.

That was dated technology by 1961 and nothing more than a spectacle used to scare the Americans.  The Mariana Trench is not a steep walled canyon and its true horizontal scale is not widely known.  It is formed mostly by grades of just a few percent that may run downward for many tens of miles.  Its horizontal scale is massive.  Shock waves would not be impacting against solid vertical rock walls as suggested by the animation.  Challenger deep, the deepest spot known at this time, is a small area 200 miles southwest of Guam.  The actual depression, most likely akin to a big mud hole is maybe a mile wide and seven miles long.  No living vertebrates (fish) have ever been found below 26,000 feet to date.  Biochemistry literally begins to change under that much pressure and it is no longer a simple matter of pressure inside canceling out the pressure on the outside of an organism.

Also, a hydrogen bomb does not generate as much radioactive fallout as a fission based bomb.<br><br>Also, if the force could be applied below ground (near a sensitive point in the fault line), it could have some effect. Not a global effect, but some regional effect. The Tzar Bomb was rated at 50 megatons (50 million tons) of TNT. A 9.0 earthquake releases about 100 megatons of TNT equivalent energy. Because of the logarithmic nature of the Richter scale, the bomb explosion would probably be somewhere 8.3 on the scale.<br><br>The problem is getting the bomb into a useful position. The deepest drill hole know is 7.5 miles, and the deepest part of the trench is about 7 miles. A machine would have to be built to make a hole large enough to take the bomb down to the fault line (which will probably take at least 10 years and many millions of dollars). The operation would have to be done on one of the Marianas Islands (like Guam), so it&#39;s most likely not to remain a secret for very long.<br><br>The Cannikin underground test (1971) was a 5 megaton bomb that triggered a 7.0 earthquake on Amchitka Island (with 4.0 aftershocks for a few weeks after), so using an atomic weapon to generate an earthquake is feasible, but not necessarily practical.<br><br>Also, just because most of the &#39;force&#39; of the blast would go up doesn&#39;t negate the fact that the shockwave from the blast would penetrate the sides of the Marianas trench and radiate into the earth over several miles. After all, both water and rock transmit shockwaves better than air does. If the circumstances are right, it could generate a number of aftershocks in excess of 5.0 on the Richter scale.", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T09:39:40Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "trash content", "comment_text": "what would happen if you detonated all nuclear bombs in the Marianas trench? would that make a big diffirense?", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T09:36:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Theft Parrot", "comment_text": "Everybody gangsta till someone mentions Tsar Bomba", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T09:31:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Altitude Fishing", "comment_text": "you the heck thinks about this crap lmao", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T08:41:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Une personne", "comment_text": "And what happends if the bomb explode just 1 kilometer in the ocean ?", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T08:18:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Giel Xhedrick Ambrocio", "comment_text": "I think i have covid <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> it was good... to live.<br><br><br><br><br>It was good..", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T08:13:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Giel Xhedrick Ambrocio", "comment_text": "I think i have covid <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> it was good... to live.<br><br><br><br><br>It was good..", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T08:13:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kristijan Ah\u010din", "comment_text": "owwww you&#39;re saying exploding a tsar bomba at the joints of tectonic plates will not cause them all to shift? bummer.

Granted I know it cant break through 100s of kilometers of crust but the force combined with the pressure already being put on it, as well as the more focused blast (as the trench acts somewhat like a bottleneck and focuses the energey into more of a bullet) as well as the cold water and currents race in to fill the new big f&#39;ing hole that appeared in like a second. Could under these circumstances, damage be done to the earth. I figured that could potentially trigger tectonic plates to shift and change currents in that part of the ocean which in turn could affect alot of species of marine life. Also sorry after thought here, if there&#39;s a magma tube close to said explosion could that cause the force to further bottleneck down into the crust for potentially 10s of 100s of kilometers while also gaining potentially a large amount of kenetic energy back as well. If this happened volcanic eruptions are likely to occur and im not sure how radioactive that magma could be but if it is even a little bit radioactive and it&#39;s coupled with a large volcanic eruption the ash and debris released could get into our atmosphere and cause insane weather shifts and radioactive rain which would kill most crops and the few that survive would have no sunlight to thrive in, as ash clouds can linger for weeks even months and our atmosphere would have a hard time filtering out such a large radioactive ash cloud.

The Soviet atom bomb program was started in 1936 or so. The scientists , predominantly from Russia and other nations, were spearheaded by Eagor Kurchatov, a brilliant and good-looking scientist. Everyone had a code name. Head scientist Kurchatov&#39;s code name was &quot;Beard&quot; or &quot;Brown Beard&quot;. Kurchatov&#39;s secretary was &quot;Miss Beard&quot;. Kurchatov along with his more famous dissident nuclear scientists and made the final blue prints of the atom bombs in the early 1940&#39;s. The team  simply refused to ask for bomb materials  to actally make the bomb. The Soviet Union was ruled by a Georgian named Joseph Stalin. Scientist Kurchatov and others delayed the Soviet atom bomb. Kurchatov and the other nuclear scientists were convinced that Stalin may immediately use the their atom bomb against Germany or Japan, as they felt that Stalin, an ethnic Georgian, may be a mad man. They only tested their atom bomb in 1949 under threats and duress from Moscow, who said &quot;Enough is enough. Your Kurchatov team could have built the Soviet atom bomb in 1944. We want the bomb in 1949, before the decade of 1940&#39;s is out.&quot; They wrote, Otherwise You Soviet scientist comrades, consider yourselves fired, whether from your jobs as nuclear scientist or by a bullet to the head.&quot;&quot;        Scientist Kurchatov and others delayed the Soviet atom bomb. So, the Soviet atom bomb was delayed by 5 years. They wanted a Slav at the helm in power before giving the ready bomb to the Soviet leaders. Stalin was still in power in 1949.\r<br>\r        The Soviet scientists were convinced that an ethnic non European leader will immediately use the atom bomb, and hence their attempt at delay.

I understand why you came to the conclusion that you did, but you are  only accounting for the fallout in terms of how nuclear bombs were tested under air pressure, and applying that to the hadal pressure of the mariana trench. Okay. I understand it&#39;s all hypothetical, but you failed to take into account a few things. Yes, while the pressure of  that depth is massive, something as fast and as hot as a fusion chain reaction is not gonna just cancel out with some bubbles floating to the top. If there was no crust, maybe that would be a reality. but detonating that type of power right between two tectonic plates would DEFINITELY cause an earthquake. Have you ever taken a glass out of the dishwasher, when it&#39;s still hot, and then rinsed it under cold water only to have it shatter?<br><br><b>dingding</b><br><br>So you are not accounting for that reaction. #2, whatever the byproduct is, that the radiation makes after being exposed to certain molecular elements, whether that be sand, or water- the chemical chain reaction under pressure makes it harder to rise to the surface, yes,  but so far, I don&#39;t think many humans have been down to the bottom of the Mariana trench, THEREFORE, what kind of minerals, animals, OIL WELLS, OR OTHERWISE are down there, and NOT being accounted for in terms of chemical reactions, is just a MASSIVE oversight on your part.

For starters the trench would direct most of that energy up towards the surface. Just a one kilometer bubble would displace approximately one tenth the depth of the water In the trench. Between the pressure wave moving upward and the subsequent backfill of water there would indeed be massive waves produced. Raw math would predict a one kilometer tall initial wave but I expect that some of that height would be mitigated by expansion to the sides. Even if only a third of this energy emerged as discernable wave height we would still expect to see approximately 330 meter or close to 1000 foot waves. Also we could expect the trench to direct that energy up and then perpendicular to the trench.  I like your consideration of the raw pressures exerted at the trench floor but would love to see some math backing up your claim that it would likely and effectively negate the power of the bomb.

The trench has walls.  And that massive pressure change would push on those walls.  The explosion is in every direction.  And, we know how volcanos happen.  Trapped pressure builds until it finds a way out... eruption.  I would argue that the pressure on the walls are already very high, just like right before a volcano erupts.  And just a slight bit of pressure (the last drop in a bucket causes the water to spill) and we know the Mariana Trench is from the crust moving/plates shifting.  So, if we were to add so much energy/pressure we could be that last bit of pressure that causes enables the shift to be severe.  And, we also know pressure on solid material, like the trench walls, are barely absorbed but actually transferred through the material under it finds an outlet... like, an eruption.  If you drop a grenade into a pool and have inflated balloons secured to the opposite side of the pool wall or bottom (to simulate a human\u2019s body/lungs) the explosive force pressurized the water and those balloons or a human body will be crushed/burst.  I agree that the pressure of that depth would be significant enough to diminish the explosive force above the destination point but the explosive force is in every direction, 3D.  This theory may be true and I would accept that it is somewhat likely but I wouldn\u2019t bet all life on it.  Fracking is already causing earthquakes/tremors and that\u2019s just because they pressurize an gas-filled pocket to force the gas up and out.  And, I fear that fracking may causes eruptions.  Eruptions are mostly caused by water favor/steam pressure finding a way out and then after the eruption, the liquid magma has a way out, too.  Yellowstone Park is actually a huge volcanic field.  The geysers release the pressure at a significant rate that the pressure does not become eruption-worthy.  But, Old Faithful is no longer faithful and other areas of the park are becoming more active.  If the geysers somehow no longer relieve the pressure, say because more water is pumped into the earth and turns to steam, Yellowstone could become a huge volcano and erupt.  So much ash that the farmlands in the Midwest are no longer producing and enough very small ash/dirt erupted into the sky that we experience less sunlight reaching the surface.  And the eruption would have enough force that it would make Tsar Bomba seems harmless.  Fault lines, especially in the US, would break apart.  Bye bye most of California.  I am a pessimist and we are all, by nature.  We fear and worry about the negatives for survival.

I&#39;ll have to ask a nuke colleague if the 1 megaton (for the Tsar bomb) shown here was some modification of the energy released, as a result of being under 1,086 atmospheres.

They also did it with huge conventional explosions. The analysis (written in the 70s) is now unclassified. Being curious (and working at a nuc engineering place), I read it.</b><br><br>First of all, an amazing fact: Despite being in direct contact with a nuclear explosion, <b>the water of the expanding bubble wall does not boil!</b> The pressure inside the bubble exceeds (by far) the vapor pressure of water. The water touching the blast can only boil during contraction of the bubble after it expands.<br><br>A deep (&gt; half mile) underwater nuclear explosion leaves no trace at the surface but hot, radioactive water rising from below. There are no bubbles because they were collapsed in the deep water and the gas inside them got dissolved into the water.<br><br> At its maximum diameter, a very large nuclear bomb creates a bubble about a half-mile wide in about one second.  But the expansion quickly becomes unsustainable because the amount of water pushed outward increases with the CUBE of the blast-bubble radius.<br><br>Then it quickly collapses because:<br><br>\u25ba Deep water pressure is <i>enormous.</i> It is the weight of the water above the explosion.<br><br>\u25ba The expansion reduces gas pressure, which decreases temperature.<br><br>\u25ba Water is  not compressible like sponge, styrofoam, wood, rock, or even solid metal. Water is nearly incompressible. Because of this, compressing that much of it  that fast absorbs a truly righteous  amount of energy.<br><br>\u25ba Vast amounts of energy are also absorbed by phase change (water becomes steam).<br><br>\u25ba Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability at the gas/water boundary causes &quot;fingers&quot; of water to extend into the bubble, increasing the boundary surface area, cooling the gas.<br><br>In about a second, the water pressure outside the bubble causes it to collapse back into a small sphere with very high gas pressure. This also takes one second. Then it rebounds, expanding again. This is repeated several times (3 or 4), but each rebound contains only about 40% of the energy of the previous cycle.<br><br>Blast bubbles from deep nuclear explosions become mere hot water in about six seconds and leave no small bubbles to float up to the surface. <br><br>This drastic loss of energy between cycles is caused in part by the extreme force of a nuclear explosion pushing the bubble wall outward supersonically (faster than the speed of sound in saltwater). The speed causes Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability. That is, the smooth inner wall surface becomes turbulent and fractal, with fingers and branches of cold ocean water extending into the bubble. That cold water cools the hot gas inside and causes it to condense. The bubble becomes less of a sphere and looks more like the Crab Nebula, the deviation of which from a smooth surface is also due to Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability.<br><br>Boiling in the contracting bubble acts like evaporation, cooling the bubble wall, and it is another reason that an oscillating blast bubble contains only 40% of the energy it had in the previous cycle.<br><br>During these hot gas oscillations, the bubble rises. This causes the blast bubble never to be perfectly spherical. Instead, the bottom of the bubble is flatter, and during contraction, it even tends to &quot;reach up&quot; toward the blast center. <br><br>In the last contraction cycle, the bottom of the bubble touches the top before the sides have fully collapsed, and the bubble becomes a torus in its last second of life. After six seconds, all that remains of a large nuclear explosion is a mass of hot water, slowly rising from the cold depths of the ocean.", "comment_date": "2018-08-20T18:55:04Z", "likes_count": 782}, {"comment_by": "Umrahpay", "comment_text": "so, we need to build a bigger nuclear bomb. lol", "comment_date": "2018-08-20T18:15:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fardin Khan", "comment_text": "Says nothing would happen<br><br><b>Radioactive water:</b> Hold my beer", "comment_date": "2018-08-20T17:26:14Z", "likes_count": 358}, {"comment_by": "Aymen Gabsi", "comment_text": "Perfection....", "comment_date": "2018-08-20T16:44:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chrisrezende", "comment_text": "Kurz...what?!", "comment_date": "2018-08-20T16:43:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quester91", "comment_text": "Your art style and animation is simply amazing, I love it.", "comment_date": "2018-08-20T15:35:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashik Amit", "comment_text": "You think nothing going to happen !!!

Proton-proton fusion is probably not a viable pathway, despite the density of protium in water, given its extremely small probability of occurring for any given interaction, but would it be at least hypothetically possible to initiate a proton-deuterium chain reaction in Earth\u2019s oceans, triggering a runaway fusion reaction (which, given the volume of the ocean and the quantity of deuterium therein, would trivially release enough energy to vaporize Earth and probably the Moon as well)?  From what (clumsy, amateurish) calculations I\u2019ve been able to make, given the known concentration of deuterium in seawater, the answer seems to be yes, but with the caveat that even the Tsar Bomba\u2019s energy was about a hundredfold too small to actually initiate such a reaction.

The ideal tsunami creator creates a permanent  (or at least one that lasts hours) displacement in the water measured in cubic miles.  A large bomb creates a bubble (a cavitation bubble, containing steam, not air) that expands against the pressure and then collapses, rebounds outward to a smaller diameter, collapses again, and continues the cycle until all the potential/kinetic energy is converted into heat.  That will create waves close in but not the long-period waves that are tsunamis.<br><br>Under huge pressure not even a bubble will be created.  Water is NOT incompressible, only relatively so compared to air.  If it were totally incompressible, it would not be able to transmit sound, which is a pure compression waveform.  Nothing I know of is totally incompressible, even neutronium in neutron stars transmits shock waves.    <br><br>Underwater bomb experiments:<br>    Crossroads/Baker - in 50 meters inside the Bikini lagoon, 20 kT.<br>    Wigwam - in 610 meters of water in the Pacific Ocean, 400 miles off LA, 30 kT.<br>    Hardtack I/Wahoo - in 150 meters outside Bikini Lagoon, 9 kT.<br>    Hardtack I/Umbrella - in 50 meters inside the lagoon, 9 kT.<br>    Dominic/Swordfish - in 198 meters in the Pacific Ocean, ASROC test, undisclosed yield.<br>    USSR #22 (Joe 17) - in 12 meters at Novaya Zemlya, 3.6 kT.

All the US tests and the USSR #22 are featured in videos on YT.<br><br>Radioactivity generated by the bomb is not a hazard.  First, there is no life as we know it in the trench.  No energy.  No smokers (they work at plate spread joints, not subduction), no sunlight, no currents, no nothing.  Secondly, water is a very good shield from radioactivity.  6 meters is enough to lower the worst radioactivity we have (fresh spent reactor fuel) to background. Third, nothing to spread the radioactivity around.  Too deep and protected from even the deepest circulation currents.  All material from the bomb will drop no farther from the blast than, say, a mile.  No bubble to the surface (too much pressure).<br><br>Oops: it appears that I am wrong about life in the trench.

While you are completely entitled to your views, and even though I agree with a fair bit of them, I personally would like to see that this channel be a bit more clear cut and less bias if possible. While there will always be some trace amount of bias, I do feel that it could definitely be lessened for the sake of raw information. This all being said, I have yet to dislike a single video, and if nothing were to change I would not be hurt one bit. I just find that sometimes bias can cloud up the information, and especially make it hard for some to differentiate from what is the creators opinion, and what is fact.

So your whole dance around the radioactive plumes etc is inaccurate at best and misleading at worst. Most of the effects would boil down to creating a few tons of heavy water via neutron irradiation, some radioactive sediment from &quot;starter&quot; fission charge (no more than 10 metric tonnes), a little bit of radioactive Krypton (no more than 50 kg according to a back-of-the-envelope calculation, which is just 8 cubic meters under normal conditions), and quite a bit of your garden-variety helium-4 (ionized). Almost all of the radioactive materials, with the exception of Krypton, will stay at the bottom of the sea. Also, tell your animator that illustrating a thermonuclear fusion-type bomb with a fission reaction is more than a bit misleading -- while a smaller fission bomb is used to start a fusion reaction, it&#39;s not where most of the yield comes from, not by a long shot.", "comment_date": "2018-07-23T00:04:52Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tarik Yildirim", "comment_text": "Harikas\u0131n\u0131z yine devam\u0131n\u0131 bekliyoruz sab\u0131rs\u0131zl\u0131kla", "comment_date": "2018-07-23T00:04:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stef\u00e1n \u00d6rvar Sigmundsson", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s do it!", "comment_date": "2018-07-23T00:04:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Haroldo Payares", "comment_text": "So we got riddle video that magnify consequences and this video that nulify consequences, I&#39;m not an expert, detonate a nuke in the mariana trench won&#39;t do all that riddle video told but we can&#39;t take that situation like a taking a hike as this video suggest.", "comment_date": "2018-07-23T00:04:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Rasmussen", "comment_text": "Thanks, been saying this for years.

This would spread all over one if not all of our oceans eventually. The Radio active fallout would delude once spread enough around our oceans and maybe its low enough for life to survive. Sadly this won&#39;t be true for the ocean the detention happens. In a week or two we would see lots of dead marine life within 1000km.  Everything from Whales, to tiny fish would be floating around dead having  the base of their food chain demolished to a extreme degree, effectively starving to death. Predator animals wouldn&#39;t starve so easily, thye may just get sick from eatting radio active fish, but they would leave seeking other prey in other oceans. This would drastically change the ecosystem of that ocean It would effect us humans that much but it will me less fish food will be on the table for awhile.
