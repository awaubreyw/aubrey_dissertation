Which is directly influenced by surface area.  The mouse has a much larger surface area compared to it&#39;s weight  which means it&#39;s terminal velocity (the maximum speed it can reach while falling) is much smaller. The mouse doesn&#39;t have enough weight to counteract the resistance it encounters pushing it&#39;s way through the air. Consequently the bonds in its cells have with one another and the ability of it&#39;s bones to resist breaking are enough to counteract the impact from it&#39;s speed while falling.  The force of the impact being greatly influenced by the mass of the mouse and the speed at which it is falling.<br><br>If the elephant and the wolf shared the same ratio of surface area to mass.  They would fall at roughly the same speed.<br><br>Think of it like this.  You fall out of a plane and you&#39;ll have roughly a set terminal velocity.  Now you add a parachute.  Well according to this video your size has increased so you should fall faster.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

That is not true. Neither size or mass determine how big the effect of gravity (which in this context means speed in free fall, I suppose) is. The mass of an object determines the FORCE, and the size impacts the AIR RESISTANCE that counteracts the force of gravity. So one could say that the density of the object (but also its shape) determine the terminal velocity.

Like yes a cube that has side length of 1m has a volume of 1m cubed. And a cube that has side length 1,000m has a volume of 1,000,000,000m. But it also has a side length of 1km and a volume of 1km^3. Its built into the units. That 1m box also has a side length of 1,000mm and 1,000,000,000 mm^3.

(mg) which is gravity times mass which gives us the force of gravity (Fg). Fg=mg As we incrase the mass, force incrases. <br>Second formula is momentum. P=mv. Momentum is basicly how strong is an object according to its mass and velocity. When we release an object from the top of a building, a mountain or something higher than sea level, its potential energy turns into the kinetic energy, which is 1/2 m v squared. So from the formula, we can understand that it has a velocity now and it incrases over time. According to the momentum formula, velocity increases. However, it still depends on the mass.

Instead of referring the the volatility and combustibility obtaining to the shorter alkane chain molecules which are blended in sligthly higher ratios in higher octane fuels to produce a slightly more energetic burn, they define it in vague terms saying that octane is a measure of how little an engine is damaged by the fuel. The higher the &quot;octane&quot; (they say) the lower the damage and then they reveal that Shell has a new 99 RON high octane fuel. They want us to buy it and pay the premium. Time to call the advertising Standards Agency. This is miss-selling. Just as corrupt as the VW emissions scandal. For many cars there is simply no benefit in using 99 RON or 98 RON when the engine is configured for 95 RON. Disgusting oil companies. One day they will be bought out and broken up by Tesla.

For example, when a species survives a wide scale event thanks to a genetic mutation-as a result of evolution- people often describe it as an &quot;evolutionary response&quot; or behave as though there was some conscious force driving the mutation towards the best possible outcome. Really, evolutionary mutations are completely random. Whether or not a species survives depends on whether one member HAPPENS to develop a mutation that would allow it and its offspring to better survive. This is why a lot of...less scientific individuals can think that evolution is hokey, because they think the theory entails some kind of ultra convenient series of sequential, back to back changes. Let me say that I by NO means blame people for describing it as a kind of natural engineering, evolution, by its very nature, suggests that evolved species are almost statistically certain to be in some way superior to their predecessors, that&#39;s HOW the mutation endures in the first specimen and persists through multiple generations. Because so many mutations will happen over a long period of time, we only pay attention to the &quot;evolved&quot; traits, because they made a difference. As a result, people who aren&#39;t as educated on evolution think that it seems all too convenient. <br>I think the best explanation on the nature of evolution was given by Stephen Hawking on a show he had (I believe it was on PBS), where he had a group of people engage in an experiment involving blindfolds, a sort of clay, a catapult, and a castle tower.

This means all of that force not only hit the pavement but went into the elephant as well due to the 3rd law. You would think the bigger something is the more mass it has but that isn&#39;t true ether. A 12 foot square foam could have less mass than than a 10 inch ball of lead.

Now imagine some scale that is larger than our observable universe, beyond anything we know how to observe. What if things at that scale operate on some crazy physics that we also can&#39;t comprehend, and to entities at that scale, our physics are as foreign as quantum physics are to us.

On the other hand, the elephant has way too much inertia to be stopped gradually enough by the mattresses to save its life. the part of the elephant that hits the ground first was not designed to hold up 4-25x an elephant&#39;s weight. the g-forces experienced on impact is what makes the elephant feel 4-25x heavier. so when it makes impact, the bottom has nowhere to go except sideways as the rest of the elephant crushes down on it.<br><br>No disrespect intended.", "comment_date": "2017-08-10T23:22:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zainabbahelmi", "comment_text": "No real animals were harmed in the making of this video.

Though it does gain some mass by having more air inside, with respect to the atmosphere around the mass is far more distributed. In the case of helium balloons, hot air balloons, and great blimps, while still effectively more massive than their deflated counterparts, their density is far less than that of air, allowing them to not just fall slower, but upward until they reach the low-density areas of the atmosphere.<br><br>Animals aren&#39;t like balloons, in that their volume tends to be filled and supported by solid mass. As their size increases, the amount of stress they experience on any part of their body becomes exponential. Ancient animals such as dinosaurs could reach greater sizes thanks to their hollowed out, air-tight bones, in addition to the greater oxygen content at their time. Whales can grow even larger, as the water they swim through helps support their weight, with air and fat keeping their bodies buoyant.<br><br>Even if an animal were to be more balloon-like regarding density, the sheer length of their bodies will cause a number of other changes. For one, signals from the brain to the body take longer. Blood must travel further to deliver oxygen. Increased volume will decrease heat dissipation. Assuming surface area to volume ratio remains consistent, just enough to allow them to overcome air resistance, the animal&#39;s metabolism and response time would decrease as a byproduct. They&#39;d work effectively the same, but slower.<br><br>Why does a fly so easily evade your attempts to swat it? Though having a far smaller brain that would reduce its memory and data processing capacity, its reaction time is far faster. Its signals have far less length to move through, allowing for immediate response to stimuli. Of course, since it has mass and has to move through air, its reaction time won&#39;t be enough to overcome the difficulty of moving its mass through a resisting medium. Because you have greater length, in addition to mass that allows you to overcome air resistance, the ends of your arms will have greater potential velocity than the fly when swung. With your bare hands, and a well-timed strike, you can splatter a fly... though it&#39;d be easier to just use a fly swatter.", "comment_date": "2017-08-10T19:39:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ktoq toq", "comment_text": "Nature is freakin&#39; perfect", "comment_date": "2017-08-10T19:39:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blizz", "comment_text": "I am a simple man.

Another misconception: gravity has nearly the same effect regardless of size (at least when considering a range between an ant and an elephant - see how constant g=9.81 m/s is considered as rather constant on earth).

Evolution has to engineer things I thought Evolution was random natural selection how can an engineer or anything unless there is a Creator behind it doing the engineering. See Evolution doesn&#39;t work when you get into the nitty-gritty of biology for example the fairy fly. The fairy fly obviously was modified with forethought into a creature that could live in that environment that it lives in. So God controls evolution sort of like how engineers in Munich control the next evolution of the BMW. The world is just too complex for Godless natural selection and that&#39;s the world much less the universe my God how much more complex can you get and the more we learned about it rogue planets binary pulsars black holes which may go into the quantum mechanical Realm with the singularity then we can speak of possible quantum gravity. So then we get into the quantum mechanical area spooky action-at-a-distance where you have a spin and that spin is mimicked by a particle on the other side of the Galaxy but when you change the spin of one particle in automatically changes the spin of the other particle. Or Quantum tunneling so one thing lead in the other disproving how complex the world in the universe really is. I&#39;m not some bible-thumping creationist I don&#39;t believe in biblical creation I just believe that God has been there and he will always be there and we maybe just one of his whims.
