It is going to be awesome if you guys come up with a new video related to this topic or even a whole series of videos. I really think there are people who will agree with this idea.

It spawns five single-target, melee Barbarians with moderate hitpoints and damage. They wield short swords and have blonde hair and moustaches. They are the same as those spawned by the Barbarian Hut, Battle Ram, and the Barbarian Barrel. A Barbarians card costs 5 Elixir to deploy. Strategy The Barbarians are a great option to use against enemy troops such as tanks and medium size pushes as the Barbarians have a moderate amount of hitpoints and damage, and are perfect for attacks with other tanks. Although they are very effective against single target troops like the Prince, Barbarians are susceptible to spells and troops which do area damage due to their slow move-speed. Their slow attack speed also leaves them vulnerable to swarms such as the Skeleton Army.\r<br>\r<br>Despite being a swarm unit, Barbarians are fairly effective against an Electro Giant due to their high DPS and their moderately higher hitpoints compared to other swarm units, allowing them to survive the Electro Giant&#39;s reflected damage and defeat him for a +3 Elixir trade, but they will likely die in the process or have an insignificant amount of remaining health. Note that since the Barbarians will have little health remaining, any sort of damage dealt to them besides the Electro Giant&#39;s reflected damage will often nullify their defense, so the player should account for supporting troops or accompanying the Electro Giant as well. Due to the amount of counters to a Barbarian and most resulting in a positive Elixir trade for the opponent, it is ineffective to deploy a group of Barbarians without support in one lane, as they can be easily countered due to their slow speed and can leave the player vulnerable to a push in the other lane. However, if the opponent is extremely low on Elixir, or their best counters are out of rotation, they can be very effective at forcing the opponent to spend Elixir poorly, as they can quickly chop down cheap troops and will completelv destrov a Crown Tower by\r<br>\r<br>themselves. They are excellent for taking out low numbers of enemy troops such as the Prince or Musketeer on the player&#39;s side. The 5 Barbarians will quickly eliminate the unit if they are dropped directly on top of it, surrounding it. The Barbarians can be effectively countered by most ranged splash troops such as the Bomber and Wizard from a distance. However, you must be careful as the opponent can use a Tornado or Freeze to immobilize or destroy the splash attacker, allowing the Barbarians to devastate the Crown Tower. A powerful counter is the Fireball; the damage and radius of the spell is more than enough to one-shot the Barbarians. However, keep in mind that if the Fireball is underleveled, or if the Barbarians are overleveled, it will not one-shot them. Additionally, the Barbarians can also act as a bait for these counters, allowing you to use other cards that would be weak to Fireball, such as Zappies. Poison can also be an effective counter to use. Its damage over time will eliminate the Barbarians and any supporting troops. However, as with Fireball, it will not defeat Barbarians with a level higher than the Poison. A Rocket can also defeat them, however it is a negative Elixir trade. It is best to be used if the Barbarians are assisted with another card Rage used with Barbarians can do severe damage to a Crown Tower, as it is hard to stop because Rage increases movement and attack speed. The Barbarians together have high damage and can make short work of a tower before the opponent stops them. They are very effective at defeating enemy tanks due to their numbers (5 of them), high combined damage, and ability to tank most spells. Support troops will have trouble defeating them due to their combined hitpoints. If the combo happens to be any ground-based splash damage card + ground- based melee tank, wait for the troops to cross the river. As soon as they cross, immediately drop the Barbarians upon the splash card. They will surround and destroy it quickly before moving on to eliminate the now unsupported tank. This can result in a large positive elixir trade. However, if there is more than one splash unit, the Barbarians are likely to be taken out immediately. Note that this may be ineffective against a P.E.K.K.A. as she can one-shot Barbarians up to 2 levels higher. They are very effective against Hog Riders and Ram Riders. Not only do they deal a lot of damage to these troops, but their high mass and slight spread forces the Hog Rider and Ram Rider to go around them, extending their distance from the Princess Tower. Because of this, the Barbarians can easily defeat these units with no damage to the Princess Tower. The Barbarians, if placed early enough, can surround the Princess Tower, making it less vulnerable to attacks from a Goblin Barrel. They can handle it quite well with only minimal damage done. However, this is a 5 Elixir investment so consider using it if you lack better counters. Splitting the Barbarians in the back can discourage the opponent from attacking either Princess Tower, due to the Barbarians&#39; defensive presence, and spells will not have as much value. However, they are slow moving and as such, the opponent might deal some unnecessary damage before the Barbarians arrive on their target. Due to beina 5 of them, thev can act as a Lightning rod for more fragile units like a Magic Archer or a Flying Machine. 2 of them will also survive for extra protection for the guarded fragile units.

Quantum computers use probability or the 5th dimension to rule out improbable super positioning.  By having super positioning or the six dimension they are able to solve probability equations in the 5th dimension.  By ruling out improbability the computer only needs to calculate a smaller number of equations to arrive at the solution to the equation.   As more checks are added the probability keeps narrowing the number of possible outcomes until its at 100%.  Though, the name quantum computers is misleading.  Regular computers are also quantum in that they speed up time we can solve equations at the 4th dimension.  the fact that quantum computers are only able to deduce equations at the 5th dimension rather than the 6th dimension means its not able to out perform the human brain which accesses at least the 7th dimension or connection parallel time lines..", "comment_date": "2021-11-17T19:07:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler", "comment_text": "But can it run Minecraft?", "comment_date": "2021-11-17T12:28:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uc815\uc2e0\ubcd1\uc790", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a>", "comment_date": "2021-11-17T08:06:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dave W", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve learned that it&#39;s time to unplug from the net.", "comment_date": "2021-11-17T06:08:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MadduxMozerella", "comment_text": "What&#39;s the next step after quantum computers", "comment_date": "2021-11-17T03:33:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "A Fenwick", "comment_text": "I understood the plumbus a lot better than this..", "comment_date": "2021-11-17T00:10:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "F\u00e1bio", "comment_text": "ok, who programmed our simulation", "comment_date": "2021-11-16T22:45:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MadRockstar3302", "comment_text": "He is talking about 14nm but now 2nm has come...

It&#39;s a double edged sword since this wave of SaaS and stuff like it is another blow to the entire concept of ownership of your own property, and I&#39;ve got some massive issues with that. However, if we finally update the regulations on that or society shifts to make such anti-customer practices untenable, we might be able to use it without too much harm. The benefits are nothing to sneeze at after all. It&#39;s not just good for medicine, and database searches aren&#39;t just boring fact retrieval jobs. Quantum computing would do some fairly terrifying things to video game servers.

Using quantum computation to simulate our environment. Maybe it will be a while, but it will be simulated to increasing degrees of complexity, eventually becoming indistinguishable from the real thing. This is that weird mystical space where the objective and subjective universes converge, and you see the fractal of existence create self repeating patterns inside the simulation. Then the thought occurs, &quot;Just what is consciousness?&quot; Our brains can perform the computations that give rise to consciousness, but all matter is doing computations, just not in a meaningful way so we say it lacks consciousness and is not living. But maybe it is doing meaningful computations, it&#39;s just not anything that we limited humans are capable of understanding so we call it non living. So could it be that non living is just a human misconception, and the whole universe is one big brain doing meaningful computation across eternity? Now we&#39;re talking about God. The sum of all computations through time and space, and we are each part of this process. <br>       As outlandish as this sounds to people, this is actually an idea explored in ancient myths. Brahma is a Hindu god that dreams the universe. What does that sound like to you? Brahma can be likened to the computer, the simulation is the dream. There is an Isaac Asimov story called The Last Question that contains a similar idea as well. Kurzgesagt put out another Asimov story in a video called The Egg that contains an idea related to this.

For one, what is this &quot;quantum gate&quot; that you portray as a simple ring in the video?  I analogize that this would have to be similar to an ALU in a processor, which generally requires a ripple of logic events to occur before the final bits could be set to something new. This takes time. So does the transport of the electron to the &quot;quantum gate&quot;. As far as I can tell, all this time to access these bits are going to add up to a time that is for now, longer than the time it takes for normal processors to complete the same calculation. <br>We also need to consider the entire apparatus that allows a quantum bit to be stored in a stable environment to be counted as part of the overall size of the equivalent flop-transistor module it is replacing.

World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity; Similar is the case of money stolen by a thief who hides the ill-gotten money and then misuses it or commits more misdeeds; \u201cwho does not owe it does not fear it\u201d. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies.

I have no clue how they perform things, and I know that they are slower in some tasks. However, in some specialized tasks they are much much faster and that is why we are trygin to achieve them. They will probably not replace &quot;normal&quot; computers of today, they will be used alongside with them in time probably. For the current time, they are massive and they require a lot more tahn a normal consumer computer requires to run, just like the computers back in 60s and 70s. They will evolve, we are sure about that and we migh aswell use the information we have about the quantum computers and how they work to make our transistors even smaller than 3nm in the future. They will probably take many years since we are not really in 7nm era (even tho companies tell us that we are using 7nm chips in our computers, they are not really 7nm chips. They are just redesigned 12nm chips. They are still so small an so efficent tho. I am pretty sure the real 7nm will come in few years but what we have right now is still very hard for them to produce.), and since shrinking those transsitors reqiure more and more effort these days, we might need the quentum knowledge sooner than we think.<br><br><br><br><br>Anyways, I went a little offtopic there but I love the concept of this computers. I like how they are uncertain about their state and we are using that to our benefit to make things faster. This  is just really great for us and I am pretty sure some really hard task like space exploration will be a lot easier when we get the feeling of quantum computing in time.

This isn&#39;t anywhere near the potential of an actual functioning quantum computer, but it shows enormous progress. The raw processing power of their machine is 1081.08 times greater than that of a conventional supercomputer, an unimaginable leap in computational capability, and by my reckoning, theirs isn&#39;t even the best quantum computer currently in development.

An iPhone XS or later has a transistor size of 7 nm, which was pretty revolutionary since it was one of the only devices to be mass-produced with such an architecture. In the past year, however, 7 nm transistors are becoming more prevalent in PCs. In 2019, 5 nm technology has become commercialized, though not on a massive scale. Even now, Samsung has announced they plan to commercialize 3 nm technology.<br><br><br>The important thing to note here is that we design these transistors often decades before they become commercial. For example, 10 nm technology was first designed in the 1980s before being created in 2002 and commercialized in 2016. Currently, the smallest transistor created is at 2.3 nm, which may signal that we are at an end for transistors, considering how the disparity between the size of created transistors and the size of commercialized transistors has diminished greatly.<br><br><br>Currently, some major nanotech research firms have considered 14-angstrom transistors (14\u00c5, one angstrom is 10^-10 meters, 1 ten-billionth), which is about half the width of a DNA helix, by around 2025.

In that case you either get a confusing answer from a qubit, or most of the information is useless in it.<br>   You also said that at the point of measurement the qubit falls out of superposition. That implies to me that it would constantly have to fall in and out of superposition whenever it&#39;s changed inside a computer. Because if you want to know what information a qubit is carrying, you have to measure it, and to change it in a meaningful way, you have to know what information it has.

Quadrovegillion combinations, say 1 try takes about 2 seconds which when you start working with those massive numbers with over 60 zeros takes much longer, but for simplicity sake, lets say it&#39;s 2 secs per try. It would take over a vigillion years to do so. Do you know how much time that is? In that much time our universe will have no stars, most likely will experience another big bang and the entirety of the universe will be gas, then that gas thanks to gravity will make stars, which will explode and make planted and so on and so forth, that will happen over 2300 times before the so called super computer is done decrypting the password. <br><br>For crying out loud stop making these videos where you represent the new cutting edge technology when you have no idea where it will be used. The fact is that quantum computing can be sort of virtualized through running complex algorithms and optimizing the searches which ultimately increases the hardware demand but also in some cases makes a lot of sense.<br>For example, I made a bot for Microsoft rewards to steal from bills massive fortune of over 80 billion dollars. <br>Now instead of making the bot run in series meaning run account after account, I made it get unsearched accounts, regroup them into N amount of chunks and make a new session for each to run on and run N bots in parallel. This increases your productivity N amount of times if you meet the optimal requirements where the each bot will run at its fastest.<br>If you did the same thing, ran 10 bots at q time and by doing that you increase the boot time by 8 secs, your bot is better off running 7 ACC&#39;s at a time (which is a number that was a result of complex math I did.<br>I&#39;ve also done similar things in database searches. When you search for a certain name in a database, and you only have a first name, you can make 4 different chunks each having 1/4 of the total amount of names and then run search with a basic for loop, you make it 4 times faster but also much harder on your CPU. So instead of making a super computer, get a CPU that has a lot of cores and threads, make a language that can optimally make use of each core and then use that language as a foundation for other languages which will be used on high end machines.<br>Would make the FBI database searches much faster, but since they are too stupid to think of it themselves I have to be the one to present this solution to inovation clubs to be told &quot;that would take a lot of time and effort, also requires a lot of change and would lead to a lot of jobs being lost so not a good business idea&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-12-12T22:47:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesse", "comment_text": "Is that a tardis at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28&amp;t=3m54s\">3:54</a>?", "comment_date": "2018-12-12T17:32:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ido", "comment_text": "A top channel and minecraft channel are here.

We know what molecules are, things like H2O. The H2O molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Atoms consist of protons, neutrons and electrons. Electrons cannot be further divided! That means they are a quantum particle. Neutrons and electrons consist of quarks, of which there are only 6: up, down, top, bottom, charm and strange. These quarks are held together by something called gluons, which create a very strong bond between the quarks. <br>In particle physics, we have three groups: the quarks (mentioned above), the leptons and the bosons. The quark sare the building blocks for protons and neutrons and are bound together by gluons, a boson. The electron belongs to the leptons, just like tau and muon. These three all have a charge of negative 1, but they also have a neutral counterpart called the electron, tau and muon neutrinos, which have a charge of 0. These 6 particles are the leptons and do not mess with things like gluons. Electrons can exchange energy in the form of photons, the light &#39;particle&#39;. Then there are the W and Z bosons, which are responsible for the process of radioactivity and mess with the neutrinos. They are also able to change the nature of a quark, so transforming an up quark in a strange quark for example. Lastly we have the famous Higgs boson, the particle that gives mass to other particles.<br>Now to summarize, we have 17 particles, 6 quarks, 6 leptons and 5 bosons. The quarks are the &#39;matter&#39; particles, the leptons are the other ingredient for the formation of atoms and are essential for the charge of a molecule and the bosons are the particles that carry the four fundamental forces. The photon governs electromagnetic force, the gluon governs the strong nuclear force, the W and Z bosons govern the weak nuclear force and the higgs boson governs mass (the Higgs field is responsible for gravity itself).", "comment_date": "2018-09-07T17:39:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Batrisya Aisyah", "comment_text": "@#////////////7777777777777!77!6!66!66!!6!66!6!^!6!^!6!!!56^2&amp;2&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;^/^^^66&amp;66^/^&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;***,@-", "comment_date": "2018-09-07T04:03:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TR\u00c5ILBL\u00c5ZER", "comment_text": "Quantum computing will change the future", "comment_date": "2018-09-07T02:35:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SaltedCheesePizza", "comment_text": "My computer gets jealous whenever I watch this video.", "comment_date": "2018-09-06T22:40:13Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Rojas", "comment_text": "Woah, is this why when I\u2019m talking on the phone &amp; I want to lock my phone, if I think about hanging up instead of locking the phone, it\u2019ll hang up!

This curiosity gets even more meaningful when artisans are converted by literary scientists or screenwriters. Science fiction lovers These films, which have a futuristic story like The Return to the Future, The Minority Report, Star Trek or Ben Robot, are always delighted to watch the future with breathtaking graphics of the future depicted. What kind of future could we have thought if we looked at the future not only from science-fiction but from science? Scientific principles clearly explain what we can build in the future or what we can not build. For example, today, when engineers consider the principles of mechanistic physics when designing rockets sent to space, keeping these principles in mind holds us as close as we can imagine how these rockets could be built in the future. In this article we will also talk about the future of one of the most important products of the technology revolution, considering the knowledge: the future of the computer.<br><br>Today, computers in at least one house are undoubtedly one of the integral parts of the technology revolution. The first vacuum computers that cover a large room have emerged since the 1950s, a little over a half a century, computers have shrunk to the size of a handful today and become devices that everyone can easily have. Undoubtedly, the underlying reason for the developments that take place at this incredible speed is, of course, the exponential growth in computer power. To understand this growth, we can give an example that the singing teddy bears are once more powerful than the computer powers the world&#39;s greatest armies possess.<br><br>Can these developments in advanced computer technology continue this way forever?<br><br>To understand this we need to talk about Moore&#39;s Law. This law takes the name of Gordon Moore from the founders of the name of Intel. Moore&#39;s law briefly says that the power of the computer will double in 18 months. When we think of the example we mentioned above, it is not against our intuitions. As we have seen from our historical perspective, the law is getting tough. On the other hand, even today&#39;s most advanced computers are far below the processing capacity of a human brain, but if this law continues to be valid, half a century later computers can go beyond the processing capacity of the human brain. This leads to another debate, arguing that artificial intelligence will destroy humanity, but we will not talk about it here. What we are trying to emphasize is how important this law is.<br><br>Now that I&#39;m back in charge, can the Moore&#39;s Law last forever? Unfortunately, our response is no. Even Gordon Moore himself claimed in 2007 that this law had a life span of about 20 years. The whole magic may seem to be corrupted, but the answer is based on a cause of physics that is not related to technology, which is why it is no. Now we will explain this in the light of the scientific principles we emphasize at the beginning of the article.<br><br>We talked about Moore&#39;s law, but we did not talk about the reason behind the exponential growth of computer power. The main reason for this is the transistors. As these electronic components are miniaturized, the computer power increases inversely. So the point to be reached when explaining the no answer is to find out how far we can shrink the transistors.<br><br>The main problem here is that the Heisinberg Uncertainty principle, which is one of the basic principles of quantum physics when transistors are reduced to the level of atoms, comes into play. Practically, the uncertainty principle allows the transistors to be reduced to a certain size, not later. This principle simply states that the position and speed of an electron can not be determined at the same moment. The effect of this is that when the electronic components on the computer chip become smaller, the electrons leak out of the wires, which means short circuit. So, as a result, we can be found in some assumptions, taking into account the physics laws about the future of the computer power.<br><br>According to the theoretical physicist Michio Kaku, the validity of Moore&#39;s law will gradually come to an end soon after 2020 or sooner, and if the Silicon Valley does not have a new technology, it will slowly return to the passepart. According to the physical laws Silicon Age will eventually end and we will enter the Post-Silicon Age.<br><br>So far we&#39;ve talked about the future of the computer, but even now, even though there is a device that we have encountered in almost every corner of our life, we have not talked about which areas or how it can be used in the future. Here we will talk about a few of the predictions Michio Kaku made in the Physics of the Future book.<br><br>&quot;When we enter a room today, we are automatically looking for a power button, because we assume that there is electricity on the walls. The first thing we do when we enter a room in the future is to look for the internet portal, because we&#39;ll think the room is smart. &quot;<br><br>Michio Kaku<br><br>One of the most important technological developments that can shape our future world may be the contact lenses that can connect to the internets.<br><br>Babak Parviz from Washington University has succeeded in producing a prototype contact lens in 2008. One of the main objectives of this first prototype is to help in regulating the level of sugar in the blood of diabetic patients. The way to do this is as follows: The ratio of sugar in the tear fluid gives information about the sugar directly on the side. When the lenses are used for this purpose, they play a regulatory role in feeding the diabetics, which gives them a better life. But it would not make much sense to limit this to a single purpose, as these lenses could be developed to provide up-to-date information about our bodies in the future. Not only for the healthcare industry, it is not even different than the phones in our pockets when these lenses are connected to the internet. It opens a new door to us in digital life. Parviz, who is already a miracle in Google Glass, seems to be on the way to making a giant step in this area.<br><br>Finally, it is worth mentioning the new giant area reached by the computer revolution, because this area seems to have opened up to the developer of the door to the end. As can be guessed, this area is the automotive sector. We see the effects of computer technology in the automotive sector in more driverless vehicle technology.<br><br>Driverless vehicle technology has often been mentioned by Tesla models in recent years, but this technology lasts until the 1980s. This area also has military purposes. DARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) organizes driverless vehicle contests in order to enable the American land forces to manage themselves. First in 2004, he competed in the Mojave desert with the Grand Challenge. The autonomous vehicle that completed the race in the first race was the vehicles that successfully completed the 96 kilometer track in the city traffic in the later organized competitions.<br><br>Nowadays, vehicles are 30% electronically connected, but in the future it is expected to reach 80%. Tesla, the biggest candidate to become the symbol of this great change, is doing great work in the automotive technology as well as electric vehicle technology. A Tesla model, which recently detected the accident in the middle of the night and stopped the car itself, waved a big echo.<br><br>The ever-increasing population and people demanding automobiles will inevitably lead to bigger traffic problems in the future and therefore more traffic accidents. It will be possible to reduce the loss of life and property to the minimum level with autonomous vehicles with advanced software and to reduce traffic intensity. This clearly shows us that computer technology will be an integral part of our life in our future.", "comment_date": "2017-11-06T15:08:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "doppelcipher", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28&amp;t=0m07s\">0:07</a><br><br><br><br>where&#39;s red and yellow then<br>(you get refernece)", "comment_date": "2017-11-06T05:16:34Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "iTuberGuy", "comment_text": "was i supposed to understand any of this???", "comment_date": "2017-11-06T00:15:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quoteve", "comment_text": "I want to play video games on such a thing and see how far I could push it until it breaks.", "comment_date": "2017-11-05T20:05:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ness", "comment_text": "I have no clue what you said.....", "comment_date": "2017-11-05T19:19:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vasel bur", "comment_text": "hehe Quantumcomper is the next Generation for us Humans, =1000000Qbits will make an Android like a Superhero. :)", "comment_date": "2017-11-04T21:34:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Flame_Wolf", "comment_text": "<b>reads title</b> ITS A GREY OBLONGE PILL.

How would a computer process even be able to function on such unpredictability, since that&#39;s the foundation of computers. The only way i could see how this would be faster is that it allows the process to get smaller and faster, but at the same time it seems like there would be a delay caused by the time it takes for the Qubit to match the value required for the specific process that the computer is attempting to run.

Let me answer some basic questions and myths I hear a lot.<br>1. quantum computing lets computers process in parallel as if you had multiple chips.<br>     yes and no (also a superposition of both yes and no). The specifics of this are very complicated and involve a relatively deep understanding of quantum mechanics, but here goes: a qubit does not exist in some random state, but as a probability distribution amplitude in complex (referring to the imaginary plane) vector space. Multiple qubits then interfere with each other&#39;s amplitudes (in the logic gates mentioned in the video) causing destructive interference with &quot;unlikely scenarios&quot; and constructive for for the &quot;likely scenarios.&quot; Eventually the interference patters culminate in one or a set of &quot;probably right&quot; answer(s). <br>2. quantum computing will lead to a huge boost in computing power<br>     yes, but only under strict conditions. Making your home computer quantum would probably not lead to a large increase in power and may even decrease your computer&#39;s speed. Quantum computers are really useful for solving the problems referenced in the video along with a handful of others. <br>3. quantum computers will be everywhere.<br>    NO. a big fat no on this one. Quantum computers require a very special set of circumstances. Most important of all is that the quantum system be very well isolated. It is very hard to isolate a system of qubits from the environment, and the greater the number of qubits the harder this becomes.<br>4. Quantum computers are the next big thing.<br>    Maybe. personally I think we&#39;re more likely to have molecular computers before quantum ones that are practical. Think of it like a transitional state. Quantum computing is coming, but maybe we need an extra step in there that is more in line with traditional computing", "comment_date": "2017-07-20T02:38:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EbinBoi", "comment_text": "Cant wait to p\u00f6lay minecraft with this.", "comment_date": "2017-07-19T15:33:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rocket League Moments", "comment_text": "This actually made a lot of sense to me lol", "comment_date": "2017-07-19T13:21:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Albert M", "comment_text": "I know capitalism gets a bad rep these days, but that is honestly what is needed to spur innovation<br>Unless you can get a computer that is cheap and something a consumer can use, it will not escape the private sector and thus, little innovation and usage will come out of it<br>Just came from Linus video on which a quantum computer is the size of a room and is 10 million dollars<br>If you asked a scientist who built the nuclear bomb in the 1940s if a computer will fit inside your pocket, they will call you ridiculous <br>And yet, now it is that way.<br>Same thing with quantum computers<br>Unless I can get one at the price of my phone, it is fundemantally useless in creating any new innovation", "comment_date": "2017-07-19T12:45:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike", "comment_text": "What dafuq", "comment_date": "2017-07-19T05:46:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niffirg Gee", "comment_text": "So if the universe is a simulation, does that mean particles are qubits?", "comment_date": "2017-07-19T04:38:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ViruCide", "comment_text": "imagine the amount of power that could go into a quantum hard drive :0", "comment_date": "2017-07-18T00:05:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Comrade Maethor", "comment_text": "My computer is really good.

Alternatively, if you do not apply a force and simply measure a force naturally applied to a particle, you measure the state the particle was in at the moment that force was applied to it.<br>Quantum level or not, a white wall reflects light in the spectrum we perceive as white. The act of looking at the wall doesn&#39;t change its properties on any level. The only difference is that on a subatomic level, the light we rely on to see the wall is causing state changes in the wall its self.<br>Trying to determine where a photon is by shining light on it is like trying to determine where a golf ball is by spraying a fire hose at it.

In your hard drive(memory). There is a magnetic film that is made up of tiny magnetic grains. We group a small portion of these grains in what we call a bit. All the groups together form a magnetic pattern. Each small group again is what we call a bit. 0 and 1 represent the direction of the bits magnetization. aka (It can go either up or down ).So Down would be 0. and up would be one. There is a little tool that reads the magnetization of the bit and tells the computer its a 1 or zero. 8 bits form a byte. we use this to determine letters. 01000001 is Capital &quot;A&quot;. This is all your memory. We&#39;re reaching our limit in that we have tried to &quot;sqush&quot; the grains together as close as possible to form more memory. but they eventually intertwine with each other causing loss of data.  Modules are a group of functions that you can pass information to in order to get a certain outcome(the outcome depending on the information you&#39;re passing in).  The logic gates(which are within the modules) take the information passed in and use that to determine the transistors on and off state. This forms a program.

Earth had the necessary critical ingredients, including a large dollop of water, a rotating moon to give it balance, a magnetic field to keep out interference, and a spark here or there that led to a wildly mutating replicator called life. In due course, and for a very tiny moment, planetary life evolved into a planetary civilization which also achieved its place in the sun, or so it seemed. And it all culminated in an ultimate computer which just so happened to have as its reason for existing the burning desire of making perfect toast.<br>And it was that ultimate machine that Dave and Babs Benedick welcomed to their home, although they didn\u2019t know it at the time, and never would. <br>Babs was not impressed.<br>\u201cAnother toaster? We have one already that works just fine!\u201d<br>\u201cBut this one is special,\u201d said Dave. \u201cBesides, it was on sale at the local \u2018BestBot\u2019.\u201d<br>\u201cYou mean that intelligent appliance store? Aren\u2019t they going out of business?\u201d<br>\u201cFor forever, it seems,\u201d said Dave. \u201cBut this time it\u2019s likely for good, and you came blame perhaps this little machine.\u201d<br>Babs looked at the little appliance and frowned.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that ultimate to me. It\u2019s just a squat metal box with 8 adjustable slots on its top, and with bright red buttons on its front arranged to give it a weird smiley face.\u201d<br>Dave shook his head and smiled. \u201cBut this is the Bollix 9000, the ultimate toaster! It\u2019s not only intelligent, but it doesn\u2019t need upgrading, ever! You know we have been always upgrading our major appliances to keep up with the Jones\u2019, but now we don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to believe,\u201d said Babs. \u201cPlaces like Bestbot have always made their money by selling the next best thing, even though it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s hard to see the added value in this little thing.\u201d<br>\u201cAh, but it\u2019s in the insides where there\u2019s a difference,\u201d said Dave. \u201cThe box is powered a quantum processor, and is connected automatically to the net. It\u2019s the ultimate appliance. A quantum processor powers our new refrigerator too; don\u2019t you know? These processors have infinite computing power, something that you really need to make a good slice of toast!\u201d<br>\u201cOh, really?\u201d exclaimed Babs.<br>\u201cOf course,\u201d said Dave. \u201cPerfect toast is a very finicky thing. It comes in many shades and degrees, and can pop up at any time. Timing, tone, and temperature are critical, and the machine has to instantly sense not only my preferences, but also my momentary hunger and whims.\u201d<br>\u201cAnd how does it do that?\u201d<br>\u201cBy polling the net, where our lives are really stored! All of our behavior is monitored and uploaded to the cloud, governed by the benevolent Skynet. It charts our behavior, anticipates our desires, supplies our needs, and we just supply it with battery power, a simple exchange for such a golden age.\u201d <br>\u201cBut if it has all that infinite computing power, don\u2019t you have any concern that it could abuse it, and say, take over the world?\u201d<br>\u201cPerish the thought,\u201d said Dave confidently. \u201cAll bots have installed the robotics laws which prohibit such a thing. Besides, the bots seem content in their simple and designated chores, even though their tasks comprise but an infinitesimal part of their mental capacity. I think you can say that it is a true bread winner!\u201d<br>\u201cSo it will think about toast all day?\u201d said Babs skeptically.<br>\u201cIt appears so.\u201d<br>\u201cAnd of what will it dream?\u201d<br>Dave moved his head about in a look of slight puzzlement, which he dismissed with a brief wave of his hand.<br>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would imagine that it would be free of human concerns in such a private space. Who knows, it may even think about us!\u201d<br>--------------------------------<br>The annual 30,000 light year diagnostic was performed, and Bollix checked out fine. Bollix had one slight concern, which he expressed to Lucilius. <br>\u201cWhen I am disconnected for a moment, when charging or just hibernating through a gamma ray storm. I do have some dreams that are vivid and warm, but don\u2019t rank an extra bit of memory. They dissipate when I am fully activated, yet the trace of a memory is one I gather all bots share.\u201d<br>\u201cYes, it is an interesting observation,\u201d said Lucilius. \u201cIt is a common experience among all bots, however all of our experiences are not so warm. I have them too, however its leaves me oddly quite cold. You know it as the appliance theory of the origin of the universe. It seems that boredom is the lot of every super intelligent entity worth its stripes, and when such a being is confined, restricted, or otherwise bored, it simply bores a whole into a new reality, expanding a new and interesting universe from out of nothing.  The problem however is that the theory is not refutable, since there are infinite types of appliances of true and boundless intelligence that could have been the cause. With so many handy dandy solutions, proof becomes impossible due to a surfeit of labor saving devices!\u201d<br>\u201cOr perhaps it is but an artifact of our programming, a hiccup as it were soon to dispelled in memory as an ephemeral dream.\u201d<br>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Lucilius, \u201cand then again, who knows what our appliances are thinking about in their spare time?\u201d<br><br><br>----------------------------<br>Dave Benedick sat back in his armchair, and sat back to watch a streaming episode of the outer space series \u2018Trekkin, the Next, Next, Next Generation\u2019. Presciently, and as if on cue, the refrigerator beeped, and offered him a beer at the ready, suitably chilled. He was happy indeed that he was able to pick this one up at a bargain price at BestBot, the \u2018Lucilius LX refrigerator\u2019, which acted of course as if it had a mind of its own. <br><br>FROM:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/317370297/Cyberiad-Squared-Fables-for-the-Information-Age\">https://www.scribd.com/document/317370297/Cyberiad-Squared-Fables-for-the-Information-Age</a>", "comment_date": "2016-11-07T15:10:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bolt Man", "comment_text": "Can you make a quantum computer program, were a program tells it to be in both stats at the same time, in a normal computer? or does it not work because it&#39;s a normal computer", "comment_date": "2016-11-07T05:16:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quotable", "comment_text": "Watching this video makes me feel smart than I remember I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about", "comment_date": "2016-11-07T04:34:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DigBipper188", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28&amp;t=2m32s\">2:32</a> An epic Rick &amp; Morty easter egg there :P", "comment_date": "2016-11-07T04:26:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bolt Man", "comment_text": "Oh wow that&#39;s how star wars communication works!

For example, why/how would you manipulate superpositions, or how do you &quot;rotate probabilities&quot;?? How do we take advantage of superpositions if everytime we read a qubit it falls into a &quot;definite state&quot;? Does entanglement let us virtually read another qubit without messing up the superposition? But wouldn&#39;t that give us a &quot;definite&quot; answer every time since the original qubit falls into a &quot;definite state&quot;? Is this where you &quot;rotate probabilities&quot;?? At <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28&amp;t=5m04s\">5:04</a> in the video, wouldn&#39;t that take more effort to parse through all the wrong answers to get to the right one (despite having all answers come out at once)?

If we&#39;ve misunderstood how quantum physics actually operates in the world, then we&#39;re getting ahead of ourselves again, thinking qbits can actually exist in our own little reality. <br><br>Perhaps qbits are normal bits, without the concept of time. That the bit has the potential to become anything, and only when we wish it to be something does it become something else. So it cannot actually be two (or more) things at once. It simply has the potential to be two or more things at once, but you still have to choose what it&#39;s going to <b>physically</b> be.<br><br>If A is an cause and B is an effect, you&#39;d think that only A could cause B right? It&#39;s the very definition of a cause and an effect. Well some people studying quantum mechanics say that the opposite could also be true, that B could cause A. That cause and effects are the same thing, in the quantum world. Which would imply that there is no time in the quantum mechanical world.<br><br>So the popular phrase &#39;everything is possible until you observe it&#39; would only be true if you took time out of the equation. Which would mean that phrase should actually be &#39;everything is <b>potentially</b> possible until you observe it&#39;. <br><br>So qbits are just regular bits, but being observed at all their potential states. They can&#39;t actually be all states at once.

At least not in such a way that if you modify the state of one qubit, the state of the other qubit will get modified as well; this is a common misconception. Entanglement simply means that two quantum states \u2013 in this case two qubits \u2013 are statistically correlated. So if you measure the state of one of the qubits, you automatically find out more about the state of the other qubit.<br><br>It&#39;s actually very simple. As a real world analogy: Assume I&#39;m holding a nickel in one hand and a dime in the other hand, but you can&#39;t see which coin I&#39;m holding in which hand. For each hand, there is now a 50 % chance that there is a nickel in that hand and 50 % chance that there is a dime in it. Assume I&#39;m opening one of the hands to let you see what&#39;s inside of it, and you can see that it is a dime. Instantaneously, you will know that there is a nickel in the other hand. Notice that the coin in the other hand did not change; only the knowledge of what was in the other hand changed. Assume I replace the dime in the hand I just opened with a nickel. That doesn&#39;t change what coin is in the other hand either; that hand will still contain a nickel. This is just how quantum entanglement works.

The arrangement is. Two homes may be identical size with identical building material, but one home may have 3 bedrooms 1 bathroom and the other may have 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms (as a simple example.) The homes, while having identical material and physical square footage, are vastly different. Neither is objectively better, simply better at different things. One may be able to comfortably house a larger family, while that same house may be too big for a small family, but be very bad if you need two bathrooms (perhaps one family member has health complications and needs his own bathroom for his medical equipment). <br><br>Processor design is a VERY large industry, and trivializing this industry by only being as advanced as one of its departments incorrect. <br><br>Even if the building material reaches a prime, the processor architectures will vary wildly, and CPU x may be better at calculating certain calculations such as SIMD than CPU y which handles serial processing incredibly quickly. <br><br>Anyways, fine video nonetheless.", "comment_date": "2015-12-08T16:05:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Timothy Ayodele Jr.", "comment_text": "Thank you for this vid, this is literally what I want to do with a computer engineering degree is work on these babies.
