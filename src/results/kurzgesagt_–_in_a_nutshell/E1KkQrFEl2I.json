Still, it&#39;s more important for them than for a multicellular organism. They can produce their own energy, but they still have to get the resources for that inside their enormous cell body (along with other nutrients that they need to build their components) and to get waste products out.<br><br>The way that they function is illustrative of the point this video makes. Most are &quot;huge&quot; only in relative terms, like bubble algae. They can be seen and could presumably be meaningfully handled, although I feel like they&#39;d probably be too delicate to handle very much or roughly. Any issues they have with surface area vs. volume are probably minor enough to solve with &quot;clever&quot; energy use and proteins to facilitate diffusion. Things get really interesting, though, with the largest ones.<br><br>Marine plants in the genus Caulerpa can form what looks like a carpet on the sea floor. They&#39;re based around a stem-like stolon, a tube with its length measured in meters, and can have hundreds of fronds that look a lot like the ones on a fern. Those similarity are just an example of convergent evolution, though. The plant is a single-celled green algae. Where most plants use fronds or leaves to maximize surface area available to capture sunlight, Caulerpa species have a cell membrane contorted into the same shape to maximize surface area for diffusion. Where most plants use stems to circulate nutrients, Caulerpa uses its stolon to circulate its cytoplasm to the same effect. Cells that huge have multiple nuclei, building proteins throughout their body.<br><br>Nature is really a fascinating thing.", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T14:15:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin Olsen", "comment_text": "That ATP molecule was poorly designed", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T13:31:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charlie Greenwood", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1KkQrFEl2I&amp;t=4m26s\">4:26</a> could a make a blue whale the size of a Bactria", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T11:18:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DragonRage61", "comment_text": "Very interesting! \ud83d\udd0e\ud83e\udda0", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T03:46:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charles Saints", "comment_text": "i don&#39;t get the down votes on videos like this<br><br>why ?", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T02:57:54Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tameron Babineau", "comment_text": "We&#39;re like those Harry Potter tents.

In the end, the syntactic sugar (modern functions you can just call upon whenever you want) is actually just a wrapper for a lot of pre-made functions. So, very much like a &#39;human&#39;, said functions still go back to the very roots of programming, which is 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s... Bits. These bits get clumped together per 8, to make a byte (compareable to a cluster of cells). Every pre-made programming function really isn&#39;t anything other than if statements and loops. &quot;If 1 then &quot; and &quot;if 0 then&quot;, repeated thousands of times (loops) to eventually pretend as if &quot;stuff just works&quot;.

What is really holding a bacteria back is not the square cube law. The square cube law only is true relating to squares. No DUR. Its why life pretty much is never a square. Take humans for example because of our elongated shape the average male has a surface area of 1.9m^2 and volume of 0.6m^3.  Kurz would have you believe that by a scale of ratio our volume is larger than our surface area by a factor of ten however the opposite is true. Humans have a lot of surface area compared to volume. Bacteria however are held back in reality by two factors cytoplasmic streaming and the absence of a nucleus. Cyclosis is a complicated subject but long story short bacteria are terrible at it and it makes transporting through the cytoplasm difficult. Additionally Eukaryotic organisms can be much larger than prokaryotic because of Eukaryotic cells ability to be Multinucleate. types of sea weed can be unicellular by having multiple nuclei. Bacteria don&#39;t have nuclei which would make it difficult for a host of reasons to be larger.

If you live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye, by the Spirit of God, mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God. I am born from above and except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.

My Father is greater than all, ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of him ye do. But God is long suffering and patient, not willing that any perish but all come to repentance. Therefore obey the gospel of Christ that you may be saved from your sins and have the power of God to live as saints in this present world.

While this was a neat introduction to passive diffusion, I hope one of your future videos will mention the importance of facilitated diffusion, active transport, and other molecular processes that &quot;beat&quot; passive diffusion and are essential to cell function. For example, even at the small bacterial scales like the video mentioned, passive diffusion alone isn&#39;t sufficient for many processes, like removing toxic compounds from the cell interior. And at larger scales, like the human ovum (~100um), passive diffusion would be far, far too slow for signaling processes like preventing fertilization by multiple sperm. It&#39;s important to note that passive diffusion is only one part of signaling and transport in cells, and only one reason among many of why cells have the wide variety of shapes and sizes they have.

In February of 2017 I was deep into drugs and substances. I had an addiction to Methamphetamine and Synthetic Marijuana. One day I decided that I was going to use K2 and Methamphetamine simultaneously, and I did so. After I did this for about three days I began to become paranoid, but I wasn&#39;t to concerned about being paranoid because I knew that Methamphetamine made me paranoid in the past. But this time was different, after going several days without using the drug I still felt paranoid and it was gradually getting worse. During this time of torment, the four closest people in my life had found out something terrible that I hid deep in my past, and began to torment me about it, they would talk about it in such a way where only I could understand what they were talking about and there was nothing I could do about it other than to sit there and be scared about if I was going to make it through another day without being hurt by my own family, I was only 17 years old and I felt completely powerless. <br><br>At the time I did not believe in God, but I thought &quot;If there is a God, He is the only one that can get me out of this mess.&quot; As the months went on I began to search after God with my whole heart, doing things I had never done like praying, studying the Bible and singing spiritual songs and lifting my hands in the air. And there came a day when I was listening to &quot;Start Over&quot; by NF and I said these words &quot;Lord, look into my heart, you know that I want to do this more than anything else&quot; and for the first time in my life God spoke to me, it was a very deep, loud voice and spoke like one having great authority and power and He said &quot;I know Andrew&quot;<br><br>Regardless of all the years of sin and everything that I did against God that broke His heart,  He still knew my name. I couldn&#39;t believe that God spoke to me, I was saying &quot;HE KNOWS MY NAME HE KNOWS MY NAME, THE GOD OF THE UNIVERSE KNOWS WHO I AM&quot; And that is when I realized I was not alone in that storm and that Jesus was going to deliver me and was going to use my failures to help other people who are stuck in the same place I was.

Repent and trust in Jesus alone! Lemme know how I can pray for you :)\r<br>\r<br>God has made the world good and perfect, He made people in His own image for community and fellowship- but we as humans have rebelled against God by sinning. ALL of us have sinned. Whether it\u2019s lying, gossip, stealing, using His name in vain, looking at someone with lust, hating someone etc. ALL of us have fallen short of God\u2019s perfect standard and law. And just like on earth there\u2019s punishment for breaking the law, so there is punishment for breaking God\u2019s law: death and eternal separation in hell. But here\u2019s the good news: out of God\u2019s deep and unconditional love for us, He sent His one and only Son to live the life we should\u2019ve. Jesus is 100% man and 100% God (yes, at the same time), He has never committed any sin (even tho He was tempted to), and He just loves you ever so much. And because of these traits, He is the only one able and worthy to take on our punishment. Jesus paid the price IN FULL for our past, present and future sins, just so that you don\u2019t have to. And then 3 days later, Jesus rose from the dead, proving that His sacrifice was accepted in God\u2019s eyes. Now all you have to do, is trust in Jesus alone for your salvation and repent (turn away from your sins). And remember, we are not saved by our works or deeds, we\u2019re saved by grace through faith.\r<br>\r<br>God is so good! He has pulled me out of the darkest place, and sharing the Gospel is just in the hopes that He can do it to someone else too.

Believe that three days later Jesus Christ rose from the dead.  When you do this salvation is yours, otherwise when you die you will go to hell for eternity.  <br>God and Jesus will send the Holy Spirit to live in you, to grow you as a Christian, which means &quot;Christ follower\u201d.  He will lead you to live holy, to live righteously in fear of God with a heart and a spirit that is transformed to do good works which please God and Jesus.  He will also lead you to a full Bible believing, practicing, living, preaching church.  <br>God loves you, He wants to forgive you, and He wants to give you everlasting life in Heaven, but, only you can make that choice to seek His mercy &amp; change how you live and think by freely accepting His gracious offer by humbling yourself and living out His will for you.

For example, if I mix vinegar and baking soda.. is that an emotion? Can you feel anything from it? no? Then why is it when you have complex chemical reactions occur in your brain, you &quot;feel&quot; something from it. What is that &quot;feeling&quot;? Chemical reactions occur everywhere, the ones isolated in this head of ours are done in such a fine tuned way, but regardless they&#39;re just chemical reactions. <br><br>So if they&#39;re just a process we already understand, then why is we can &quot;feel&quot; this feeling from it? What is that damn feeling? Its a real aspect to reality because we&#39;re part of this reality and we experience it, but how? <br><br>A chemical reaction occurs and somehow, on some other level &quot;something&quot; (us) exchanges this information into some form of non existent &quot;feeling&quot; of love, or hate, or anger, or happiness. Same applies to Color, wtf is color? Our eyes are sensitive to specific wavelengths of light thats all, but the chemical reactions in our skull somehow are interpreted by whatever we are as &quot;colors&quot;. Red, blue, orange, green etc, these don&#39;t exist outside of our awareness.<br><br>This is why consciousness is weird, because its something on a whole different level. Sure, its &quot;just chemical reactions&quot; but its the experience of the chemical reactions that create an awareness and what is that? Is it the energy itself released by these reactions that are somehow alive and able to feel the environment utilizing this biological machine? Is it the Universe itself experiencing what itself feels like by hovering over these finely tuned chemical reactions when they occur to create some awareness?<br><br>A chemical reaction doesn&#39;t explain feelings, they occur, and feelings are interpreted from them by something.

He was left with a huge air leak that required more (failed) surgery, and chest tubes connected to suction to keep the air pulled out of his chest to avoid his lung collapsing from pressure building in his chest cavity upon exhaling (because not all of the air leaves your body through your mouth anymore).  Ultimately we were sent to another hospital where one-way valves were inserted into his brochi to block off that entire lobe of his lung.  Despite all that, he STILL has a small air leak, requiring a chest tube and external heimlich valve, just so that he could finally go home from his hospital prison.  It&#39;s healing so slowly that they frankly don&#39;t have any idea when the hole will seal, if ever, or whether the valves should ever be removed to restore the lung capacity that this procedure blocked.<br><br>Don&#39;t smoke, kids.

I swear if you fire them, I will strike.  Well, probably not, since I love this channel, but still.<br>2. The Animation.  Every scene is something to look at, it is stunning.  Amazing job animation team!<br>3. The information.  The fact that you all show your sources, while also make an easy to digest, animated, video.  It is amazing!<br>4. The Availability.   You could get this on Hulu or Netflix.  No doubt.  It could definitely be on Amazon Prime.  But the fact you make this free shows how much you care about educating the world.  And mostly the youth, you can&#39;t deny it.<br>5. The demographic.  I am 13.  I love watching these.  My grandpa is 65.  He loves watching these.  You have made a series that anyone can watch and love.<br>6. The conclusion.  I am going to say it right now.  You are the new Bill Nye.  Take your seat among the champions.  Carl Sagan, Bill Nye, and Neil Degrass Tyson, just to name a few.  I hope you see this, and you know that you deserve every subscription and more.<br>Edit 7. The Music.  Check the replies to see who said it, but I totally agree.  The music is amazing.<br>Edit 8. The Team.  I can not stress enough how great everyone on this team is.  Everyone only thinks about the Narrator and the Animators, but there are so many more people than that making each and every episode that we all love.", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T18:33:09Z", "likes_count": 443}, {"comment_by": "Rajusa", "comment_text": "Giant bacteria is my spirit animal.", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T18:33:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K\u00fcbra Ky", "comment_text": "Why there isn\u2019t Turkish subtitle \ud83d\ude1e", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T18:33:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ashton miranda", "comment_text": "Never believe an edited comment", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T18:32:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Behee", "comment_text": "My math must&#39;ve gotten messed up because my solution is 10.5 joules, not &quot;breathing&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T18:32:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnny 2 Feet", "comment_text": "when you breath in your lungs are filled up with &quot;Fresh Air&quot;<br><br>This video must bad been made BEFORE Toxic waste, Cigarette, Marijuana and other forms of smoking consumption, and landfill everywhere because personally i wouldn&#39;t call it &quot;Fresh Air&quot; i&#39;d just say it&#39;s Air (For now)", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T18:31:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zachary Richards", "comment_text": "So we started from bacteria", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T18:31:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonatan Romanowski", "comment_text": "I &lt;3 KG<br>&lt;engagement boosting comment&gt;", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T18:31:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sri lakshmi oleti", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1KkQrFEl2I&amp;t=4m50s\">4:50</a><br>Watch it in 0.25x.<br>He pronounced Pseudomonas aeruginosa as PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSO. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Yeah I am the only weirdo who saw that.

So even though the say 49% of molecules are in the low concentration, potentially \u2018wandering\u2019 to the high concentration, the remaining 51% in the high concentration can also go to the low concentration, and when more molecules leave the high concentration than go to it, you get diffusion. The point I\u2019m trying to make is that at the individual scale, there is no tendency to go towards low concentration areas, it\u2019s just when you look at the bigger picture that diffusion emerges, so when they have animations of molecules magically pushed into the low concentration area, or through the cell membrane, it\u2019s simply not accurate.

Basically it says that by changing the resolution at which you want to quantify a coastline length, it varies and goes up to infinity as you increase the resolution. So by looking at the surface area of smaller things and comparing it to bigger things (surface area of a tree&#39;s leaves vs surface area of the internal structure of all the leaves of a tree) aren&#39;t we just increasing the resolution of how we quantify the surface thus making it look bigger and bigger the smaller we look?", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:26:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "RedStone576", "comment_text": "we&#39;re actually addicted to breathing", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:26:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Okay.", "comment_text": "Everytime I hear /breathing/ my manual breathing goes haywire.", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:26:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dev", "comment_text": "Me an intellectual who knows its osmosis.<br>Well I&#39;m somewhat of a genius myself", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:26:03Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Thanasis Moukas", "comment_text": "Doew bacteria infected by other bacteria?", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:25:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bjorgvin", "comment_text": "did u know that the outer skin is actually dead?", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:25:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "gamo_art69", "comment_text": "1h cool needs some time can I get some", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:25:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hostandri", "comment_text": "I\u2019m so glad Kurzgesagt isn\u2019t American, or else I would still be converting imperial to metric", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:25:49Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Fish Bob", "comment_text": "don&#39;t you love pretending that you understand", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:25:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\u20e0\u2022 12 years ago \u2022 7 years ago", "comment_text": "Jojo fans: <b>hamon breath</b>", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:25:47Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Franz Kafka", "comment_text": "This video doesn&#39;t answer the question of its title", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:25:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pedro Vieira", "comment_text": "Fantastic!!!!
