This idea is neat in theory but I see many problems that are overlooked. The counterweight system would limit the amount of payload capable of use. Unless of course we are talking MASSIVE space station sized tether systems requiring many parts and supplies. Planes that can reach the speeds required to catch the cable are few if any. If they could they wouldn&#39;t be capable of exiting into space unless designed specifically for this as mentioned and require technologies we haven&#39;t developed. More than likely a payload would have to be launched just as they are today in order to catch the tether just on the sheer speed required. So it really does nothing other than give the function of a slingshot effect which is still confusing to me as the tether travels at a set speed, so your launch will be at that speed no matter where you are on the rotation of the hook. Ever ride a Ferris Wheel? You don&#39;t go faster at the top. Otherwise you could just set up 10 of them each spinning faster and faster in a row and when you enter you get shot through to each one until you are going lightspeed. The reality is, this doesn&#39;t work like explained. In relation to the planet the tether is spinning at 12k so when it reaches the top of the rotation it doesn&#39;t magically speed up. You are still going 12k. Then there is the simple and unavoidable problem with satellites. Ya know.. the internet.. phones.. There are so many obstacles in space this wouldn&#39;t be capable of cutting a path multiple times a day through all of them without problems. Then lets also talk about gravity. While the counterweight could possibly manage to pull a payload through the atmosphere without pulling itself down in the same motion, it is highly unlikely. Even the hook itself falling through the atmosphere would add enough gravity and friction to pull on the entire system each rotation. Adding another 20k#+ of payload would only slow it down further making it fall deeper into the atmosphere each rotation. I know it was touched on needing extra rockets and boosters on the tether itself as the solution, that would require regular maintenance, supplies, and probably onboard staff operating the tether systems. On planets with 0 gravity this would work but going back to the slingshot nonsense, its pointless when we have rockets that reach the speeds required to get to space already. The entire battle is simply to break the atmosphere.

The technology for creating a tether cable does not exist.  Carbon Nano Tubes are not long enough to make a tether.  This is the same issue with a Space Elevator.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying it won&#39;t ever happen, but there are a LOT of issues why the tether and space elevator ideas struggle.<br><br>I hope it does happen someday!!<br><br>The technology to do what you&#39;re suggesting is about 1000 years away ... given the way technology evolves.  Maybe 2000.  Considering the bow and arrow took many, many thousands of years to become redundant as a weapon of war.<br><br>For example, rocket technology has not really changed for 100 years.  By that I mean, it&#39;s still a combustion process.  The rocket has adapted to the use of small and powerful computers and &#39;some&#39; relatively minor improvements in materials science.  For example, SpaceX still uses Stainless Steel which has been around more than 100 years.<br><br>Materials Science is the main blocker here.  Materials need to be developed that are far better than what we have now.  The tether cable not only needs to hold the massive weight perfectly for let&#39;s say 5 years, which would be about 50,000 cycles.  The tether cable needs to also withstand the huge flexion and resistance to stretching (it will be like a spring) and micro-meteorite damage and tiny fractures and cracks etc etc etc.  It&#39;s very, very complex and does not exist.  It would need to be resilient like the heat shields on the space shuttle yet flexible like a rope and stretchy like a rubber band.<br><br>THEN, there&#39;s the excessively complicated control issue of managing the rotating mass ... so many issues I&#39;m not EVEN gonna type them out.<br><br>It&#39;s not as bad as saying invent a time machine, but it&#39;s an extremely complicated problem that you have oversimplified incredibly.<br><br>Keep up the great work!

In particular, Moravec and co have only superficially analysed the long-term dynamics of the spinning skyhook. This dynamics is quite complicated I think, and one should be wary whether the hook&#39;s spin energy will not be drained over time due to tidal locking or something related. Conservation of angular momentum does not prohibit such a draining: it is the sum of the orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum which is conserved and there can be a flow from the latter angular momentum to the former. I have not seen literature or simulations which analyse this question and with some bad luck this might be a show-stopper, no?", "comment_date": "2021-04-01T11:08:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sam p-w", "comment_text": "I&#39;m honestly quite confused about why we (NASA) are not working on this right now...", "comment_date": "2021-03-30T20:28:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Snowy's Hedgehogs", "comment_text": "Is this all messed up with all the LEO satellite musk is putting up?", "comment_date": "2021-03-30T20:14:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mache Polo", "comment_text": ",,Not again,,<br>\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04", "comment_date": "2021-03-30T11:56:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "elephantperson _10", "comment_text": "why dont we just do it then...", "comment_date": "2021-03-30T07:54:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tanner Adkins", "comment_text": "thanks for telling me about something that i won&#39;t ever see in my lifetime.", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T20:42:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Troll Kenobi", "comment_text": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#39;s Skyhook???", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T11:44:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lily_", "comment_text": "Why don&#39;t these exist yet?!?", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T04:23:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "akkostol", "comment_text": "it makes shuttles go yeet, let&#39;s make this", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T16:16:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alphahurricane", "comment_text": "this is far more fantasy than a space elevator", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T13:37:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karthikeya Seetha", "comment_text": "You all had made my life more curious.

Whether you will go there and 2. If you find you&#39;re not on your way there, I&#39;ll tell you how to get there.\r<br>\r<br>Only two kinds of people get to Heaven: perfect people, and forgiven sinners.\r<br>\r<br>What is perfect? Well, not stealing regardless of how insignificant it may seem, not saying a single evil word against anyone - not to mention God sees our thought life. And like a judge in court, a penalty has to be paid when evil is done and laws are broken (e.g. if a murderer was let off in court there would be uproar so how much more God)?\r<br>\r<br>In short - we arent perfect, at all. And rather than Heaven, God, if giving us justice, will have to make us pay for our crimes by death and eternal damnation in an everlasting fire and torment. THAT\u2019s how much God hates sin.\r<br>\r<br>BUT:\r<br>There is a way that we can be saved. AND completely forgiven. Jesus - the Son of God - came down to live a perfect life without sin, conquering all evil and the devil&#39;s sinful, lustful traps that so easily ensnare us. Jesus overcame all of that, and was then sentenced to death on a cross.\r<br>\r<br>While on the cross, God poured out the anger and wrath of sin on His Son - Jesus took OUR fine of damnation in our place. That\u2019s how much He loves us. Unbearable pain and being separated from God. EVERY single evil thought, word or deed that doesnt line up with God&#39; perfection, every sin you ever have/will commit knowingly or unknowingly, Jesus took the complete, undiluted wrath for. \r<br>\r<br>And, like a fine in court, Jesus paying for it means that we can go free. Not just free, but we can experience God&#39;s love and be completely forgiven and saved from Hell as all punishment was carried on the cross and crucified there for all who believe. Instead, we can live immortally and eternally in Heaven.\r<br>\r<br>After His death, Jesus rose again on the third day, demonstrating His sovereignty and power and victory over not just the sins of this life, but DEATH.\r<br>\r<br>GOD HAS VICTORY OVER DEATH.\r<br>\r<br>Soon Jesus will return and those who died believing in Him will RISE from their graves and go to Heaven, and those who rejected His salvation, message and teachings will suffer Hell to pay their deserved fines for all eternity without a second chance.\r<br>\r<br>This is your chance now.\r<br>\r<br>He wants you to repent (turn away from your sin and pursue God&#39;s perfect intent for your life, striving in the opposite direction). \r<br>\r<br>It\u2019s not only about escaping damnation, it\u2019s entering God\u2019s healing as well. God has a plan for your life, a plan that involves you being recreated into His perfect moral image AGAIN as we were before the sin in the garden. He loves you and wants to cleanse you - He will give you the strength. Now we can walk in His strength, experiencing His love, being taught what it means to be part of His family and too be given victory over sin and death. \r<br>\r<br>He wants you to have faith in Him, letting Him take the wheel of your life (dont forget, when you&#39;re doing God&#39;s will you&#39;re following perfect love - following Him you can be certain that you are never doing the wrong thing- imagine how cleansing that feels).\r<br>\r<br>What if I still sin when Ive accepted Christ&#39;s death and resurrection on my behalf?\r<br>\r<br>Thats why Christ died. For your SIN. When God looks at you, striving towards Him or even falling, He sees the righteous life of Christ covering you you in place of your current, sinful reality. For those who strive to turn from sin, regardless of the pitfalls, God sees Jesus&#39;s life in place of your inability, and His blood so that yours will never have to be shed for your sin.\r<br>\r<br>Religion = rules to be saved \r<br>\r<br>The gospel = Christ saved us already we just have to believe it by faith alone in Christ alone. If you lack faith (as I did before), pray. He will make it strong in time. Trust Him as you would trust those close to you. He created you and knows you inside out. \r<br>\r<br>Sound opposite? Thanks to our natural sinful nature, it likely does, but God knows our weakness and struggles and pitfalls with sin. THAT&#39;S why He wrestled (and won against) every temptation YOU ever faced. Just pray to God, tell Him you are struggling and are unsure - God can and will work with even the slightest desire within you to follow Him and be free from sin.\r<br>Ask Him to make you willing - if you are willing to be made willing, pray for it, simply shut your eyes and talk to Him.\r<br>\r<br>When Satan knows people have left His camp, He won\u2019t take it lying down, He often tries harder with more trials and temptations. But Satan cannot do anything beyond what God permits, He will only allow things that will strengthen you or bring you closer to Him if you cling to Him and trust in the promises of His word.\r<br>\r<br>Where do I start to learn about God&#39;s plan and His promises to me? Well, these Bible relate directly to Christ&#39;s life and our redemption, check out Matthew (or Luke if you want a more detailed account). Do it in stages and try and imagine the events and miracles as they really happened - the Bible is a true account after all.\r<br>\r<br>And when and note it says WHEN, you struggle and fall on this lifelong process, know you can pray for forgiveness, dust yourself off again and get up because Jesus already bore our guilt and shame. remember that Jesus is the ultimate foundation, the reason we are given Heaven in the first place. \r<br>\r<br>If you lack faith (as i did for a long time) pray. He desires to give strength and faith to His children in time when they ask Him.\r<br>\r<br>If you want to let Jesus into your life, even to help you to take the first step, then read through this prayer here to get the gist of it and then just say it - trust God and give it all to Him because He has the - perfect - master plan. If you take a step - just a step - towards Him, He will take a step towards you.\r<br>\r<br>NOTE: YOU ARE NEVER TOO SINFUL THAT GOD CANNOT BRING YOU BACK HOME.\r<br>\r<br>Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and there is nothing that I can do to save myself. I confess my complete helplessness to forgive my own sin or to work my way to heaven. \r<br>At this moment I trust Christ alone as the One who bore my sin when He died on the cross. I believe that He did all that will ever be necessary for me to stand in your holy presence. I thank you that Christ was raised from the dead as a guarantee of my own resurrection. \r<br>As best as I can, I now transfer my trust to Him. \r<br>I am grateful that He has promised to receive me despite my many sins and failures. Father, I take you at your word. \r<br>I thank you that I can face anything now that you are my Savior. \r<br>Thank you for the assurance that you will walk with me through the deep valley.

First, notice the hypersonic speeds needed in order to send or receive payloads. Yes they don&#39;t need to go to far into space, but they still need to go into space, at hypersonic speeds! If your ship can do that in the first place then you might not even need the tether.<br>Ok so let&#39;s pretend we solve that problem, the second issue is there are currently no material composites we know of that can provide the incredibly high tensile strength for the cables that this structure would need to be made of. When you are talking about thousands of kilometers, millions of pounds per square inch and supersonic rotational velocities, you are going to need to create a new material and that is probably harder to solve than the first problem.<br>Ok ok, let&#39;s pretend we find solutions to both those problems, here&#39;s the kicker. Every time payload is connected and slung across space it uses energy which comes from the rotational velocity of the structure, slowing the rotation down just a little bit. The authors propose that incoming payloads would be used to recharge the energy but remember that incoming payloads from some other place in space had to use energy to get up to those speeds in the first place. You can&#39;t just copy and paste and bunch of tethers all over the place and expect them all to keep spinning. The energy will deplete which means you will need rockets or something else to keep them spinning, at that point you need to ask yourself why we don&#39;t just invent hyperdrive already and stop all this fidget spinner nonsense.", "comment_date": "2020-12-30T02:18:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "urordinarypicoandkeithshipper", "comment_text": "I just hope i can also visit Mars", "comment_date": "2020-12-30T01:37:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Random Mau", "comment_text": "Sooo... we are not building this because... ? ...of reasons? what?!", "comment_date": "2020-12-30T01:04:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lismary Rodriguez", "comment_text": "David throws a pebble at Goliath, Goliath falls dead, :future interplanetary spaceport throws people to Mars : me very smart and very reliable!", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T21:14:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "marccas10", "comment_text": "I want to play swing ball with the aliens.", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T17:05:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HIGKETE", "comment_text": "the ending was super cute", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T06:21:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Madmax", "comment_text": "Great in concept horrible (most likely) in everything else", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T05:03:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stalin animations", "comment_text": "What will happen if you\u2019re ran out of food?", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T02:25:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pranjali Kedare", "comment_text": "It&#39;s 12am and I thought it said &#39;shook&#39; in the thumbnail", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T18:30:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stiff Stud", "comment_text": "That&#39;s cool, until it grabs a satellite and chucks at earth", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T18:25:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ker Loz", "comment_text": "The psychedelic system intuitively gaze because hexagon unfortunatly scare astride a bored battle. hideous high, straight hexagon", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T16:58:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Umesh Kasabe", "comment_text": "Ohh my god\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T08:26:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gigantyczne Jab\u0142ko", "comment_text": "Hear me out: Railgun.", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T08:13:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elisa Novelo", "comment_text": "actual nasa engineers: HOW WE GONNA GET TO MARS :(((((<br>some guy on yt: hey", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T03:57:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Engelman", "comment_text": "Who ITF thought of this incredibly crazy shit", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T01:43:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aaronzack14", "comment_text": "imagine siting here and knowing that your generation doesnt care", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T22:52:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik Garbo", "comment_text": "Once a monkey always a monkey", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T07:35:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GokouZWAR", "comment_text": "The conservation of energy still applies in orbit.

Plus how do you keep the end of the sling tight so that it\u2019s fully extended as it goes around in orbit?

I may not be an engineer, but I can see some major issues already.<br><br>1.) No known material could support a cable hundreds or even thousands of kilometers long. You might say carbon nanotubes, and while those are indeed strong, we still cannot produce them at any usable length. Materials like steel would be unable to support their own weight over such a distance and would snap, even without the payload of a rocketship attached to the end.<br><br>EDIT: Going back I noticed the material Zylon was mentioned in the video as a suggested material which according to wikipedia has a tensile strength of some 5.8 GigaPascals, which is very strong, but still far weaker than materials like carbon nanotubes which have a strength of around 100-200 GPa.

Even if the arrival timing and angle are somehow matched, if docking fails, the spacecraft will not be able to slow down and will bounce into outer space.", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T06:00:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonah K", "comment_text": "TL;DW yEET", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T02:26:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Harvey", "comment_text": "When&#39;s NASA gonna hire this guy", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T00:53:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LeonZSPOTG", "comment_text": "But are they doing it though?", "comment_date": "2020-08-19T20:59:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sonaarr", "comment_text": "Too bad we&#39;re all fucking busy worrying about the color of our skin and accusing each-other about who raped who", "comment_date": "2020-08-19T16:26:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cat Square", "comment_text": "Everyone is watching this vid cuz of lock down", "comment_date": "2020-08-19T16:23:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dave K", "comment_text": "Can someone forward this to Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter?

Intercepting ANYTHING at mach 12 has not only never been done before, but I imagine isn&#39;t easy and any collision at those speeds will be fatal.<br><br>Second. Departure from Earth. Catapaulting a craft in the correct direction while spinning isn&#39;t exactly a reassuring concept.<br><br>Third and my biggest issue, is using these skyhooks for returns. If intercepting the Earth tether for departure requires Mach 12, and they estimate the skyhook will double velocity. That means you have to intercept the Mars skyhook, months in advance, at Mach 24. You miss, and you either collide with it, or you continue your voyage to Jupiter and starve to death lol.<br><br>Edit: I personally think the skyhook is a great idea but only for leaving Earth atmosphere.

My favourite is based on a marine spar.  You have a ballast station where you have a runway for airplanes to land and take off, storage facilities and some quarters for staff and passengers.  The ballast station would hang by steel cables to bouyancy stations supported by balloons, the ballast station may also have some bouyance attached mostly so that it may be able to descend with parachutes long enough for people to bail if it should ever be disconnected.  Elevators would carry material and passengers up from station to station reducing the spans to distances conventional materials can support.  The upper most portion would be a compressive support tower with as much boyancy along it&#39;s height with the unsupported section held above the supports by the tension of the cables from the lower section much as marine rigs manage to rise above the ocean.  This takes the payload to the edge of the atmosphere where it takes a lot less energy to launch into orbit.  The bouyancy balloons requires less lifting gases at higher altitudes and at a certain altitude, the flammability of hydrogen would no longer be a concern as the atmospheric pressure would be low so expensive helium need not be the only lifting gas used.  The lower sections could use a combination of helium and hot air to allow adjustments for payload and passengers without using ballast.  The energy for the hot air could be collected by solar panels at each platform and wired down.<br><br>If you want to further reduce energy requirements, this could be coupled with a skyhook concept as vehicles launched from the spar could reach and dock with the space hook though to be honest, the docking of a vehicle with a supersonic hook sounds rather tricky to me hence the skyhook is not one of my favourites.<br><br>Note, a lunar space elevator is possible with steel cables so mining the Moon would be simpler than routing asteroid mining through skyhooks on Mars.  Also asteroids don&#39;t really have enough gravity to require a skyhook or space elevator but a Stanford Torus could use it&#39;s spin to help launch cargo with the angular momentum lost made up by lower thrust boosts over time perhaps by radiating waste heat in specific directions.", "comment_date": "2020-01-06T00:16:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alijah Panganiban", "comment_text": "Hits satellite uhoh", "comment_date": "2020-01-05T19:19:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrei Nugroho", "comment_text": "Elon musk should see this", "comment_date": "2020-01-05T17:21:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Irish Spartan Studios", "comment_text": "Then: Yeah!

That could transform the hole skyhook into a spinning ball with a incredible speed, that would not only be inuseful for our purposes of space exploration, but also quite dangerous for spaceships and satellites that pass by it&#39;s route (which couldn&#39;t be controled at this point). So we would need to construct the skyhook with some material that&#39;s incapable of bending at all (probably with a craaazy high elastic coeficient).<br>-Second there&#39;s the thing about where we would drop it, because, economically speaking, it&#39;s cheaper to send things to the space by the equator, so, naturally, the skyhook would be more usefull if we let him next to the 0\u00b0 latitude. But, if an accident occures with such a huge structure it would launch enourmous amount of debris in the space, creating a really dangerous area for space objects, and maybe even &quot;trapping&quot; us in Earth.<br> Anyway, I think would be awesome if we could acctualy beuild something like this, beacause space expantion would be right at our door (with not talking about the view of it here in Earth).

Not to mention you need SUCH precision math to fling and then catch vessele on mars even if you have like 100 in orbit. Oh you figured that out? now let me tell you there is so much space junk and even slight bump of junk (probably will break tether) will ruin math and your vessel will miss its target, vessel doesnt have much fuel so you cant even correct that in flight and youre in space, floating and cant do anything and by fling mechanics youre probably out of earth sphere of influence and will go around the sun and maybe even out of suns sphere of influence so maybe youre orbiting the milky way center. but yeah this is so huge that junk would probably break it very soon. there is MILLION of problems with this already and not to mention 1000 more engineers would find out.

It would be costly, but it would absolutely be doable. <br>In case you don&#39;t know, a space gun is a type of electro-magnetic railgun that would propel stuff from the Earth&#39;s surface enough to reach into space. A relatively short railgun (a couple of miles) would be enough to transport things like fuel, supplies or structural components for spaceships out into space, requiring MUCH less energy to get it out there.

It would mean we can build colonies on the Moon and Mars, which eventually becomes self-sustainable. It&#39;s all dependant on how cheap and easy it becomes to get stuff out into space. The spacegun can be powered by solar energy, which also makes sense since it would be located close to the equator. <br><br><br>All in all.... Yeah let&#39;s do it.

The payload would go up, the satalite would descend, and upon reaching the top, the payload would stop, the force would be gone, and the spring should push the satalite back up.<br>There must be an energy loss here but I was never great at mechanics.

It is true that the most simple form of a sky hook -- one that simply hangs and does not rotate -- is marginally simpler than a fixed/semi-fixed space elevator.  This is really only due to pesky problems dealing with the lower atmosphere.  It is not a material problem.  You could use the same exact material proposed in the sky hook.  Nothing says a space elevator need be rigid.  In fact, the first space elevators will likely just be static sky hooks which terminate on an ocean barge type of platform, allowing for positional corrections.  <br><br><br>Insofar as all this rotation stuff they proposed:  those engineering problems are an order of magnitude more difficult than anything related to the space elevator.  Orbital calculations required to hit targets that small within such a tiny tolerance range while not using any propellants?  Not a chance.  In fact, it&#39;s probably not even possible.  Down to that degree of accuracy, gravitational &quot;lumpiness&quot;, space dust, or the affects of unseen gravitational sources (everything from dark matter to unobserved clouds of gas) would create errors larger than can be corrected without use of propellants.  Then there&#39;s the idea of creating a mass/energy equilibrium.  Perhaps, hundreds of years after such a logistics network were established, you could begin creating such an equilibrium.  But only after sufficient mass is being exchanged BOTH directions.  And, even then, you&#39;ll be lucky to get within 80% equilibrium.  Remember, there&#39;s significant atmospheric drag, even around Mars, when it comes to a system like proposed.  The energy required for stabilization, even assuming a high degree of equilibrium, will be ginormous.  As in, &quot;we need to invent something new&quot;, ginormous.  Today, we have no way to stabilize a &quot;Phobos super tether&quot;.  Talk about science fiction.  A space elevator is significantly less difficult.  Especially a Mars-based space elevator, which avoids many of Earth&#39;s atmospheric problems and has significantly reduced materials requirements.", "comment_date": "2019-11-18T14:06:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rick Hageman", "comment_text": "I had thought that the tether was more sci-fi than the space elevator.

Combine it with something like a relatively small mass accelerator and we could have incredibly cheap space travel now. It&#39;s not as good as a space elevator would theoretically be but it&#39;s good enough to make a space economy viable, which is what we need to get started, and as I mentioned it&#39;s something that has the potential to be improved upon instead of being one monumental project. We can start with a tether and then we can build some small mass accelerators just to cut down on fuel a little or send small satellites into orbit, we can keep making small incremental improvements that constantly make space travel cheaper. The tether could also serve as a valuable space hub as it would be an obvious place to build a major space station and it could almost function as a sorta ATC for space. It might even house some of the first zero gravity industries.

The amount of control needed to initiate this project is insane with too make dangerous and even costly consequences. The counterweight would need to be relatively large and you would need to bring it in orbit first, which is already a nightmare costwise. What if you fail (which happens fairly often in spaceprojects)? You have a massive chungus entering earth&#39;s armosphere at mach 12.<br><br><br> Then you suggest unwinding 6km of tether form the base of this counterweight. I am not gonna make any assumptions as I am not well informed enough regarding the material you mentioned, but what I can assume is that it has to be somewhat thick to be reusable as many times as you imply. So spooling it will increase the volume of just the base of your &quot;Fling&quot; as well. <br><br><br>Zylon as you mention it has a density of 1540 kg/m3 (not sure if it&#39;s just the basic Zylon you suggest using). If we take the tether of pure zylon to be 0.5m diameter (which right here could either be massive overkill or underestimation so it&#39;s not a definite number) with the area of 0.2m^2 and 6000m length we get a volume of zylon of approximately 1200m^3. So our zylon mass is: 1848000 kg (1848 tons). The Falcon Heavy seems to have a current max payload of about 65 tons for Low Earth Orbit which seems to be double what you suggest for the Hub of our Fling (in that case perhaps a payload of 130 tons)with no recovery of stages (not sure how accurate this is just quickly searched for current rockets max payloads and Elon&#39;s seems to have come up). This is alldisregarding the Counterweight, just to put the tether into space. <br><br><br>Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I really think this is an amazing idea which we could play with a lot, I love most of your vids and this is one of them. But I am not that happy with presenting this Idea as a surefire way to make interplanetary space travel work, especially in only a 10min video. So I thought it would be best to voice my concerns here.  All of the math I presented could be wrong as I didn&#39;t spend a lot of time researching yet. But the idea still stands, it could work, and it could be better than the Elevator, but the same issue the Elevator has is still present, how do you mount it? <br><br><br>I mean why not just make a space elevator using a Thick Zylon teather as the shaft? It would need to be flexible anyway. <br><br><br>Thank you for the vid and time put into the video, it was really fun doing a bit of googling on these things.", "comment_date": "2019-11-18T02:14:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leaf :)", "comment_text": "Are people trying to get this put into place right now?

We would revert to using ohter planets in our solar system WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTE WONDERFUL PLAN! We basically have a large amount of resources to further and to create better space exploration ships or to create better technology. It will soon allow us to make spaceships like the ones we see in Star Wars and many other space related movies. We can uses them as a standing point to where we are going next or will research and do next. We can create large ships able to carry out large sums of resources. We can also create space bases such as the one we already have in our space belt(not sure what our magnetic circular force that keeps the moon in it\u2019s position but um, should have an idea)- And that space base is the one that is from NASA. I also believe that we can use a slingshot to get ships out of our atmosphere. The slingshot would work by breaking the speed of sound it self. Able to go at mock 12 or 10. Able to go against the law of gravity and physics or how things should work. And go against the the wolrd of consequences- not sure if that world is called the Quantum world (basically where all things have reasons to why they happen- I KNOW IM A NERD!) It would be based on magnetic friction and magnetic field. And would again, go against friction. It would allow ships to move faster and maybe safer out of our atmosphere. Guys, the future is near, it\u2019s already infront of us. My generations future scientists will continue the things our best named scientists to be ever known(One I admire the most is Stephen Hawking) Also do note that I am only 15 years old and I want to be apart of future space exploration research and a person who wants to solve Cancer to the extent that it shouldn\u2019t be a worldwide problem. I also want to be a doctor and a inventor- an idea I have is hover board that is able to float on water and any type of surface-static friction, air friction or basically just friction itself.

Might be too late for it now as is. Yes there are lots of great ideas for space instructors but what people fail to take into consideration is problems we have yet to solve here at home before it&#39;s possible (example is low earth debris). My idea is simple, build a giant mound of dirt up to near space then an elevator that would let us move all items with only the cost of elevator moving it up. initial cost would be HUGE!!! But the biggest cost is moving all that &quot;earth&quot; to make a mound big enough to reach near space then the rest is easy to build/maintain.

My answers (not saying yours or anyone else&#39;s is wrong) are what I consider best long term goals that would make a difference 100&#39;s or 1000&#39;s of years for humanity in the future. Gotta stop looking at this as a less than 100 year solution. Cause we are greedy and that&#39;s why we think stuff like the skyhook is a good idea right now.. it&#39;s not, but could be later.

The issue doesn&#39;t lie with the cable here, although it would very likely be shredded within the first few months to a year, but with the actual force exerted by the collision. An object travelling millions of miles an hour, even if the object is no larger then a small pebble, will exert a large amount of force upon collision. This could throw the spin of the device off, which could be catastrophic for any further use, or even throw the entire thing out of orbit. The calculations to make sure that the throwing is fast enough to make it to Mars, and the catching slows any returning ships enough for safe re-entry would be incredibly complex, and have to be repeated for both devices, with different variable for each.

You kind of touched on how hard it would be to catch a tether at the beginning, but it gets much more dangerous once you leave earth.<br><br>If you miss a tether leaving earth, you simply land and try again. If you are in the asteroid belt and miss a tether, you could sail off into the abyss never to be seen again. Literally nobody would be able to rescue you. <br><br>This extraterrestrial tether system would also have to be maintained incredibly well and redundant. Since the travel time between outer solar system travel points would be months, downtime would be incredibly risky as again, if you miss a tether you are sailing off into the abyss.<br><br><i>Another</i> issue would be communication. Airline traffic control is complex, but imagine trying to coordinate making a multi-month long journey, based on tethers that were constantly changing position, using communication that takes minutes to hours round trip.

Think of it like a sword swinging at the earth, the tip will be traveling fast through the upper atmosphere, morphing into more of a scimitar shape as it went along, its hook falling behind the vector the tether holding the weight draws to the earth. The weight on the other end of the tether could be reeled in closer to the axis of rotation in conjunction with reeling in the skyhook to straighten out the curve by increasing the rotational speed like a figure skater bringing in their arms.

I feel like that model of the solar system misleads people. Also for the Phobos space tether eventually the centrifugal force (Yes it is a thing it a caused by inertia go away annoying 3rd graders) would exceed the centrifugal forces caused by a space elevator build in Martian orbit, in fact I would say that if we built a space tether around Earth the &quot;reduced&quot; cost of getting to orbit would make it a better investment to get the right materials to Mars to build a space elevator. I say this because of Mar&#39;s weaker gravity, meaning a shorter cable, and it&#39;s slightly longer days, leading to a cable that is shorter and under less stress. However the whole space tether idea would fail horribly, for some very unavoidable reasons. The first reason is that the space craft would still have to expend a lot of fuel to get up to even 80km, and be at a speed where a cable that started at ~1080km above Earth&#39;s surface would be moving, the reason I say this is because the majority of a rocket&#39;s fuel is spend in the bottom portion of the atmosphere, accelerating through the thick atmosphere, and not adjusting it&#39;s orbit from ~120km to ~2080km. This is not even mentioning that the Apollo service modules got from LEO at 200-500km above Earth to 382240km at Luna&#39;s orbit with a small rocket, (I can&#39;t find  more than one source but I would say 77 million, 77 million of 1.2 billion per launch), and return to earth. This is just one example of a rocket and can be applied to many more, like the Falcon 9. The reason on the  falcon 9 that the second stage is not, ad will never be, reusable is because it is cheap compared to the more expensive and larger 1st stage. The second reason is the cost to get it into orbit. Because you would need a massive weight to hold it in place while flinging all the craft it would be massively expensive, and at that point we bring ourselves to number three, Why not a space elevator? Well, you think, he said so in the video, you need mystery material right? The Sky hook uses materials we already have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And to that I say you would still need a mystery material for the skyhook. The reason for this is that with a space elevator, yes you would need a thicker cable, but with that thicker cable you could also bring up more materials. And because with the skyhook you would need a weight at each end to keep it from, you know, slacking out, you would require putting double the payload into to orbit for the skyhook, connecting them by a rope, spin them up incredibly fast before either end enters the atmosphere, and all the while doing so with what did you say? Nylon? Good luck. With that. And the 4th reason, you would need to constantly bring up new fuel because of the decaying rotational and orbital momentum. All together this video is terribly inaccurate, and deserves to be taken down like the addiction and refugee videos.

Even just getting into the space to position a satellite in the exact correct spot requires many minds to figure it all out.<br><br>I know you already know this, but most people still dont grasp it yet. Space Travel works in circles. You cant just fly/slingshot yourself straight to a destination. It needs to be thoroughly planned and plotted so when you slingshot yourself out into the darkness, by the time the planet arrives, you will hit the exact point you wanted, which is your tiny skyhook.<br><br>In space you are always orbiting something.<br>When you leave earth you are fighting the earths gravity, you dont just rocket straight off into the sky, you rocket into a curve. If you rocketed straight up, you&#39;d go straight up, reach a point where the gravity beats you, then swing around and fall straight into the earth with enough force to disintegrate yourself.<br>You rocket into a curve and build your orbit, growing higher, and faster, like you&#39;re attempting to draw a circle around the earth with your rocket. As you get higher, and go faster, the circle eventually grows into a stable orbit, when the circle no longer falls within the planet, yet goes completely around it. This is orbit.<br>To break your orbit, you have to grow this circle into an egg shape, larger and thinner, until you have the velocity to break the earths orbit. To save fuel, you&#39;d use a slingshot method, where you increase your speed while at low orbit, so when you circle around to high orbit, your speed increases and you&#39;re flung out of orbit. Lets hope you dont pass by the moon while you&#39;re doing this or you&#39;ll get sucked into its orbit and have to do another maneuver to escape it (or use the moon to slingshot yourself again).<br>Dont forget, theres gotta be someone figuring this course out, simulating it before you&#39;ve even attempted it, to ensure you dont shoot yourself out into the abyss never to return. You have an incredibly tiny margin of error, one thing goes wrong, you do something too early or too late, and you might never come back.<br><br>Now you are in solar orbit and are no longer bound by the earth. You&#39;ll be flying parallel to earth while circling the sun.<br>Same thing again, if you&#39;re going to mars, you need to slow your orbit down so its no longer circling the sun, but egg-shaping the sun, at a point where your eventual egg-shaped orbit will pass mars&#39; orbit.... And remember, mars isnt even there when you start this maneuver, you are planning this maneuver in advance because you are aiming for where mars will be in the future, not where mars is now. More logistics to figure out.<br><br>2 1/2 years into the future, someone did their jobs right and plotted you an accurate course, mars will be there when you arrive. Now you gotta work in reverse, and slow yourself down, building a stable orbit around mars, and if theres a skyhook there, line yourself up perfectly with the skyhook, match its speed and orbit, get caught. One wrong move and you&#39;ll throw the whole hook out of orbit and both are darting off into the edge of the solar system (or worse, into the sun).<br><br>Probably going to take a hundred intelligent minds to continually plan out your course and re-plan it out as variables change. Its not as simple as it sounds, hence why nobody&#39;s doing it yet. And thats just the course, someones gotta plan these skyhooks out build them, place them, and maintain their orbits, and do the same for the rocket too.<br>Thousands of intelligent minds to get the job done.", "comment_date": "2019-11-17T17:31:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Riyadh Casoojee", "comment_text": "Ice King did skyhooks first", "comment_date": "2019-11-17T17:31:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LauXu", "comment_text": "NASA liked this video", "comment_date": "2019-11-17T17:31:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PERSONA, NADA M\u00c1S QUE UNA PERSONA", "comment_text": "I need one of that", "comment_date": "2019-11-17T17:31:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aj Carter", "comment_text": "Out of every YouTuber that has 10 million subs you are the the most deserving of it.

Currently one of the most expensive science endeavors ever is the ISS which barely just supports 6 people, with a quality of life that most people couldn&#39;t endure. I also think the idea of this being a &quot;propelentless &quot; means of exploring the solar system is totally false, these these would need to constantly be refueled even if they use ion drives.

Other materials work too, even kevlar, but zylon is the best material choice, even if it is somewhat more expensive.

Send starship(s) to asteroid to asteroid with payload entirely consisting of ion or NERVA engines to strap to the asteroid.\r<br>4.

Agreed due to the gap of conventional aircraft travel in the slip stream around 15 km and the tether AT ITS LOWEST can only be at 80 km.
