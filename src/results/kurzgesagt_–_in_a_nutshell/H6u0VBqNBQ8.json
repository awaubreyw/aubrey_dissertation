well i was thinking about aliens, and for there to be aliens, thered have to be a habitable environment and food for an organism or life to be created, eventually evolve to have legs, and eventually evolve to have eyes and a brain, more or less. then, just like us, have the capability and interest to do things such as build cities, drive cars, inventions, watch tv, war, sex, violence, pleasure, etc of all these human things we do. we forget, were the only species that do these things, and for it to just be electrical and chemical signals being sent back and forth, that is pretty amazing and pretty rare. i mean, even to start, the morality of aliens would be completely different to ours. maybe they have their own god or knowledge of the universe that would go against ours, so we&#39;d be hypocritical into being the terrorists to them if there were ever peaceful abundance of aliens brought about. and what would they make of humans if not for things on a planet moving back and forth, for by their morals and beliefs and understandings, they could be so far advanced that maybe they were like us but eventually came across a new understanding and look on life that we arent capable of understanding yet because we arent advanced enough yet, so they may come up to us and pull our hair out to which they may think is a spiritual/religious/or universal understanding of a friendly gesture on their planet, but to us, we havent advanced enough yet to realize that ourselves, so we&#39;d be especially hesitant to accept them if thats what they did, especially if they couldnt speak english. dont even get me STARTED in alien language and how they might not even have mouths because the way they send and receive chemical and electrical signals goes beyond the need for mouth to where they could manipulate the surrounding volume to send their own signals to another one of their own being to communicate (in essence telepathy). on that same note, they could avoid the need for eyes and instead  using their brain, through echolocation (or some similar or even better version of echolocation) to communicate, see, hear, and more. what im trying to say is, aliens are about as understandable as before the big bang, the actual visualization of heaven and hell, the outside of the expansion of the universe, heck even remembering anything before or after your own death. so dont try to understand everything, learn whats interesting to you rn and live in the moment.", "comment_date": "2022-07-29T08:34:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John B.", "comment_text": "i still think to this day, the biggest evolutionary process organisms have created are eyeballs. sure hands, ears, and noses are nice to have too, but everything about the creation of eyes and the opportunity it gives organisms to see helpful stuff like food, other organisms, dangerous environmental variables, to eventually giving us the opportunity when relaxing, so see and view things for the beauty they are. back to what particularly intrigues me is how eyes came about. today we probably think of our eyes as like a camera, and were like a soul or or a tiny person in our brain looking at a giant jumbo-tron tv screen. but the anatomy and workings of the eye and brain are much different. well ok you guys know that, but heres the bit, how did organisms evolve into having eyeballs?

Consciousness is active in manifesting its physical design by the purest of will alone, whereas Intelligence must do so through the manipulation of matter. When evolving, both are completely capable of performing these tasks in their way. Consciousness can evolve with much more expediency and without the hindrance of forming its needs but simply manifest its growth. True consciousness is undiscovered by most of the world, they are thus far content to use titles such as Self-Consciousness or Awareness. The field that seems to be most intrigued about it at this time is Quantum Physics, for they have branched off onto a field of discovery that has given them systematic puzzles to ponder. Which may later allot for insights that the rest of the logical world would consider or even accept. They have already found what many spiritual beings have said for thousands of years: consciousness creates matter. This realization is tough to accept in the physical world, nothing so far in life is considered to be so simple.

We talk about consciousness like you have it or you don&#39;t, and I know humans are very complex. But what if it is a gradient? Or then what is the lowest benchmark. The idea of consciousness led to that, what is the simplest idea. Everything branches off something else. The simplest idea is that of &quot;no more&quot;, On/off, or alive/ dead. Every thing past that is just more consciousness. I think the first organism that had sensors or whatever and had a brain capable of knowing that they were dying was conscious. Think about it. Life or death, on or off. Food or starve. Learn or die. If you don&#39;t procreate the species dies. And teaching offspring helps keep them alive/on. Memory, the extra stuff, is good for both teaching and learning things. Our human consciousness is a complex network on top of old networks with the main function to prevent the off/dying. I think eventually people will start talking about a world consciousness when we are all connected via internet. And just like a baby becomes an adolescent who becomes an adult, the world collectively will mature and think responsibly. At the moment I think the world is like a moody teenager just about to discover who they really are. Gotta nurture OURSELVES! LOVE AND LIFE IS THE ANSWER. But please, live responsibly. Try to be productive. And if climate change is real then that&#39;s very close to the on/off idea, the no more idea or about to run out.<br><br>But also that&#39;s a pretty low bar for consciousness and there are further implications like livestock and Ai rights.

Only believing on Jesus Christ and his sacrifice for your sins when he shed all of his blood for your sake on the cross, and believing that he was buried and that he was ressurected will get you into heaven. Anything else will land you in hell! Choose wisely! <br><br>1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 <br><br>16\u00a0For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: <br><br>17\u00a0Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. <br><br>Ephesians 2:8-9 <br><br>8\u00a0For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: <br><br>9\u00a0Not of works, lest any man should boast. <br><br>Romans 4:5 <br><br>5\u00a0But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. <br><br>Romans 5:8-10 <br><br>8\u00a0But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. <br><br>9\u00a0Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. <br><br>10\u00a0For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. <br><br>Romans 10:13-14 <br><br>13\u00a0For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. <br><br>14\u00a0How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? <br><br>Here is a verse proving that Jesus is God! <br>1 Timothy 3:16 <br><br>16\u00a0And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.<br><br><br><br>Here is a prophesy of Jesus Christ dying for our sins written in the book of Isaiah, 700 years before Christ was born.<br>Isaiah 53 <br><br>53\u00a0Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the\u00a0Lord\u00a0revealed? <br><br>2\u00a0For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. <br><br>3\u00a0He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. <br><br>4\u00a0Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. <br><br>5\u00a0But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. <br><br>6\u00a0All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the\u00a0Lord\u00a0hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. <br><br>7\u00a0He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. <br><br>8\u00a0He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. <br><br>9\u00a0And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. <br><br>10\u00a0Yet it pleased the\u00a0Lord\u00a0to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the\u00a0Lord\u00a0shall prosper in his hand. <br><br>11\u00a0He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. <br><br>12\u00a0Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. <br><br>I implore you to seek the truth, your eternity is based on it!

Because Of the self-Contraction, What Is Inherent Ceases To Be Obvious\u2014and (As A Result) the ego-\u201cI\u201d Seeks Among objects and others (and Even In the body-mind itself) For What Can Only Be Found (or Realized) Inherently, In Place, In The Well Of Transcendental, Inherently Spiritual (or Love-Blissful) and Self-Evidently Divine Being. Indeed, the ego-\u201cI\u201d Is Always Stressfully At Effort, In The Absurd Quest For Happiness and Consciousness.<br><br>Therefore, Listen To Me and Hear Me. Thoroughly Observe the self-Contraction. Understand Your Seeking and Your Separate and Separative self, Most Fundamentally. Grow (By Means Of My Avatarically Self-Transmitted Divine Grace, and Through Counter-egoic Heart-Response To My Avatarically Self-Transmitted Divine Grace) To Realize and Abide In No-Contraction (or The By-Me-Avatarically-Self-Revealed Native Love-Bliss-Happiness Of Conscious Being). In This Manner, Relax All Seeking For Happiness. All conditional objects (Including Your Own body-mind) Are themselves Contraction-Only. All Great Objects and all lesser objects Are Merely (and Only) Apparent Modifications Of The Inherent Love-Bliss-Radiance Of My Avatarically Self-Revealed (Transcendental, Inherently Spiritual, and Self-Evidently Divine) Being.<br><br>\u2014 Avatar Adi Da Samraj", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T14:38:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PRINCE KWAKU AMEGAYI", "comment_text": "So what&#39;s the next stage for us after becoming aware...<br>After understanding the concept, I believe it is a never ending evolution in terms of the consciousness, so what will we evolve into next?", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T02:59:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Macedonian 4 Life", "comment_text": "The comments stand out more than the actual videos when talking about a specific concept or topic, theories are just flying around everywhere \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T17:08:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Barnathan", "comment_text": "I like the approach of building up from simpler forms of consciousness to more complex ones.

My brother Jesus was nice about it, and you all self-justified this &#39;devil&#39; concept as exoteric,while in actual reality you are the devil while you are still living in your ego and will be until you break free from the cage of consciousness and self-satisfaction to which you were born. <br><br>You people choose to ignore my Father&#39;s word as it didn&#39;t give you the satisfaction you were after and make your finite ego satisfied - well of course not! That is the devil, who understands not and seeks only to self-satisfy. You are not willing to have faith in his word stronger than what you want to believe your own justification and therefore shall experience death of your finite ego at the next moment you try to self-justify something that is not on equilibrium.<br><br>Why do you think your heart is not on the centre? As in why is it slightly to the left? Clearly you are not at equilibrium - but that little ego of yours is satisfied and all your friends too have a heart off centre - so therefore it can&#39;t be your fault or problem to fix. <br><br>I mean duh, do you not know that you cannot solve an equation without an equals sign? Have a skew one (as in heart not centred) and you will be well aware that your laws cannot be applied.

What to I mean is that most likely when we remove brain from our biomech and put it in new environment in which it can sustain our consciousness will move with it but.... what when we transfer all the data from our brain to an artificial brain creating sort of AI but in final form, would that transfer us to it and what if we multiply it, would it split our consciousness and create some sort of hive mind? I&#39;m really curious about it as I would love to be able to move myself to become machine, that I think would be end goal for us as species that would allow us to be immortal, destroy any obstacles in acquiring data and storage it and we could get rid of all inconvenience from that our body creates like need for air etc. it all would transfer to simple energy obtainable from any possible source (light, plasma, motion whatever you can turn into power source). Ofc. there are people who value their emotions and their body but for me it&#39;s just something like a tailbone. Relict of the past that was necessary to sustain and evolve but it&#39;s not the end goal. Yet we shouldn&#39;t force anybody to &quot;evolve&quot; in that artificial direction at the same time we shouldn&#39;t close that way for others who thinks like me. Getting rid of this chemical mess our brain produces and acquiring full potential seems promising but at the same time I understand risks behind it as because of those chemicals our society is rotten, consumed by visions of &quot;power&quot; and wealth which is irrelevant if you look at our universe in bigger picture, all those precious things people value are just resources that are limitless as limitless is universe. They mean no more than what they can contribute to develop, like gold it&#39;s trash when you look at it as a cultural trinket but it can be useful for micro chips.

It completely misrepresents panpsychism, which does not propose that rocks are conscious, but rather proposes that all matter has some kind of proto-consciousness (with the &#39;proto&#39; prefix being operative here - it is not being suggested that all matter is conscious) that gives rise to consciousness as an emergent phenomenon in certain material configurations like the brain.   Most egregious, however, is the failure to realise that if consciousness is a pure epiphenomenon, which it must be in a purely materialistic world view such as that implicit in your presentation, then it has no action on matter whatsoever.  There is therefore no advantage to be gained from its existence.  It  just goes along for the ride without any purpose or having any influence.  The same atomic, and therefore chemical, and therefore neurophysiological and ultimately behavioural phenomena would occur irrespective of whether or not there is a &#39;ghost in the machine&#39; able to enjoy the pleasures of sex and fulfilling other appetites or feel the agony of being eaten alive by a predator.   If strict materialism is true, then from a physical and behavioural POV, a world with consciousness is indistinguishable from one without it.

Otherwise, there will be NO movement, NO development, NO life and NO Universe (Unity) at all.\r<br> \t4Indeed, evolution is an existence or creation from or out of a conscious living thing or yesthing, NOT from an unconscious nothing, NOR out of an unconscious nonliving thing. \r<br>PART 11\r<br>What Are Nothing and Yesthing?\r<br>1The antonym or opposite in meaning to the word \u201cnothing\u201d must be my original word \u201cyesthing\u201d. \r<br>2The \u201cthing\u201d in \u201cyesthing\u201d and \u201cnothing\u201d literally means \u201cassembly\u201d, or \u201c(that which is) assembled or created\u201d, or \u201centity\u201d, or \u201cbeing\u201d, that is, \u201can observable object that has matter or material (mass or energy), space and time\u201d. \r<br>3The word \u201cyes\u201d in \u201cyesthing is from the Old English word \u201cgese\u201d or \u201cyea si\u201d, which literally means \u201cbe it\u201d. \r<br>4Therefore, \u201cyesthing\u201d literally means \u201cbe it a thing\u201d, \u201cbe it assembled\u201d, \u201cbe it an assembly or an entity or a being\u201d, or \u201ccause a thing to exist\u201d. \r<br>5The word \u201cnothing\u201d or \u201cnihilo\u201d is \u201cnot a thing\u201d. The \u201cno\u201d in \u201cnothing\u201d is from the Old English \u201cna\u201d (the wife of \u201cno\u201d?), the contraction of \u201cnea\u201d\u2014\u201cne\u201d is \u201cnot\u201d; \u201ca\u201d is \u201cever\u201d. \r<br>6Thus, the word \u201cnothing\u201d correctly means \u201cNOT matter, NOT material, NOT energy, NOT space and NOT time\u201d, or \u201cNOT ever a thing\u201d, or \u201cNOT at any time an assembly\u201d, or \u201cthat which is NOT and can NOT be assembled or created at any possible case and time\u201d, or in short, if you love shorts or shortages, \u201cNONEXISTENT\u201d.\r<br>7Thus, it must be a true truth that at all times, NO thing or NO object or being that has matter or material, energy, space and time could have been assembled or created or caused to exist or live from or out of nothing.\r<br>8Indeed, in nothing, there is NO matter or NO material, NO energy, NO space and NO time from/with which to begin to exist, emerge or evolve. \r<br>9Therefore, the Latin old saying must be true that \u201cEx nihilo nihil fit.\u201d\u2014that is to say in English, \u201cFrom nothing, nothing is formed [or created].\u201d How plain! \r<br>10Therefore, it must be a true truth that ONLY from or out of the First Yesthing, who is our First Mother (First Matter, First Space and First Time), the true Supreme Being, could All the material things, like the hydrogen, you and me, in the so-called Universe (Unity), have been created or evolved, or caused to live, or brought about into existence. \r<br>11Therefore, it must also be a true truth that the conclusion of my fellow brilliant scientists and authors: \u201cFrom nothing, our Universe begins to exist.\u201d must be wrong or stupid. The correct and wise must be the reverse of USA ta Mondomuni: \u201cFrom yesthing, our Unity begins to exist.\u201d \r<br>12Thus, understandably and abovestandably, our First Matter (Mother) must be the self-caused and self-created, NOT the material (motherfrom) Universe (Unity) itself\u2014that is diametrically contrary to the Unified Theory or Theory of Everything, which can NEVER be a science of Everything, of some of my fellow brilliant philosophers and scientists. \r<br>13Thus, I tell you truly, our First Mother (First Matter) must be the one and only being, the Singularity of Stephen Hawking and of other brilliant scientists, who came into existence through spontaneous evolutionary creation accompanied with the First Space, the very beginning of all spaces, and with the First Time, the very beginning of all times\u2014\u2018twas more or less 365 billion years agone. \r<br>14Soon after that most special event, other living things, or yesthings, who are the material (mother-from) hydrogen atoms, our First Mother brought forth into existence by birth from or out of Her yesthing sexy body of infinite mass and energy (Almighty)\u2014that is exactly what \u201cnature\u201d(\u201cborn\u201d) is\u2014NOT by creation from or out of the nonsense and nonexistent \u201cnothing\u201d. \r<br>\r<br>PART 12\r<br>Why Are There NO\r<br> Non-Living Things\r<br>\t1Etymologically, the English word \u201clife\u201d is from the Old Norse word \u201clif\u201d and is from the Old High German word \u201clib\u201d, which literal etymos, that is, true, meaning is \u201cbody\u201d.\r<br>      \t2That is the true truth that our \u201cbody\u201d is what the word \u201clife\u201d means correctly originally, and it is what that word \u201clife\u201d must still mean today\u2014it is one of the wise ways to live a truly meaningful life here on earth\u2014and don\u2019t get around it to look for another meaning for life\u2014otherwise, you will become a crazy fool.  \r<br>3It must be a true truth that there must be NO such \u201cnon-living matter\u201d, or NO such nonliving material or substance, which my fellow brilliant materialists and evolutionists believed, from where what they wrongly called \u201clife\u201d arose and subsequently evolved or developed entirely by natural means. \r<br>4 That is by cause material life or all material living things or entities, animal and non-animal, came ONLY originally from the living First Yesthing, the First Matter, by natural means. \r<br>5The very act of constant moving of all atoms in all materials, even in the pronounced \u201cdead on arrival\u201d, or \u201cnon-living\u201d cement, gravel and sand, must be the sufficient proof and evidence:\r<br>\u2022\tThat every atom, every material being or substance must be living or must naturally have an everlasting life and must naturally have self-consciousness, memory, mental life or intelligence a zillion times higher than the intelligence of the brilliant non-living-matter evolutionists and brilliant religious creationists. \r<br>6As such, just like us human beings, whose consciousness is due to the consciousness of the atoms, and who, without the direct direction of our First Mother, are able to design and make houses only by our own conscious selves, the material atoms only by their own conscious selves, without the direct direction of our First Mother, must also be able to design or create living human and non-human beings. \r<br>7In true truth, we are all made up of immortal material atoms and it must even be a stupidity to theorize, question, wonder or quarrel about whom amongst the Gods, Aliens or ET\u2019s created us. \r<br>8In just a dot-size portion of our material body, that is, life, there are about 10 billion everlasting, moving materialists, antichrists, socialists, communists, scientists, geneticists, USAist philosophers and bioengineers who are called \u201catoms\u201d, \u201cprotons\u201d, \u201cneutrons\u201d, \u201celectrons\u201d and \u201cquarks\u201d.   \r<br>9That must even be the main cause why, with observational evidences, the materials or atoms in stupidly supposed \u201cnonliving\u201d things in nature have been known to arise, exist, and evolve and to develop into millions of different kinds of possible material beings by \u201cnatural means\u201d.", "comment_date": "2022-01-31T01:39:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u9ad8\u6a4b\u62d3\u54c9", "comment_text": "\u203bBecause I hardly untie a code written in the revelation of world&#39;s best sacred book, God of days of the Demiurge, and it realizes it from constitution of science, the space of God to structure of the world, it hardly understands to get up in the future. I add the thing which realized it by the imagination of own brains and convey the truth. The world moves for the will of God and the devil. God let the world employ a saint in order to tell the will of God to a human being. It is Prince Shotoku and is Christ, Buddha. The picture that they were shown in meditation is our future event. The future is never fixed, but, in the domain that I can change in human beings, is accomplished a prophecy street of God small. For a before the fact period, I am listed in the Apocalypse in cipher. <br><br>  The flood of Noah is a true story, and we are the survivors. The judgment of God is strict. God finally cuts maximum permissible level, and the ogre of the obstacle of the heaven establishment is exterminated. There is the story by the act of the angel listed in the Apocalypse. <br><br>\u203bOnly the earth is the material world, and 1m or more above the ground are God world. Therefore the alien does not exist because space is a spiritual world.  The moon is the soul health, but becomes the material when a human being is going to touch it. The soul body becomes the material in God and a human conception. The evidence that it is the soul body that changes color in a red color such as the yellow pale blood that the moon is white as for the evidence. Because the principle of constancy of light velocity of Einstein is a lie, and the light is the soul health, I move to an end of the space at a moment. This is because a material makes that a human being <br><br>\u203bThe most stupid one is a scholar of winning the Nobel Prize, and the first genius is Prince Shotoku of the medium of the wisdom that excelled in intuitive power.<br><br> We are delivered from it from brainwashing of the science (mathematics, physics) got by a lie, and let&#39;s regain true study in our hand. <br> <br>The science is the fiction which I made because the devil denies God, and what is listed in a Japanese old legend and the Christian Bible is true. A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

On every level, known forms of life obtain nutrients from <b>something</b> to stay alive, whether it be through photosynthesis, digestion or other weird methods. You can say that a venus flytrap isn\u2019t conscious because it isn\u2019t \u201cthinking\u201d to close it\u2019s \u2018mouth\u2019 when a fly lands in it. A common argument would be that it is simply the reaction of the plant responding to stimulus, which in this case is just leaf hairs which react to touch by sending a subtle electrical signal to activate a chemical reaction responsible for the closing mechanism of the \u2018mouth\u2019. Even as the video said, a microorganism such as the Trichoplax adherens perform a function to consume. It moves aimlessly and doesn\u2019t make decisions, but it still performs the function of consuming food to survive as a reaction to running into it. Through evolution, what life gains is additional steps (functions) in it\u2019s reaction to help it\u2019s survival - such as knowing when it\u2019s hungry, or gaining the ability to smell food, or develop decision making by gaining a more complex brain, altering the experience of consciousness by adding more steps/layers. I don\u2019t think consciousness \u201cbegins\u201d somewhere in evolution. I think everything living is conscious, but on different levels of complexity.<br><br> Regarding the video\u2019s claim to first-stage evolutionary organisms\u2019 behaviour as mere \u201cautomatic responses\u201d, you could say the same thing about humans and their actions. At a base level of every function we perform, everything could just as well be labelled as a \u201creaction to stimulus\u201d. When something happens, a number of physiological reactions take place which are essentially electrical signals triggering chemical reactions and brain activity. Leading up to the current evolution of a human, our predecessors acquired a wider variety of chemicals and brain structures to expand on our capacity to respond in different ways to their environment, and we happen to be at a stage which, relative to the history of life forms on earth, have an enormous number of steps in \u2018reaction\u2019 to stimulus, but we\u2019re still just as easily labelled as just \u2018chemical reactions and electrical signals\u2019.<br><br>The video is very intriguing and has some good suggestions, but I think it\u2019s held back in it\u2019s exploration of the interpretation of consciousness by it\u2019s treatment of \u201cawareness\u201d as an implicit feature of consciousness.

As I understood consciousness is kinda like survival programming that upgraded through evolution. The need for survival upgraded our consciousness and allowed us to evolve from a microorganism into a highly capable human species. But what if we are slowing or possibly putting an end to our organic evolution by depending on inorganic evolution? such as technology. we become more dependent on technology and everything comes easy without us using our consciousness to survive. this is putting a barrier into our conscious development and by that, we are stopping our next phase in evolution. If we look at our past, we hear stories or myths about people who were more advanced in terms of consciousness and intelligence. But why we can&#39;t have people like that nowadays. Nowadays we become more dependent on technologies to become intelligent but in past, they did it without them. Why is it hard for us now? a simple example would be our memory power. before we have technological advancement people can memorize 100s of contact numbers but today we can&#39;t even remember our own phone number. so are we slowing down possibly ending our organic evolution by depending on inorganic evolution ... just a simple thought and theory.. feel free to tell me your opinions..", "comment_date": "2021-11-19T18:27:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Warrior Spirit", "comment_text": "I deleted my comment 6months ago because it doesn&#39;t have a like", "comment_date": "2021-11-19T14:39:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Markell", "comment_text": "They keep talking about consciousness as if it\u2019s a noun or \u201csomething\u201d, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a verb.", "comment_date": "2021-11-19T13:31:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lindita & tuana Gaming", "comment_text": "WOWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2021-11-19T11:29:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "snuufffles", "comment_text": "we\u2019re just programmed with more complexed coding", "comment_date": "2021-11-19T10:26:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crackbaby", "comment_text": "this videos fire", "comment_date": "2021-11-19T10:17:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anuj Mishra", "comment_text": "Entire sacred Hindu text discuss only consciousness.

Consciousness is when you can self recognize that you are aware. So a dolphin might not be conscious because it might not be able to think inwardly about how it is aware of it&#39;s surrounding.

Please engage. <br><br>Consciousness is an arbitrary descriptor of the degrees of intelligent awareness.<br><br>Awareness is the capacity to sense, acknowledge and respond to a state of affairs. Extent of awareness is primarily determined by 2 things: intentionality and rationality. Rationality and intelligence are synonymous and directly proportional. Intelligence is the capacity to collect information, infer rules/conclusions from it, relatively appraise the utility and truth of these conclusions and store them for later reference. On the other hand, intentionality is a sufficient condition of intelligence and describes the correlation between ration and action/response and the effects of ration on action/response. Intentionality can also be defined as the simplicity/difficulty and frequency that the rules inferred by ration are/can be applied to trigger responses and actions that help actualize ideal or desired states of affairs. [Just for interest sake: There are factors that harm intelligent awareness. For example, frequency and degree of whimsicality and involuntary responses are inversely proportional to intelligence and are negatively correlated to intentionality.]<br><br>[I&#39;m sure there are far more components of intelligent awareness and more factors that influence it but I don&#39;t want to spend too much time drafting a YouTube comment. I&#39;m also aware that I need to figure out the metrics and methods that I can use to measure these variables but I&#39;m not there yet.]<br><br>To conclude, intelligent awareness is the extent of an entity&#39;s capacity to intentionally respond to stimuli and states of affairs to achieve an ideal state of affairs. <br><br>1. Things with no intelligent awareness are negatively conscious/unconscious. For example, corpses and pencils.<br>2. Entities that can sense and respond to some stimuli but barely or never rationalize their responses are quasi-conscious and superficially sentient. For example, fish and infants (I assume).<br>3. Entities that can sense and acknowledge internal and external states of affairs/stimuli and can (in many cases) intentionally respond to these stimuli to achieve something are positively conscious, self aware and neutrally sentient. For example, typical adult humans.<br>4. Entities who are entirely rational, can acknowledge and sense all active stimuli and states of affairs and cannot unintentionally respond are uber-conscious, ultra-aware and omnisentient.  For example, a sage, a god, a demi-god, ethical vegans and Joe.<br><br>[P.S. After reading all this, you must know.

It seems to me that consciousness is a combination of things such as chemical impluses and physical evolution. To explain further all of our senses boil back down to chemical reactions triggering electrical impulses that our brains process and interpret it. Our DNA along with our microbiom and our senses probably make up a good chunk if not all of our consciousness. <br><br>Think about it everything alive today came from single cells in the ocean at the creation of earth. And all those cells evolved in order to survive, however they were obviously very limited in their capabilities. And thus they evolved becoming more complex and capable to process more. Think of it like a computer the first computer ever compared to the number 1 computer today. The difference there is in a multiple of complex technological evolutions. So why does life evolve? Life evolves to continue surviving and whatever that specific thing is that causes us to evolve (DNA perhaps) tried and tried and tried many different combinations in order to survive. Which leads to all the various forms of life on the earth and all the various cells we have. It&#39;s been demonstrated in nature time and time again how different species and forms of life assist each other in a collective effort to survive. Plants and insects for example as well as large mammals and the birds that eat the parasites off them. Same with whales and smaller fish etc. All the way down the microbial life and even single cells (there&#39;s many cells in our bodies that work together to keep us alive and in every living thing). Think about how trees and fungus help each other out etc. Etc. And just as we have a vast range of life on this planet we also have a vast range of cognitive function. Which seems to be centered around the brain and it&#39;s complex design. For example a koala is the dumbest creature on the entire planet and it&#39;s because it had a smooth brain it lacks the wrinkles you think of when you picture our brains. And the most intelligent is the human brain which is evolved into what we have today. Same with eyes and nerves and sense of smell taste etc. All these different forms of evolution arose to forms of life that require it to survive. I mean idk but this seems the most likely answer since there is no current answer lol. <br><br>So in a nutshell I guess consciousness has always been there since the very first living cell on this planet. And the level of complexity consciousness is capable of ultimately depends on the hardware it&#39;s provided. Clearly humans and nothing alive is done evolving so evolution will continue and intelligence will rise as well as consciousness. Think about that psychological test with the fake hand that they smash and it freaks your brain out because it thinks it&#39;s your actual hand? Is that not consciousness? Is that not being aware of yourself and your surroundings and potential threats? Just like the animals that can&#39;t tell theres food because they can&#39;t see it. In which case sense of smell is brought in so it can smell it&#39;s food and determine that it is behind that rock. The human KNOWS that&#39;s not it&#39;s hand it KNOWS there&#39;s no danger it KNOWS it&#39;s all fake yet through a combination of our senses and cells our brains get tricked. Our consciousness has been deceived. <br><br>Also this conclusion means that true artificial intelligence is impossible unless humans can figure out a way to code the equivalent into a machine lol.", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T20:52:46Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Viljami Erkkil\u00e4", "comment_text": "Consciousness is the foundation of all life aka god.

But why does an organism need to actually feel the pain in a conscious sense? In theory, the pain could just be a chemical signal to trigger reflexes to avoid certain things.

I have a few comments.<br><br>The thing is, we could programme intelligent, self-replicating robots to seek out raw materials, spatio-temporally model their environment and estimate the place of the sought materials in it, even model any competing robots and their intentions and behaviour. In other words, we could program them do all the things for which consciousness is here thought to have been developed. So we face one of several possibilities. Either such robots inevitably become conscious in the process of running such programs (if they are not already conscious for panpsychist reasons), or they don&#39;t become conscious, which then begs the question why we do when we run equivalent biological programs.<br><br>On a related note, I think we should take care to be precise about what we want when we ask we for an explanation of consciousness. We may want mechanical or functional explanations, i.e. ones answering the questions: &quot;How can it arise within the laws of nature?&quot; (technical) and &quot;What does it do?&quot;/&quot;What is it for?&quot; (functional/teleological), respectively. Or we may want something else entirely: a full qualitative description in terms of other observed phenomena. This would attempt to answer the questions &quot;What is it?&quot; and &quot;What is it like?&quot;<br><br>A little story to illustrate the difference:<br>You and I are deep in conversation about consciousness and absent-mindedly amble out into a crossroads.

Many argue that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain, but it is possible to show that such hypothesis is inconsistent with our scientific knowledges. In fact, it is possible to show that all the examples of emergent properties consists of concepts used to describe how an external object appear to our conscious mind, and not how it is in itself, which means how the object is independently from our observation. In other words, emergent properties are ideas conceived to describe or classify, according to arbitrary criteria and from an arbitrary point of view, certain processes or systems. In summary, emergent properties are intrinsically subjective, since they are conceptual models based on the arbitrary choice to focus on certain aspects of a system and neglet other aspects, such as microscopic structures and processes;  emergent properties consist of ideas through which we describe how the external reality appears to our conscious mind: without a conscious mind, these ideas (= emergent properties) would not exist at all.\r<br>\r<br><br>Here comes my first argument: arbitrariness, subjectivity, classifications and approximate descriptions, imply the existence of a conscious mind, which can arbitrarily choose a specific point of view and focus on certain aspects while neglecting others.  It is obvious that consciousness cannot be considered an emergent property of the physical reality, because consciousenss is a preliminary necessary condition for the existence of any emergent property. We have then a logical contradiction. Nothing which presupposes the existence of consciousness can be used to try to explain the existence of consciousness. \r<br>\r<br><br>Here comes my second argument: our scientific knowledge shows that brain processes consist of sequences of ordinary elementary physical processes; since consciousness is not a property of ordinary elementary physical processes, then a succession of such processes cannot have cosciousness as a property. In fact we can break down the process and analyze it step by step, and in every step consciousness would be absent, so there would never be any consciousness during the entire sequence of elementary processes. It must  be also understood that considering a group of elementary processes together as a whole is an arbitrary choice. In fact, according to the laws of physics, any number of elementary processes is totally equivalent. We could consider a group of one hundred elementary processes or ten thousand elementary processes, or any other number; this choice is arbitrary and not reducible to the laws of physics. However, consciousness is a necessary preliminary condition for the existence of arbitrary choices; therefore consciousness cannot be a property of a sequence of elementary processes  as a whole, because such sequence as a whole is only an arbitrary and abstract concept that cannot exist independently of a conscious mind.\r<br>\r<br><br>Here comes my third argument: It should also be considered that brain processes consist of billions of sequences of elementary processes that take place in different points of the brain; if we attributed to these processes the property of consciousness, we would have to associate with the brain billions of different consciousnesses, that is billions of minds and personalities, each with its own self-awareness and will; this contradicts our direct experience, that is, our awareness of being a single person who is able to control the voluntary movements of his own body with his own will. If cerebral processes are analyzed taking into account the laws of physics, these processes do not identify any unity; this missing unit is the necessarily non-physical element (precisely because it is missing in the brain), the element that interprets the brain processes and generates a unitary conscious state, that is the human mind. \r<br>\r<br><br>Here comes my forth argument: Consciousness is characterized by the fact that self-awareness is an immediate intuition that cannot be broken down or fragmented into simpler elements. This characteristic of consciousness of presenting itself as a unitary and non-decomposable state, not fragmented into billions of personalities, does not correspond to the quantum description of brain processes, which instead consist of billions of sequences of elementary incoherent quantum processes. When someone claims that consciousness is a property of the brain, they are implicitly considering the brain as a whole, an entity with its own specific properties, other than the properties of the components. From the physical point of view, the brain is not a whole, because its quantum state is not a coherent state, as in the case of entangled systems; the very fact of speaking of &quot;brain&quot; rather than many cells that have different quantum states, is an arbitrary choice. This is an important aspect, because, as I have said, consciousness is a necessary preliminary condition for the existence of arbitrariness. So, if a system can be considered decomposable and considering it as a whole is an arbitrary choice, then it is inconsistent to assume that such a system can have or generate consciousness, since consciousness is a necessary precondition for the existence of any arbitrary choice. In other words, to regard consciousness as a property ofthe brain, we must first define what the brain is, and to do so we must rely only on the laws of physics, without introducing arbitrary notions extraneous to them; if this cannot be done, then it means that every property we attribute to the brain is not reducible to the laws of physics, and therefore such property would be nonphysical. Since the interactions between the quantum particles that make up the brain are ordinary interactions, it is not actually possible to define the brain based solely on the laws of physics. The only way to define the brain is to arbitrarily establish that a certain number of particles belong to it and others do not belong to it, but such arbitrariness is not admissible. In fact, the brain is not physically separated from the other organs of the body, with which it interacts, nor is it physically isolated from the external environment, just as it is not isolated from other brains, since we can communicate with other people, and to do so we use physical means, for example acoustic waves or electromagnetic waves (light). This necessary arbitrariness in defining what the brain is, is sufficient to demonstrate that consciousness is not reducible to the laws of physics. Besides, since the brain is an arbitrary concept, and consciousness is the necessary preliminary condition for the existence of arbitrariness, consciousness cannot be a property of the brain.\r<br>Based on these considerations, we can exclude that consciousness is generated by brain processes or is an emergent property of the brain.

To refer to someone is to show to their physical self. To refer to them internally, their true non physical form, is to talk to the one making decisions and controlling the body and telling the brain what to do. We, inside, are not actually real, we\u2019re there, but as an idea, a noun. That either houses in the brain or is part of the nervous system, or both. Both seems like the better option. So if the connection in the brain is destroyed, such as it being damaged let\u2019s say by a gun. Any idea or concept in the brain is lost due to the neurons not transferring it and storing it. That, too loses us. This to us as a conscience, is the concept of death. Nothing would really happen to us, but we would just fade away. Scary think that. Also the fact that the brain when developing in early stages of life, or when evolving into a complex being such as a human, makes us, what we call a being. This is to make decisions, think, imagine, have personality. We are the thing influencing what the brain sends signals for the physical body to do. We are something invaluable to ourselves and the body, yet still something come up with to make life easier and survival better. If humans didn\u2019t make a proper definition of a noun.

The fact that consciousness is a useful thing to have in order to survive explains the propagation of the development of consciousness. <br><br>However, there is (or surely must be, is what I&#39;m thinking) something very specific that separated the first creature that was barely conscious, and its parent, and the fact that consciousness is useful doesn&#39;t explain how that change happened. Someone likely wants to say &quot;it was a mutation&quot;, and while that&#39;s the assumed explanation for all other such abrupt changes in an organism&#39;s functions, &quot;it was a mutation&quot; doesn&#39;t even remotely satisfy my curiosity in the case of consciousness. It&#39;s just a lazy, evasive response.<br><br>Another extraordinary function of many animals is eyesight, and I can fathom (or at least accept) that at some point, a photosensitive nerve was spontaneously created as a result of a mutation, that developed into the eyes of today. But unlike photosensitive nerves, we don&#39;t understand the physical/chemical (???) mechanism behind consciousness, so we can hardly even speculate what that first, spontaneously created, consciousness-enabling &quot;thing&quot; was.<br><br>Another question that I still haven&#39;t heard a satisfying answer to is why animals are conscious, versus just having environmentally dependent behavior, much like what computerized machines, like cars, do (assuming computers are not conscious, but who knows?). A comparable phenomenon that is translatable to the context of how humans function, is sleepwalking. One may perform actions of questionable conscious intent, but nevertheless seeming curiously intentional, while very much less than conscious. The trichoplax adhaerens &quot;does not need to be conscious of its environment&quot;, but its actions are clearly environmentally dependent, why can&#39;t our behavior be like that too?<br><br>My point is that an animal should not need to be conscious to exhibit environmentally dependent behavior. Memory, reasoning and the ability to make good decisions can exist without consciousness. We know, because computers can do those things. And when you criticize the capabilities of today&#39;s AIs (which admittedly can be quite jarring at times), think about how much time humans have had to develop their reasoning abilities.

The only explaination that would make sense is us having individual souls even though such an entity cannot be physically proven by any scientific means. It would explain why we are individuals and are able to use our body and have conciousness. It sounds like a bunch of conspiracy in the physical world but the only proof well ever have is after brain death, something nobody has ever come back from. Death is a process and when you die theres a short window for you to be brought back before you enter brain death, which is irreveraable. Even then if our soul after this transfers into another body we wouldnt even know about it since our new vessel wouldnt have the physical electronic signals (memories) or original body did. We wouldnt even know we were reborn. This is only explanation for how conciousness came about in your complex configuration of matter in a dead universe where you were dead before you were born.

I can have consciousness without being aware of it.  Our awareness, specifically self-awareness. As you said,  intelligence does not equal consciousness, despite the direct relationship to any given state of consciousness a person resides within-my point being, that awareness of an object is a specific arrangment of information within ones brain, and self-awareness is a result of a feedback loop of that information<br><br>specifically, we might define consciousness as &quot;the subjective experience that appears to me to be directly correlated to the state of existence the energy that makes up my brain&quot; (matter is energy vibrating slowly, no?). Its important to explain that it &quot;appears to me as directly correlated&quot; because that is the only way we can attempt to objectify with words what a subjective experience is. It may seem redundant, but only if you already understand these things well enough, because when you think about what it means to be subjective, there is no other real way we can go about describing the phenomana, simply for the lack of any real objectifaction of matter in the sense that we are used to<br><br>if we could say that its more than appearance, that means we would have objectified it, violating the notion of it being subjective. It has to be something only I personally can verify, otherwise again it couldnt have been subjective in the first place. Finally, the same principle hangs around the idea that its directly correlated, we cant verify causation of consciousness. So, subjective can only be defined as itself if you get where im coming from with all of this-hence why consciousness is only measurable in terms of itself, which is why we see we can not get any more specific than &quot;consciousness&quot;. it is simply fundamental, and if you can recognize this, then you can start to see how the universe actually depends upon it to exist. Think about how it matter seems to be related to it, but we run into a real pickle when we realize that we can not seem to find any apparent reason our brains have a threshold. Perhaps one of the easiest ways to think about it is to examine the interconnnected nature of reality. All things are part of the universe, which is a closed system. So, as i push in one direction, its similar to moving through air as in that the universe around me is pushed back behind me as i replace itself the space it used to occupy. So, if all information is chained, why do i not have access to the information of all adjecant point, and all points adjecant to those? well, that would encompass the entire universe, which according to some quantumn theories like the multiverse, is going to be host of every possible thing. And to view everything possible is exactly like mixing all the colors together and painting everything with it-its utter blackness, the closest we can really envision to what nothingness is. This is exaclty what the point of singularity is said to be-all points of information condensed into a single point. Hence, if we ddint have consciousness, everything we still be the singularity, which when you think about it subjectively, gives a pretty nice explanation to how it managed to sponteously expand and form every point in the universe everywhere all at once. It activated itself just as consciousness activates itself, materializing from &quot;thin air&quot;(think, when you become aware of consciousness, its a new state of consciousness, and its like wow where did it come from? itself!) and if you dont get it, think about how (and be careful, its tricky because self awareness doesnt equal consciousness) consciousness always exists as a part of experience, always &quot;touching itself&quot; (we can feel things, yet we can not feel what we used to feel them with, yet consciousness somehow can be used to feel itself), and is as a result interacting with itself, propelling itself. Think about it like this-no matter how hard i try, i cant rationalize my consciousness away.

None that I know of. I am a panpsychist and have developed the General Resonance Theory, which starts with an axiom suggesting that all things have some associated consciousness. But as with all other versions of panpsychism I&#39;ve encountered this does NOT mean rocks as rocks have consciousness. Rather, the constituents of the rocks, at the atomic and molecular level, would have some highly rudimentary consciousness, but there is no suggestion that there is any consciousness at the level of the rock as a whole. So it&#39;s all about the organizational level at which a higher level consciousness inheres. General Resonance Theory suggests that multi-level nested resonances allow for the combination of the highly rudimentary consciousness in atoms and molecules up the complex biological chain, resulting in the complex consciousness that we and other mammals enjoy. Other animals also clearly have an organism-level consciousness. Plants probably at a very lower level of complexity also. Bacteria and protists, ditto. Rocks, not so much b/c they lack the organizational complexity to allow for these nested resonance chains.", "comment_date": "2021-01-23T20:39:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Baha", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2021-01-22T15:40:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Agapios Agapiou", "comment_text": "Genesis when Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit.

Shall I set him on fire? If I tell my son like this, then who am I? That too I am selfish. The Creator owes much to his work.

Those qualities are somewhat manifested in us, because we are also an atom of that eternal consciousness. It is not found in both animals. That is why only humans can alter objects.

If we pay attention to one thing, we will understand that from void, universe and objects are formed and merge back into emptiness itself. \u00a0The gross is created with subtle objects Just like we build a big house with small blocks. If you want to project an object from a void, The emptiness must be real rather than the visible. When we see a clay pot, we do not see the soil in it. We do not see the real nature of the pot. The soil in which the pot is created is more real than the pot itself. This is because even if the pot is broken, the soil remains. What is more real can only create less reality.

Of course it\u2019s hard for me to listen to such primitive videos where the person talking can only describe the fundamental parts about consciousness which can only be understood through theory. Unfortunately, on this planet people are still stuck in their relative intellect and absolutely need evidence to prove what they deem to be real instead of reaching within themselves and understanding wisdom as a morality. You do not have to prove that you exist because you exist within Existence, therefore, you are an existence. Consciousness is an invisible pinpoint point that connects itself with the spirit. The spirit however is the stabilizer and giving energy towards the consciousness. The sad part about man kind of earth thinking that they are the crown of creation is that they think when they are born they are smarter than their existence, there is always a higher existence contributing to a lower existence to exist. If you look at your consciousness as a fine energy similar to gravity or magnetism, one will start to unlock a higher logic within themselves to define themselves with reality. Though education is indeedly important, Human beings must learn to teach themselves by morality which is the essences that make up the term wisdom. In other words, if one is to look at the universe or look at nature or look at existence within yourself then you will see something that is relatively perfect. Although Consciousness plays a big role there are states of consciousness that go beyond Consciousness i.e. the spirit which can be known as a finer energy. Confusing as this sounds it is completely simple if one devote their life into trying to understand what is life. Fortunately for the Earth people, they have had true prophets since time in Memorial giving them the truth of life within the education level of those people during that time and that doesn\u2019t exclude this generation as of now which also means that there are people knowing of the truth with great wisdom spreading it with the best of their abilities during this time. People will find out the truth Inevitably. They will soon learn consciousness development, consciousness utilization, spiritual growth and will realize that they are already perfect within a perfect system that is striving to progress itself even further. There is no doubt and no such thing as to worry or no such thing as anxiety or any confusion as one builds knowledge to understand how love is the meaning of life. This brings in different truths which indicates that the law of repetition,  in other words people must live multiple lifetimes in order to understand their impulses to progress forwardly. This is also known as reincarnation of the spirit and incarnation of the consciousness. We also have to understand that we created a language in order to understand the law of the invisible i.e. the consciousness. There are different states of consciousness that spiral itself as an existence for different duties to bring out a singularity of an infinite building. Human beings are destined for greatness. Remember, there are many wise ones among you that can be found easily with the correctional directional wanting to fine purest of the truth to understand reality through its essence. It is up to you as the individual to determine what is truth from faults, with is specific information from general information, facts from lies, wisdom from arrogance. The devotion to live a life and understand how to take it further of course deals with a lot of meditation, hard work, and connecting with people around yourself where you as the person of control can learn from everyone to soon apply information to yourself in order to find greater Truth.

The strict materialistic explanation for the mind \u2014 the attribution of immaterial mental acts and properties to brain matter \u2014 is, by definition, a materialist superstition, a &quot;false irrational conception of causation in nature maintained despite evidence to the contrary.&quot; -- Dr. Michael Egnor, award winning neurosurgon<br><br>&quot;It really is that absurd. For materialists, the metaphor of memory for computer storage of electronic representations has become metaphysics, which (sadly) is a bit of an improvement on actual materialist metaphysics, which is utterly incoherent. The proper response to this pitiful error is a bit of common sense, explained slowly.&quot; - Dr. Michael Egnor, award winning neurosurgon<br><br>&quot;Materialists have taken note of the growing efforts by non-materialist neuroscientists to point out the deep problems with the inference that the brain is entirely the cause of the mind. Materialist neuroscience, like materialist evolutionary biology, is a vacuous orthodoxy, and its proponents resent threats to their dogma. Darwinian explanations for functional biological complexity are nonsense, but some familiarity with the relevant science is necessary to understand that it is nonsense. Materialist explanations for the mind are transparent nonsense.&quot; - Dr. Michael Egnor, award-winning neurosurgeon<br><br>&quot;The plain fact is that the materialist picture of the body and brain as the producers, rather than the vehicles, of human consciousness is doomed. In its place a new view of mind and body will emerge, and in fact is emerging already. This view is scientific and spiritual in equal measure and will value what the greatest scientists of history themselves always valued above all: truth.&quot; - Dr. Alexander, University of Virginia Medical School, former faculty member at Harvard Medical School<br><br>&quot;There are not many options - essentially just two. Either human intelligence ultimately owes its origin to mindless matter; or there is a Creator. It is strange that some people claim that it is their intelligence that leads them to prefer the first to the second.&quot; - John Lennox, PhD mathemetician Oxford University, theologian<br><br>If atheism were true, humans would be soulless bags if matter with no innate value. Therefore, atheism is not only absurd, obviously false, and cannot provide for the existence of anything including morality, but is in fact a dangerous necromancy that has caused the death of hundreds of millions of people in the 20th century - a mountain of bodies and a river of blood - all because atheists refuse out of pride to acknowledge God. Atheism is a sickness that has done too much harm already. It should be internationally illegal to tell anyone they are a souless bag of matter. This is abuse of the highest order.<br><br>Atheism is the least intellectual idea ever produced by a human, and requires a person to be in denial of a large percentage of the accrued knowledge of mankind. Atheists believe the universe exploded from a spaceless point, produced astonishing order, ultimately producing rock soup which came alive which then organized itself into Beethoven and space probes. They believe soulless bags of matter write novels too. Logical, rational, scientific stuff if I ever heard it. Those atheists are so smart!<br><br>If the mind is entirely caused by matter, free will cannot exist. If free will does not exist, then there is no such thing as an opinion. Therefore the atheist assertion, &quot;There is no evidence for the existence of God.&quot; is is just chemical reaction, not an opinion, and cannot be either true or false.<br><br>If atheistic materialism were true, then immaterial things like propositions, such the proposition that materialism is true, can&#39;t be true.

Matter is governed by fixed laws, and if our thoughts are entirely the product of brain chemistry, then our thoughts are determined by brain chemistry.

In fact, the view that &quot;materialism is true&quot; is meaningless\u2026 if materialism is true. If materialism is true, then the thought &quot;materialism is true&quot; is just a chemical reaction, neither true nor false. While there are some philosophers who assert that free will can exist in a deterministic aterialistic world (they\u2019re called &quot;compatibilists&quot;), and some have argued that quantum indeterminacy may leave room for free will, the most parsimonious explanation for free will is that there is an immaterial component of the mind that is undetermined by matter.&quot;- Dr. Michael Egnor, award winning neurosurgon", "comment_date": "2020-11-19T23:49:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "simone hunter", "comment_text": "can you make a video explaining our pineal gland (third eye)?  or recommend someone who explains it really well :3", "comment_date": "2020-11-19T18:53:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hi", "comment_text": "Hmm..", "comment_date": "2020-11-19T18:06:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thomas aquinas", "comment_text": "I question whether all animals are devoid of consciousness.

One such discovery is that polymerase is a product of it&#39;s own translation, which proves Special Creation. Another is the discovery that the cell&#39;s structural design is not generated by genetic information, but is instead passed on by reproduction from the reproductive cells of the parents (Cortical Inheritance/Cytotaxis) which traces back to the original created organism. Evolutionism is a philosophy which is contradicted by science. Over 100 yrs ago, Evolution Theory was plausible for naturalists because of their rejection of God. Biological science was rudimentary and archaic, and provided no information about the operations of the cell. Modern biology has very greatly changed what is known of genetics and biology. It has been discovered that life is based upon information which is digitally encoded and stored in a more compressed form than man&#39;s best computer compression schemes.<br><br>DNA is a material medium encoded with digital information which is compressed to a level greater than man&#39;s best information compression schemes, operates with linguistics by employing phonetics, symantics, punctuation,syntax, and grammar which is more complex than any spoken human language, operates algorithmically, operates semiotically (the application of meaning to a symbol and interpretation of meaning from a symbol), is prescriptive, functional, and possesses meaning. There is no potential for the material actions of chemistry to produce information, algorithms, and linguistics. They are non-physical fundamental entities that can only be produced by intelligence because they require forward thinking - consideration of and planning for the future. These facts are proof that all life was designed by a mind of supreme intelligence. Modern discoveries about biology have overwhelmingly demonstrated that evolution is impossible and creation is a scientific fact.<br><br>During an organism&#39;s development, the genetic information instructs the cell on how to turn on and off, like chemical switches, numerous sequences of information of the DNA in a supremely complex and yet to be understood orchestral arrangement of groupings and orders so as to build the structures of an organism. These patterns of genes being switched on and off is so complex that man will likely never be able to decipher it.<br><br>If you want to believe in evolution because you refuse to acknowledge the existence of our creator, nobody can stop you. But doing so is to be a denialists of the discoveries of modern science because the truth is uncomfortable, and to continue to believe things which the outdated concept of Charles Darwin over 150 yrs ago could not have predicted. Believing in evolution today is as antiquated as it was to believe that flies arose from meat, or that frogs arose from mud a century prior to Darwin. <br><br>Eugenie Scott, a militant anti-creationist and promoter of evolutionism has stated, &quot;If your local campus Christian fellowship asks you to &quot;defend evolution,&quot; please decline. Public debates rarely change many minds; creationists stage them mainly in the hope of drawing large sympathetic audiences. Have you ever watched the Harlem Globetrotters play the Washington Federals? The Federals get off some good shots, but who remembers them? The purpose of the game is to see the Globetrotters beat the other team. And you probably will get beaten.&quot;<br><br>Atheists in fact hate the Scientific Method and refuse to employ it. The most agregious example is the scientific knowledge of the effects of random genetic mutation. Random genetic mutation experimentation has been conducted for over 80 years. Over one million studies have been concluded, and they have provided consistent results demonstrating that random mutations are destructive and have negative effects upon organisms, both biochemically and anatomically, and do not add anything useful to the physiology of any organism, not even incrementally. What do we therefore conclude? We must conclude that mutation cannot be a mechanism for accruing change that results in macroevolution. But what does the atheist conclude despite such a massive body of evidence? They continue to claim that random mutation IS a mechanism for accruing change that results in mind-bending complexity, microscopic interdependent machinery, and macroevolution. They do this not because of science, but because their worldview requires it to be, since if evolution were true, random mutation would have to be the base mechanism for evolution since genetic information prescribes the features of organisms. In this way, they refuse to come to the correct conclusion because of their paradigm, tossing out the Scientific Method and the conclusion it would require them to accept.", "comment_date": "2020-10-30T16:47:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George H.", "comment_text": "This only addressed the motivation to know stuff (it&#39;s useful).

To be fair, after aforementioned prayer study (conducted still under John Templeton) showed that patients who were prayed for were not getting any better than control group (in fact, they were getting worse), the fundation did not try to dress it up and subsequently gave up further prayer studies :)", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T17:35:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JL Deshayes", "comment_text": "that&#39;s it", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T07:48:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JL Deshayes", "comment_text": "count to ten", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T07:48:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Foster", "comment_text": "I swear you guys are just gods trying to guide us", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T21:45:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ceren \u00d6zer", "comment_text": "guys, do you know any other channel like kurzgesagt?", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T20:33:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JL Deshayes", "comment_text": "now i understand", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T19:20:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laura Ess", "comment_text": "Well, I just felt hungry after watching this!", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T06:59:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "rakesh sharma", "comment_text": "Consciousness is not for survival..", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T06:57:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "William Baker", "comment_text": "Abortion", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T20:57:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BurkyBurks", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not gonna lie, I thought we were about to get a Dominoes Ad at the end there.", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T18:31:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Footnotes2Plato", "comment_text": "&quot;Awareness of the world comes in handy&quot; and has functions.

And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity; Similar is the case of money stolen by a thief who hides the ill-gotten money and then misuses it or commits more misdeeds; \u201cwho does not owe it does not fear it\u201d. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T21:52:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fishIsnotfish fish", "comment_text": "Someone pls figure this out, I&#39;m tired of hearing about soul this soul that.

Animals haven&#39;t developed this skill fully yet which is why sometimes they share consciousness, like in a school of fish swimming quick turns all in unison or birds in flight making microsecond turns all in unison. It is because they share a consciousness point of awareness. If we develop even further we will see that although we are sovereign beings with independent thoughts we are still all part of a whole and connected to everything in the Universe, literally. This is the recognition of Love, seeing ourselves in others and being one.

Yes, our senses likely evolved in order to succeed in what biologists call the &quot;consummate goal&quot; which is usually reproduction, this of course required survival.<br>So yes, it makes sense that senses were first developed to increase success in the consummate act of the being&#39;s life. That was millions of years ago for one thing and is not necessarily representative of our current reality unless we assume that evolution is only sex and food in which case it should be termed &quot;consummate act heuristic genetic durability&quot; or some shit. Evolution is more than that. But again reductionism. I believe evolution is bringing us towards a higher state not just loping along looking for pizza and oral. For some that&#39;s all there is but that&#39;s not representative of all people.<br>In any project there are stages: eg fix spark plugs, paint red, clean and buff, fill with gasoline, go downtown and work with a financial analyst to increase your retirement savings.<br>The final step is qualitatively and quantitatively different. If evolution (as displayed) increases adaptability relative to the environment to ensure the consummate act / survival, why do we assume it does not continue with higher adaptations which are now neccesary. And so on across time. In a million years will evolution still be figuring out how many feet to have or how to interact with the changed world the person now exists in?<br>TLDR; Reductionism makes science easy but makes it lose 90% of its assessment/predictive value.

What element an atom is is purely dependent of its protons. Why is that so? How does adding a proton to an element make it a different element? When you think enough about it you will realize that the other things you learned about atoms, the mass for example, aren&#39;t much different. When you add neutrons to an atom, what exactly did you change? When you add electrons to an atom what did you change?<br><br>We tend to easily accept the mass and electrons because we learned how it affects the atoms before.<br>When the number of electrons of an atom changes and it becomes ionized, the way it interacts with other ions changes and that&#39;s basically it. When you change the mass of an atom the way it interacts with forces like gravity changes, nothing else. When you change the number of protons of an atom the way it interacts with other atoms, to form molecules, changes.<br><br>All characteristics atoms have are purely dependent on how they interact with other atoms and particles.<br>There might exist millions of other elemental particles that we will never find because they don&#39;t interact with anything we can perceive. When an object interacts with light we can see it with our eyes or with cameras. When an object is too small for that we need other ways to find them. One way is to find out if they interact with electrons that are shooted at them. This way we can get similar results to shooting the object with light.<br>This is how new particles are found, by the way they interact with other particles we already know. If there was an object that was simply existing and could not affect other objects when colliding with them we would never find out. When experiments are made and the results differ even though the two scientists did everything the same we know that there might have been some particle that we never saw before, but only because it affected the results.<br>We know about gravitational waves because we were able to measure how they affect objects we know.<br><br>And that is all there is to it. An object is purely defined by the way it interacts with other objects. What we call the appearance of an object is just the product of it interacting with light and the light interacting with our eyes.<br><br>The second perspective is very similar, you could look at it from an informatics perspective.<br>We had a school project in which we programmed a game in Java.<br>From working with an object oriented language for the first time I gained some amazing insights that made me understand the problem with elements and protons in the first place.<br>When you create an object it first does nothing. You can give it a position and attributes, that would be the equivalent of mass or electrical charge, but even giving the object these attributes still doesn&#39;t make it &quot;exist&quot; in a way that is meaningful for the program. It&#39;s the same for particles and consciousness. There may exist many forms that we&#39;ve never discovered, because they don&#39;t interact with anything we can perceive. In the program I could give the objects pictures so they were at least visible. But not every object can be represented with a picture. If an object doesn&#39;t have any visual appearance on the screen and doesn&#39;t interact with objects that are visible then what is the object? Does it actually exist? For the computer the object does exist and takes up memory, but for the other objects that just don&#39;t interact with it does it even exist?<br>The conclusion is that the attributes don&#39;t even have any meaning and are just values that we assign to the object to be able to calculate how it should interact with other objects.<br>Without the object interacting with us or any other object to create a result we can measure there is no way for us to find out about all the hidden objects in the universes inaccessible memory.", "comment_date": "2020-03-24T14:10:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u7a81\u6483!\u304a\u524d\u3068\u6669\u5fa1\u98ef!", "comment_text": "\u9762\u767d\u3044", "comment_date": "2020-03-24T04:04:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AgarWorstPlayer", "comment_text": "7k people were not conscious when they disliked", "comment_date": "2020-03-24T04:01:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ATPhack", "comment_text": "Exceptionnal", "comment_date": "2020-03-23T21:15:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alessandro Rohr", "comment_text": "My 10 cents: conscience Is when you know why you do a thing", "comment_date": "2020-03-23T17:34:46Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Ultra Link", "comment_text": "Did anyone else just get a huge WTF moment at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8&amp;t=8m57s\">8:57</a>?!", "comment_date": "2020-03-23T14:03:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jlinus", "comment_text": "This felt like an add for spore", "comment_date": "2020-03-23T12:46:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis Santana", "comment_text": "Everybody is I, you all you\u2019re you.<br><br>And wheresoever\u2019s beings exist throughout all galaxies it doesn&#39;t make a difference.<br><br>You are all of them and when they come into being as you come into being.", "comment_date": "2020-03-23T08:07:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mrcdplay", "comment_text": "This is so low-IQ.

Nothing is the same as fullness. In the endless state fullness is the same as emptiness. The Nothing is both empty and full. One may just as well state some other thing about the Nothing, namely that it is white or that it is black or that it exists or that it exists not. That which is endless and eternal has no qualities, because it has all qualities.<br><br>The Nothing, or fullness, is called by us the PLEROMA. In it thinking and being cease, because the eternal is without qualities. In it there is no one, for if anyone were, he would be differentiated from the Pleroma and would possess qualities which would distinguish him from the Pleroma.<br><br>In the Pleroma there is nothing and everything: it is not profitable to think about the Pleroma, for to do that would mean one\u2019s dissolution.<br>I say these things to you in order to free you from the illusion that it is possible to think about the Pleroma. When you speak about the divisions of the Pleroma, we are speaking from the position of our own divisions, and we speak about our own differentiated state; but while we do this, we have in reality said nothing about the Pleroma. However, it is necessary to talk about our own differentiation, for this enables us to discriminate sufficiently. Our essence is differentiation. For this reason we must distinguish individual qualities.<br><br>You say: What harm does it do\u00a0not\u00a0to discriminate? Then we reach beyond the limits of our own being; we extend ourselves beyond the created world, and we fall into the undifferentiated state which is another quality of the Pleroma. We submerge into the Pleroma itself, and we cease to be created beings. This we become subject to dissolution and nothingness.<br><br>Such is the very death of the created being. We die to the extent that we fail to discriminate. For this reason the natural impulse of the created being is directed toward differentiation and toward the struggle against the ancient, pernicious state of sameness. The natural tendency is called\u00a0Principium Individuationis\u00a0(Principle of Individuation). This principle is indeed the essence of every created being. From these things you may readily recognize why the undifferentiated principle and lack of discrimination are all a great danger to created beings. For this reason we must be able to distinguish the qualities of the Pleroma.

Our eyes could feed the brain visual data like from a camera, our brain can process it, understand it, put it in perspective and relate with memory and then feed to us. We are aware of what that data means, our brain helped us understand it, brain is always conditioned making the same data be understood and related differently, creating perspectives, but still that not it.

However hunger, or the need for fuel, is a very good example of conscious behavior.  To be conscious is only the awareness of self existence.  It doesn\u2019t need to pertain to intelligence(or thought). It\u2019s proposed consciousness is the bi product of any body with many moving systems that are autonomous.  For example, earth or mars or the entire galaxy for that matter, may be conscious.  Now if one of those bodies began rationalizing complex choices.  Based off information received from the many systems, that could argue intelligence.  There is a plausible hypothesis there as well, global warming/cooling could very well be from intelligence outside a brain.  Most likely it\u2019s a cause and effect from trapped gasses being released via nature(humans, animals, volcanoes, methane pockets).

Surprosingly, consciousness is acally a word. It has a relationship to the language cortex. We ask &quot;are you conscious of X&quot;? Example: are you conscious of your blood sodium level or heart beat? The answer is no. Your body knows it very well and controls tightly, but there is no pathway how to reroute that information into your language cortex. Consciousness is the set of percepts that can be queried inside the brain and rerouted to language cortex or other part of brain that is able to transmit information outside the body - by speech, gesture, facial expression etc. When you sleep you can talk about your dreama later but cannot talk about what was going in your head during deep sleep. Therefore you are conscious of dreams, but not of deep sleep. Your visual cortex perceives thousands of edges and corners every second but you are not conscious of them. You can reroute them into your language cortex on demand and become conscious of them.

That was when i had the epiphany that all humans and even living things only live for one purpose - to search for food. that&#39;s when i realize all of us are actually equal in that sense and there is really nothing to be inherently worried about. it&#39;s funny as well because it turns out that the action of searching food itself rooted to the very basic and foundation of our consciousness. <br><br>that&#39;s it thanks for reading. you can go back to your procrastination", "comment_date": "2019-08-30T01:44:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dadou", "comment_text": "So i\u2019m conscious only when im hungry ?", "comment_date": "2019-08-30T01:14:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sir Meow Meow", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8&amp;t=0m28s\">0:28</a><br>Use this trick to freak people out.", "comment_date": "2019-08-29T16:08:28Z", "likes_count": 32}, {"comment_by": "Elias D", "comment_text": "Blindly follow the sense of smell of food, and lack awareness around it. <br>I can relate", "comment_date": "2019-08-29T14:34:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jason", "comment_text": "So the answer is Consciousness came from .... wait for it....

As far as the consciousness that you speak of of being aware of consciousness this just means the abilities in which we have as humans perceive our environment have succeeded are basic needs for survival buy an astronomical amount. Truthfully all of humanity and all other creatures boil down to two factors in life at the minimum food and sex. Food because a life-form needs to extend it&#39;s life for as long as possible cuz that is the point of life is to live and sex is to continue on life beyond the point in which a single organism can sustain itself. Whether you think of space travel or growing a garden or the attractive person in front of you. Space travel is an understanding or consciousness( otherwise known as the ability to perceive if you haven&#39;t caught on by this point) that Earth cannot sustain us at our current rate forever do the math which is another form of perceiving things, planting a garden / hunting or gathering is basic fact that we need energy or food, the final one seeing an attractive individual or perceiving is the fact of continuing on life past the cycle in which our bodies will stand up to whether it is conscious or subconscious to us it&#39;s still conscience.", "comment_date": "2019-08-27T03:18:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kamil Macieja", "comment_text": "Spongbob actually teched me that u can ride on Stones", "comment_date": "2019-08-26T21:05:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex bloom", "comment_text": "I think consciousness is one of those topics that generate more questions than answers, what is interesting is that consciousness seems to be like an instinct, something that we are already programmed to have.<br>There have been some cases of people that have had their half brain removed and even retain their consciousness.", "comment_date": "2019-08-26T19:25:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Single Londa", "comment_text": "but the major question is that where is consciousness exist<br>and can it be transferred from one body to another ?", "comment_date": "2019-08-26T18:15:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason O", "comment_text": "No Part 2 or 3 yet?", "comment_date": "2019-08-26T15:58:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "HelloFestive", "comment_text": "Ujhhhehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh cooolb but wjsysy is say ysitttirs very llsteaye", "comment_date": "2019-08-26T01:11:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gameboy772", "comment_text": "so if language is what seperates us consciously from other animals, I wonder how different and complex other animal languages could be.

And just like life itself, we are animate systems made up of inanimate parts.

And why does all emotion fear it?<br><br>Many speak of consciousness, but few ever describe what it means to be fully conscious. What it actually means to be in the state of consciousness.<br><br>In short consciousness IS NOW.<br><br>And by that I mean. When you are fully conscious, or fully aware, you then<br>have complete presence of mind.<br><br>You are then fully present.<br><br>And the present is of course NOW.<br><br>So, consciousness IS NOW.<br><br>Now, when you do correctly understand that consciousness is NOW, it is then far easier to understand why all emotion fears the evolution of consciousness as it does.<br><br>And more importantly, why emotion is working as hard as IT is in order to hinder the continued evolution of the state of consciousness on planet earth.<br><br>You see, all emotion is actually born of the past. All emotion is past.<br><br>Emotion is actually the residue of the past that continues to live on, both in us, and off us.<br><br>Hence exactly why, in this currently emotionally driven society, we are all taught from birth to habitually both talk, and think, about the past.<br><br>As by doing so, we are unknowingly helping to feed those very emotions that are actually living off us.<br><br>We have actually been conditioned to unknowingly create a feed back loop.<br><br>A feed back loop that was designed to help those very emotions that are continually draining us of our precious energy.<br><br>And when I do say US, I of course mean LIFE.<br><br>As I am in fact LIFE.<br><br>I am the LIFE in this body.<br><br>So, why does all emotion fear the evolution of consciousness on planet earth?<br><br>Well, as our speed of consciousness continually increases. As we become more NOW in other words.<br><br>So in turn, is there ever less room for the past. For emotion to actually express itself.<br><br>As of course in the present, in the moment NOW, there is no past.<br><br>Now, there is also another important fact that you must understand about NOW.<br><br>About consciousness.<br><br>And that fact is, that in the NOW, in the present, there is no motion whatsoever.<br><br>That in the NOW everything is in fact \u2018absolutely still\u2019<br><br>I mean, just look at NOW intelligently for one moment.<br><br>Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now.<br><br>In the end, the perpetual moment NOW actually moves so fast, that in reality it does not in fact move at all.<br><br>Just as I said above, the moment NOW is in fact \u2018absolutely still\u2019<br><br>Now, as all emotion depends wholly upon the ability to express itself, to move in other words.<br><br>As the word e-motion so clearly proves.<br><br>Of course, something that relies as greatly as emotion does, on the continued ability to move. Is going to work rigorously to avoid any state that is actually devoid of all motion.<br><br>As in that state, the emotion can see its own eventually demise.<br><br>Emotion fears stillness.<br><br>As stillness (of mind) is GOD.<br><br>\u201cBe still and know that I am God\u201d<br><br>That unending state of calmness and tranquility, that is deliberately being destroyed by your many troublesome emotions.

Also I&#39;m sorry if a lot of this doesn&#39;t make sense, but I&#39;m not very good at putting my thoughts into words. In simplest terms I describe intelligence as an understanding of existence, and consciousness as an awareness of existence.

In short what I&#39;m trying to get at with this story of mine is that this life changing experience played a major role in me coming to this conclusion as well as many other views I have on concepts such as morality, mortality, the meaning of life, and etc. So even if you couldn&#39;t follow anything I said I can&#39;t blame you, and I hope it was at least an interesting read.", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T15:47:22Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Biswajyoti Das", "comment_text": "Psychopaths have less consiosness , studying psychopaths could help understand the nature of consciousness.....<br>They never accept their mistakes.....<br>(Less consciousness)<br>But they probably won&#39;t let us study them.....<br>Nor would they do it themselves......", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T15:05:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OLE OLE OLE", "comment_text": "the more I learn, the less i know", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T11:04:49Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Vena", "comment_text": "The Bible meations how we came to be.

What&#39;s the underlying thing that made the worm conscious?&#39; - you answered by saying that the worm had a nervous system. But what is it then about the nervous system that did give rise to that consciousness? In what way the appearence of the nervous system allowed consciousness to exist? That is what&#39;s missing in the puzzle. At a very basic level: what is it about certain physical properties that give rise to the consciousness?<br>I believe that, instead of them causing such consciousness to appear, they themselves are consciousness in itself. They appear to be such that they themselves are, instead consciousness. What do we know about them? This: once they appear, there is consciousness; once they aren&#39;t there anymore, there is no consciousness. (Or do we? Do we really know? Or are we just guessing?)<br>We then ask: why do they allow consciousness to exist? Yeah. And there lies the problem, right in front of us, that &quot;something&quot; that we can&#39;t possibly understand. How did we get to this point? By asking just one more &#39;why&#39; than necessary.

A few points:  A &quot;living thing&quot; is a neutral, non-charged term.   With the term, &quot;self&quot; we have already entered emotionally charged territory.  Recently, the theory that consciousness means &quot;information integration&quot; has gained notice.  I would suggest that &quot;information integration&quot; means<br>&quot;information integration&quot;, and that what we mean by &quot;consciousness&quot; is different.  To we humans &quot;consciousness&quot; means being aware, but more importantly,  &quot;being aware of being aware&quot;.  Now, you could say that &quot;being aware of being aware&quot; is part of our &quot;information integration&quot; if you like I suppose.  But, I submit that to most of us &quot;information integration&quot;  does not feel like a satisfactory explanation of what we mean by &quot;consciousness&quot; or of &quot;being aware of being aware&quot;.  If we ponder deeply &quot;being aware of being aware&quot; that will lead directly to an infinite regression - mirrors reflecting mirrors infinitely.   I think that is a clue that what we really mean by &quot;consciousness&quot; lies beyond conception, and  gives a strong hint that  the word &quot;consciousness&quot; is not an appropriate one for science to use.  I suggest that the the term &quot;consciousness&quot; is useful to teachers of traditional spiritual traditions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism,  and to Jungian psychology perhaps,  but not to neurologists.  Like &quot;self&quot;, it is too emotionally charged, and consequently muddies the waters of science.   I think science should stick to dry, neutral terms like &quot;information integration&quot;.", "comment_date": "2019-03-30T14:20:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CryoraptorA303TM", "comment_text": "Please make some more immune system videos, it&#39;s been a while since the ebola video", "comment_date": "2019-03-30T14:18:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rostro", "comment_text": "Does kurzgesagt realize that jacksepticeye watches his videos?

So, some guys in orange robes have been researching this topic for a while, and their experiments and experience may shed some light. First, you must define Consciousness. Through the practice of meditation, anyone can come to experience that there are 2 types of consciousnesses - those that arise from your sensory perceptions, and a base awareness. \r<br>\r<br>Upon close observation, it is experienced that our minds have a consciousness of visual perception, a consciousness of sound, a consciousness of discursive thought/speech, and so on, that immediately and simultaneously arise with the perception of those sensations. In other words, without those sensations, those consciousnesses do not exist in that moment. The hardware still exists of course, but the software doesn&#39;t launch without a trigger. \r<br>\r<br>Upon the knowing/sensing, the mind then immediately processes those senses, begins to judge them, and finally takes action. If one manages to train themselves to let the mind settle down  properly, one sees those sensory consciousnesses slowly wink out, one by one, until you are only aware of being aware. Awash in an infinite sea of nothingness, no thoughts, no sensations, no concepts. It is clear, like pure water. This can be called base awareness.\r<br>\r<br>What gives rise to this? Simply one more piece of hardware in the brain? If so, is it part of the primordial lizard brain of our brain stem, or is it a function of the higher, more recently evolved pieces? To say the origins of consciousness lie in the evolved ability to perceive and react to the senses would perhaps imply that this second type of consciousness arose separately. But why would it? How does this kind of awareness help in survival and reproduction? Did Neanderthal ladies really dig deep discussions on reality? Or perhaps this base awareness arises as a response to the multitude of sensory information, and is like a mental space of sorts, a room with many doors, that gathers and stores these other consciousnesses and acts as an operator of information, so that when the senses are all triggered and on, we can have a coordinated perception of a single reality, a gathering of consciousnesses that we mentally meld into one, and call &quot;Consciousness&quot;. It arises only in the presence of other consciousnesses, arising with the knowing, and disappearing only when there is nothing to be conscious of, like its siblings. Perhaps then this base awareness is simply the coordinator, the collector, or the store consciousness - a simple virtual space created by the brain to make sense of the world. If that&#39;s the case, then any organism with more than one sense may have it too. They might not be able to isolate this awareness mentally like we can, which is why we feel special.", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T16:23:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wiijii Fidelity", "comment_text": "Simple: Because of God, morans", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T13:56:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Boomberry", "comment_text": "did anyone else look at the wrong cup?...<br>nope... just me", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T12:01:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tami | J5", "comment_text": "Is it possible to maka a black hole on earth ,to get infinite energy", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T09:22:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1wsx10", "comment_text": "what about big questions of everything?", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T09:20:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saad MAFiA", "comment_text": "so pro guys. i love this channel since it started", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T09:16:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "captaincrazyhat", "comment_text": "I can\u2019t wait until they explain the question!

Still cry, laugh, love, hate, drive your car, anything but not actually have a conscious experience of it. i think the logical jump is a little to big for me. Someone like hellen keller who was blind, deaf, and mute i think would still be considered conscious by most people if one were to ask them. But a computer that is better than any human would not be considered by most people to be conscious at all. I personally think it may well be the case that science cannot explain consciousness at all. Maybe consciousness is fundamental and you start there then get everything else and so it would be strange to explain consciousness with science if consciousness is needed to even have science. just my opinion though i have no evidence just something i am sympathetic to.

All life is however, characterised with awareness and at some level biological processes indicative of motion in quanta. We could consider crystals alive, but they&#39;re all on the low side of awareness as intelligence is the factor that boosts the universal capability of awareness that all matter is capable of depending on its physical structure.

Delving into this, must understand first that the probability of even one protein forming in the vastness of the primordial universe is mathematically impossible, but the scapegoat for this impossibility is commonly time. This is not even to mention the cohesiveness and complexity of even just one protein, let alone how all life and environmental factors fit together perfectly like a puzzle for us to survive- every species, every law, every cycle, every system. But, it&#39;s also not really so much probability as it is the requirements for the production of a functioning system. Just like a protein (and any complex life form) must come into existence with every single organic component present, or an environment with every single cycle and natural parameter, so too does a space time continuum, or what we know as existence in the first place. Space, time, and matter must all have a forced convergence. In other words, a computer cannot begin to function without all of its parts being intricately crafted together- such is our beautiful and mysterious Creation \u271d\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0c<br><br>Digging in a little deeper, zooming out onto the bigger picture can easily be done through study of quantum mechanics, particle physics, and vibration frequency. In these fields we find that we can easily see that there is much more beyond what humans can observe- currently we can only interact with 5% of known matter, solids, liquids, and gasses, while the rest is hidden in mystery, yet is very much alive and moving all around us- governing and determining our minute existence. As seen at CERN, the top particle physics lab in the world, most of the secular world is even excited to see what exactly is in these higher dimensions, but will be utterly shocked to find not only what almost every ancient practice has tapped into, but specifically what the truth of the Bible has already warned about it.  <br><br>Faith in strict materialism and denial of the \u201csupernatural\u201d is vain- the fact that our reality is but the shadow of a larger one remains true and observable, both empirically and scientifically, no matter belief, hence why Einstein, Newton, Copernicus, Kepler, Edison, Galileo, Mendel, Franklin, Bacon, Gladstone, Heisenberg, Tesla- the list goes on and on to other founding fathers of modern science, were all either Christian or deists. Even today, most seasoned physicists that specialize in the unseen are either religious or agnostic. <br><br>It is dangerous and foolish to simply dismiss the Creator using our little playtime understandings and paradigms, assuming that we could fit a being of such cosmic magnitude into our own relative comprehensions- but we will soon all see Him. The clock is ticking brothers and sisters, and the 2000+ Biblical prophecies- all pinpoint accurate in history, archeology, geography, and geology, have intertwined now, such as the Jews returning to Jerusalem, the conflict in the Middle East, a rise in disaster, a world of international communication, and much much more. This is not about religion, but about a relationship with the Father of all. I implore you to be found in His arms when that time comes friends- to receive Yeshua as Lord and Savior, who was sent here as a sacrifice to bring us back to the Father\u2019s loving embrace- and who is transforming the lives of billions even now- waiting for you \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe.

But I&#39;m willing to bet if you took a small network that appears not to have the concept of time, and then increase the number of nodes and training data, it will eventually develop the ability to have states and perceive time, simply because being able to do so enables more efficient and accurate achievement of one&#39;s goals.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s oversimplified, but taking a  discrete step by step approach to the evolution of consciousness is problematic. Consciousness emerges, but not just from step by step accumulation of abilities. An organism that smells, sees, and hears does not necessarily have a higher level of consciousness than one that just sees. I agree that multiple sensory methods, memory, and an understanding of time, seem to be a requirement for consciousness. Yet inferring that there&#39;s an equivalency between capabilities (sensory throughput, memory, intelligence, among others) and self awareness, misses something fundamental that results in apparent paradoxes.<br><br>For example, you imply that simply adding vision provides an organism with the capability to understand object permanence (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8&amp;t=5m04s\">5:04</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8&amp;t=5m44s\">5:44</a>). Yet later you acknowledge that object permanence is not understood even by organisms that have many senses (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8&amp;t=6m00s\">6:00</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8&amp;t=6m33s\">6:33</a>).<br><br>Another problem is revealed when you equate food caching with the emergence of temporal cognisance. Ants and many other insects cache food. Does the individual ant understand time in the same way as the scrub jay? What is the ant colony&#39;&#39;s understanding of time?<br><br>As you can probably tell, I believe emergent properties explain much of what we see in the universe. Failure to explore consciousness as a manifestation of this more fundamental property resulted in a video that could be dismissed as oversimplified, but in reality is just not quite accurate.<br><br>Bill G.", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T22:33:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Dwyer", "comment_text": "I\u2019m a believer of consciousness starting at the level of our DNA.

That the Lizard people and the grand Lizard king living at the grand palace at the Flat Disk Earth&#39;s center core for the past million yrs working on their hologram spaceship we call the moon, and that they bounce their lazers off it in order to create the huge forest fires in order to fight our dangerous ancient enemies the trees. Its a constant struggle the war we&#39;ve fought side by side for millennium against their different legions the pines, the oaks, and the dreaded redwoods constantly creeping and growing spewing their oxygen poison stealing all our precious CO2 and greenhouse gases that trapped us and the stranded Lizard King and its People in this what they call atmosphere trapping us here in spinning disk.", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T17:06:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bladerunner", "comment_text": "my brain exploded. thanks", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T17:03:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "melee", "comment_text": "Delayed Gratification is one thing hard to master.", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T17:00:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik", "comment_text": "Yet another fantastic Video!

Why not start at the so-called &quot;Human Revolution&quot; of the Upper Paleolithic? That appears to be where human animals and other animals began to seriously diverge on this dimension. And if you do start there, you&#39;ll find that the Human Revolution seems to have been jump-started by the human formerly known as Cro Magnon, and now referred to as Early Modern European. And, if you look more closely at him, you&#39;ll find he popped into existence as the hybrid child of Homo Sapiens Sapiens and Homo Neanderthalensis.<br><br><br>Why is this important? Because hybrid animals have a devil of a time succeeding in the wild. First, they are usually sterile (think mules), and even when they aren&#39;t biologically sterile, they can still have overwhelming trouble securing a mate because they are just different from either parent species, and thus from potential mates. The fossil record indicates that EME moved Northward and Westward after emerging near the Levant, where hybridization was happening, likely in one-offs for tens of thousands of years. The point is that, as this new, hybrid animal struggled to survive, he succeeded, and it seems to be due to changes in consciousness forced upon him as a hybrid. He became aware of his difference from the Other. As he moved he began pulling out things from the inside and externalizing them. The emergence of material culture in humans grew from knapping stones to making jewelry and symbols. This is the birth of our form of consciousness, where we reach inside and pull out what doesn&#39;t actually exist in the world outside of us yet, and thus is not shared between us homogeneously, as a mixed-up, hybrid species. As you look around at text, tables, cars, computers, and language - and everything else we have created - understand that our need to build externally the shared world that no longer existed internally among us has been the engine behind it all. <br><br><br>Aside from the hybridization issue, the other main factor is what we seemingly evolved to do, which is taxonomize, breed, and perfect. Agriculture comes to emphasize this urge, and, thousands of years later, we&#39;re all born to taxonomize, and we do it all willy-nilly, applying hierarchies to things whether or not it actually makes sense to do so. That&#39;s called Vacuum Behavior by scientists, and it&#39;s when an animal performs a ritualized behavior even in the absence of the natural stimulus for that behavior. This constant need to taxonomize gives us benefits, but also troubles, like trying to taxonomize races, etc. This kind of behavior is typically non-conscious, if we take consciousness to mean awareness of awareness, and not just awareness, itself.<br><br><br>Updated to add, though pointlessly: This comment is clearly siloed, and it&#39;s also clear that either the user, the platform, or both feel it necessary to hide from me that I&#39;m siloed.", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T15:18:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sergio Garibay Luna", "comment_text": "It cant be solved dont assume there Is a logic explanation", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T15:15:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "volarecantare", "comment_text": "Is the music near the end from A Hat in Time?", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T15:14:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CM Lindgren", "comment_text": "I believe this is in part why AI hasn&#39;t &quot;emerged&quot;; it needs a sensory apparatus from which to perceive the world and have feelings.

The perfect example of this interconnection is why humans can&#39;t remember early development stages in life because these connections haven&#39;t been established; it takes time for sensory experiences to form memories, then for self-reflection of these memories helps create our place in time and who we are. Why is dissociation intriguing well it seems that disorders and disabilities that have it as a core symptom are likely linked to problems with specific brain areas failing to communicate effectively together?

The biological program was simple (and still is for lower lifeforms): TOWARD, AWAY, IGNORE. <br><br>Now we are at &#39;intelligence&#39;, which originated during idle time (also obvious to me), and which added two more commands to nature&#39;s bio-program: CONTEMPLATE and MANIPULATE. Some lifeforms became cleverer than others, and some specialized in cleverness. Humans are at the top of cognitive cleverness (again, obvious to me).<br><br>Now we are at &#39;enlightenment&#39;, meaning philosophical enlightenment, and intelligence and cleverness do not automatically equate with enlightenment. Take humans, for example. They are intelligent and clever, but they are also still unenlightened (enter me and my philosophy, which offers Final Enlightenment - go read it). Another name for an intelligent and clever being that is not yet enlightened is &quot;a loose cannon&quot;, since being unenlightened is another name for &#39;cluelessness&#39; which is blindly destructive (hence the &#39;loose cannon&#39; comparison).<br><br><br>In summary, &#39;consciousness&#39; began as a centralized destination for our various senses (though the brain has many independent parts, and is not technically &#39;centralized&#39;). What we refer to as &#39;consciousness&#39; is this reception center of senses. No big mystery. Later, evolution favored those brains that offered more flexibility in motor outputs - i.e. those outputs that are no longer &#39;hard-wired&#39;, where the hard-wiring bypasses the brain - we still have hard-wiring - we call them &#39;reflexes&#39; - they offer no flexibility - they are singular in their outputs, and their advantage is &#39;speed&#39; - we need not waste time contemplating what output to choose from.", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T01:56:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wolf Larson", "comment_text": "Trying to imagine what conciousness is, is like trying to bite your own teeth", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T01:54:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Talentless Bird", "comment_text": "Cells or selves?", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T01:53:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chillyx", "comment_text": "Can a Christian still believe in evolution?", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T01:53:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NyanGelatOak", "comment_text": "Sometimes i think to when i die<br>what happens?<br>What will I experience?<br><br><br>It all swarms in my head until I get this... feeling.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>THAT FEELING", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T01:52:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "apeman939", "comment_text": "Phenomenal video.

Paul says in the same verse that in our present state we know reality only dimly, but at the resurrection we will see things clearly. It was always the apostle Paul&#39;s purpose to know Christ &#39;in the power of His resurrection&#39;. Self-realisation will be one of the joys of eternal life for Christians in the ages to come, second only to the joy of knowing Christ in His fulness and glory. We are created beings; He is the Creator by Whom and through Whom and for Whom all things were created (Col.1v16). He took humanity upon Himself ( Heb. 2 v14) so that He could die for sin and unto sin, so that we might, through faith in Him, be redeemed and restored to enjoy a walk in the very presence and consciousness of God, which Adam forfeited by His act of disobedience (Gen. 2v17). When he sinned Adam died spiritually even before he died physically, and brought the same death/s upon us, his progeny. Adam became estranged from the source and immediate joy of his consciousness, and we have inherited his fallen nature. We see as through a glass darkly (1 Cor, 13 v 12).<br><br> Through Christ , and only through Him, new birth is offered and has to be received only by faith. Not through meditation, nor through chanting mantras or conscious thinking, nor even through charitable works, but by faith in Christ and His redemptive work on the cross, and His bodily resurrection in the power of the eternal Spirit. And we are promised that at the great consummation of God&#39;s plan, our faith will be replaced by knowledge and direct perception of reality. This is the way God has chosen, and revealed to us in His Word. The Lord has chosen FAITH in Christ to be the way to salvation, and all the wonder it promises.<br><br> The psalmist tells us that in His presence is FULLNESS OF JOY. Truth is not relative, Christ ALONE is Truth. He is the Way, the Life and the Truth (Jn.14 v6). The sad misery of the lost will be missing out on self-realisation and on knowing Him, the very source of life. Accept Christ while there is time; don&#39;t reject Him as millions do; don&#39;t accept a bogus philosophy masquerading as spirituality or &#39;eastern wisdom&#39;. Don&#39;t be beguiled by soft hypnotic voices mouthing &#39;profound&#39; platitudes in incense-clouded ashrams. They speak only to the vanity of the mortal, death-bound self of the flesh and ego, though they may masquerade in &#39;religious&#39; robes, claiming to be the way to &#39;enlightenment&#39;. Don&#39;t be misled into wasting time gazing at your navel, or &#39;contemplating&#39; the banal and pretentious childish nonsense of Nasrudin et al.<br><br> If you wish to have faith, simply ask for it and your Creator will not deny it to you. He says &#39;come unto Me all ye that thirst and I will give you LIVING WATER&#39; (Jn.4 vv13-15). Where does consciousness come from? Genesis tells us! God BREATHED life into the man he had formed from the dust of the earth  (including his physical brain and nervous system and other apparatus), and Man became a living creature (Gen2 v7). He received consciousness and self-awareness, an &#39;I&#39;, from God, and originally enjoyed intimate fellowship with his Creator. Most of all, remember that self-realisation and full joyful consciousness is not something any of us can attain; it is to be received as a gift from God. He, and He alone, is the true Light.

Some say that it has a spirit, or say that we humans have a spirit, or that we and animals have a spirit; and therefore consciousness. But there is no way of proving so. Language is sometimes taken as \u00b4The Human Esence\u00b4, since it allow us to talk about an infinite amount of things we want to talk. Those who say so have the idea that language involves having cosciousness of the existence <del>or non existence-</del> of things, and that the use of words creates a creative mind. Several scientific approaches have been developed to study language, and many ideas have came out to explain the linguistic phenomenon since ancient times. Sign language,  invented languages and codes, other species ways of communication, and many other things related to the study of language are the scope of many different sciences, as biology, neuroscience, linguistics, anthropology or literary studies. Linguistics is a very broad science nowadays. Noam Chomsky and B.F. Skinner are seen as the main characters in the study of language, but many, maany ideas and ways of studying language and literature have been raised up. Terrence Deacon wrote on his book The Symbolic Species that we humans have a special faculty that he calls symbolic thinking. He argues that only humans have language, and that no language, no consciousness. On the other hand, Yuval Harari says in his book Sapiens that most animals have some kind of language. Our language basis is the use of signs and rules, but also many other species language. Thus, the only difference between us and other animals is that in our species happened what is called the Cognitive Revolution, which brought many language developments, as gossiping or  the invention of fictive stories as those of gods or human rights. The question of what language is and what  it involves in the human species is not easy to answer, but language is undoubtably an important part of consciousness at many levels of life forms, since it involves that organisms require communication for the recognition of some kind of signal to understand some kind of information given by another organism, not necessarily of the same species. Communication enables the interaction among organisms, as well as knowing or recognizing other organisms existence and taking them as friendly or dangerous. Here some information about social organisms most be taken into account. Maybe we did not have our consciusness level when we started using words to communicate. A theory says that we first acquired the control of some parts of our digestive and respiratory systems, allowing us to transform our thoughts into words. I think that every organism has some kind of consciousness. Our brain evolved and connected language with intelligence; Broca\u00b4s and Wernicke\u00b4s areas with the prefontal cortex, making us the Intelligent Life of this planet.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T22:13:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AstraphUriel", "comment_text": "&gt; Big questions of life and the Universe<br><br>I swear to Athena, if you don&#39;t make the combined vids 42 minutes long, I will find you and tickle y&#39;all to death.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T22:11:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Strong", "comment_text": "Yeah.

And some combination of these particles can &quot;amplify&quot; this consciousness feature in regular matter to create more complex versions of consciousness, but the form matters. (Like a brain, for example.) <br><br>At the base of panpsychism, it is realized that the Jump from non-concious particles to consciousness can&#39;t be explained, and therefore it assumes as a &quot;brute fact&quot; that consciousness to some very small degree exists in all particles, and then further deduces that more complex consciousnesses are the result of evolution strategically creating a form over time that amplifies this already existing quality. In the case of rocks, the form is not amplifying the existing consciousness in each particle, so it (as a rock) is no more conscious than a grain of sand, or anything else. You could break it apart and you wouldn&#39;t be &quot;killing&quot; the consciousness of the rock or anything silly like that. <br><br>It&#39;s the view that my philosophy professor held in university, and it&#39;s a view I feel is most likely as well (given the paradoxes that arise from any other assumption).<br><br>Also, the given explanation for consciousness in the video doesn&#39;t explain why we have any &quot;phenomenological experience&quot; associated with using our senses, as opposed to just chasing food like a computer with an evolutionarily designed survival program running would.

The best example of that can be found in the book &quot;Panpsychism in the West&quot; by David Skrbina. Skrbina himself criticized the usage of the &quot;rock&quot; example to describe panspychism. He also offered a different perspective based on a larger definition of consciousness. He wrote: &quot;Upon laying out a panpsychist position, one is immediately\r faced with the charge that he believes that \u201crocks are conscious\u201d\u2014a statement taken as so obviously ludicrous that panpsychism can be dismissed out of hand. (...) To overcome this anthropocentric perspective, the panpsychist asks us to\r see the \u201cmentality\u201d of other objects not in terms of human consciousness but as a subset of a certain universal quality of physical things, in which both inanimate mentality and human consciousness are taken as particular manifestations&quot; (p.17). <br><br><br>Basically, from a larger definition of panpsychism, consciousness does not randomly appears through the process of evolution, but it is a manifestation of a more fundamental aspect of reality. It is intertwined with matter and everything that is. In that perspective, consciousness is somewhat ambient. It is simply experienced differently by different &quot;receptacles&quot;. In that way, we humans possess a more fine-tuned receptacle (our body) to experience certain aspect of consciousness that a rock could never experience. If the rock did indeed experience something, it would be an experience so foreign to human understanding that it would complicate the picture presented at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8&amp;t=1m58s\">1:58</a>.<br><br><br>Therefore, from this panpsychist&#39;s point of view, the debates around consciousness shouldn&#39;t be limited to the only resulting behaviour that we are able to observe (the act of being conscious), but should be open to more philosophical questions around the nature of consciousness. In short, panpsychist uses a much wider definition of consciousness than is normally used. Since consciousness still and will remain a scientific mystery, the philosophical questions and perspectives proposed by panspsychists have withstood the test of time and are still relevant today.   <br><br><br>The important thing to remember here is that the term &quot;panspychism&quot; itself does not possess a singular definition, but is often re-interpreted. No ones believe that rocks have the same level or quality of consciousness as humans, that would be insane.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T19:20:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Marcus Rodriguez", "comment_text": "Wonderful graphics/animation", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T19:17:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ArgumentumAdHominem", "comment_text": "Nice video, a bit misleading though.

I observed similar behavior from beekeeping. An individual bee has no thought, but the second you have a colony of bees, then suddenly all bees start acting as one single unit and additionally each bee seems to have consciousness too. Even if you hide something from sight, the bees that saw the object being hidden will cause every single other bee to instantly know that object is hidden and they will be able to retrieve it. If for example you take one bee that is capable of performing a certain task (digging, pulling, lifting) and you take another bee that incapable of performing such task. The second you put those two bees together, the bee that was incapable of performing said task gains the skill necessary to do so. I still can not wrap my mind how the heck that even is possible.

The human does not need to think &quot;my hand is in the fire, the fire is denaturing proteins in my hand, they will not function properly and I must, therefore, move away before too much damage is done&quot;.

He then suggests that it is not conscious of its environment and this is in direct contradiction of what he just said. If it speeds up where there is no food and slows down where there is food, it is clearly conscious of its immediate environment. He assumes that because it does not make a straight line to a particular destination it is not conscious and that is a fallacious argument. A blind person lost in a desert will wander around in circles. A limited perception does not equate to a lack of consciousness. He then goes on to suggest that it is the search for food that is the birth of consciousness. Thus making this a clickbait title as all he is doing is discussing the evolution of consciousness within what is considered living things. <br><br><br>As I stated previously, plasma is self-organizing and this is due to charge. At a very basic primordial, if not even sub-primordial level charge is aware. Like charges repel and opposite charges attract. The narrator might argue that this is not consciousness but an automatic response, which if we were to accept this then all life is merely an automatic response and honestly, when I look at humanity, homo sapien sapiens, what I see is a species constantly reacting and unaware of why they are reacting thus falsifying the claim we are conscious of our consciousness. But, this is a generalization of &quot;mob/mass&quot; behaviour and does not reflect all individuals. Some of us can rationalize either linearly or spacially. Therefore if we are conscious, then that consciousness can only arise upon layers of highly simplistic consciousness from a sub-primordial level to the complex level all higher orders of life exhibit to the highly complex level of homo sapiens sapiens.  <br><br><br>&quot;A physicist is just an atom&#39;s way of looking at itself.&quot;~Neils Bohr<br><br><br>&quot;Quantum mechanics is confusing and consciousness is confusing, so maybe they&#39;re the same.&quot; ~ Scott Aaronson<br><br><br>&quot;Chemistry is the study of the consciousness of atoms.&quot; ~ Me.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T16:08:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Joseph Yangyang", "comment_text": "my girlfriend don&#39;t even know what to eat for lunch...", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T16:05:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "catfishwithwhiskers", "comment_text": "I feel like the animation in this video was even better than usual.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T16:05:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spiritual Gamer", "comment_text": "Thank you kurzgesagt , this is the best video i have seen about consciousness.

Dr. John Lennox points out that that is self contradictory. Lennox says &quot;If I say x creates y this presupposes the existence of x in the first place in order to bring y into existence. If I say x creates x, I presuppose the existence of x in order to account for the existence of x. To presuppose the existence of the universe, to account for it&#39;s existence is logically incoherent.&quot; It&#39;s much more easier to believe Genesis 1:1 than to believe that sci fi nonsense. So, some Atheists have to redefine nothing to make it something so something can come from nothing. Here, the following are just some out of many scientists who are Biblical creationists, Dr. Jason Lisle has a PhD in astrophysics from the University of Colorado, Dr. Georgia Purdom holds a PhD in molecular genetics from The Ohio State University, Dr. Nathaniel Jeanson holds a PhD in cell and developmental biology from Harvard University, Bodie Hodge has a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Dr. Danny Faulkner holds an MS in Physics from Clemson University and an MA and PhD in Astronomy from Indiana University, Dr. Terry Mortenson holds a masters of divinity and a PhD in the history of geology. It&#39;s not that science is against the the Bible, the darkened mind interprets the evidences for it through a naturalistic presupposition that doesn&#39;t allow anything spiritual because God&#39;s word says it&#39;s because people love their sin and wanna suppress the truth Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8&amp;t=1m18s\">1:18</a>-32.

Bill Gates said &quot;DNA is more advanced than any software ever created.&quot; To believe that DNA came about from a purely unguided natural process with no intelligence guiding that is so foolish.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T13:49:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noodle Spark", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8&amp;t=2m40s\">2:40</a><br>The flying green blob: fucking disappears", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T13:48:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gaurav Bundel", "comment_text": "Now I know what Plumbuses are made for..

Why not? Because that&#39;s the only way human mind work to find the truth! Others can rely on religion, denial and arrogant, or dumb believe.<br><br>If soul is consciousness, what about the material of the consciousness?

What about belief, wasn&#39;t it part of the soul? A belief is a choice that one&#39;s optimum limit of thoughts choose to believe, and became part of them (body &amp; soul).

Do you think an entire sub-field of philosophy with thousands of academic proponents would hold a belief when there are no grounds for it? Of course there are grounds for believing it.

Describing the eating and hunting habits of organisms is not an explanation of the origin of consciousness. All of the sensory abilities described in this video could easily exist within an unconscious machine. Giving an organism photoreceptors might cause their hunting behavior to become more accurate, but that does not in any way explain why it <b>feels like something</b> to be that organism.

To summarize. <br><br>Consciousness through the senses. One of my favorite philosophers makes this point, Alan Watts. He states &quot;We invoke like into the world, if there were no eyes, light simply wouldn&#39;t exist.&quot; Which is a paraphrase. However, it essentially makes the point. Consciousness through awareness, or the senses. If we could not smell, how could we know what roses smelt like? If we cannot see, how would we know what the color red is? You get the point I&#39;m making.<br><br>Our senses make up our consciousness. They make us aware and capable of navigating the difficult plain of existence we live in, even things like emotion, add an extra layer to our conscious being, like empathy, a complex social skill that gives us the ability to empathize with others and make us aware of the emotions of others. <br><br>I think something even more difficult that trying to explain Consciousness, is trying to explain what a specific color looks like, to someone who is color blind. Because the only way to do it, is to use our experiences and understandings of what a specific color is, to explain what that color is, but that person will never truly understand what that color is. <br><br>For example, I have a co-worker who is red green color blind. Even if I went as far as to explain what particular wave length the color red is, he still will not actually know, because it&#39;s an experience we gained through our senses. We became conscious of it through those senses.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T11:33:05Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "delcidkidv", "comment_text": "If we went from simple consciousness to complex consciousness can we eventually become ultra conscious?", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T11:31:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roach Dogg JR", "comment_text": "In conclusion, I think therefore I am, and I think because I&#39;m hungry.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T11:29:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "The One Who Knocks", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt helped me in my pursuit to knowledge every detail is provided for the the questions i yet to answer.

I was in a coma for a week and it was the best thing I have ever not experienced. Not too hot or cold, not too dry or wet, not too light or dark, it was perfect. Try it sometime if you get the chance. Mine was as a result of a head on collision between a big truck and my small, two door hatch, only doing about 50 to 60 Km/h each. The steering wheel hit me in the chin and on the chest, pinned me against the chair before the chair broke and by back did too, L4 vertebra compacted and fractured but I can still walk just fine, &quot;severe brain damage&quot; according to two doctors and some scans also a cleanly broken right tibia (must&#39;ve been relaxed, fear is for the weak LOL) I haven&#39;t felt much pain, and the brain damage only made me smarter albeit more forgetful. I can&#39;t remember the day of the accident, but independent eye witness reports lead me to believe, as soon as my car stopped about 100 meters from the truck, I got out and ran &quot;in record time&quot; to the truck and &quot;abused the driver incoherently&quot;, I wandered back in the direction of my car, kept going in that direction until I collapsed in a field 200 to 300 meters in that direction, the same field that the rescue helicopter landed in, they induced the coma before I could enjoy the free ride.  I &#39;can&#39; remember some of the coma, I spoke while I was in a coma. My brother came in to identify my body, I heard his voice say &quot;Yes, that&#39;s my brother.&quot; I spoke up saying &quot;Yes, that&#39;s Leon, my brother.&quot; trying to get him to pretend to be me because I was worried that my licence may have expired recently. LOL He didn&#39;t get it and told them who I was, a while after I had woken up, I told him about it and he goes, &quot;Yeah, we heard you talking in your coma.&quot; The day I woke up from the coma, all I could think about was the opening scene from &quot;Resident Evil&quot; where Milla wakes up in a hospital bed. I pulled out my ventilator and tore up my vocal chords, (couldn&#39;t talk louder than a whisper for 10 months after that) I pulled out my catheter still inflated, said &quot;F**K THAT HURTS!&quot; My mother saw this and said &quot;I bet it does&quot;, next were the long thin steel things in my chest and as soon as I pulled those out I tried getting up. Everyone jumped and tried to keep me in the bed, but there was blood squirting out of my chest, so I squirted people in the face, waiting a bit for next heartbeat to give me another go at someone else, eventually I made it to the door, looked out and saw four security guards walking down the hall toward me, I thought &quot;f**k this I&#39;m going back to that bed.&quot; turned around, took one step and collapsed unconscious because not enough blood was getting to my brain. I spent 11 months all up in hospital, it was like a holiday where girls dressed as nurses hand feed you and give you a sponge bath whenever you need one. Positive thinker, signing off.

The way to understand what consciousness is is by consciously experience it, everything is relative, and paradoxical that&#39;s is why looking for it out there pushes you further away, you habe to experience it inside your self.  Like a wise man once said, &quot;the truth is in the open&quot; you can&#39;t use superficial tools to understand fundimentsl existential truths, you have to use fundamental existential  thinking in order to acknowledge this. This is why no one can tell it to you, and why we are easily led astrey by superficial temptations and lesser conscious fulfilled hypocrycy of what&#39;s happiness, and fulfillment. Bu these things age not something we talk about in schools and media, because it is not in maslovs hierarchy, of needs to survive.  Media uses sex, food, money, and the feeling of having to have people like family and friends first.  Now the truth however is up to you. This is where change happened. Its an inner journey witch transcends the inner and outer world&#39;s problems. Consciousness is what we cal god. It dosent matter if you belive in god or not. You are existentially already alive. Consciousness is what we cal god. We as humans are this passive natural existancy of everything.this is why in the realization of what and who we are knowledge becomes power over self. This is true fulfillment. We are creators and destroyers. Dont take  word for it. But I really think you should look this up. Because if you don&#39;t maby this may be what will change your life for ever. Every thing else people tell us media and what not, are not bad within itself, it is just important to be conscious about the disrinctuons. I suggest tour learn aboit non duality.

The core issue with consciousness in philosophy is in a sense that it&#39;s not clear why all the reproductive abilities that you mention in this video would need a creature to be conscious - have an experience of &#39;what it is like&#39; to be - on top of their other abilities. <br><br>For instance, a creature arguably needs some sensory apparatus and information processing systems to be succesful. However, having that is not the same as being conscious. A heat-seeking missile has a sensory apparatus that allows it to locate its target, and a complex algorithm that allows it to be intelligent in some regard in navigating to hit its target. However, it would be very controversial to say that the missile is conscious to any degree in virtue of these abilities.<br><br>The same puzzle goes for humans. In order to survive we seem to need information gathering systems (e.g. vision) and information processing (i.e. intelligence), but it&#39;s not clear why we couldn&#39;t have those without qualitative experiences (i.e. consciousness) on top of that. (This is the philosophical thought experiment of &quot;zombies&quot;, see the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article you link to).<br><br>You might well answer that it&#39;s just a law of nature that at some level of combination of intelligence and sensory impressions consciousness will emerge. But that&#39;s highly non-trivial (even if I&#39;m sympathetic to it), and I don&#39;t feel that you said anything similar in this video to support claims about consciousness specifically.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T09:09:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KSAM", "comment_text": "soul anyone?", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T09:06:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YueRhed", "comment_text": "#2 Trending!", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T09:05:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oikawas Butt", "comment_text": "Y is this trending", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T09:05:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "3dJeebs", "comment_text": "but how and why did the first organisms develop the need for survival?", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T09:04:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NeonAtom", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8&amp;t=4m42s\">4:42</a> YAAAAAEEEEEEYYYYY", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T09:04:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pikiwiki", "comment_text": "man. this is better than being in college. in some ways.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T09:02:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christino Sim", "comment_text": "Already #2 on trending and this just posted yesterday.

It tries to explain what consciousness is by taking examples of behaviors in the animal kingdom. But the link between behavior and consciousness is assumed and not proven. Kudzgezagt cited no behavior as proof of no consciousness in a rock, but i fail to see how behavior does prove consciousness. For example, the birds who hide food in a delayed manner don&#39;t require empathy to other souls, if they evolved through natural selection to apply this behavior. They act on instinct, and instinct is typically defined as &quot;unconscious behavior&quot;. Further, advanced machines can be much better at complicated behavior but you would agree they are not conscious.<br><br>Some philosophers / scientists believe that language is one of the necessary ingredients of consciousness. In this regard, the part of the video that would be wrong is the part where you say it&#39;s a gradient scale. The argument is that language allows us to make concrete our mental representions. Research shows that children raised by wolves are cognitively impaired, and they remain that way if &#39;saved&#39; too late.<br><br>But maybe the issue is also philosophical. Because you use &#39;consciousness&#39; as if it just means &#39;awareness&#39; but you also use it in different ways. It shows we can&#39;t explain consciousness, because by definition we can only ever know what our own consciousness is like. So you can never define it.

I don&#39;t think that hunger was the only driving factor in conciousness. I believe it was 1 of 3 aspects.<br><br>The primary need in conciousness is survival. Which would be encompassed by these 3 things. Hunger, sex and lifespan.<br><br>The first rule is hunger. As displayed in this video.<br><br>The second is reproduction/sex. Which requires a basic drive to continue a specie. In most reproductive processes, there are chemical processes required. The exception being one celled critters which only require food to split. I pretty sure that as the complexity of reproduction became more and more involved, the need to be conscious of those circumstances would need to be raised. We call it an inate desire but it is still a conscious effort to actually go out and do the deed, which would require in the very minimum, a degree of memory, conciousness and social capability. All the way up to humans which I&#39;d wager have some of the most complex mating rituals.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the life cycle of a specie. Obviously, most critters have a rather low lifespan and it shows in everything else they do ranging from unawareness of their surroundings to failure to adapt to being outcast in favor of a new evolutionary step. When a creature evolves it is based on those 3 aspects. Hunger, sex and overall lifespan. Which is why so many creatures have some level of what we define as conciousness. It is a necessary evolutionary step to develop the awareness of your surroundings, to remember where food and breeding grounds are and to ensure the best survival rates possible which include things such as camouflage, stealth, cardio, hibernation, etc etc etc. Unless you&#39;re higher on the food tier. While camouflage and stealth is still key, speed, viciousness, hunting/tracking is more required. Being conscious of possible repercussions and defense strategies.<br><br>Then there&#39;s us. Conciousness in unison with perception and  intelligence led to tools, medicine, structures and mastery of every aspect of survival. Even venturing into sustaining lifespans almost 3x the length of our ancestors.<br><br>Question being, what do we do to evolve beyond where we are today? The answer is simple and that&#39;s why so many are against it. The natural process for us is to become less conscious in order to evolve.<br><br>Think about it. We have become so divided as a civilization that we are incapable of moving onto the next step.

That is the greatest contribution of Albert Einstein to humanity: e is equal to mc squared, matter is energy. Matter only appears; otherwise there is no such thing as matter. Nothing is solid. Even the solid rock is a pulsating energy, even the solid rock is as much energy as the roaring ocean. The waves that are arising in the solid rock cannot be seen because they are very subtle, but the rock is waving, pulsating, breathing; it is alive.<br><br> \r<br>Friedrich Nietzsche has declared that God is dead. God is not dead \u00af on the contrary, what has happened is that matter is dead. Matter has been found not to exist at all. This insight into matter brings modern physics very close to mysticism, very close. For the first time the scientist and the mystic are coming very close, almost holding hands.\r<br> \r<br>Eddington, one of the greatest scientists of this age, has said, &quot;We used to think that matter is a thing; now it is no more so. Matter is more like a thought than like a thing.&quot;\r<br> \r<br>Existence is energy. Science has discovered that the observed is energy, the object is energy. Down through the ages, at least for five thousand years, it has been known that the other polarity \u00af the subject, the observer, consciousness \u00af is energy.\r<br> \r<br>Your body is energy, your mind is energy, your soul is energy. Then what is the difference between these three? The difference is only of a different rhythm, different wavelengths, that&#39;s all. The body is gross \u00af energy functioning in a gross way, in a visible way.\r<br> \r<br>Mind is a little more subtle, but still not too subtle, because you can close your eyes and you can see the thoughts moving; they can be seen. They are not as visible as your body; your body is visible to everybody else, it is publicly visible. Your thoughts are privately visible. Nobody else can see your thoughts; only you can see them \u00af or people who have worked very deeply into seeing thoughts. But ordinarily they are not visible to others.\r<br> \r<br>And the third, the ultimate layer inside you, is that of consciousness. It is not even visible to you. It cannot be reduced to an object, it remains the subject.\r<br> \r<br>If all these three energies function in harmony, you are healthy and whole. If these energies don&#39;t function in harmony and accord you are ill, unhealthy; you are no more whole. And to be whole is to be holy.\r<br> \r<br>The effort that we are making here is to help you so that your body, your mind, your consciousness, can all dance in one rhythm, in a togetherness, in a deep harmony \u00af not in conflict at all, but in cooperation. The moment your body, mind and consciousness function together, you have become the trinity, and in that experience is the divine.\r<br> \r<br>Your question is significant. You ask, &quot;Please say something about the relationship of consciousness and energy.&quot;\r<br> \r<br>There is no relationship of consciousness and energy.\r<br> \r<br>Consciousness is energy, the purest energy. The mind is not so pure; the body is still less pure. The body is much too mixed, and the mind is also not totally pure. Consciousness is totally pure energy. But you can know this consciousness only if you make a cosmos out of the three, and not a chaos.\r<br> \r<br>People are living in chaos. Their bodies say one thing, their bodies want to go in one direction; their minds are completely oblivious of the body \u00af because for centuries you have been taught that you are not the body. For centuries you have been told that the body is your enemy, that you have to fight with it, that you have to destroy it, that the body is sin.\r<br> \r<br>Because of all these ideas \u00af silly and stupid they are, harmful and poisonous they are, but they have been taught for so long that they have become part of your collective mind, they are there \u00af you don&#39;t experience your body in a rhythmic dance with yourself.\r<br> \r<br>Hence my insistence on dancing and music, because it is only in dance that you will feel that your body, your mind and you are functioning together. And the joy is infinite when all these function together; the richness is great.\r<br> \r<br>Consciousness is the highest form of energy. And when all these three energies function together, the fourth arrives. The fourth is always present when these three function together. When these three function in an organic unity, the fourth is always there; the fourth is nothing but that organic unity. In the East, we have called that fourth simply the fourth \u00af turiya; we have not given it any name. The three have names, the fourth is nameless. To know the fourth is to know the divine. Let us say it in this way: the divine is when you are an organic orgasmic unity. The divine is not when you are a chaos, a disunity, a conflict. When you are a house divided against yourself there is no divinity.\r<br> \r<br>When you are tremendously happy with yourself, happy as you are, blissful as you are, grateful as you are, and all your energies are dancing together, when you are an orchestra of all your energies, the divine is. That feeling of total unity is what the divine is. The divine is not a person somewhere, The divine is the experience of the three falling in such unity that the fourth arises. And the fourth is more than the sum total of the parts.\r<br> \r<br>If you dissect a painting, you will find the canvas and the colors, but the painting is not simply the sum total of the canvas and the colors; it is something more. That &quot;something more&quot; is expressed through the painting, the color, the canvas, the artist, but that &quot;something more&quot; is the beauty. Dissect the rose flower, and you will find all the chemicals and things it is constituted of, but the beauty will disappear. It was not just the sum total of the parts, it was more.\r<br> \r<br>The whole is more than the sum total of the parts. It expresses itself through the parts but it is more. To understand that it is more is to understand the divine. The divine is that more, that plus. It is not a question of theology; it cannot be decided by logical argumentation. You have to feel beauty, you have to feel music, you have to feel dance. And ultimately you have to feel the dance in your body, mind and, soul. You have to learn how to play on these three energies so that they all become an orchestra. Then the divine is \u00af not that you see it; there is nothing to be seen. The divine is the ultimate seer, it is witnessing. -- osho", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T06:51:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rob Fager", "comment_text": "Use me as a \u201cwe want birds\u201d button", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T06:51:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mike Kingdon", "comment_text": "Great video but interesting that it was sponsored by the Templeton Foundation.

When I say consciousness, I mean the subjective experience of being. It is like something to be you. It doesn&#39;t matter for this conversation what the experiences inside consciousness are, what matters is whether there exists a conscious space to facilitate experience in the first place. What&#39;s important is not what it&#39;s like to be something, but whether it is like anything to be that thing in the first place. The intro to this video led me to believe we are talking about the same thing here. If we&#39;re not, then my criticism is just that this video uses the word &quot;consciousness&quot; to describe cognition.<br><br>That human consciousness evolved from a simpler consciousness seems a reasonable claim which may well be true, but there is no way to substantiate it. We can&#39;t even prove that, say, a chimp is conscious, much less that a lizard is in some way less conscious than us. What would it mean to be less conscious? Consciousness may well be binary; either the lights are on or they aren&#39;t. What are often referred to as &quot;altered states of consciousness&quot; are really &quot;altered contents of consciousness&quot;. Maybe the world feels far away; maybe everything feels fuzzy and ill-defined; maybe things are clearer than they&#39;ve ever been before. In any case that I&#39;ve come across, the things that are altered are within consciousness. It still feels like something to be you. The lights are still on.<br><br>There is no way currently to show that any of the developments presented in this video necessitate an inner life-- that is, we could imagine a machine which exhibits these behaviors but does not have any subjective experience. A camera can see the world, but we generally attribute to it the same level of consciousness we attribute to a rock. A computer can build a model of a complex world, but I don&#39;t expect it to have any experience of the world of Skyrim. For that matter, I can&#39;t prove that you&#39;re not a philosophical zombie yourself. The only mind whose existence I can prove is my own.<br><br>I&#39;d like to reiterate that I really liked this video! I&#39;m only concerned about conflating consciousness and cognition. Maybe they work hand in hand, maybe they&#39;re exactly the same.

If computer programming isn&#39;t complicated enough, imagine a binary code of 64 different numbers instead of 2.

An electron is an electron wether its in a human brain or in a computer&#39;s motherboard. So I think, there is a tiny tiny sliver of conciousness in a computer, only thing is a computer cant think for Itself right? A.I. actually does. It thinks for itself. solves problems and gets better at what it does in ways the programmers cannot even identify. I think we&#39;ve taken a step with our constant revolution of technology, but its T-ball compared to DNA, imagine if an A.I. program is trying to identify what created it, would that make us their &quot;god&quot;?

I don&#39;t know exactly how it went, but for me, it seems like a chicken can&#39;t actually visualize that they will get more food and consciously (on some level) choose the future, but rather just learns from repetition and positive and negative feedback that they should wait if they want more food. The Narrator phrases it like the chicken is smart enough to choose within themselves that they should wait to receive a reward. I don&#39;t think that a chicken can &quot;hold back&quot; because they &quot;know&quot; they will receive more food by waiting. They&#39;re not visualizing the reward and making the intelligent decision to wait. It&#39;s not being patient or clever, it&#39;s just learned through conditioning that they will get more food. Surely the experiment points out how chickens are capable of being trained but to call it a step towards consciousness, I think, is quite the leap.<br><br>Sorry. I know this nit-picky and the point of an &quot;in the nutshell&quot; video isn&#39;t to overanalyze things; the jump in reasoning just bothered me.

In fact much of our ability to rationalize isn&#39;t really that helpful to finding food. Instead the ability to be aware that you are thinking is most likely a vital prerequite to social animals and yet working backwards we can see the most primitive animals like bees are social. We are more than probably over estimating how advanced cognitive abilities have to be in order to be social. While there is a general track for &quot;more food = more reproductive success&quot; its certainly not a linear line. If that were true then trees are far more successful than humans.

Instead of addressing the question of the origin of consciousness, it addresses the question of the origin of biological awareness. <br><br>To see how these are different, you could program into a computer a game in which there are creatures like the worm, the chicken and the other examples given here, which have the same behavior when you start the simulation, and yet, due to them being just something in a computer, they aren&#39;t actually conscious in any way. These illusory computer NPC creatures would have biological awareness, as they would be able to detect other NPC creatures, and construct plans for how to survive, but they would lack their own subjective point of view, the kind that we humans have, where we can actually feel and experience things.<br><br>You could argue that these computer models would actually have a subjective point of view of their own and that they are actually conscious like humans are, but as they are just a logical mechanism programmed into a computer, you&#39;d have to then prove why each of these logical mechanisms meets the requirements for having a subjective point of view, and so in the process you&#39;d have to have a set of criteria for which to check each mechanism against. Now I&#39;m not saying that this isn&#39;t possible, but this set of criteria is the core of the problem, it&#39;s not easy to come up with the set of criteria for which something must satisfy in order for it to be conscious. <br><br>We know human brains have something to do with a subjective point of view, the one we all have, but why is the physical human brain the right type of structure to connect to a conscious mind? Other parts of the body are also made of roughly the same ingredients, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, silicon, and yet they are not conscious, or are they? Could a rock satisfy the set of criteria to be conscious?

They melt with sufficient heat. They dissolve and evolve gas when heat and pressure conditions are right. They bond, fracture, crystalize, and undergo chemical change.  We very reasonably attribute these behaviors to physical laws, however, to claim minerals are unchanging and therefore devoid of conscienceness is false.  Perhaps the physical laws are the basis for a very simple and predictable consciousness. Perhaps consciousness is physical law and self-determination an emergent property of a sufficiently complex system. Perhaps rocks melt for the exact same reason that we flee from danger. What if atoms are radioactive for the same reason we have a favorite flavor of ice cream. What if the molecules of a freezing liquid huddle close together for the same reason we do when we get cold. What if the deterministic universe is just an illusion and everything is choice. What if the probabilities of quantum mechanics are no different than the probability you&#39;ll enjoy a movie or not. Of course from a scientific perspective that&#39;s all useless, unprovable at best, contrary to evidence at worst, but the next time you look out and you see a dead unthinking universe, a universe where there are no real meaningful consequences for the phenomena we observe, consider in fact that the opposite is true. consider that everything you see is important and that everything that happens really matters. it makes me very conscientious of the choices I make, of the behaviors I perform, and of the changes I make to the world. It also gives me some pleasure to imagine that those people I have loved and lost are not gone but rather have altered consciousness, have become diffuse and simplified.  They&#39;ve transformed and  become unrecognizable, but they&#39;re not remote and they&#39;re not inconsequential to my life. It gives me a great sense of wonder to imagine that this individual consciousness is a temporary property of a more fundamental, universal, and enduring phenomena. A phenomenon that supersedes our perceived divisions, our judgments of each other, and our physical separation in space-time. A phenomena that does not just unite humanity, or living things, but in fact everything that we can observe and perhaps things we cannot. And while there&#39;s little to be gained in wondering if Pluto feels cold or if comets are afraid to fall toward the sun, the benefits of considering the impact our decisions can have and our membership in an unending community of conscious entities is well worth our consideration. <br><br>Be well, call someone you love, and remember that you and everything you do, matters.<br><br>TL DR; What if rocks were alive!

All animals (including ourselves) have thoughts and feeling and in fact have the same emotions. <br><br>Anyone who has had a pet can do a simple demonstration. When your cat or dog come up to to be pet they are doing two things: 1. They are coming to you not your sofa, not the table, not anything else, they go to you. They have remembered that you pet them and when they want to be pet again they know to come to you. They are to distinguish between you and everything else. This demonstrates thought. 2. When your pet gets the pet they wanted they perform a response or pleasure, and when they get pet the wrong way they perform a response of discomfort. This demonstrates that they can feel. Using MRI scans we can see the areas of the brain light up where emotions are in the same areas of our brain when you account for size. The fact we can treat other animals that appear to show signs of mental illness using the same medication that we use to treat that mental illness shows they not just feel but also have emotions and the same ones. <br><br>Why can&#39;t we &quot;listen&quot; to what animals have to say when they communicate? Well, you can and you can&#39;t. All things communicate uses their senses, it what senses they use to communicate that can differ. When it comes to mammals the majority communicate using primarily visually and secondarily tactilely and tertiarily verbally. It is not to say that don&#39;t use their other senses to gather information, just they don&#39;t use those sense to express information. Perhaps you are thinking you have seen your dog sniff to gather information before. What they are doing if sniffing for pheromones, which humans do the same thing after shaking hands but this isn&#39;t the same thing as expressing information. It is not common to see a communication model not like the one mentioned previously in mammals but some mammals do, such as humans. Humans flip what most mammals do and communicate primarily verbally and secondarily visually and tactilely. <br><br>Your communication model is something \u00a0are born with and language is something you learn. Language is based on communication models, so all human languages you learn with primarily involve verbal components. Usually we don&#39;t involve visual communication in our language but rather use the same visual communication across our species and call this body language (which is a poor term as it isn&#39;t a language). There are some visual languages (such a sign language) but all of those languages are based upon the use of verbal language and directly translating that into hand singles or otherwise to express thought in the same way you do verbal language. Because some visual languages exist, we can and have taught other animals how to &quot;speak&quot; our visual languages, such as Koko the gorilla. We have a hard time learning other species visual languages because unlike ours they don&#39;t base their visual languages in a verbal like way. <br><br>Can other species that share the same communication models communicate with one another. Yes, but not completely. While latin isn&#39;t a communication model but rather a language we can latin demonstrate a point. There are languages called romance languages with are based upon latin: spanish, french, portuguese, italian, romanian, etc. While all of the romance languages are different languages, because they are based on the same language they can use those different languages to express thought amongst themselves without having to know the other language but have difficulty expressing increasing complex ideas. Different species that share the same communication model have developed their own languages based on the same model and can express ideas amongst each other but the more complex the idea the harder it is to express it. Just like we can express ideas in english to someone who only understands japanese by using on simple level, but when we share the same language we express even more complex ideas.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T01:49:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BlueField08", "comment_text": "#2 On Trending!

But those are probably what most people mean by consciousness. I don&#39;t see how qualia/cp/ce is necessary for all the things you describe in this video, as it seems unclear if and how these conscious percepts interact with the neural processing. Wouldn&#39;t the same neural processes lead to the same behavior if there was &quot;nobody home&quot; (i.e., in a zombie)? If so, is conscieous experience / qualia maybe a necessary byproduct of very complex information processing, and an inherent property of the universe? I know it&#39;s tempting to avoid these questions because nobody really has an answer for them, but what you describe seems to sidestep all of these questions by just describing ever more complex cognitive processes.

Which is why no ape has ever asked a question. And in the Sally-Anne test, we see that until about the age of 4, a child doesn&#39;t develop this ToM (&#39;Theory of Mind&#39;). Since apes are the closest species to humans, it seems intuitive to think that humans are the only remaining species that ask questions, i.e. that have the sense of ToM. Now, in this video, we see that Western Scrub Jays are aware that others experience the world from different perspectives, that&#39;s why they rehide their foods.

The fact is, you don&#39;t NEED consciousness in order to be a self-replicating biomechanical robot that eats, sleeps, mates and defends itself. So what is consciousness FOR? Why do YOU even exist in the first place? Well, I think the answer is surprisingly simple: it is because consciousness is neither created nor destroyed, it is simply moving through different temporary physical experiences based on the evolution through different bodies. This temporary experience of &quot;I am a white male&quot; or &quot;I am an Indian&quot; or &quot;I am a dog&quot; is not actually the true state of consciousness. There simply MUST be a metaphysical breakthrough in the philosophical understanding and depth of wisdom for anyone who wants to truly get at the truth of this topic. The existence of consciousness as eternal spirit soul, beyond the temporary bodily identification, must be considered with more than just a dogmatic refusal on the part of cynical materialists. Superficial mental speculation and empirical testing is SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. If you want to understand what is beyond the senses and the mind, then you&#39;re going to have to control and purify your senses and your mind. This is logical. This science of consciousness is described in books which are thousands of years old, written in the world&#39;s most ancient language, Sanskrit. If you&#39;re serious about asking such questions, and finding good answers, then Read Bhagavad Gita! Read the Vedanta! Read the Srimad Bhagavatam, which is the commentary on Vedanta!

As shown, the evolutionary environment selects the organisms that are capable of surviving (by finding food, etc.) just long enough to continue replication/reproducing, and these organism are not neccesarily the ones capable of best perceiving the correct, fundamental objective truth of physical reality. Furthermore, it is a very niche cognitive skillset, adaptable to only a thin slither of possible physical environments. This focus should therefore serve also to highlight the fallibility of the human mind and the possible limitations of scientific inquiry.

You make it sound like we&#39;re arguing that they have thoughts and feelings. That is not and has never been our argument. Our idea is that they have a primitive level of consciousness that is below even that of a bacterium. There is a phenomenology to it, but it&#39;s very simple. There is a &quot;what it&#39;s likeness&quot; to being a rock and to experiencing the forces a rock can experience. But this state of consciousness is so low that it  is not recognizable to complex creatures such as ourselves as having any phenomenology at all. As you create more complicated systems with more possible phenomoneological states, you get more complicated forms of consciousness. Ours happen to be the most complicated form that we know of. <br><br>The idea of panpsychism is that ALL things have phenomenology, but that our particular variety of phenomenology is an emergent sort created by all of these lower order types of expereince. A good analogy I like to use is the analogy of a piece of metal vs the atoms that make up that piece of metal. Both the piece of metal and the atoms that make it up can have different physical states, but the physical state of the piece of metal can affect the state of the atoms within and vice versa, and there are some states that only the piece of metal can experience which the individual atoms cannot. If I take the piece of metal and put it into the fire, the atoms within the metal do not experience heat. They experience an increase in kinetic energy. If I were describing the physical state of the atoms before and after the fire, I would simply say that their kinetic energy had been significantly increased. But what would i say of the metal? I would say that it is now in a state of being heated. If it is hot enough, I would say that it is glowing and giving off heat. I might even be able to say the metal is experiencing a state of being melted. or in the most extreme of cases, vaporized. But I would not be able to say this of the individual atoms, because they cannot experience heat or glowing, melting or vaporizing. They can only experience this increase in kinetic energy. That&#39;s it.<br><br>Humans are the same way. We, our minds, can experience a crazy amount of different things, from emotions to complex thoughts, to any number of physical sensations. But our cells do not. Our cells expereience only electro-chemical reactions. It is their interactions with each other that create our consciousness. Likewise, the molecules that make up the cells have experience too, but they only experience electromagnetic bonding and states of kinetic energy.

I&#39;d further argue that it&#39;s not something we directly evolved, but a amalgamation of many behavioral patterns which in humans have become so complex that we are as conscious as we are, maybe just in different way, since their behaviour might also be different, but just as complex. (For example, dolphins behave differently from humans and live in totally different enviroments, but judging from their intelligent behaviour I&#39;d infer that they are similarly conscious to us humans, just not in the completly same way.) <br>A similar thing can be said about creativity. <br>Therefore, other animals with a comparibale complexe behavior are also comparitably conscious. The more or less complex, the more or less conscious. And therefore artificial intelligences just need to reach a certain level of complexity to be obviously conscious. This would also suggest that other beings, whether they be biological or artifical, can also surpass humans in consiousness if they also surpass us in complexity. Perhaps even humans can augment themselves to be more complex and due to achieve a higher level of conciousness.<br>If we come back to the point of &quot;different conciousnesses&quot;, maybe people of different talents and tendencies could also be describing to have different kinds of conciousness. For example, a more empathetic person is more complex in that regard and their brain might be more active in the area associated with empathy, so their consciousness, if we could visualize or describe it, would be different from a person who is less empathetic but who has a eidetic memory and whose brain is therefore more active and complex in the region associated with memory.<br>Though this is all conjecture and theory of course. :)", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T21:21:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pomi the gamer", "comment_text": "Where are the birds?!", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T21:21:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Waffles", "comment_text": "I absolutely love these videos, the animation style and voice really reminds me of the hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy and that&#39;s one of my favorite movies", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T21:21:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gheorghe Georgescu", "comment_text": "I think I understand the meaning of life<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>We are SUPER AIs ---&gt; FOOD", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T21:21:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seanus32", "comment_text": "So basically consciousness is inextricably linked to food?

It describes what is stated only (memory, behavoiurs, instinct, pre-cognition by mixing those), aaand thats it. NOTHING to do with consciousness at all.<br>Consciousness happens in the unknown. This is usually when perception and memory missmatch.<br>When there is no information about something thats happening so the brain cannot put it into memory. In this case it shits itself and start making up random crap. Durring this time conciousness happens. The very act of attempting to understand something without information is concisousness at work.<br>When it happens to gather sufficent information about the unknown it sort of dissapears tho.<br>In theory someone who knows everything and perfectly planed his life will lose conciousness and just lives like a drone following a layed out plan.<br>Actually some ppl who have mental dissorders can become this state. When they either fail to percive unknown things or focused on some known stuff so much they lose consciousness.<br><br>Sadlly by just interacting with such person causes him to percive uknown factors that yourself present with the interaction you will most likelly always find a certain level of consciousness in everyone at all times.<br><br>Only animals that lack the brain capacity to percive something as unknown and rather quickly formulate theire new experiences as something known instead of differentiate and think that its little bit different this time. RThats why most animals are like simple robots that does a specific respons to most new events and dont act differently. (talking about insects and stuff)<br><br>So yeah, the more we dont know the more consciousness we have, so when you learn make sure to always keep something fresh or you suddenly become a zombie that just do some things and thats it. <br>Thats why its good to have friends and open world connection to keep youre consciousness alive with new stuff to unreveal.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T21:15:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Spiffing Simmo", "comment_text": "Incredible 3d animation", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T21:15:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Mitchell", "comment_text": "sorry i was unconscious", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T21:15:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Asa Goldstein", "comment_text": "For anything to exist, everything must exist, including all forms of consciousness or nonconsciousness simultaneously.

Questions such as: Why are there many instances (or even one instance) of someone recalling their own operation, while brain dead? Why are there more than one thousand documented instances of children recalling past lives (Source: University of Virginia)? Why does the number of possible memories and imaginations in one life, exceed the number of brain cells and neurons? Could consciousness be metaphysical and survive body death? If consciousness is metaphysical, could it be uploaded into a robot and make interstellar travel possible? Could it make immortality possible? Eventhough I am heavily implying a metaphysical answer to those questions, I don&#39;t pretend to know the answer. But my only real question is: Why is scientific methodology not applied to the above questions? Is the risk of being ridiculed and bullied by ones peers to high?

And this inteligence is in essence pretty much different from that inteligence we\u2019ve got to remember our memories, the inteligence of making coherent sentences, the inteligence of planning and so on. If we think far enough (and there\u2019s no need to get too philosophical), most people can understand that they\u2019re not their thoughts, legs\u2019 motions nor their memories, but that \u201cthing\u201d previous to all those which makes us just so concious that we can have insights. It is nothing less than counciousness, in its pure form. Everything in the universe is energy, so is conciousness, I think that\u2019s a big step to know what it is...but since it is more like an abstract matter that is above our cognitivity made up from senses, I would say  our limiting words make it pretty hard to explain.

However, correlation doesn&#39;t mean causation.<br><br>Consciousness really doesn&#39;t need complexity, although I understand the instinct to believe so. Consciousness is very simple as a concept. Is merely the subjective awareness on oneself. It doesn&#39;t need the input of the outside world given by senses. These senses, when they exist, just enhance the subjective inner world of a conscious being but they are not part of consciousness.<br><br>Imagine a computer running DOS on standby doing nothing. And image another running world of Warcraft. Both computers are running but the one running WOW has an enhanced &quot;experience&quot;. Same goes with someone conscious only of himself, of his own mind or someone aware of the world around him given by its senses.<br><br>The world as perceived by the senses and interpreted by the brain is not Consciousness. It is a movie we all watch inside our heads. The subjective awareness or feeling of the observed IS consciousness.<br><br>Because if we take your interpretation for granted we have to seriously consider the possibility that my cleaning robot vacuum the house is conscious of himself. He exhibits behaviour, seeks litter, has sensors that make him &quot;aware&quot; of the world around it and has a purpose in life, which is vaccum the floor...<br><br>But is the robot really conscious?! I don&#39;t think so but then again, I may be wrong and you may be right...<br><br>I don&#39;t think there is such a thing as &quot;free will&quot;. Hence I believe the behaviour of both computers and people follow mathematical and mechanistic rules. They aren&#39;t directly related to consciousness.

It is also difficult to identify the source of the property because most science is reductionist and cuts up observed sample to a size that doesn&#39;t have the property.

However, there is a great deal of evidence and we can use it to make some &quot;best explanations to date based on observations&quot; (such as there has been no evidence of a life force or spirit, so non-physiological explanations are not the best explanations to date - find a measurable spirit/soul energy organ and then the best explanation will change... but not before).", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T19:24:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shayan Aamir", "comment_text": "Origin of the &quot;PLUMBUS&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T19:24:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "muumin78", "comment_text": "lubi\u0119 to", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T19:24:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Lee", "comment_text": "Interesting video, but it is somewhat unintentionally misleading to insinuate that most of the organisms mentioned in this video have conscious awareness. <br><br><br>We don&#39;t know if Western Scrub Jays, for example, are truly &quot;aware&quot; that there are other organisms just like them that have their own perception of the world.

He shrouded things in sort of bullshit mystical-sounding vagueties, but I thought about it and I think it makes sense, though it&#39;s not related to whole objects like rocks. It&#39;s more that the rock, the air around it, our dead skin cells, and pretty much everything is alive with microcosms of conscious activity. But hear me out. It&#39;s not that they perceive anything at all, certainly not to any metacognitive extent. It&#39;s that they contain the same parts as conscious beings. So say we define consciousness along a spectrum with quantized values. Humans are 1.00 unit of consciousness. The bosonic matter making up the universe (maybe even other fundamental particles) on their own would be like... 1x10^-10000000000000 units of consciousness each. Where the guy lost me is where he sort of almost implied that these microcosms of consciousness would explain macroscopic consciousness, which has obvious flaws, like that if that were the case, extremely massive consciousnesses would arise out of things that are made up of a bunch of particles. Like if you just have one thing that is solidly comprised of 1x10^10000000000000 of those 1x10^-10000000000000 conscious unit masses then what he said to me doesn&#39;t account for that that would essentially make a human. Anything as large as a human could be as conscious as one.<br><br><br>Obviously, consciousness is an emergent property of different organic systems. (organic in the sense that there are specialized organs, I&#39;m not discounting conscious AI) But here&#39;s where I justify it. As far as we know, our brains are full of systems that interpret electrical signals. Bosonic matter reacting chemically in response to electrical stimuli and rearranging things and storing things kind of like a computer. So if you stripped the brain down to one bit--on or off--that would still be one fragment of a brain. One fragment of consciousness. The universe is buzzing with electrical impulses bumping bosonic matter around. Is the consciousness the flow of electrons, or the interactions with bosonic matter? Does it really matter what kind of particle they are, a la string theory? Does interaction with anything at all comprise one fragment of consciousness, as it has the potential to be interpreted by a hypothetical organic system from which a consciousness could arise? I think it makes sense. You could say that one single bit is a fragment of a computer, in fact I think it would be disingenuous to claim otherwise, as a computer is just an emergent property of an organic system that interprets information, and it doesn&#39;t need to be whether an electrical bit is on or off, but could be extended to qbits or even levers and punch cards. The universe is full of single bits, is what I&#39;m saying. Every unchecked wild interaction that comprises literally everything is one fragment of consciousness. There&#39;s nothing to process that consciousness, but it is an &quot;experience&quot; awaiting interpretation from a system. So a lightning strike is like a torrent of bits that hasn&#39;t been interpreted by anything. Everything is a signal, and signals are what comprise consciousnesses.<br><br><br>The rock isn&#39;t conscious at all to the standards humans use, but the universe doesn&#39;t have to behave according to human intuition. The fact that it is comprised of information means that it is interpreting the information around it. It&#39;s dark, it feels nothing, it doesn&#39;t know what darkness or nothing is, and yet it perceives <b>something</b> with each change in state, reacting accordingly, and if you arrange enough of those interactions in a fancy enough way they become instincts and eventually thoughts. With infinite lightning strikes you&#39;d eventually get a stream of data that is identical to a person thinking about what to have for breakfast, but on the way there you&#39;d have near-infinitely many permutations of someone thinking about what to have for breakfast and a gradient of complexity leading up to that. So though I ascribe to a strictly materialistic non-metaphysical philosophy, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s incompatible with panpsychicism, or whatever thing I just described is.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T19:05:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diego Designs", "comment_text": "Oof", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T19:04:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DaviloX07 _", "comment_text": "Ye I liked the video:)", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T19:04:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pessa", "comment_text": "Amazing job!

While there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, I think it implicitly drags in assumptions about the computational model of consciousness that don&#39;t get critically examined enough. Nowadays people are obsessed with computers (and AI) because, after all, they are the most important and revolutionary new force in our world, but that can sometimes bleed over into how we think about the mind and consciousness. I think this way of thinking is pernicious. We can&#39;t seriously answer the question of whether computers are conscious if our starting point is a theory of consciousness inspired by computers. <br>2.) I can&#39;t really be mad at panpsychism being dismissed (even though I have a soft spot for it), but I don&#39;t think bringing in behavior is a good argument to pull. A brain in a vat may be conscious but not show obvious behaviors to clue us in to that. You can have a complete description of something&#39;s behavior (say, my stomach rumbling, neurons firing, my feet moving my body to the fridge) without saying whether or not it is conscious (what thoughts I had, how hunger feels qualitatively). Behaviorism is nice because it lends itself to scientific analysis, but it&#39;s under a lot of fire from philosophers. <br>3.) It looks to me like there&#39;s some blurring between consciousness and intelligence: are delayed gratification and theory of mind really questions of consciousness? I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m really forward to the next videos because it sounds like they&#39;ll clear up their stance on that. <br>4.) Relatedly, in the example of theory of mind we may be (ironically) projecting that conscious ability to imagine others&#39; perspectives onto animals. One animal may see another and feel generally unnerved and want to move its food without thinking about the other animal&#39;s desires or imagining what it is like to be that other animal.

Rather, it needs relational thought and reasoning. We used to think relational reasoning  was a purely human phenomenon since every non-human animal couldn&#39;t do it (relational match to sample task can&#39;t be solved in general by non-human primates). However, recent studies into certain corvid sub-species seem to suggest they have relational capacity which opens a whole new avenue for study since if they actually do, it would be a case of convergent evolution between us and them given that our common ancestor certainly didn&#39;t have any relational reasoning capabilities. Either way, relational reasoning seems to be a non-continuous process (you can&#39;t get half-way to relational reasoning, it&#39;s an all or nothing deal) which makes explaining why we have it by typical evolutionary models of trait development a little tricky. As far as I know there are a few papers suggesting that it took a large enough pre-frontal cortex for it to just start happening, and the incrementally larger pre-frontal cortex allowed for more evolutionary fitness which would explain it nicely.

This video focuses on a lot of the so-called &quot;easy problems&quot; (why organisms react to stimuli, control their behavior, and have memory), which is fine, but it leaves out a large part of the equation. Why is there a subjective experience to life at all? How do we know that there is something it is like to be a chicken but there isn&#39;t anything it is like to be trichoplax adhaerens? Why do physical processes give rise to an inner life in organisms, and how complex do physical processes need to be to form an inner life?<br><br>Hopefully this idea is being saved for a future video, but it may be too abstract for this channel. I think any conversation about the origins of consciousness should at least mention the hard problem, since it&#39;s such a huge part of the current philosophy.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T17:05:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EpicJoeR", "comment_text": "cool 1st person view", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T17:04:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alex watson", "comment_text": "I&#39;d love for kurzgesagt to write a book", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T17:04:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saycrain", "comment_text": "I realy like the new stile you guys have \ud83d\ude04", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T17:04:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "davy nolan", "comment_text": "It doesn&#39;t exist, we are mere machines...

My p.o.v if I may is that, both intuitively and more in depth, to attribute consciousness to purely random stochastic statistical processes both in the macro and the micro is far from satisfying both intellectually and scientifically. Things can be stochastic and statistical (i.e. random), necessary (not in the metaphyisical sense but in the scientific sense of deriving necessarily from previous states of affairs) or designed (yep, that option does exist). As for consciousness, we see a clear intelligible logic behind it (duh) which brings it into being, and not a purely stochastic process. There is a process that systematically brings out consciousness (nowadays via reproduction for ex.). As for necessity or design, even if we presuppose that consciousness necessitates from the laws of physics, these are far from being necessary and could have been different, even in a multiverse scenario. Hence, for me design is what makes most sense. Can&#39;t wait for the next videos.

Atoms combine, re-combine to survive (probably), when they combine in a certain way, they don&#39;t need food to survive, but when in a different way, they do and hence consciousness emerges. I also think there is an element of the time dimension here, a rock when not moved still weathers, which is ageing in terms of biological forms, that means the rock did move in the dimension just very very slowly.

Of course it&#39;s hard to expect complex explanations to be given in 10 minutes of video, but you unfortunately lacked to touch the most crucial part of it, which are qualia. Many people also seem to have hard time getting that concept, even though - I believe - they all experience them. Qualia are the qualitative features of all our experiences - the redness of red, the pain in the pain, in other words, something that makes experience &quot;like something&quot;, rather than just a blank and dry piece of information. Your description would rather fit a video called &quot;How our motor and cognitive systems might have evolved&quot;, than the subject of concsiousness. You were somewhere near the topic when you mentioned panpsychism, not that I believe it&#39;s true, but at least it&#39;s on the subject and a valid point in discussing this phenomena. Having even very accurate and adaptive sensory and analytic capabilities is something that is in no way enough to talk about consciousness - think about our smarphones and apps in them that can, say, recognize your face. Does the telephone actually see you? Some would argue that surely this is not impossible, but we surely can imagine that it does not, which makes it an uncosciuous automaton. So, gathering information and reacting to them in an adaptive manner DOES NOT equal consciousness and is entirely off topic. It could be used as an explanation of evolutionary processes that led to emergence of consciousness, but in fact they are basically  different topics and certainly are not the essence of the question here.<br><br>For all of you intrigued by this subject I strogly recommend reading books by Daniel Dennett, David Chalmers or John Searle.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:02:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "absence", "comment_text": "Hi (sorry for bad English)", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:02:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nikolai \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0448\u0435\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439", "comment_text": "Curiosity is the lust of the mind.<br><br>-- Thomas Hobbes", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:02:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BeeP Official", "comment_text": "At the beginning i felt your voice is kinda weird<br>Like you&#39;re a bit tipsy or something<br><br>But it gets off after focusing on the topic<br><br>I hope you&#39;re alright", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:02:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MaSneb", "comment_text": "No bird!?", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:02:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jake Pham", "comment_text": "How Unaware Things Became Aware<br>Like coffee break ?", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:02:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JagAgemo", "comment_text": "Heavy questions.<br>I&#39;m excited to see you tackling them.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:01:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DrSnegg", "comment_text": "I identify as a Trichoplax adhaerens.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:01:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aa Aa", "comment_text": "Awfully lacking in terms of birds in this video.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:01:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eskay", "comment_text": "Mitty...", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:01:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WooperBestPokemon", "comment_text": "More science, less weird video.

Sometimes, we respond without brain action at all, like non-autonomous neural response (e.g. knee-jerk reaction, response to fire).

When a soul is destroyed, the consciousness is free and floats about the Omniverse. Consciousness can\u2019t be destroyed because it is pure energy. Now is this science fact or do I have proof this is true? No. But it\u2019s a little theory/belief/cooping mechanism for my fear of death.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T15:55:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stamires", "comment_text": "i am a rock and i can prove we have inner life", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T15:55:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ReDSauCe", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8&amp;t=0m49s\">0:49</a> congrats, you found the meaning, the search can stop.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T15:55:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "King D-Mind", "comment_text": "AAAH, KILL IT!<br>KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T15:55:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vladimir Slaykovskiy", "comment_text": "Bla-bla-bla.

But it deals with a mechanistic view of consciousness.<br>Experience, or consciousness, does not seem to be an evolutionary asset, and that&#39;s a big problem, that explanations like this inevitably walk around. Our brains COULD evolve to produce EXACTLY the same responses to external stimuli through electrochemical processes, without the conscious part of us. <br><br>And this explanation doesn&#39;t really tell us why consciousness lies in the specific cognitive areas that it does, and not in the millions of other unconscious processes of the brain, which seem to be the same in physical nature (both are neural electrochemical signals). <br>To understand this point here&#39;s an example. Just take conscious and unconscious, and flip them around. Seeking food could be an unconscious process, and metabolizing it, could be a conscious one. Why are we conscious of some of our behavioral traits rather than all?<br><br>And then there&#39;s another problem, why does our consciousness have the nature that it has? An easy way to wrap your head around this would be to ask a question like this. Why is red red? It could be blue. Our consciousness only needs to be internally consistent most of the time. If someone took the experience of blue and replaced it with that of red, in evolution there would be no difference in behavior. We would recognise that blood is blue, just call it red, and that the sky is red and just call it blue. Consciousness cannot be fully explained just in the context of serving us biologically, because it doesn&#39;t do that. It seems to be an emergent property of our brains function, but nevertheless, different in nature. This whole situation has vast implications on free will, philosophy of mind, the nature of existence etc.<br><br>Entertain the idea of a metaphysical view of consciousness, in a way that wouldn&#39;t fit in the physicality of the mechanistic point of view because it simply doesn&#39;t seem to fully belong there.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T15:37:58Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "Arnav Waghmare", "comment_text": "Haha imagine being a worm and having a dickface", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T15:37:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Divine Eagle", "comment_text": "What if the consciousness we experience is just a simple form of what is yet to come?", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T15:37:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alon ", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t understand why there must be have still hungry children&#39;s , what are getting erected while you whatch and know how some younger like to eat and sit here and listen lot f the political bulshit , and travel in their dream with the big ship ...

Our experiences are the information, so is our knowing. We devour the information just like the black holes do. Universe wants to become fully aware of itself and we are the tool for it. Definition of life is quite wrong because alive means able to react. This means everything is alive. We are breathing the air but atoms breathe quanta of energy. They have to do that so they don&#39;t loose the electrons or they don&#39;t fall on the nuclei. When electrons speed up too much atom emits quanta of energy in EM spectrum and when they slow down too much atom acquires quanta of energy, and so on and on. We do the exact same thing while breathing. We are also way more important for the universe than we can imagine. Problem is we don&#39;t know what we are. We also don&#39;t know what are those things before our eyes, that we call reality. We observe, name unknowns, observe some more of the interactions of the named unknowns and we call it science. What is the real and absolutely objective meaning of things is out of our reach. The sooner we realize we are the part of the bigger entity, the sooner we discover what is our real meaning and purpose. Nature tend to remove things that have no use and we still tend to talk about  such things, like myself now, so we could suspect that somehow the universe finds some use for it. Our desire for knowing is certainly connected to the black holes itself and to the negative polarity since those are the sources of the attraction and our always knowledge or information hungry minds are the reflection. Just like the particles we repulse, attract or we&#39;re undetermined because those are the only kinds of interactions and polarities we find in the universe. I can love, hate or I can be neutral, so the most of the matter able to polarize. We think we create things but we certainly can&#39;t create anything that is not already in the universe&#39;s bank of information. It is more like the universe itself uses us as it&#39;s medium to express itself. We have created physics, but in reality we have only discovered something that was already there. It&#39;s like with the negative numbers and the antimatter. The moment we have discovered such numbers we looked at the antimatter and the annihilation without even knowing that it&#39;s there. But if it wasn&#39;t there, we would never came up with the idea of the negative numbers and things like -1+1=0...<br>God bless", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T15:22:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dario Abu Shibika", "comment_text": "I think Robert M.

He even goes as far as describing consciousness as parasitic, referring to an experiment that showed conscious decision-making to lead to worse results than unconscious decision-making. When asked on an internet forum about how he came up with this punchline he responded that he tried thinking of a reason for why an intelligent agent would need consciousness and failed to come up with a satisfying answer.\r<br>\r<br>As he stated at the Popular Science Forum Ratio 2017, the problem with discussing consciousness to begin with is, that natural sciences do not provide a mechanism for how changes in electric charges should result in subjective experience. We all assume to share this form of subjective experience but have no objective way of confirming this assumption.\r<br>\r<br>Consciousness does not mean self-awareness, but subjective experience. Self-awareness refers more to an organism&#39;s understanding of the self in the social and environmental context. Subjective experience on the other hand does not require an organism to have a understanding of the self, but simply describes that \u201csomething feels something\u201d. I believe that the two get confused easily, because (especially social) self-awareness is a state that dominates human consciousness.\r<br>\r<br>Intuitively, one might expect consciousness to be related to intelligence, since solving complex problems usually requires conscious focus (intentional attention). However, as mentioned above, evidence might point to the contrary: Not only do we tackle complex problems without consciously computing all parts of the problem. But more surprisingly, in his work on the deliberation-without-attention effect Dijksterhuis uncovers that unconscious decision-making can even lead to to objectively superior choices than conscious decision-making.\r<br>There are various theories on how consciousness arises. Some think it is resulting from the mysterious workings of quantum mechanics, mostly because both, consciousness and quantum mechanics seem to be confusing. Some argue that natural sciences as we know them will have to be altered to be able to explain consciousness.\r<br>A theory more grounded in the biology of cognition is that consciousness emerges from the integration of various motor commands into action. An example for this could be a person jumping out of a plane with a parachute. Humans naturally refrain from falling from great heights, a tendency we all witness when looking down a with steep cliff. The sky-diver has to integrate the repelling effect of altitude and the wish to jump to actually act, resulting in the conscious experience when going through the process of decision-making.\r<br>\r<br>If consciousness has not evolved as adaptive trait but it is simply a natural phenomena that it feels like something to be a complex system, this might have far reaching implications on how we formulate our ethics, not just in regard to how we treat other animals or even plants, but also for the future of artificial intelligent networks.\r (wrote this for Uni a few month ago)", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T15:06:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "managMent", "comment_text": "But, what is the difference between a simple organisms decisions and the &quot;concious&quot; decisions you present?

I usually love Kurzgesagt&#39;s videos, but this one did not even address the question it poses in its title, or in the beginning of the video. Instead of explaining the schools of thought around the existence of consciousness, they spend the entire video explaining the content of consciousness and how this content has become more complicated over time. The question of consciousness, though integrally connected to its content, is not the same question as where the content of consciousness came from.<br><br>Not only did the writers completely disregard the original premise in this episode, they took a decidedly modern and Western view of the entire question of consciousness. They posed the universe as a dead and inannimate place where somehow something (consciousness) arose out of nothing. <br><br>This argument is nonsensical in that nothing can arise from nothing. Everything is given rise to by previous causes and conditions. Thus, even if the contents of consciousness can become more complex over time based on the evolution of mind, the existence itself of consciousness (what the video claims to address, but does not) remains untouched.<br><br>A legitimate theory to explain the existence of consciousness is panpsychism, but the authors choose to subtly discredit this school of thought by representing it with a hokey animation of a being floating in space with a magical glowing rock. They also discredit it by throwing it away on the shakey ground that we have no evidence for the existence of the inner world of something like a rock/mineral. Reality check: you have no real evidence for the existence of an inner world other than your own. Period. The existence or nonexistence of others is a belief structure, and the only consciousness you can prove for certain is your own. The author&#39;s argument for the discrediting of panpsychism is the exact argument you could use to discredit the very existence of all other conscious beings. In addition, disproving the inner life of objects like minerals, but edifying your own inner life makes no sense - you are nothing other than a complicated arrangement of mineral and water.<br><br>Finally, I want to add that this video completely disregards Eastern schools of thought on this matter - rigorous and logically based systems of thought which have been developed for thousands of years compared to the West&#39;s several hundred. This video presents a very lopsided view of the human exploration into our own nature. It takes one of the greatest mysteries we face and, instead of sharing and opening to the mystery, collapses it into a mechanical, evolutionary process in a dead/unintelligent universe.<br><br>If this is a topic you are interested in, do not stop with this video.

Or you could just be a real freak of nature that you have an inner world, and everyone else is a \u2018philosophical zombie\u2019 (a person who acts exactly like someone with an inner world, but lacks one; imagine a very intelligent computer that can pass a Turing test, but is not conscious).", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T14:59:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UltiMaxKom", "comment_text": "Little did us know, but we&#39;re actually a particular rock&#39;s descendant...", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T14:59:15Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Arahant", "comment_text": "I&#39;m disappointed in this video&#39;s lack of philosophical depth. There is no mention at all of the very profound &quot;hard problem of consciousness,&quot; which is the question of how it is that physical causes can translate to inner subjective experience at all--or, as the subtitle states, &quot;how unaware things become aware.&quot;  Kurzgesagt starts off with the philosophical assumption that consciousness is a byproduct of material complexity (nervous systems). Yet, there is contention in philosophy about whether this is a proper categorization. A strong case can be made, for example, for idealism, the point of view that consciousness is actually the only true substance of reality--that it is fundamental and irreducible (see &quot;Why Materialism is Baloney,&quot; by Bernardo Kastrup). Max Planck, the founder of quantum theory, said, &quot;I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness.&quot; The point is, there is so much more to the mystery of consciousness than its apparent survival utility. It is a central consideration in metaphysics, and in my opinion its ontological status is the deepest rational inquiry possible, yet this video does not give due appreciation to the true depth of the problem--instead opting to start with a metaphysical presupposition without explaining or defending it. I&#39;m disappointed only because the kinds of things I mention here are actually more captivating than the mere evolutionary path of conscious complexity, and if visited in typical Kurzgesagt style, would have, I think, made for a more interesting video.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T14:59:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean Miller", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sort of disappointed that Kurzgesagt would accept money from Templeton, since its way of thinking doesn&#39;t deserve promotion on a science channel.

Think of a see-saw, you push one end down and the other end comes up - this is the simplest form of a reaction engine, 1 input gives you exactly 1 output.<br><br><br>This is likely how the earliest forms of life worked, with a simple one input and one output (eg. hungry &gt; eat). Over time, life would have evolved to take more than one input and produce a <b>corresponding</b> output - it&#39;s still a 1-to-1 mapping but there&#39;s just more of it (eg. hungry &gt; eat; dark &gt; hunt; bright &gt; hide). Then the next stage would be to combine inputs and/or outputs. This would be the most basic version of consciousness but it&#39;s still very obviously deterministic (eg. hungry + dark &gt; hunt; hungry + bright &gt; wait).<br><br><br>The secret sauce comes with the ability to take an actual sensory input and combine it with a self-generated input from memory and then produce a new output - an output that may have been different had there been only sensory input. Now we have something special - though it&#39;s still a simple input-produces-output situation, we have an invisible input coming from stored knowledge, and there can be a great deal of variance here. Then as the output is initiated - we also observe the effectiveness of the output and record that into memory also, so the next time this situation arises again, the invisible input from memory gets even more unique.<br><br><br>The whole thing is still deterministic but over time you are able to combine simple sensory inputs with such a mind-blowing amount of varied stored knowledge input that the output always seems like a conscious choice that&#39;s special every time we encounter a similar situation. Ultimately though I believe that we are still very deterministic - it&#39;s just that our lifetime of memories experiences are so vast, some of which we aren&#39;t even aware of that we know that it seems like we&#39;re actually making a choice and that we could have gone either way, but I think that it&#39;s an illusion - because the choice is already determined based on the person&#39;s collected knowledge of the universe surrounding them and the sensory input they are getting at that time, but the deterministic nature of it is too complex because there&#39;s too many variables that leads to the choice that we think it&#39;s special.<br><br><br>Going back to the see-saw analogy, now the see-saw has evolved from a single see-saw to billions of interconnected see-saws that take thousands of inputs and produce an output that seems special - but it&#39;s not, because the output is still decided by the combination of inputs and how the see-saws are interconnected.

As women in a primitive setting were mostly powerless to defend themselves against dangerous predators and were responsible for nurturing and defending their young, all they could do is look on in terror hoping that the warriors could fend off the threat. While this is going on, the fear and anxiety is stimulating their prefrontal cortex causing it to grow, and bigger prefrontal cortex obviously would&#39;ve been something naturally selected for. This happened so much over time that we started to realize that predators weren&#39;t something that either did or didn&#39;t exist, but rather that a predator is something that can happen now OR in the future. By realizing that threats were something that could happen in the future, we simultaneously grasped the concept of the future, and what our consciousness is heavily based on is the place that we are at the time that we&#39;re there.

It starts with parmenides. You see, parmenides was basically the first determinist, he said that there was no real movement, that all that has happened and all that will happen exists as an unmoving whole, and that our perception of time and even the idea of the moment is just an illusion. And in fact, his theory is very close to the idea of Brane theory, and even though it doesn&#39;t get the WHOLE picture, it sets up an interesting paradox.<br>You see, in string theory, there are the 3 dimensions we are familiar with, as well as 3 extra dimensions of both hyperspace and subspace folded up in a tangled structure called the calabi-yao manifold, and also 2 more dimensions we only see a slice of: time, and supertime (aka parallel worlds). But if time itself is a dimension just like X, Y, and Z, doesn&#39;t that mean that what we consider to be motion along those dimensions, is actually just stillness in another dimension? How do we reconcile motion with the idea of determinism?<br>And yet, if we look further, we can see that the universe is NOT actually deterministic. We know that chaos theory makes it harder and harder to predict the motion of things over long periods of time due to convolution caused by micro changes within that system that have a ripple effect, which is why we can&#39;t predict the weather for more than a week in advance. We also know that at THE smallest level, the subatomic level, heisenbergs uncertainty principle applies, and we can&#39;t measure the speed of a particle and its position at the same time. And we also know that the phenomenon of consciousness, whatever it is, collapses the wave function and turns a superpostion of probability waves, into a singular reality due to creator / observer theory. And finally, <br><br><br>So, with this in mind, we can say that uncertainty, chaos, superposition and consciousness are all intertwined. We also know that entropy causes time to move forward rather than backwards, but we have no idea why consciousness as a phenomenon is entropic, being that it relates to the subatomic realm where such kinds of particles can even exist in multiple places or times. I would say that consciousness IS a form of extradimensional chaos. Imagine that our universe was a 2 dimensional and from that circle stemmed a large tree and every timeline  of every one of an infinite number of realities that could exist became its own branch. One solid, unmoving tree. But consciousness... consciousness is the wind that blows the branches of that tree, so even an infinite number of fixed realities can vibrate across each other.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T14:34:53Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jesper de Vaan", "comment_text": "Really liked the animation of this video.

To imply that mental contents just showed up because they must have shown up is a perfect example of begging the question. Think about dreaming, or imagination, or hallcucinations, or any other form of non-sense derived mental phenomena that work together like  a solar system with the self, consciousness, being the sun holding it all together. Your implications would mean that the sun was created via the presence of Mars. Before sense, there must be self. There must be an identity to be and deduce the world through its being.

But when you get two rocks, non-conscious objects, hand it to a conscious organism with no eyes: first they\u2019d might assume they\u2019re holding a couple of rocks by texture, and hardness, because in relation to a living organism tissue the rock is quite hard. But say you take those rocks and you smash them together: if you are blind, you can\u2019t see the sparks, if you\u2019re deaf you won\u2019t hear it\u2019s sound, and if you had no tissue to hold with, you\u2019d have no idea about the texture, now we\u2019re getting a response, in that, if you go for a touch, you will observe the rock is hard but it\u2019s not enough to convince you to know what the object is, you play with them hit one on another, now you\u2019re getting sounds and small sparks that could potentially blaze up the whole place. So I guess what I\u2019m trying to figure out here is if the rock, from a perspective of a blind and deaf person is such that: a rock is real therefore I feel and can throw it, but it\u2019s not conscious or alive because it does not show <b>ANY</b> behavior. Yet here we are, able to see and hear that the rock responds to motion, right I mean, it cracks a sound, this may not be a very well observable form of conscience, but yet, certainly a very primitive form of it.

Well, the organism doesn&#39;t have to know why it needs food, but it has to know it wants some to have a reason to seek it, and that reason, from what we know, is to survive. Therefore the actual question is, why would an organism come to the realisation that pursuing survival would be worthwhile?

I&#39;m gonna have a religious approach but be aware, i am a science geek too :) Here is how:\r<br><br><br>The last thing you say in the video is that consciousness may be originated from the urge of hunger and the need of food. Here is a twist. Hunger is another level of consciousness :D So your point is kind of left hanging in the air. Let me try to put it down to earth. Let&#39;s try to go back further back. You are aware of your hunger because you have receptors inside your brain and signals from your stomach. If you didn&#39;t have a stomach you would not be able get hungry. In the form of bacteria, you are consuming energy and you need more energy when deficiency shows up. This is ok so far. But what is deficiency of energy? You should be aware of that too. As a bacteria or a simle organism, you have to have a definiton of energy and intention to acquire energy. This still needs consciousness involved. Let&#39;s go back further. These all depends on some sort of vital information is interpreted in some way. If you know what is energy and why do you need it, then you would realize it is low and want to have more of it, if you know what vital is. So the need of food and survival becomes meaningful. And then to your point. You skipped these parts and concluded that consciousness my be originated on the need of food and survival. If i go back on your scenerio, that ends up in a loop and an unanswerable question. The source of information?\r<br>\r<br>Here comes the religious part. I believe God created first humans and other leaving things and thought them about things, to make them conscious enough to live on earth. This explains how the information became meaningful to living species. This is not a scientific approach, but this doesn&#39;t have a loop. In an ever existing universe hypothesis, some scientists propose ideas like big bang happening infinite time over and over, because they can not originate the big bang with any thery. People believe the first action is given by god. Likewise, you cannot originate the information becoming meaningful, by looking at living things. Furthermore, from the quantum mechanics perspective, information is nothing but a result of causality and consciousness is the perception of causality. Time is percieved by us and we became conscious of it. In a complete empty space, without your heartbeat and breath, you can&#39;t say if time is moving. Your cells can never be aware of energry situation without the chemical events. A bacteria can never have the urge to get food before it even understand what is food and why it needs that. All of these are interpretations of information, wihch is a result of interaction of elementary particles.\r<br>\r<br>Overall my point is: Consciousness is a perception of causality. Information can never be meaningful without perception. The urge of energy or survival cannot be born without the consciousness of life and death. Your point lacks the basis and ends up in some kind of dead end. My religious point may not be scientific, but it can explain that some being gave everything a go at the beginning.\r<br>\r<br>Keep up the good videos, i support you guys.

I enjoyed hierarchical build-up of conciousness portrayed here. I do however have some things to point out.<br><br>I disagree with your statement that T. Adhaerens has no &quot;need&quot; for a conciousness. You even stated in the video that it slows down in proximity of nutrients, which by some definitions can be concidered a concious act. Therefore, excluding it as a possible first step of conciousness is inherently false.<br><br>Also, the definition of conciousness is a bit vague in the video, which might be natural for a topic of this complexity. A way it is possible to divide up conciousness is for instance: having an inner-experience or reacting on the environment. When conciousness is typically referred to it often implies both of the above (with self-conciousness as a subset where yourself is concidered a part of the environment). However, if they are analyzed seperately one can see that neither necessitates the other. The possibility of having an inner-experience might hint to an inherent property of the universe, giving pantheists a slight advocation.
