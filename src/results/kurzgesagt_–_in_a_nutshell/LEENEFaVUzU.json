People are happy with space around them, the natural world, and a small number of others they know well. When local people are responsible for the land, they have a vested interest in looking after the place. Global scale management removes accountability and personal concern for things being done well, and greed and selfish interests rule the world. Cities are hell holes of mental illness and crime, and people flee them for more spacious, natural places. Our innovations, while clever, are destroying the environment. Where can you find a natural source of freshwater near you? Chances are very high that without the town water supply, there is NO drinkable water near you. All the waterways are polluted. We are filling the earth with plastics, PFAS/&quot;forever chemicals&quot;, nuclear waste and heavens knows what else, instead of the trees and plants and clean, fresh water that have been here for eons of time. We are using up all the non-renewable resources at a breathtaking rate. We are populating every nook and cranny of the planet, and that means there is less and less room for the things that we like to have around us, the natural world. Fighting over land, water, food and other resources can only intensify as the crowding increases. I could go on, but we are all so familiar with the problems. We are hurtling toward a brick wall.

The story of the main timeline has robots that, overtime, cause century-long wars and several apocalypses, and at the end completely replace human society. It makes me very anxious, since robots are a thing that are happening in our lives as we speak, and getting more and more advanced, making those futures believable. So, thank you for snapping me out of believing a series about killer robots is just a funny fantasy, since even if I knew that my brain subconsciously didn&#39;t get the memo.

Saying that millions of potential lives are at our mercy is something i didnt really catch. For me the lives are at the mercy of the time. If the TIME wants, it will let those lives live or die at its wish. Dont take it as a religious TIME thing or something. I am talking about the science TIME. For example people think that time travel is possible, but it is only when the TIME wants you to do it. And it actually isnt like u go back in time i.e. past. Its just an illusion that TIME wants you to see. Actually, &#39;going back in past&#39; is ur future. So i think whatever we do it wont matter if TIME has different future ready for us. Even if we all decide to destroy EARTH, but TIME wants our future generations to be born on earth, some or the other way destruction of earth wont happen.

Also the margin for error is just too high  for us as a species to take that average for granted. Especially with every thing going on in the last 60 years. that average wouldn&#39;t budge one decimal if Humans disappeared  toworrow, the average would still be 1 million years. And that is what scares me about this whole topic.

The other half is on the collatzconjectureproof page on my website which I&#39;m sure you know by now. If not it is linked in every video on my channel.<br><br>In the proof to the Collatz conjecture we use 3 types of odd numbers<br><br><br>A number divisible by 3 (3n) 9,15,2, 27 etc<br><br><br>A 3n+2 11,17, 23, 29...etc<br><br><br>A 3n-2 13, 19, 25, 31...etc<br><br><br><br><br>When we do this we spot a pattern.<br><br><br>1. Every division by 2^odd number (2,8,32,128 etc) leads to a 2+1<br><br><br>2. Every division by 2^even number leads to a 2-1.<br><br><br><br><br>3. There are 2 functions which lead to the same stop-start value of x only 1234 can satisfy both functions simultaneously.<br><br><br>3x+1\u00f72^n<br><br><br>3x+1/3\u00f72^n<br><br><br>Some 2 separate numbers can together satisfy both functions to arrive at the same stop-start number but they cannot be in the same sequence.<br><br><br><br><br>Because<br><br><br>For a loop there must be 2 ways in and one way out. This is not possible.<br><br><br>4. A number can have 2 ways in and one way out for example 47 can be reached by 31\u00d73+1\u00f72 or by 125\u00d73+1\u00f78 but the 2 ways in cannot happen in the same sequence.<br><br><br>4a. Because both come from an initial number that must be part of the sequence, for example 27 is the starting x which leads to the number 31\u00d73+1\u00f72=47 but 27 is divisible by 3 so cannot be the arrived at by a descent from 3x+1\u00f72. 97 is a 3n-2 which cannot be descended into from above because.<br><br><br>4b. A starting x that is a 3n-2 cannot be descended into from above because in order for a 3n-2 to be arrived at by the function 3x+1\u00f72 it must be arrived at from below because any (3n-2)\u00d73+1\u00f72 can only happen where that 3n-2 is a lower value than the initial x because in order to arrive at the same slope between x and 2x it must also satisfy the slope between x and 4x (3x+1/3) in a direct descent so therefore any 3n-2 must arrive at most at 2x. So therefore such stop start number would be a 3n+2. If it is a 3n+2 then 2x must at most be 1/2 of 1/4 of 8x which has the same slope as between x and 2x relative to 0 but this is impossible because then the 8x would be 16x relative to the stop start number which is impossible because all divisions by 2^even number (base 4) end in a 3n-2.\u00a0 \ufffc<br><br><br>So there can be no descent from higher up it must come from below. There cannot be any number within infinity that can satisfy this requirement because the 1st number to violate the descent to 1234 must theoretically come from above (which I have just shown is impossible) not below because all lower numbers would have already decended to 1234.<br><br><br>4c. No 2 different 3n+2 can descend at the same slope to arrive at the initial value of X see illustration attached.<br><br><br>No 2 3n+2 numbers can both satisfy the same end number after 3x+1\u00f72^n because any 2 numbers satisfying the function descend at a different slope relative to a direct line to 0 so cannot both arrive at the same slope that is between x and 2x in a direct descent.\u00a0 So any initial x must have been arrived at from only one possible route, a sequence which must begin at the initial value of x (or lower which as already established is impossible because the theorised 1st number to violate the drop to 1234 cannot be arrived at from below). Also because for any theoretical slope to arrive at the stop-start x which is a 3n+2 it must satisfy 3x+1\u00f72 from (a) a lower value of x which must have been arrived at from operations of the function beginning at the initial x which means a descent from a higher value of 3x+1 also is impossible because then it cannot also satisfy the function 3x+1/3 to descend into the same slope between 2x and x. If it did arrive from higher it cannot also arrive from lower which is obvious but may not be obvious to anyone under stress.<br><br><br>So no loop is possible arising from any number within infinity for these simple reasons.

We all rely on the work of millions, and the millions rely on each other. Even the bench you sit on at the park was created by someone in the past. The idea you have in that park, facilitated by that bench, belongs partially, in spirit, to the worker who made it.

Truly optimistic indeed. It is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of Capitalism. Science fiction writers hardly create anything other than hyper-capitalist futures, disregarding the historical unlikelihood of Capitalism&#39;s continued proliferation in as little as even just a century in the future.

They just didn&#39;t need that.<br>They lived in a dinosaur&#39;s paradise where birth control was provided by the environment. We could say that they were safely controlled by their environment - they couldn&#39;t get to a situation where they do anything that makes them extinct.<br>Humans have passed that line a long time ago... er, well, in that scale, not so long time ago. We can potentially make the earth inhabitable in a few days, and we&#39;re continually making it inhabitable by transforming it slowly.<br>Moreover, we have long passed a sustainable population. We have made most other animals and plants extinct, and our population is barely sustainable in this globalized world. One local war and millions starve. Any advance in technology, or logistics is instantly used up to support new population - to the point that the population makes the environment toxic for everyone.<br>I also can&#39;t support the vision of the population peaking at 11,5 billion - that would require everyone becoming rich enough that the number of children decreases. What I see is these rich people dying out, and overpopulated people flowing to their place. This way the increase never stops, it will keep its exponential nature.<br>This doesn&#39;t mean that Humanity is doomed. It only means that it needs to learn. It might need a few iterations. Most of the above problems doesn&#39;t mean the end of the human race - only the decimation of the population. Still, I really hope that I won&#39;t be alive to see it.

Lewis From &#39;Mining the Sky&#39;:<br> As long as the human population remains as pitifully small as it is today, we shall be severely limited in what we can accomplish. Human intelligence is the key to the future: human beings are not, as some would have it, a form of pollution.<br>Having only one Einstein, one Hokusai, one Mozart, one daVinci, one Shankara,... is not enough. We need (and can have) a million times as many. We need intelligence, wisdom, compassion, and excellence. These godlike traits are manifested in the physical universe only by life, and in the biological universe, only by intelligent life.<br> Life is not a cancer of matter; it is matter&#39;s trancendance of itself. The fulfillment of time &amp; space is matter; the fulfillment of matter is life; the highest fulfillment of life is unbounded intelligence &amp; compassion.<br> We would be quite wrong to conclude that the asteroid belt, or solar power... is the ultimate resource. Intelligent life, once liberated by the resources of space, is the greatest resource of the solar system. The material and energy resources of the solar system allow mankind an infinite future: we can not only break free of the surly bonds of the Earth, but break free of the Sun and escape its fate.<br> &quot;There is no way back into the past.

He wrote that there&#39;s no real reason why we shouldn&#39;t live on past the end of the Sun.<br>He also said that we might find ourselves in the position one day to do something about the ultimate end of the ability of the universe to support life, whether it&#39;s the &quot;heat death&quot; or a &quot;cold death&quot; from continuing expansion, as seems to be the case.<br>See his article &quot;Time Without End: Physics and Biology in an Open Universe&quot;. He openly challenges how nobody seems to want to look into the deep future and what prospects might await.

Things like us, maybe a million.<br><br>There&#39;s no reason to think that anyone a half billion years in the future will want to tinker themselves or their offspring to be like us Mk-1 humans.<br>The human species will go extinct, when among the billion species of sentient life from here spread across the galaxy, none are &quot;human&quot; any more.<br><br>I point out that the O&#39;Neill space colony came about because O&#39;Neill at Stanford, was tired of the doom and gloom and popular sentiment that technology only kills and can never actually make things better.<br>He challenged a class of grad &amp; undergrad students to find something for a long term hopeful future in high technology, and after looking at what Apollo was bringing back from the moon, gradually hammered it out to the extent that NASA Ames and Stanford ran the &#39;70s space settlement studies. They found that there are no new inventions needed to mine asteroids or moons and to build for virtually Earth-like conditions anywhere in space where there are or to which we bring materials.<br><br>Note that doing so would destroy &quot;money&quot; or &quot;wealth&quot; as we know it. The first entity that returns from an NEA, even a few kg of loosely sorted metals, instantly and forever wins the &quot;game&quot; of making money from collecting resources of raw materials, or energy (or monetary metals).<br>Within 50 years from start, any time since the &#39;70s we&#39;ve wanted to start, we&#39;d end the relevance of the scarcity model to raw materials or energy or room for growth.<br>Construction materials are literally raining down on us. The little Apollo class NEA that hit near Chelyabinsk in &#39;13 was denser with metals than Earth&#39;s crust ~50km deep. Some meteorites ae density 8+, greater than pure Iron. King Tut&#39;s rust-proof meteoritic steel dagger is 6% cobalt. No mine on a moon or planet will ever work such materials.<br>We know of 1400 NEAs more easily accessible (and year-round) than Mars. 400 easier than the Moon, 40 or so easier than Lunar orbit. The Apollo capsules came straight in on hyperbolic interplanetary trajectories without entering orbit or trying to slow down. An aeroentry barge of asteroid materials doesn&#39;t even need to stay intact or afloat after splashing down in the shallows off an industrial port city.<br><br>O&#39;Neill and NASA showed this to Congress back then. Obviously the &quot;powers that be&quot; back then thought that a better future for us now would be stuck down here, in pollution and oil wars.<br>Note that for the cost of ~3 of our CVNs and their air wing and escorts and the logistics infrastructure to deploy them to fight over oil, we could have started mining and building in space and had the first small, first-generation space habitat and all the ground and in-space infrastructure to reproduce it.<br>The &quot;Cost&quot; would since have been paid off along with the national debt, by asteroidal metals. No more oil wars or budget shortfalls, ever.<br><br>Yes, I know many will say that asteroidal metals can never be economically brought back.<br>As with space colonies themselves or Solar power satellites, such objections always overlook the scale of the resource, and assume many straw-men to make it impossible.<br>All, even &quot;futurists&quot; (even O&#39;Neill), shy away violently from thoughts of crashing the value of all the gold in all the vaults, or the oil underground. We just don&#39;t dare think about such a thing. Why? we just don&#39;t.<br> So we&#39;re left with trying to dream up ways a colony or space effort can pay for itself. Zubrin talks about patent royalties for things invented by Mars colonists. Musk sells internet and ground-orbit launch services, to pay for going into space.<br><br>I like to point out that the biggest hoax and scam of the space age is that so many have been convinced that doing things in space is and must be a huge, budget-busting expense, and that there&#39;s nothing worth going on for, or doing in space.<br>Both are simply not true.<br>During Apollo, the US spent as much on cosmetics, and large States spent more on liquor, then we spent going to the Moon.<br>The bailouts of &#39;08 were greater than the entire historic running grand total NASA expense. Including Apollo, the Shuttle and ISS. The bailouts of 2020 very much more.<br>Today our annual DoD budget is ~80% of that running total NASA cost. Not counting &quot;black&quot; military budgets and on-gong military operational expenses, which aren&#39;t included in that voted DoD budget but are tacked on as &quot;riders&quot; in &quot;must-pass&quot; legislation. During our invasion of Iraq, we were spending $8 billion a month, and our NASA budget was $17 billion.<br>Today, we spend more on each: fast foods, illegal drugs, sports gambling, and lotteries, as on NASA.", "comment_date": "2022-07-09T05:11:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rakso1597", "comment_text": "the last human has been born since the last human evolution. the next human to be born will be a proto human", "comment_date": "2022-07-09T04:50:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rakso1597", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udc41\u200d\ud83d\udde8\u267e\ud83d\udc41\u200d\ud83d\udde8", "comment_date": "2022-07-09T04:48:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Singka Machinao", "comment_text": "Imagine every human to ever live knows and remembers u\ud83d\udc97", "comment_date": "2022-07-09T04:35:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Flanders", "comment_text": "&quot;We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-07-09T04:13:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phat Ninja 070", "comment_text": "I am Grateful.<br><br>I feel just saying &quot;thank you&quot; to the kurzgesagt team is under selling just how grateful I am to them for making this video, especially as it comes at a time when the world seems confusing and everyday is an exercise in managing the fear of living another day.<br><br>It gives hope when you realise that this could be &quot;the beginning and not the end&quot;.

(Because this virus mutates too fast to create an effective vaccine, which may never get made), upon the world. This is dangerous because common behaviors of common folk, such as shoulder to shoulder events, shopping and sardine packed working conditions, helped this virus along...even as people died in China daily...America went forward 2 full months wothout any concerns...then...rather than force the hands of state officials, and put the population through a 2 month quarantine,\u00a0 we&#39;ve been seeing states react, rather than prepare...and all at the natural stages this virus thrives on...complacency among enough of us to allow the spread to continue.

We could be educating everyone from home...there are no valid excuses for our current broken schooling, and no teachers need lose jobs...as the internet is an amazing communication device...<br><br>Taxes are broken. Your dollar earned gets hit so many times...and we all just accept that blindly.<br><br>Medicine is broken.

So while the video essay communicates that 800 thousand more years of humans is a pessimistic estimate, scientific thinking does not permit such gross assumptions and misguided analysis. And that&#39;s just about scenario 1. The whole video is full of assumptions that are coated in misinformation. Of course assumptions are often necessary in most analysis, and the narrator acknowledges that these are assumptions. But the problem is in the fact that the video misguides the viewer on the nature of these assumptions; in my example, while the assumption is an overtly optimistic and simplelistic estimate, the narrator communicates that the estimate is a pesimistic and conservative one.

This means there is a chance that you will not die after about 100 years whereas otherwise you would&#39;ve. Even if there is a very high chance you fail, on the off-chance that you succeed, it will dramatically increase how long you live and thus your total positive contribution to civilization, provided that the one average person you&#39;re &quot;replacing&quot; by becoming ageless and consuming society&#39;s resources is not expected to contribute as much.<br><br>Of course there is a counterargument to this, that maybe the other people that become ageless due to your intervention are, on average, less willing to help the world long-term than if longevity had developed later without your effort. These people will all live for a very long time too, so if they make fewer long-term contributions, it would drown out the positive effects of yourself surviving.

Some of them I imagine could be even dumber than the atomic bomb which might lead to some form of planetary omnicide.", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T23:42:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "inky Gamer", "comment_text": "R.I.P hologram duck...or is he dead?", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T23:41:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cronista", "comment_text": "Eu queria tanto comprar um patinho de pel\u00facia pra mim!", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T23:39:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stick", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEENEFaVUzU&amp;t=0m17s\">0:17</a> I have to mention this but the whole Mayan prophecy thing was a mistranslation", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T23:33:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Captain F!sh", "comment_text": "Man i cant wait for starwars to be realife and also rick and morty.<br><br><br><br>yeah..", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T23:32:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ivann Souza", "comment_text": "As a fellow Brazilian, thank you for providing it on my mother-language, I have no problem understanding it in English but that&#39;s an exception here for us, I wish you guys great success!", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T23:27:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anti Developer", "comment_text": "good video. but i am from ua, good luck!", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T23:20:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Frost", "comment_text": "Lies.", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T23:19:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dieillumintiscum", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEENEFaVUzU&amp;t=5m20s\">5:20</a> So the sun is getting hotter, therefore the earth is getting hotter.

First, I&#39;ll say please read this comment to the end, or you will have nightmares. <br>Okay, here goes. <br>The last biological human will be born a few centuries from now. At that time, there will be alive many hundreds of billions of non-biological people, all of whom live within virtual worlds and/or robotic bodies (and can move between the two at will). All (or almost all) of these virtual worlds will exist in spaceships, some of which have a permanent place within the solar system, and some of which are on a long journey to another star. However, and this is the bit which is difficult to explain, humanity is also on a long journey towards evolving into something else. That &#39;something&#39; has cognition, just like us, but it probably cannot be divided into individuals. Rather, it is a gestalt entity, with thoughts that can swirl separately for a while and then join in with the others without barriers. The way it thinks, its instincts and goals, it cognitive abilities, are evolving from those of humans, but are destined to become very different. <br>I believe humanity will survive. History shows that, as a species, we are very good survivors. There may be calamities which kill many people in the future. But some people, at least, will survive.<br>However, we are not going to stand still. Our technology will evolve. We will evolve. What we become in the future may well be unrecognisable and scary to us now.<br>But what we become will, I believe, actually be a better us. We are held down by our biological limitations and anachronistic instincts. Future us will be better. Still flawed, still making mistakes, but nevertheless better.<br>It can be very hard to accept the idea that we will evolve into something that is alien to how we are now, but remember that a new born baby evolves into something very alien to what it is at birth: an adult human. In the same way, we, humanity, will necessarily evolve into something very different in the future.

Share the lands and no more wars. We all would have proper information in our minds to make a clear freedom of decision with also a real time result outcome by computers showing our gentic group numbers just like the stock market or maybe something similar. All numbers in data will be in computers starting with land territory, crop weight, the continuous change in average life expectancy and so on...... all information would be meshed in and everyone can see. The longer a couple waits the more money they gain permanently(easier then the stock market and totally separate). The goal of the computer would to attempt to defeat competition between each human group but retain and balance each group in attempted to make a perfect life by bringing down murders to 0% and less work but more free time for all. Yet computer still geared for every couple to have one kid if they waited long enough. There mission in life is accomplish and still able to retire early. That would be a great computer to space travel with i would think. The reward is to retire early so inform the kids early in life with information. The kids/young adults would have to work long hours to give a good example that if they had kids too early or had too many then they be working for the rest of there lives not retire at all....... if they didn&#39;t work the computer would show long term results of becoming homeless or going to a really nice jail cause not able to pay bills. When in really nice jail they would not be able to have anymore kids. There kids will have wait longer the next generation do to the results of there parents decisions or perhaps a inflation surge amongst the whole group(like what we are already in). So being in a nice jail facility be the lowest point but hey there family had there kids and is that be better then war, panhandling on the streets or watching people die or suffer.. perhaps we are already in a financial jail but you know i think we need an actual early retirement program so everyone can see and have a goal", "comment_date": "2022-07-02T14:19:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John Curtis", "comment_text": "It&#39;s not important whether the human species lives or dies.

The branches with the &quot;skull&quot; looking icon is way more plausible then your &quot;big&quot; ideas of us moving out even from our planet, don&#39;t even bother talking about moving out from the solar system because at this rate, it will NEVER happen.<br><br>Your depiction of people with 2 children per family is not going to lead us there. It&#39;s simple math, 2 at a 50%/50% gender distribution will only be on a sustainable population level. So come back to REALITY and stop making all these DELUSIONAL videos.", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T22:35:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "4lex4nder12", "comment_text": "Cancanser?

This is a great video developed through creativity and assumptions, but with rational lines of thought.  <br>The one thing I must question is @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEENEFaVUzU&amp;t=4m30s\">4:30</a>  using the assumption of a constant birth rate year over year instead of a variable birthrate creates unnecessary inaccuracies.  (.)  If we assume the population increases over time and the ratio of births per human remains constant, then it is logical that the yearly birth rate would increase over time.  More humans able to reproduce = more baby humans.   The key point in this paragraph is to distinguish between the definitions of birth rate (total humans born in a year) vs. birth ratio per human (average number of humans 1 human creates).<br><br>For example, (totally made up numbers) - if every 1 human born create a worldwide average of 1.1  humans, then during a year with a world population of 10B humans, the population would increase by 1B humans (10Bx1.1=11B).  Assuming the same ratio of births per human, during a year with a world population of 100B humans, the population would increase by 10B humans (100Bx1.1=110B).  <br><br>The entire point of this comment (besides selfishly making me feel better and not freaking out about maths) is to point out that @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEENEFaVUzU&amp;t=4m33s\">4:33</a> the stated number of humans waiting to be born,100 trillion, is much lower that it would be because the model creates a linear line of growth when graphed.  The model using a variable birth rate would create an exponential line of growth if graphed, which means the statement referencing 100 trillion humans waiting to be born is an underestimate. This results in the next statement regarding there being 850 times greater number of humans waiting to be bornd than the number of humans that  have already been born to be underestimated.  Finally, the underestimation above results in the next statement  @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEENEFaVUzU&amp;t=4m40s\">4:40</a> estimating the number of the current human population is only 0.008% of all people who will ever live lower.   <br><br>In conclusion, the change to the model from linear population growth to exponential population growth increases the magnitude of your argument about putting us at the beginning of something big instead of the end.  The change to the model increases future population estimates throughout the remainder of the video, which again enhances he magnitude of your conclusions.  <br><br>That&#39;s 30 minutes of my life I will never get back spent on a YouTube comment that no one will read because this video is already 3 days old.

Humility is a key ingredient in driving science forward as we need to start with uncertainty across almost all propositions in order to open us up to investigating those propositions and thus generating knowledge. But, myths such as the Tree of Knowledge, Pandora&#39;s Box, and Promethian Fire reflect a sense we have that the slightest overreach will close the door to a good future.

If that many people did exist, it&#39;s likely that their ancestors would be composed of a minuscule number of Y chromosomes. In other words, there would be very little male genetic variation. If we extrapolate from history, we find that not many men got to sire offspring. It was probably when the agricultural neolithic era and founding of religion saw the largest number of males able to sire offspring. Without the need for religious practices, human mating behaviors fall into tournament mating strategies. There is a book called &quot;Dating Up: The Hypergamy Factor&quot; which speaks on this. Therefore the genetic variation among the species is limited and that puts humanity at risk for diseases that attack the Gene&#39;s and/or birth defects.

But birth rate is just the start - the video assumes that if our descendants survive millions of years or even longer, they will continue to resemble &quot;people&quot; in even a very broad sense. For example: existing as large numbers of clearly distinguishable minds per small region of space (say, per planetary body); maintaining those per-region numbers at population levels at least similar to today, if not many orders of magnitude larger; continuing to reproduce at all, and at similar rates... the birth rate consideration is almost a footnote.<br><br>Around halfway through, the video mentions one possible reason for humanity to do this: &quot;more humans may actually mean more progress&quot;. But if technological society survives the coming centuries, then I can&#39;t see how our problem-solving capacity would have anything to do with the size of the human population. Again, maybe I&#39;m missing something - but it seems to me that in such a technological far future, the vast majority of problem-solving would surely involve technology. Whether we think of that as mere software, artificial intelligence, cybernetic enhancements, or whatever else is almost beside the point: I just can&#39;t see most of that decision-making plausibly consisting of human beings thinking human thoughts.<br><br>Now, you could argue that even as we continue to develop technology to make decisions for us, those decisions will still be &quot;guided&quot; by ordinary people making decisions of our own (e.g. providing the technology with feedback, or designing new forms of it), and that the number of people guiding this process is what will really determine the rate of progress in science, technology or problem-solving in general. And sure, that&#39;s true now and for the immediately foreseeable future. But I really can&#39;t imagine how any technological society could exist for <b>millions of years</b> - if not far longer - and still have its problem-solving capacity limited in any way by the number of ordinary people.<br><br>I&#39;m interested to hear if anyone has thoughts about this.", "comment_date": "2022-06-29T17:08:03Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "Selcuk Askin", "comment_text": "OMG!", "comment_date": "2022-06-29T17:06:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "World of Science", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEENEFaVUzU&amp;t=10m07s\">10:07</a> it&#39;s Cool", "comment_date": "2022-06-29T17:06:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yo Man", "comment_text": "What I would like to see is a video on what the highest technology of humanity could look like and what might be possible.

Some key people in my family are unimaginably pessimistic about our ability to keep going, and they think the world is going down the drain. I think this is largely due to that perspective being popular and in vogue right now. The political climate makes it seem like nobody can agree on anything and that the out group is so incompetent that the only explanation for their actions is malady against society in general. That is obviously false, and I can say that with confidence because everyone thinks that about everyone else, but not themselves. Deep down the vast majority of people are trying to do the right thing. Even if we get that wrong and there are bad actors in play, that should give us some hope. All of us want everything to be okay. I think religion does play a role too. Like the video states, everyone thinks the world is ending when their alive and then life just keeps going. This is ESPECIALLY true of Advent Christian religions by which I mean Christian denominations that believe Jesus is coming to save us by destroying the old earth and creating a new one. They infer that because this is the case, any human attempt to make things better is futile, and the only way everything will work out is if Jesus destroys this earth and purges humanity of sin which will be done with fire and brimstone. In fact, many of us celebrate the end times because it means we are closer to the end of human suffering. My family and I are Seventh Day Adventists and we all share this eschatology. I\u2019ve noticed it used as a coping mechanism. Many of our discussions about the happenings of the world end with us saying that whatever terrible event  that just happened is fine because Jesus will come and fix everything in the end. It allows us to keep going when all seems lost. However, a side-effect is that we are very pessimistic and if we really took our religion seriously, we would be utterly uninterested in the future, and we wouldn\u2019t try to make anything \u201cbetter\u201d or fix anything or address any problems. Luckily, we still care about things like that, but the video is right, it makes us very myopic in approaching large-scale problems. To be fair, we obviously aren\u2019t the only ones who suffer from \u201cexistential myopia\u201d if you will. It\u2019s obviously just one manifestation of a psychological truth buried deep in human consciousness, we know we won\u2019t last forever, and we\u2019re afraid of that both individually and collectively. We all have to figure out how to respond to that and it\u2019s no trivial task. My point is that regardless of how you respond, there is a possible potential universe where humanity thrives and solves one problem after another until there are only trivial problems that are easily handled. And while there is also a possible potential universe that is the opposite of that and everything in between, it makes sense to have faith that if we all devote our lives to trying to make things better or at least less bad, then that amazing future is far more likely to happen. It\u2019s okay to be skeptical, but we can\u2019t be cynical. It\u2019s okay to think that God will solve everything in the end, but we can\u2019t let that keep us from following Him in the meantime. This world does matter and people are counting on us. Even if the end is near, there\u2019s no way to know that. It\u2019s our responsibility to assume it isn\u2019t and plan for a better future.

If you&#39;re able, I think delving into group psychology, in the sense of mass manipulation as well as the dynamics of small and large groups; ideological psychology, such as how our beliefs can override the evidence of our own senses and how <b>especially</b> false beliefs which have become part of our sense of identity, especially if that identity exists within a group, and provide social clout within it, are almost impossible to change someone&#39;s mind about; cult psychology, including why people join, why they stay, and how to get someone out; the psychology of abuse, and abusers both of an individual and of a group; and the psychology of governance, both how peoplerule and how they are ruled. All of those together, as I see it, and maybe you do to, are really part of the same piece of the overall big picture. If you can show it, in your way, and there are those who listen, I think we may have the first fighting chance we&#39;ve ever had at avoiding the worst of those possible outcomes.", "comment_date": "2022-06-29T14:11:40Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "\u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0440 \u041c\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u043b\u044b", "comment_text": "Kazakhstan watches your videos too.

God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away.

Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness.

In that case, the odds of being among the first 117 billion people ever born is about 1 in 10 million - extremely unlikely. And of course, that number will only become even more unlikely if we assume higher numbers of people in the future, like a sextillion or even a tredecillion humans. In that case, the odds will go from extremely unlikely to unfathomably unlikely.<br><br>I&#39;ve heard a few possible explanations to this seeming paradox, but none of them seem particularly satisfy.<br><br>For one, we could just have made that insanely unlikely dice roll. After all, no matter how improbable, <i>someone</i> had to be in that super-early group, thinking about how unlikely their birth was.<br><br>Another, and probably the most unpleasant explanation, would be the doomsday argument - which basically states that the end of humanity really is closer than we think. If, say, only 300 billion people will ever be born, then being one of the first 117 billion becomes far more likely. <br><br>A third idea would be the simulation hypothesis. The basic summery would be that the &quot;Star Trek future&quot; already have been achieved, and we are living in a simulated version of earth as it was in the year 2022. <br>This would make some sense, since the current period - the period right before humans really started expanding into space, would likely be a time that future humans would want to experience. In the same vein as how we enjoy reading history and from the roman era or playing video games from the early 80s, just to try and understand what things used to be like in the past, people in the future would probably want to simulate our reality to understand what our lives used to be like. <br><br>What do you think?", "comment_date": "2022-06-29T08:51:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "arrowghost", "comment_text": "Tredecilion, eh.

This changes constantly though. Tens of thousands of years ago,  &quot;we&quot; was your tribe, a few millennia ago and it was your culture. To Europeans a few centuries ago, it was Europe and their colonies. In the future, I theorise that &quot;our&quot; history will not be just human history but that of every sentient life form we encounter in the cosmos.<br><br>Today we regard &quot;our&quot; history as that of the history of every human and human culture, that wasn&#39;t the case 500 years ago. While human culture will still be focused on and discussed in the future, the concept and relative term for &quot;us&quot; or &quot;we&quot; in the use of history will most likely not be determined by human history, but of sentient history.<br><br>That&#39;s my opinion and theory of how future generations will see the past and its history.", "comment_date": "2022-06-29T08:26:51Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "FlamingTP", "comment_text": "Optimistic much?

This leads to population decreasing of those people which have higher potential of moving the development of human kind. Highly developed countries are holding it&#39;s population or even increasing due to people from less developed or should I say poor countries immigrating there, but mostly not contributing to its development further, occuping low to mid tier jobs. Of couse there are exceptions, I do not pull all under one umrella, but the big picture is important. Meaning population is growing , but as a useless amorphous mass which will do no technological advancement and only consuming resources. We are stuck in this spiral.

And that those who want to own illegal weapons will get their hands on them, regardless of the law.<br>If everyone owned\u00a0weapons, those\u00a0looking to do harm will\u00a0think twice before doing\u00a0so.<br>Some good arguments, I&#39;d admit. <br>My argument was that not all of us have a need to hold weapons. That what we hear on the news is not our reality. That these rare occurrences\u00a0don&#39;t happen to the majority of us, as long as we don&#39;t encourage these behaviors by giving these criminals a spotlight or &quot;walking down that dark alley&quot; ourselves.

Those who own rifles, use them for hunting or sport.

Your video raises a point worth talking about, although Nick Bostrom publicly talked about it 10 years ago. Right now we would need someone with your reach to stop the escalation of the Ukrainian war. Russia will not stop until they win. And the West will not stop until they win. That IS the pathway to destruction. Of course, even an all-out nuclear war won&#39;t erase mankind but merely push it back 100 or 200 years. As my last point that no one on earth has picked up yet, although it is the most intelligent thing about the mentioned war, I would like to tell you this: If US succeeds against Russia (for example by installing a friendly government), they will be global sovereign. As such an entities rights can only grow, that would lead to the uttermost dystopia. We NEED Russia to keep that from happening. Or any other sufficiently powerful actor. But right now, apart from Russia no country or institution qualifies for a lack of nukes. Becoming global sovereign is the ultimate goal and I would even suspect that the US would be willing to accept all Chinese, French, and British nukes exploding on their soil to reach it.

Life does not just go on like you&#39;re making Doritos. Again, the dead can&#39;t defend themselves, and they have been robbed of a life.  You say life goes on, but you&#39;re not in their shoes, so it&#39;s an easy, convenient and stupid sentiment. The fact is that humans are a predatorial species which means there&#39;s no hope for unity and love. Love only exists in very few people. That&#39;s not enough to save us. We&#39;re an evolutionary culdesac facing entropy, and we deserve it in spades. Nature&#39;s failed experiment we are. Remember, look at all the children our race has killed in wars since the dawn of man. We have existed for 300,000 or more years, and we still haven&#39;t gotten it right, and I say TIME&#39;S UP! That&#39;s why I&#39;m very comfortable in letting the human race end. I enjoy life now, and I&#39;m more relaxed, because I know it&#39;s a futile attempt to heal a naturally and dangerously flawed, predatorial human race. I have come to terms that we are naturally a violent species. We can&#39;t change a zebra&#39;s stripes, and we can&#39;t remove a lion&#39;s savagery. Mankind is naturally violent by nature, and compassion is the subversive rebel that loves instead of fighting; to be in the world, but not part of it, not part of all the violence. Love is real, control is everywhere. It takes awareness and bravery to walk away from the ugly human race. I don&#39;t trust a bear in the woods, and neither do I trust humanity. That&#39;s not negativity. That&#39;s called logic and facing reality and the truth. Optimists are just ignorant virtue signaling pretenders. Humans will NEVER stop being violent.

Was it because it inspired hope towards the unknown future or was it because i fought myself so hard to not believe in the overwhelming opportunities of the future, these beliefs that i once had as a kid but escaped me as i grew up. So remembering that belief i once had brought back all the pain i have towards this world and the way it forced me to become a shell of a positive human i once was. And that pain which was put into me and my innocence as a child being torn apart; remembering all that made me cry. I honestly stopped recognizing myself since i turned 14-16. I stopped recognizing the world i live in long before. In fact i never recognized the world. Solutions to world problems seemed illogical when i was a kid and they still seem illogical now. But back then i had all that hope and positivity for the unknown.  Maybe the answer is time. As you see more of the world, the more you understand its impending doom.<br><br>I wish i could believe what is being said in this video. My kid-self definitely would watch 5 minutes and close the video because the idea that there lies positive outcomes in the unknown future is  already ingrained in me that i would not need to watch the video to understand its message. I remember hoping as a kid that i would get to experience technologies that would amaze me as i grew older and that i am to be in good health to be able to experience them and that is all i asked in life. Now, i find myself hoping that my future unborn children will not see the end of days or suffer in the period before leading to the end of days.<br><br>Onto a different note:<br>What does religion tell us? If enough people shun religion out then all principles and values will be lost then god will send a prophet to build a ship and preserve the animals and flood all the evil people including the little good people left. But sending prophets and creating religions ended some 1500 years ago so all is left is the end of days. The end of days might be collapse of civilization, people killing each other over food and medicine and water, or hiding in bunkers underground from the violent rays of the sun but i think divine intervention will be the end of us long before any of the other things happen. The logic is simple. If god can control time and time is relative then god can make the sun turn into a red giant real quick... and none of us here on earth would enjoy that very much.

Master Li (founder of Falun Gong) said, \u201cLive organ harvesting has been commonplace in many hospitals across China. It was a directive straight from the evil.\u201d (\u201cFa Teaching Given at the New York Fa Conference Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of Dafa\u2019s Spreading\u201d)\r<br>\r<br>Here I would like to share an incident that I encountered four years ago that shows forced organ harvesting does exist. \r<br>\r<br>A Secret\r<br>At that time I lived in a community of Jinan City, Shandong Province. One day, I saw an old man in his 60s outside my apartment building. He looked skinny and pale, like a retired government official. When I saw him, he was checking a dumpster to see if he could get some cardboard. \r<br>\r<br>I greeted him and we began to talk. He was indeed a retired government official. Coming from another city, he stayed at his son\u2019s place. He seemed to be a nice person. \r<br>\r<br>\u201cI was released from hospital recently and I am bored staying inside,\u201d he said. So he thought he would pick up some cardboard and sell it. \r<br>\r<br>\u201cBut people who live in this community are wealthy in general. Is your son okay?\u201d I asked.\r<br>\r<br>\u201cBecause of my surgery, he has spent lots of money,\u201d the man replied. \r<br>\r<br>\u201cYou are a retired government official. Aren&#39;t your medical expenses covered by insurance?\u201d I was surprised and asked.\r<br>\r<br>\u201cNot everything. For the operation I received, only part of it could be reimbursed,\u201d he explained. \r<br>\r<br>\u201cWhy not? Which hospital did you go to?\u201d I asked. \r<br>\r<br>\u201cQianfoshan Hospital and it was a heart transplant. My son spent over 400,000 yuan on it. This cannot be reimbursed,\u201d he continued. \r<br>\r<br>\u201cI heard heart transplant is pretty easy nowadays. I knew several years ago people had to wait a long time because of the difficulty finding a matching organ,\u201d I said. \r<br>\r<br>\u201cUgh! Society is too dark now. There are clearly labeled price tags for all kinds of organs. It&#39;s all shameful deeds!\u201d He sighed. \r<br>\r<br>\u201cHave you heard about live organ harvesting? Like those from Falun Gong practitioners?\u201d I asked. \r<br>\r<br>He was nervous. After looking around and making sure no one else was around, he lowered his voice and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a secret. Those people [from the hospital] told my son to never tell anything about this.\u201d Then his tears started to fall.\r<br>\u201cHad I known this earlier, I would not have had such a sinful operation even if I had to die!\u201d He cried out. \r<br>\r<br>At that moment, I was almost certain this man\u2019s organ was from a Falun Gong practitioner. Also in tears, I held his hands and said, \u201cI know you are a kind person...\u201d We cried together. \r<br>\r<br>Continuing on that topic, I told him what Falun Gong is and how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had harmed Chinese people during numerous political campaigns. I also talked about organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in many hospitals. \r<br>\r<br>\u201cI already knew the Party was no good, but did not know it\u2019s so evil. It is horrible!\u201d he said. He then quit all CCP organizations.", "comment_date": "2022-06-28T22:22:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ram\u00f3n FSM", "comment_text": "Excellent video essay.

We expand into every space available on Earth because it&#39;s easy and we aren&#39;t forced to think about it for it to happen. Thus, our instincts override our intellect, and all available habitable space gets used. But when we build habitation units in space or on uninhabitable worlds, it will be difficult and tedious. We will be forced to use our intellect to expand. We will not do it via instinct, but we will have to decide that it is actually important to do so. In many cases, more people can provide more opportunities for taking advantage of available resources. More people can operate mining facilities, more people can be scientists and engineers, more people can develop, design, and operate more equipment which can do great things. But we will want more people to achieve milestones of human civilization development. We will want more people to build stable interplanetary societies, to build colony ships, to secure valuable resources, to miniaturize high-end technology such as fusion reactors or interstellar spacecraft drives. Once we begin to achieve the top of our potential, and our focus on improving quality of life for everyone reaches the point where we can make people happy for life easily, then we will stop advancing and simply maintain. Some people may explore, but nobody will build a habitat simply because a rock exists to support it. Nobody will build an O&#39;Neill Cylinder just because they have steel available. Nobody will colonize a planet just because it&#39;s a source of materials for expansion. Every bit of expansion will need a reason to happen.

Imagine if the whole world collaborated AND funded all the different organizations? We could have centuries of discoveries in our lifetimes! And that&#39;s just space exploration stuff, imagine if we worked together to stabilize food production and distribution so everyone in the world could eat delicious and healthy stuff without a million-dollar price tag. We could make such fun and cool things, discover so much and improve everyone&#39;s lives immeasurably. It&#39;d be a relatively simple thing to end working altogether, leaving people to pursue what they want to do rather than whatever brings in money.

Hopefully we will stick to scenario 1 like all advanced alien civilizations we wouldn&#39;t know of existing, for the same reason. What is certain is that life will always be subjected to the all-powerful forces of the cosmos that are blind, unaware, uncaring of the consequences they come with, if they are catastrophic to life or good - they just happen. Though what is critical to not forget about all the speculative up-scaling of the potential amount of future people is how this up-scaling would in any case relate to the up-scaling of wildlife animal population sizes. Wildlife animals suffer more than farm animals in their perpetual demise of all 99.99...% of not-fittest, and this holds true in an especially grave manner for so-called r-selection strategist species, which mainly consist of the - relative to larger ones - very abundant smaller species that focus on maximizing their off-spring which necessitates minimized care on the individual level, leading to short excruciating lives for the vast majority of the off-spring in each generation (due to disease, injury, parasitism, starvation and malnutrition, dehydration, weather conditions, natural disasters, and killings by other animals), so if the latter case of farm animals&#39; situation is discomforting enough already to think of, one should absolutely not forget the former. Ethics shouldn&#39;t just account for humans or people, but ethics requires a holistic, (with respect to sentient beings, astronomic time-spans, and living spaces) complete perspective. And doing so means to account for the fact that large multi-cellular life forms have existed on earth for billions of years, and not just for the previously estimated roughly 600 million years, which is by magnitudes far longer than humanity can realistically hope to stay on earth. For what eventually will be what one could call &quot;earth&#39;s (un)ethical final balance or score&quot;, humanity is in a position in which all odds stand against its ability to compensate for this gargantuan accumulated pain that billions of species across billions of years were by this ruthless, merciless, careless universe forced to experience in their continual struggle over life and death, all while being mindlessly repeatedly bred into existence, sealing each new animal generation&#39;s fate.<br><br>I&#39;ll make what hopefully will be a self-unfulfilling prediction here of what impending, far into the future delayed calamity is only at most about 1 year away from happening in our future: <br><br>Despite the fact that the Outer Space Treaty strictly prohibits risking contamination of celestial bodies, agencies part of countries that subscribed to the Treaty that are active in outer space will - as they always have in the past - ignore this prohibition and don&#39;t see why it&#39;s more important than even the most severe global extinction events as long as they are merely constrained to earth, and will continue risking and even intending physical contact with celestial bodies of the solar system with contaminated probes which already have been confirmed to have at least temporarily contaminated the moon and Mars - based on official statements e.g. by the administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, John Grunsfeld - and they will not stop there but will forever irreversibly with at extremely fast pace exponentially in their numbers growing microbes contaminate not just any celestial bodies of our solar system but exactly those that very concerningly enable such contamination to have the greatest negative unethical macro-scale consequences, namely the moons Enceladus (with the Enceladus Explorer mission), Europa (with the Europa Lander mission), Ganymede (with the Laplace-P mission), Titan (with the Dragonfly mission), Callisto (with the Gan De mission), and Triton.<br><br>What they - because of specialist ethicists and technology assessment groups still not being mandatory for any company projects dealing with novel technology frontiers with foreseeable potential of long-lasting large-scale consequences (like in chemistry, biology, A.I., robotics, and space) - might not know at the time as they are in the process of playing god without telling anyone or asking for international consent or allowing a mass peer-review or global convention and deliberation phase - not unlike to how the story of the sorcerer&#39;s apprentice goes who doesn&#39;t know how to anymore rid the spirits he summoned - is that the contaminations with (already) multi-cellular microbes risks leading to a by this contamination triggered evolution of life full of dominant suffering of animal wildlife to exist far into the future as possibly billions of years lasting consequence of it, so that anyone messing with celestial bodies incapable of thinking at least that far into the future to account for astronomical scale long-term risks may miss this critical insight.<br><br>It is ironic, too, because the discovery of life by means that risk catastrophic contamination may be rewarded by the Nobel Foundation, a foundation that exists because of Nobel&#39;s wish to reward accomplishments for the betterment of life, not the worse of it. And understandably, finding extraterrestrial life would be an extraordinary discovery, and so scientists are eager to make such discovery, but aren&#39;t reasonably enough restrained in the means they consider for trying to do so, which is a dangerous conception of an incentive structure to have. One thing is for sure: Irreversible contamination of celestial bodies - if it happens - will be a major burden for thousands if not millions of future human generations to come.<br><br>Given the globally overall prevailing lack of precautions, preparedness, ethical education and conscientiousness even among scientists, it is also probably just a matter of time until someone&#39;s accident while messing with CRISPR will lead to havoc, too, just for humanity having to once more learn about a disaster after an instance of its kind already happened, but at least such a catastrophe would be on a comparably small scope.

In my life, I always see infinite sunsets, a horizon with extreme orders of magnitude in potential.<br><br>All around me, everyone just refuses or cannot see past the dark.

And I don&#39;t ever want to trivialize or infantilize the issues that appear in our world.

The belief in a humanity that wants to make a better world, a better solar system, a better universe.<br>Over years, decades, centuries. Issues of today that can span a decade, in a zoomed out view of just five hundred years, can seem like they were swatted as fast as swatting an annoying fly.<br><br>These things, they feel BIG to us, but they&#39;re SMALL comparatively.

We live in this system that prioritizes self preservation in which development is stunted despite competition due to complacency and the mentality of milking patents to the fullest. Even with the greatest minds around, they&#39;ll always be hindered by the lack of funding.

We haven&#39;t fixed the most basic of our issues, until then I don&#39;t think increasing the population will do any good and will just create a new generation for the cycle to repeat.

Extinction rates partly account for species no longer present in the fossil record but a good number of them just &quot;evolved away&quot; into new species. For the fossil record that means the branch we assign to the species dying off (because evolution works like that) but that doesn&#39;t mean a stopped continuity for that particular species. A lot of those extinct species still had living descendants in other species millions of years later. Same could happen to humans, which both resignifies the meaning of &quot;the last human&quot; (though you caught that one by using &quot;people&quot;) and could extend the initial projection of mammal species average time span. We could, in the near future, find ways to modify ourselves as a species to the point that our main branch dies off while the species evolves into something different.

Also, having the exponential system kind of makes me wonder if we really do need more for the sake of more. Humans don&#39;t really need much to get by today but it seems the media tells us otherwise by influencing us to grow for the sake of growing. Another thing to question is what happens if we just simply decided to move to a more linear or sustainment system for expanding? Would that also be a possibility still make us be extinct? The philosophy I have with the issues we have today is that we should be more balanced and linear with how we expand.

People struggle to think about the future one or two years ahead. See COVID 19. My family kept ourselves safe because we knew the entire world&#39;s scientific community was working on solving COVID 19. We knew that the longer we avoided COVID 19, the better off we were likely to be. My daughter suffered the most, but she is caught up now. She was allowed to play with one friend for a whole year. It was very hard on her. She wasn&#39;t in preschool. It was very hard on her. We hated it, but we didn&#39;t want to roll dice with so little known. Then the vaccines came. Turns out the only reason she caught covid, post vaccination is because of an idiot family member who knew they might have it and exposed my wife&#39;s dad and mother and our daughter at the same time. But my daughter had been vaxxed and we had be vaxxed. She had extremely mild symptoms and one day of harsh fatigue. We didn&#39;t isolate her of course. We all wore masks around the house, just hoping to be lucky, but lets be honest, when you&#39;re reading your kid bed time stories and she&#39;s breathing and sneezing in your face you are going to be exposed. Neither me or my wife have ever tested positive for covid and we test for the safety of others we know who are high risk.<br><br>So in the end the worst part of COVID for us, was the year of isolation. It wasn&#39;t financially hard. Some might say, &quot;see it was no big deal.&quot;  I say that it was no big deal because we made damn sure it was going to be no big deal. So many people I talked to weren&#39;t worried at all about catching it until I told them our reasoning was that the longer we could avoid it the safer we would be because treatment would get better and possibly even vaccines would be made. We were right. I changed a few minds with that logic. It goes to show just how short sighted humans can be. So many people couldn&#39;t think even two years ahead regarding COVID, a new virus that, even now, isn&#39;t well understood. It didn&#39;t require a whole lot of thought on my part.

Expanding even to different planets will likely kickstart evolution for the individuals that live in any ecosystem that is different than their &quot;earthling&quot; ancestors. Much of this change could be performed manually to quickly adapt our physical bodies to our environment. Assuming we eventually hit a computational singularity, the new race of beings that would spawn from an event like that would affect our existence as well, likely either living alongside or merging with the generations to come (partial or complete cybernetic organisms). This would also have drastic influences on our population, allowing us to effectively manufacture &quot;humans&quot; (if we have reached total cyberneticism), or to at least massively alter the lifespan of those that are already alive. That path also brings up the &quot;what is a human&quot; question.<br><br>Would love to see a video that focuses on the idea of drastic change in our biology or physical nature in regards to the definition of what a human is.

If we learn the lessons that lead to success and have the wisdom and discipline to adhere to the winning formula, a descendent of the homo sapien sapien may discover how to extend the life of the universe.

It was just stunning and fascinating to me because HIV was like a big deal of a disease and this article was basically a huge step in the direction of a \u201ecure\u201c. It fascinated me so much that I started searching and reading about it at home until I saw this wonderful and inspiring video. I just got straight goosebumps when I saw it for the first time. <br>Now I\u2018m studying molecular biotechnology and molecular medicine as a main course at university and last week I got the opportunity to work with CRISPR in the lab myself.

God loves us and wants a relationship with us. The bad news is that sin separates us from God. We have all sinned and broken God\u2019s law, sins such as lying, stealing, anger, lust, pride, fornication, abortion, dishonoring our parents, and gossip. God is Holy and Just and because of this, God cannot let sin go unpunished, and that punishment is eternal hell. We can\u2019t work our way into heaven and our good deeds can\u2019t save us from our sin. The bible says all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We need something more than our own righteousness.\r<br>\r<br>The Good news is that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. God sent his son Jesus to save his people from their sin. Jesus lived a perfect life and never sinned. He willingly went to the cross where God the Father took the wrath that was meant for his people and put it on Jesus. Jesus paid the price for their sin and died on the cross, and on the third day God raised him from the dead. Jesus overcame and defeated death. He even appeared to over 500 people at the same time after he was raised from the dead. Anyone who would put their trust in Jesus and repent of their sins, will have their sins forgiven and they too will overcome death and will receive his righteousness and eternal life. To repent means to turn away from sin, to change your mind about the sin you use to do. A change of mind will result in a change of action. Christians will struggle with sin and they won&#39;t be perfect, but they don\u2019t embrace and live in sin. When it\u2019s time to face God, God will welcome them in heaven because of Jesus\u2019s righteousness.

We see ourselves at the end of humanity because we <i>are</i> at the end of humanity, since the future is irrelevant as it doesn&#39;t exist and we are in the present in our stream of consciousness. This is why the time discount rate can be pretty steep, because delayed gratification has massively diminishing returns. The best hope, then, for long term survival, is figuring out what worked in the past and then replicating it, because old systems that stood the test of time are more useful then experiments in new and unproven ideas.

The argument so many people are using is &quot;Think of how many more people will be born now!&quot;<br>No, trillions more people will be born in the future anyway. The number one determinant of children&#39;s future life success is parental wealth. So, if 100 trillion people will be born, that means 10,000 people will stem from one person, on average. That number rises to <i>10 quintillion</i> if humans leave the solar system. So, if children aren&#39;t forced to be born into poverty, to abuse, to foster care, to teenage parents etc. <i>today; surely,</i> it&#39;d be better for all the 10,000 to 10 quintillion people that stem from that one individual to live happier, more fulfilled lives. To have children when they are actually financially, and socially ready to have children. To increase generational wealth, to reduce adverse childhood experiences. To give all those quintillions of people better lives. <br>Banning abortion is such a stupid, short-sighted, short-term idea that will only cause harm to people.<br>If that&#39;s the case, that so many people could possibly come from each person alive today. Surely, we should do everything in our power to make life better for everyone. Expand welfare and social housing. Give workers better wages, better hours, better jobs. Expand human rights, abolish poverty, promote racial harmony, stop climate change. Wars seem so silly with this perspective. Like, who even cares about a war about some tiny bit of land in the middle of nowhere. We&#39;re destined for so, so much more.

This divine cycle completes its full-circle at the end of what is known as a Kalpa, or epoch.\r<br>\r<br>Hindu mythology deals with numbers large enough to be nearly impossible to imagine. A Kalpa itself is said to be comprised of a thousand cycles of four yugas, or ages\u2014each of a different quality.\r<br>\r<br>By one estimate, a single yuga cycle is said to be 4.32 million years, and a Kalpa is said to consist of 4.32 billion years\r<br>\r<br>About the Four Yugas\r<br>The four great epochs in Hinduism are Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dwapar Yuga and Kali Yuga. Satya Yug or the Age of Truth is said to last for 4,000 divine years, Treta Yuga for 3,000, Dwapara Yug for 2,000 and Kali Yuga will last for 1,000 divine years\u2014a divine year equalling 432,000 earthly years.\r<br>\r<br>Hindu tradition holds that three of these great ages have already passed away, and we are now living in the fourth one\u2014the Kali Yuga.  It is quite hard to contemplate the meaning of the vast quantities of time expressed by the Hindu time scheme, so vast are the numbers. There are different theories about the symbolic meaning of these measurements of time.\r<br>\r<br>Symbolic Interpretations\r<br>Metaphorically, the four Yuga ages may symbolize the four phases of involution during which man gradually lost the awareness of his inner selves and subtle bodies.\r<br>\r<br>Hinduism believes that human beings have five kinds of bodies, known as annamayakosa, pranamayakosa, manomayakosa vignanamayakosa and anandamayakosa, which respectively mean the \u201cgross body,\u201d the \u201cbreath body,\u201d the \u201cpsychic body,\u201d the \u201cintelligence body,\u201d and the \u201cbliss body.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Another theory interprets these epochs of time to represent the degree of loss of righteousness in the world.\r<br>\r<br>This theory suggests that during Satya Yuga, only truth prevailed (Sanskrit Satya = truth). During the Treta Yuga, the universe lost one-fourth of the truth, Dwapar lost one-half of the truth, and now the Kali Yuga is left with only one-fourth of the truth. Evil and dishonesty have therefore gradually replaced truth in the last three ages.\r<br>\r<br>Dasavatara: The 10 Avatars\r<br>Throughout these four yugas, Lord Vishnu is said to have been incarnated ten times in ten different avatars. This principle is known as Dasavatara (Sanskrit dasa = ten). During the Age of Truth, human beings were spiritually most advanced and had great psychic powers.\r<br>\r<br>In the Treta Yuga people still remained righteous and adhered to moral ways of life. Lord Rama of the fabled Ramayana lived in Treta Yuga.\r<br>\r<br>In the Dwapara Yuga, men had lost all knowledge of the intelligence and bliss bodies. Lord Krishna was born in this age.\r<br>\r<br>The present Kali Yuga is the most degenerated of the Hindu epochs.\r<br>\r<br>Living in the Kali Yuga\r<br>We are said to presently be living in the Kali Yuga\u2014in a world infested with impurities and vices. The numbers of people possessing noble virtues are diminishing day by day. Floods and famine, war and crime, deceit, and duplicity characterize this age.\r<br>\r<br>But, say the scriptures, it is only in this age of critical troubles that final emancipation is possible.\r<br>\r<br>Kali Yuga has two phases: In the first phase, humans\u2014having lost the knowledge of the two higher selves\u2014possessed knowledge of the \u201cbreath body\u201d apart from the physical self. Now during the second phase, however, even this knowledge has deserted mankind, leaving us only with the awareness of the gross physical body. This explains why mankind is now more preoccupied with the physical self than any other aspect of existence.\r<br>\r<br>Due to our preoccupation with our physical bodies and our lower selves, and because of our emphasis on the pursuit of gross materialism, this age has been termed the Age of Darkness\u2014an age when we have lost touch with our inner selves, an age of profound ignorance.\r<br>\r<br>What the Scriptures Say\r<br>Both the two great epics\u2014The Ramayana and  Mahabharata\u2014have spoken about the Kali Yuga.\r<br>\r<br>In the Tulasi Ramayana, we find Kakbhushundi foretelling:\r<br>\r<br>In the Kali Yuga, the hotbed of sin, men and women are all steeped in unrighteousness and act contrary to the Vedas. Every virtue had been engulfed by the sins of Kali Yuga; all good books had disappeared; impostors had promulgated a number of creeds, which they had invented out of their own wit. The people had all fallen prey to delusion and all pious acts had been swallowed by greed.\r<br>\r<br>In the Mahabharata (Santi Parva) Yudhishthir says:\r<br>\r<br>\u2026 The ordinances of the Vedas disappear gradually in every successive age, the duties in the Kali age are entirely of another kind. It seems, therefore, that duties have been laid down for the respective age according to the powers of human beings in the respective ages.\r<br>\r<br>The sage Vyasa, later on, clarifies:\r<br>\r<br>In the Kali Yuga, the duties of the respective order disappear and men become afflicted by inequity.\r<br>\r<br>What Happens Next?\r<br>According to Hindu cosmology, it is predicted that at the end of the Kali Yuga, Lord Shiva will destroy the universe and the physical body will undergo a great transformation.
