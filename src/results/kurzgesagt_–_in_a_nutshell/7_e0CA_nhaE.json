They weren&#39;t telling eachother what to do, nor returning with any food from under water but rather communicated via physical symbols. Some of the gulls would just make a quick bow with their heads, or rinse their mouths in the process, as if making a recollection, accessing memories, thus not having to make the actual dive underwater itself. Obviously this saves energy. Conservation is preserved. They weren&#39;t aggressive towards the ducks, and the father out the members of the group were from the various batches of the ducks, the different their behaviour was. Some would fly in circles as if to see if other gulls found anything elsewhere, but also because they were light enough that flying was energy consuming. In general they seemed very social as no immediate aggressors were present, and though keeping a distance from people were also aware of our interaction with the ducks, but having current behaviour internet to their nature have not had the lifecycle of memory interactions required to start interacting with humans, mostly because humans find their communications loud and obnoxious, with a tendency to scare them away because of the perceived obnoxiousness, which is just a way for them to effectively interact, conjugate and sound effectively on the volumes of area occupied by them", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T21:58:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thomas aquinas", "comment_text": "One day in the distant future (at least 2 months, if not 3), Humankind might end everything.

I was in a large tent and in the surrounding fields and woods there were large numbers of fire ant colonies. For the first two months they never bothered me. I was trying to be a yogi so I didn&#39;t kill anything. I consider all life to be equal. During my third month the ants finally found out there were resources in my tent. I did everything in my power to repel them. I would succeed only for a day or two at a time and they would remount another offensive. They wore me down physically, emotionally and spiritually. I prayed to them and did everything I could possibly do that was nonviolent. Nothing worked. After using diatomaceous earth to kill large numbers of them I sat and cried over the thousands of corpses while reflecting on the parallels and similarities it had to human life.

Do they use pheromones to coordinate? <br><br>2) You mention that workers &quot;prepare for the worst&quot; by blocking entrances.  This is simply incredible behavior.

The game would have different game modes where every player plays as an insect in a shooter style game.

The ants would mainly melee but you could also spit acid.<br><br>Another game mode would be bees vs wasps. I would try to keep the game as realistic as possible, but obviously I&#39;d have to take some liberties to make the game more fun and playable. And don&#39;t worry, there wouldn&#39;t be any spiders.<br><br>Imagine the attacking team has to take over outposts (slowly capturing them when there are no enemy ants in the area). Once all outposts are captured, they can attack the main base where one player can become the Queen who has special abilites and more health. Destroying larvae would reduce the enemy team&#39;s reinforcements (like Battlefront 2017) and you win by either killing the queen, destroying the enemy base, or wiping out every enemy ant. 100 vs 100.<br><br>When you first start the game, the very first thing you saw would be an option; PG Mode, or True Nature Mode.<br><br>PG Mode would make the game more PG.<br><br>True Nature Mode would allow blood, dismemberment, and brutal takedowns and death animations.", "comment_date": "2020-09-02T23:35:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Li", "comment_text": "Who else came here after watching the weaver ant vid?", "comment_date": "2020-09-02T22:47:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Navaryn", "comment_text": "when you think about it, ants seem by far the most intelligent animal on the planet after humans.

The current queen is an ever-pregnant individual laying eggs in the dark chambers of the breeding tunnels. She is the Mother of the Hive for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that our home may never truly die.<br><br><br><br><br>Yet even in Her swollen state, the Queen continues Her lifelong duty.

Vast armies give battle in Her name on uncounted grounds. Greatest amongst Her offspring are specialized ants, the soldier ants, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the worker ants and countless colonial defence forces, the ever nurturing nursery ants and the highly productive drones to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from enemy ants, predatory arthropods, ravenous animals - and worse.<br><br><br><br><br>To be an ant in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody existence imaginable. These are the tales of those times.

Later, I observed some ants walking in the bush, I found out that a colony of smaller ants were attacking bigger ants (the colony I was studying) but they always ran when its was a single ant encountering the bigger ant.

Some men feel like their life is over when they find out another man is sleeping with his special lady... then you look at Lions... When another man comes to take your girl in the lion species, he kills you, kills all of your children, and then the mothers of those children have to breed new kids with this murderous imposer. Can you imagine that crap being normal in your human life? With us, if you git your girl stolen you sulk for a while and find the courage to go get a new girl and maybe better your life in the process. I bet lions wish they could do that instead of having half their family mauled to death.<br><br><br>Despite how deep we get into our own negative feelings, we really do have it good as far as living animals on this Earth are concerned and I feel like we forget that...

Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless colony defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanticus to name only a few.

I asked him what he was doing and he said he was watching some ants. There were a couple red ants and a couple black ants that had just crossed paths. I stayed and watched them, too. One red ant kind of \u201cmet\u201d with one of the black ants they touched feelers. Then, they went their separate ways and their buddies followed them.

War is organized group combat within the same species. The term also encapsulates a mental state of open hostility, where members go out of their way to attack the other side. This can be easily confused in ants because of superficial similarities. However, you have to remember that they are many individuals acting in unison, effectively acting as a single organism. The objective is to find food, not eradicate every member of the other ant species.<br><br>IMO, the fact that you and the researchers who vet your material confuse war with predation betrays civilization&#39;s influence on you. From the beginning, our civilization set us at odds with the world, telling us that the world was made for us, and we were made to rule it. Since nature did not willingly submit to our rule, we began doing what any ruler does to subjects that don&#39;t submit: we began conquering it. And to this day, we are still trying to conquer the world (&quot;conquering disease&quot;, &quot;conquering space&quot;, etc). Simply put, we are at war with the world.<br><br>Therefore, when we see species experiencing tactical battles similar to ours, we describe it as war. But never would we describe a pack of lions as being &quot;at war&quot; with gazelles. Both cases are simply predation, plain and simple. The similarities with our armies and fighting style are a mere coincidence.<br><br>I strongly recommend that everyone on your staff read the Ishmael series (4 small books) by Daniel Quinn.

The colours aren&#39;t accurate and the visuals are too scripted. It doesn&#39;t do justice to a well researched topic. I love the clarity and brevity of the animation, but I&#39;m afraid it takes too much away from the presentation.<br>For example, at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_e0CA_nhaE&amp;t=4m26s\">4:26</a>, I think an actual real life depiction would create a better imagery. When I search online to see the atta cephalotes, they look more threatening than the animated version.<br>At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_e0CA_nhaE&amp;t=4m48s\">4:48</a>, the nomamyrmex esenbeckii anatomy diagram is again too simplistic. It looks similar to other ants featured in the video, but in reality they look like an alien species, almost crustacean like. Perhaps in the animation/editing, we can see a side by side comparison of the real life and animated version, to get a better representation of the anatomy before isolating the specific parts in the animation.<br><br>In previous videos, your style of animated videos works well when introducing and explaining ideas that are not easily pictured/video documented. (Politics, philosophy, space, and microscopic etc.) I especially liked the recent video on the complement system because there are no actual captured pictures/videos of it, only ever done in graphics.

Another idea for this could be (if you choose to play as a queen ant) Setting up trade routes between diffrent colonies or wagin war angainst other colonies ? If you choose to play as a worker ant you get a defense construction game like dungeon keeper, builing houses etc. Playing as an soilder ant is taking control of new born at first then through defending your nest and raiding other colonies you level up and can invest in perks with upsides and downsides and the visuals of your ant should also change if you for example pick <b>better exoskeleton</b> you gain get more armor and take less damedge but you move slower or lose stamina more quicker. your ant model also get bigger and bulkier if you would choose this perk.

Seconds later I found the corpse of a dead cat(seemed fresh as no smell was coming out of it). Many ants were on it...many going in and out through the holes.I was shocked to see it and my neck accidently touched a hanging branch. Within seconds of contact 10 to 15 ants were inside my clothes biting me every place possible. I started to run out of the place in panic and pain.
