I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth.", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T20:28:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryo Making Progress", "comment_text": "For &quot;you&quot;, it&#39;s as if Kurzgesagt is another form of being that&#39;s not biological-<br><br><br><br>Wait a damn minute!", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T04:57:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mad Director TV", "comment_text": "\u201cOne creative virus is rlly all it would take...\u201d.                                       2020 - bruhhh", "comment_date": "2020-08-10T07:46:04Z", "likes_count": 104}, {"comment_by": "minhthemeowania.", "comment_text": "I like it", "comment_date": "2020-08-07T02:31:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shivam soni", "comment_text": "You&#39;re  about 6years early", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T09:32:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noah kalin", "comment_text": "Our greatest discoveries, splitting the atom and Pokemon", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T16:48:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Izaya Orihara", "comment_text": "Hey, that spaceship from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKMQzkIiB0Y&amp;t=1m21s\">1:21</a> is from a anime.

Why would any member of an advanced intraterrestrial or extraterrestrial civilization want to communicate with someone of your limited intellectual capabilities?  I am not trying to insult you.  I&#39;m just stating a fact.  You don&#39;t even know the true history of your planet, let alone how it is managed.  Furthermore, your knowledge of astronomy is based on primitive concepts which, in a few centuries, will be regarded with the same disdain as that of modern physicists who laugh at the notion that the Earth was believed to be the centre of the universe by medieval astronomers.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>THE EMERGENCE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE WAS INEVITABLE\r<br>\r<br>If a universal God exists and it created ideal conditions for life to evolve only on Earth then this God would not be very intelligent.  What intelligent God would create a fertile planet surrounded by a vast and sterile universe?  The reality of the situation is that the four known forces which govern the behaviour of matter and energy are calibrated to such a degree of perfection that it is inconceivable that they were not predetermined to create the conditions for life to appear in all its various forms throughout the universe.  Intellectually and mathematically, the postulate that life exists only on Earth is both naive and absurd.  But if intelligent extraterrestrial life exists in the Galaxy, why have they not contacted us?  Where are they located and what would they look like?  These are the questions that have always been asked by an uninformed public.  Unfortunately the people most qualified to answer these questions such as biologists, physicists, philosophers, chemists, astronomers and religious intellectuals have, for the most part, always claimed that we are alone in the Universe.  Historically they have always been wrong because they have not had access to all the information that exists on the subject which is reserved only for a minority of privileged and very powerful people in the world and unfortunately that does not include you. \r<br> \r<br>\r<br>I find it amusing that people like you don&#39;t even realize that Earth was conquered long ago and is in a region of the galaxy dominated by a species called the Alpha Draconians.  Impossible you say?  Not necessarily!  So how would a hostile species tackle the problem of dominating another species?  It is probable that the preferred method of controlling a planet for a highly intelligent and technologically advanced malevolent race of extraterrestrials would be covert infiltration rather than by obvious and violent force.  Moreover, as a general rule, one does not destroy what one can control so the most logical strategy would be to control the leadership of the planet, its political, military and economic establishments but more importantly, the secret societies, affiliations and clubs which control these establishments.  Conquering a species that doesn&#39;t know it has been conquered is the mark of superior intelligence.  Obviously some people may doubt the existence of malevolent extraterrestrials in the first place.  Why would they exist at all?  The answer is that the universe would be a much less interesting and dynamic place if various species were not pushed to their limits in order to survive and evolve.  Without conflict and struggle to survive in highly competitive environments, there would be no incentive to adapt and change.  As a consequence, the process of evolution would slow down dramatically and the plethora of unique species that exist today would also decrease significantly.  For intelligent and technological species, this eternal struggle is a philosophical one between the precepts of malevolence and benevolence.  In other words between the desire to dominate other species or being subjugated oneself.  It would also be the contrast between autocratic self-serving behaviour or believing in freedom, equality and democracy.  Ironically without the existence of emotions in many extraterrestrial species in the universe, it is doubtful that benevolent species would exist at all because if all actions and behaviour are deemed to be acceptable without limits, then the emergence of a code of ethics cannot occur.  In a certain sense, this philosophical struggle corresponds to the yin and yang in Chinese philosophy which describes how apparently opposite and contrary forces are actually complementary.  More precisely, each serves as a reference point for the other.  Fortunately the capacity for emotions such as pleasure and pain serve as a strong foundation for the emergence of a code of ethics among most intelligent species in the universe.    \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Hopefully you will now understand that the universe is teeming with life.  It has always been this way and will always be this way.  I cannot expect you to understand why these cycles are eternal because your brain is psychologically programmed to understand absolutes and quantifiable events in finite terms.  In this context the belief that the universe is approximately 13 billion years old and has boundaries is both charming and inaccurate.", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T11:32:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jean-Luc Fion", "comment_text": "All this to get to Donald Trump and reality show.", "comment_date": "2019-04-07T11:06:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hi its me ig", "comment_text": "so we are technically made of stardust?", "comment_date": "2019-04-07T10:32:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Starwolf is here", "comment_text": "Wait, so if were all related to the first living thing, does that mean were all related????", "comment_date": "2019-04-04T19:17:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julius Libongcugon", "comment_text": "Love ur videos... so nice great job\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2019-04-04T11:35:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ngan Vo Thien", "comment_text": "&quot;you&quot; is stored in the DNA", "comment_date": "2019-03-30T13:55:57Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Isaac Newton", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKMQzkIiB0Y&amp;t=0m06s\">0:06</a> hog riderrrrrr.", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T14:32:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Idunn\u30a4\u30c9\u30a5\u30f3", "comment_text": "Kurgesagt needs to explain if Non Binary is real based on science!", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T11:44:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "No name no lastname", "comment_text": "I&#39;m single and alone", "comment_date": "2019-03-26T16:15:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lee Clark", "comment_text": "Add in the multiverse concept and you are not alone for all eternity.", "comment_date": "2019-03-25T11:58:27Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "pokefriend123", "comment_text": "We are ONE", "comment_date": "2019-03-23T17:08:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "KushXO", "comment_text": "Basically we&#39;re the part of universe experiencing itself", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T11:27:13Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Arthur Lage", "comment_text": "The best channel in the youtube, thank you guys for the awesome work!", "comment_date": "2019-03-21T23:07:09Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "v4d3rm4n", "comment_text": "we are soooo metal!!!!!!!!!!  \\m/", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T23:07:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmed Elhassen", "comment_text": "Thank you for sharing this video Kurzgesagt!", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:10:28Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "xTriton", "comment_text": "Time to mine some humans..", "comment_date": "2019-03-16T07:20:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Garou", "comment_text": "The hipster couple be like: &quot;We wuz molecules before it wuz cool.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T22:50:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mythic Cryptic", "comment_text": "Whats the difference between really unlikely and impossible<br><br>Its obviously obvious", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T12:34:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sheddifying", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t invent pokemon", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T08:13:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vagabond_Shadow", "comment_text": "Everybody knows that the forming of most  atoms require extreme conditions (as in gigantic concentration of energy) .

But if we would look at our universe from a different angle, beyond our space-time continuum, from a distant perspective, it was visible that everything is simultaneously happens right now and forever. And this perspective is what can be reached trough meditation. We have to realise that we are insignificantly small as persons but infinitely, limitlessly large in our true form the cosmos. We are the universe experiencing itself from different angles.

About the Fine Tuning as the absolute proof of a Mind.<br><br><b>The fine-tuning argument</b><br><br>The argument goes like this:<br><br>The fine-tuning of the universe to support life is either due to law, chance or design<br>It is not due to law or chance<br><br>Therefore, the fine-tuning is due to design<br><br>What does it meaning to be fine-tuned for life?<br><br>Here are the facts on the fine-tuning:<br><br>Life has certain minimal requirements;<br><br>long-term stable source of energy, a large number of different chemical elements, an element that can serve as a hub for joining together other elements into compounds, etc.<br>In order to meet these minimal requirements, the physical constants, (such as the gravitational constant), and the ratios between physical constants, need to be withing a narrow range of values in order to support the minimal requirements for life of any kind.<br>Slight changes to any of the physical constants, or to the rations between the constants, will result in a universe inhospitable to life.<br><br>The range of possible ranges over 70 orders of magnitude.<br><br>The constants are selected by whoever creates the universe. They are not determined by physical laws. And the extreme probabilities involved required put the fine-tuning beyond the reach of chance.<br><br>Although each individual selection of constants and ratios is as unlikely as any other selection, the vast majority of these possibilities do not support the minimal requirements of life of any kind. (In the same way as any hand of 5 cards that is dealt is as likely as any other, but you are overwhelmingly likely NOT to get a royal flush. In our case, a royal flush is a life-permitting universe).<br><br><b>Examples of finely-tuned constants</b><br><br>Here are a couple of examples of the fine-tuning. Craig only gave one example in the debate and didn\u2019t explain how changes to the constant would affect the minimal requirements for life. But Bradley does explain it, and he is a professional research scientist, so he is speaking about things he worked in his polymer research lab. (He was the director)<br><br>a) The strong force: (the force that binds nucleons (= protons and neutrons) together in nucleus, by means of meson exchange)<br>if the strong force constant were 2% stronger, there would be no stable hydrogen, no long-lived stars, no hydrogen containing compounds. This is because the single proton in hydrogen would want to stick to something else so badly that there would be no hydrogen left!<br>if the strong force constant were 5% weaker, there would be no stable stars, few (if any) elements besides hydrogen. This is because you would be able to build up the nuclei of the heavier elements, which contain more than 1 proton.<br>So, whether you adjust the strong force up or down, you lose stars than can serve as long-term sources of stable energy, or you lose chemical diversity, which is necessary to make beings that can perform the minimal requirements of living beings. (see below)<br><br>b) The conversion of beryllium to carbon, and carbon to oxygen<br>Life requires carbon in order to serve as the hub for complex molecules, but it also requires oxygen in order to create water.<br>Carbon is like the hub wheel in a tinker toy set: you can bind other elements together to more complicated molecules (e.g. \u2013 \u201ccarbon-based life), but the bonds are not so tight that they can\u2019t be broken down again later to make something else.<br>The carbon resonance level is determined by two constants: the strong force and electromagnetic force.<br>If you mess with these forces even slightly, you either lose the carbon or the oxygen.<br>Either way, you\u2019ve got no life of any conceivable kind.<br><br><b>Is the fine-tuning real?</b><br><br>Yes, it\u2019s real and it is conceded by the top-rank of atheist physicists. Let me give you a citation from the best one of all, Martin Rees. Martin Rees is an atheist and a qualified astronomer. He wrote a book called \u201cJust Six Numbers:<br><br>The Deep Forces That Shape The Universe\u201d, (Basic Books: 2001). In it, he discusses 6 numbers that need to be fine-tuned in order to have a life-permitting universe.<br><br>Rees writes here:<br><br>These six numbers constitute a \u2018recipe\u2019 for a universe. Moreover, the outcome is sensitive to their values: if any one of them were to be \u2018untuned\u2019, there would be no stars and no life. Is this tuning just a brute fact, a coincidence?<br><br>Or is it the providence of a benign Creator?<br><br>There are some atheists who deny the fine-tuning, but these atheists are in firm opposition to the progress of science. The more science has progressed, the more constants, ratios and quantities we have discovered that need to be fine-tuned. Science is going in a theistic direction. Next, let\u2019s see how atheists try to account for the fine-tuning, on atheism.<br><br><b>Atheistic responses to the fine-tuning argument</b><br><br>There are two common responses among atheists to this argument.<br><br>The first is to speculate that there are actually an infinite number of other universes that are not fine-tuned, (i.e. \u2013 the gambler\u2019s fallacy). All these other universes don\u2019t support life. We just happen to be in the one universe is fine-tuned for life. The problem is that there is no way of directly observing these other universes and no independent evidence that they exist.<br><br>Here is an excerpt from an article in Discover magazine, (which is hostile to theism and Christianity).<br><br><a href=\"http://discovermagazine.com/2008/dec/10-sciences-alternative-to-an-intelligent-creator\">http://discovermagazine.com/2008/dec/10-sciences-alternative-to-an-intelligent-creator</a><br><br>The second response by atheists is that the human observers that exist today, 14 billion years after the universe was created out of nothing, actually caused the fine-tuning. This solution would mean that although humans did not exist at the time the of the big bang, they are going to be able to reach back in time at some point in the future and manually fine-tune the universe.<br>Here is an excerpt from and article in the New Scientist, (which is hostile to theism and Christianity).<br><br><a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026852.500-why-its-not-as-simple-as-god-vs-the-multiverse.html\">www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026852.500-why-its-not-as-simple-as-god-vs-the-multiverse.html</a><br><br>So, there are two choices for atheists. Either an infinite number of unobservable universes that are not fine-tuned, or humans go back in time at some future point and fine-tune the beginning of the universe, billions of years in the past.<br><br>That we are here by chance is meaningful. We are either here by intention or not, if not then by definition we are here by chance.<br>What we have is evidence for fine-tuning. You don\u2019t dispute that. What you dispute is what the evidence means. There are only two possibilities: chance or not chance, if not chance then we are here by intention. You have to ask yourself which of the two, given the evidence we have, is more plausible. Intention is clearly more plausible due to analogous reasoning. There is no reason to believe that fine-tuning is the result of chance. The only reason why people believe that it\u2019s just a coincidence is because they wish to believe it.<br><br>1. like causes like effects<br>2. the effect of fine-tuning is caused by intelligence<br>3. Therefore, I think there is not enough evidence to choose between chance or intelligence.", "comment_date": "2014-09-19T16:52:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Carpinteyro Elguea", "comment_text": "283\u00a0 creationists watched this video.", "comment_date": "2014-09-18T13:37:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mat Tang", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKMQzkIiB0Y&amp;t=4m22s\">4:22</a> ehehehhehe what kind of bone", "comment_date": "2014-09-18T03:20:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maybe Bearable", "comment_text": "Im loving these - i will defiantly share\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-09-16T04:05:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rad Ranger", "comment_text": "i have found the true meaning of life, now i shall evolve into a moth and begin colonizing the pluto from now on known as the planet of the moths", "comment_date": "2014-09-15T18:08:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "kitty buckley", "comment_text": "Beautiful .*_*.", "comment_date": "2014-09-14T20:21:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sceeran e", "comment_text": "...

Over time is helium pushes the hydrogen outwards. After about 10 to 15 billion years (for a sun sized star) so much helium has accumulated that the hydrogen is so far out that it can no longer fuse. When this happens small and medium stars like the sun transition to red giants and begin to die (eventually forming white dwarfs), while the largest stars continue to fuse heavier and heavier elements.
