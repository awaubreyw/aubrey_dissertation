Can&#39;t have your slave labor going blind from poor nutrition. There are places GMOs could be beneficial but there&#39;s very little research in these areas. One that comes to mind is Dexter cattle are a popular breed but they have a defect that shows up in a percentage of the calves causing leg issues. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s something that could be fixed through genetic engineering but it&#39;s cheaper to just cull the deformed calves so where are all these benefits? Even the drought tolerance is about reducing losses to increase profits. The problem is the fact it&#39;s all about profits means many things done are done inspite of environmental damage because it increases profits. Round Up Ready seeds are a prime example. The joke is the weeds have gained a resistance already, actually decades ago so they generally have to use other herbicides as well as drastically more Round Up than has been approved.

If you can answer this questions honestly and without bias I will strongly reconsider my viewpoint on GMOs and genetic engineering in general.

Larger fruits and legumes simply means more nutrients being carried up from the soil. Poor waste management means that billions of tons of food waste is never composted and never reaches the agricultural fields, and so the nutritional content of the soil drops dramatically over time. This is augmented with chemical fertilizers and other poor farming practices necessary to keep the plant production high while depleting the soil entirely of its essential microbial life and organic content. These practices will only leave us with a barren landscape as within our own lifetimes, more and more crops will begin to fail, and more genetic modification will be introduced to try and circumvent the root problems. The truth is, if the soil were healthy, much less genetic modification would be needed. Just because a fruit is larger in size, this does not translate into higher overall nutritional content, but rather into foods with lower densities of nutrients and larger volumes of sugars. This means that to get the same nutritional content from a fruit, one has to eat larger quantities, contributing to obesity and other health risks.

They were talking about apples. <br>&quot;Worse yet, it may also carry a heavier load of pesticide \r<br>residues than other conventional apples; it was produced \r<br>using a new, experimental and potentially hazardous new \r<br>genetic engineering technique; and threatens apple farm-\r<br>ers, particularly organic apple farmers. Apple growers and \r<br>consumers alike say they don\u2019t need or want this GMO. Research shows that dsRNAs from food can remain intact through the digestion process and can enter the blood-\r<br>stream and cells. Once in cells, this dsRNA can affect how \r<br>they function. It is unclear what the unintended impacts  on the cells might  be, and according to Professor Judy Car-\r<br>man, whose research \r<br>focuses on genetically modified plants, \u201cwe won&#39;t know (about \r<br>the impacts) until we do thorough \rassessments, and these assessments have not yet been done. &quot;\r<br>A problem masquerading as a solution. We also know that this apple has been engineered to \r<br>lack the natural browning enzyme that may help fight \r<br>diseases and pests, meaning farmers may have to use even sizes of apple orchards means that the risks of cross-\rpollination between GE apples and non-GMO apples \r<br>is high.25 In fact, studies show that cross-pollinating bees can travel several kilometers, and that other animals such as bats, squirrels, and birds could also spread pollen from \r<br>apple trees, and cross pollinate with crab apple trees. Farmers are also concerned that this \u201cone bad apple\u201d \r<br>could spoil the whole bunch -- harming sales here and abroad. Normally, when an apple is cut or bitten into, the ex-posed part will slowly brown. This natural browning is caused by an enzyme that produces melanin, polyphenol \r<br>oxidase, which gives cells a brown tint when exposed to oxygen. Scientists believe the browning may play an important role in helping apples to fend off pests and \r<br>disease.\r<br> The Arctic Apple\u00ae, on the other hand, was genetically engineered by the Canadian company Okanagan \r<br>Specialty Fruits to not brown for up to 15-18 days after being sliced, bruised or bitten.\r<br>How does this work? The company inserted a synthetic gene comprised of 4 natural PPO genes into an apple.\r<br>This gene is called \u201cdouble-stranded RNA,\u201d and its function is to \u201csilence\u201d the genes that govern the production of PPO. The apple\u2019s own natural defense system attacks the inserted extra foreign gene and destroys both the copy and the original gene in the process. With no genes left \r<br>to create the browning chemical, the apple does not turn brown after it has been cut, and may look fresh when it is actually decaying.<br> There are insufficient long-term studies which show that consumption of genetically engineered food is safe for humans. Given that children are amongst the most sensitive to food allergens, it is critical that the first foods children eat are shown to be safe by independent, peer reviewed, long-term safety studies.<br><br>That was the article I read on apples.

I remember seeing a video of Derek from Veritasium about someone that brought a plant (potato?) from somewhere. Because there was not enough different genes the potatos became bad and a lot of people died from it. This is a proof that things could go wrong.

People who support GMOs are so blind to reality, swapping individual genes or sequences of genes, pulling it out of one organisms DNA and then putting it into another which causes all kinds of issues. The five major genetically modified food crops are corn, cotton, soy, canola and suga beets. All of these five are engineered by a trait called Herbicide tolerance . This is where they take a gene usually from a bacteria and put it into the DNA of the plants so that the plants can be sprayed with weed killers that would normally kill them. The crops absorb the weed killer and we eat it lol. The other types of crops are the BT crops (Bacillus Thuringiensis) which is again a poison or insecticide. It breaks open the belly of insects and kills them, it comes from a natural  soil bacteria. So they take the gene out of the bacteria, put it into the DNA of corn and cotton plants, so these crops become registered pesticides lol. From the poison is a chemical called Glyphosate which actually destroys our gut bacteria. Gut bacteria is majorly important as without it our body cannot produce Tryptophan (amino acid), and without that our bodies do not produce Serotonin. Of course without Serotonin our body will struggle to regulate blood sugar and vwalaaaa.... DIABETES!!!

All they want to do is mass produce for as cheap as possible and sell. Extremely cheap highly processed foods are loaded with GMOs for a reason, GMOs could = healthier foods, &amp; more effective farming or it could = less healthy foods but more effective farming.

To be clear i have nothing against utilizing seeds of related plants that grow in the same climates to produce different effects as I see the method to be quite natural and not dangerously harmful to the environment of that native region. However, using a computer to break down and change the genetic code of any plant or food crop will have effects that will make life considerably more difficult for those who ingest it because despite whatever impression the statistical data the GMO corporations or medical business establishment give you they do not have an all-knowing or even a in-depth understanding of any form of geneology they are essentially taking shots in dark and hoping for the best and not in the name of helping anyone but simply to put a patent on something that was once free and make more money.

That&#39;s deeply concerning. Can&#39;t deny that.<br><br>I&#39;ve never been against genetic modification, but I will admit that I strayed too far into the &quot;non-gmo&quot; concept.

That second point is major, and I don&#39;t think this video touched on it well enough.

Other than that, nature provides in abundance, taking more risk for short term reward out of greed, laziness and a lack of creativity.. is exactly whats getting us into trouble, and the increasing dependence of GMO Is a perfect representation of that.", "comment_date": "2021-05-08T04:20:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Queen Rudshel", "comment_text": "So is Organic food non GMO ?", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T16:49:03Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Nick p", "comment_text": "What about glyphosate?

Even if they had the capacity and infrastructures to save their own (which is a hassle), they wouldn&#39;t be 100% sure they&#39;d get the same plants. Also Monsanto often sues farmers who save their seeds because it patents many of the varieties it develops.<br>Secondly, many farmers report insects and &quot;superweeds&quot; that have developed resistance to glyphosate, hence increasing the use of chemical pesticides. Now farmers have to rely on a suite of chemicals for weed and pest control (not as much as in conventional intensive farming, but again: Monsanto).<br>And finally, in developing countries, the golden rice outcome isn&#39;t that conclusive: farmers in SE Asia gave contrasting reports, and many of small farmers raised concerns about the costs to maintaining GMO crops hence relying on larger corporations, if not being overtaken by them altogether.

I have a bunch of reasons and if y&#39;all did research you would probably be worried too. <br>Health concerns:<br>-Toxic effects (hepatic [liver], pancreatic [pancreas], renal [kidneys], or reproductive): each insertion of a gene is random, GE food producers don&#39;t know where their gene is being inserted because they don&#39;t completely know the makeup of the food; they can&#39;t establish a &quot;safe&quot; place to insert it, so such food companies just hope that the new genetic material does not destabilize the food and make it hazardous. Each genetic insertion creates the added possibility that formerly nontoxic elements in the food could become toxic.<br>-New allergic reactions: allergies can be transfered from one food to another. If you are allergic to nuts but not soybean, and they are take DNA from a nut aand insert it into soybeans, now you are allergic to these genetically modified soybeans that are beginning to take over organic soybeans.  <br>-They use growth hormones, which have been shown to increase IGF-1, which promotes the possiblity of developing cancer.<br>-Loss of nutrition: by modifying the aliment, they alter the nutritional value of it. <br>-Antibiotic resistance: they could make disease-causing bacteria resistant to current antibiotics, resulting in a significant increase in the spread of infections and diseases in the human population.<br>-Farmers aren&#39;t forced by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration to label genetically modified food, so people eat it without knowing. <br>-Many companies never subject their genetically modified foods to mandatory government testing of any sort.<br>-Tests indicate there are harmful effects on organ development, body metabolism, and immune function.<br>Edit: for those asking for proof, this is a comment section so all the studies can\u2019t be fitted here, just go to the internet and do research on why GMOs are bad.

The problem is most of them have been conned into a cycle of purchasing round-up ready seed, fertilizer and pesticides from a handful of companies and use the soil as a SUBSTRATE instead of amending it properly to increase soil structure and OM content. They do this because the fertilizers that they use bind to other elements in the ground and are sifted out when it rains. Match that with compaction from the tractors that have to pass in the fields and the law of increasing demand for fertilizer and you have yourself a perfect recipe for disaster. <br><br>On the other hand, there have been discoveries in recent years like when they discovered the bacteria Bascillus Thurigiensis as an effective control for many pest problems, which really shows the power of good science for the economy and the environment. BT is cheap to make, has an ultra-low/non-existant toxicity for most applications and is more effective than older chemical pesticides for its designated uses. <br><br>With drones and better technology for precision agriculture, we can make the transition towards a better agricultural industry that meeds the demand for global food, that is financially sustainable for the farmer and that is environmentally sustainable for our future.

For now, though, it would be irresponsible for us to overlook GM technology based solely on unproven claims, when it can allow farmers to successfully provide for humanity as it continues to grow. <br><br>Thank you for coming to my TED talk, and I hope that life brings you all the fulfillment and joy that you deserve.", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T22:34:36Z", "likes_count": 207}, {"comment_by": "Falloutgod 47", "comment_text": "I\u2019d prefer not to have my banana filled to the brim with seeds thank you.<br><br>If you don\u2019t understand bananas that grow naturally have a shit load of seeds in them.

The BT gene is a huge advance for a plant to survive in the natural environment, because the plants carrying this gene is resistant to herbivores. If the BT gene leaked from the GMO crop to its wild relatives, the wild plant species will gain this power to poison insects. And this power will very likely to be fixed by natural selection. If this is fixed in a natural population of a plant species, this gene will be very likely moving to other populations. And this will kill a lot of insects and causing the collapse of the ecosystem by disrupting the food chain. Therefore, in fact, the technology itself is not dangerous. The dangerous thing is how to use it and where to use it. the gene flow of a plant population is one of the hardest things to control, because of the pollen. pollen can be carried away by many media, such as insects and wind. That&#39;s why regulations should be applied on the technology. Another issue is the genes used to transform a plant. If the genes used to transform the plant can have interactions with intestine cells, these genes should not be applied for the transformation process. How can they interact? at least, in insect, the digested mRNA of plant tissue eaten by insects can be directly up taken by the cells of the insect guts. These small fragments of mRNA can sometimes interact with the mRNA in the gut cells to initiate RNAi process to silent gene expression in the gut cells of insects. This can be fatal.

World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (Offender- Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity; Similar is the case of money stolen by a thief who hides the ill-gotten money and then misuses it or commits more misdeeds; \u201cwho does not owe it does not fear it\u201d. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) It is not by mere chance, mystery or savings in construction when they line the walls with lead and then put cement blocks where the X-ray machine works in hospitals or medical centers, but they do it for a cause and effect since the When lead was active it was uranium with high doses of radiation more powerful than &quot;x&quot; rays and therefore &quot;x&quot; rays do not pass through lead even though they have lost their radioactive power. 8) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth.

However there are grand food reserves that are not used for feeding, because the poor can&#39;t pay for them. <br>820 million, (approx 1 in 15) go to bed every day with a hungry stomach, and not by because they due to intermittent fasting, but because they can&#39;t make enough money to pay for food made by multinational businesses like Monsanto and other Green Revolution companies funded which now are being funded by the Gates foundation etc. .<br>And still we are thought that all is well because we are using yield as most important, main parameter for agriculture. Which has shown to be unsustainable. <br>Agriculture is meant to be tended by the communities for the the communities. Providing income for the people who tend the land. If regional farmers ,in Africa for instance, can not sell their stock because commodities like chicken and milk are being brought into the country by richer countries and sold for much lower price, these farmers have no income. A lot people are farmers in third world countries and a lot of people used to be farmers in the west. Until multinationals convinced us that they would &quot;feed the world&quot; by letting us fund their technological endeavors. Which they patented and now use to undersell literally every crop. Leading the to the classic scenario of making the rich richer and the poor poorer. The millions of euro&#39;s, pounds, dollars that go from the taxpayer to the industrial farming complex are not helping the taxpayers, as they become more dependent on a few corporations that are ruining the earths health. <br>Real agro-ecological agriculture,  is the future.

And these varieties are now a rock in the shoe for American and Mexican big corn corporations. And because of NAFTA; the usage of GMO here, is a big threat to these millenarium species.

There are quite a few examples of cases in which humans touched an element from a natural ecosystem and screwed it all up. Could it be that by eliminating plagues we are altering an ecosystem that is much more important for the health of the ground? <br><br><br>2.- There is a big technical problem. We humans, normally are very bad on predicting things even though we think we are good, and more when it&#39;s related to nature, due mainly to ego, pride or emotional problems that interfere between our discovery and our personal issues, in the same way, in century XX we started to define agriculture from the point of view of pure chemistry and thinking that a land is like a Petri dish where we can add ingredients and have plants coming out, which was a total mistake, and now we have the problem of vast sterile lands all over the world due to this horrible.<br><br><br>3.- We know that we don&#39;t know a lot of things about nature, and we don&#39;t know that we ignore a lot more facts about nature. We know for example that metabolism of cells follows a row of steps which are necessary to transform one element (let&#39;s say sun light&#39; photons) into another (let&#39;s say energy in form of ATP, in plants), and we know they are necessary to be in the way plants do it, and it&#39;s not the same to just introduce Nitrogen or Potasium in the ground as to let cells do it, because inside this long and complex metabolism there are mid steps, that produce mid products that go to other processes and follow their paths, also cells in this way have the possibility to control the speed of the transformation, etc Could it be that GMO&#39;s normal metabolism gets altered by changing a part that seemed to be independent from another process taking place inside the plant? Also we have to add to this point that I wouldn&#39;t be the first time we are not able to predict the complexity of gens expression.<br><br><br>4.- There is another point about avoiding plagues and other factors that could damage the crops and this is that you don&#39;t need a laboratory and any gen modification for that, and I actually thinks it&#39;s a bit clumsy (sorry if I offense) to look inside laboratories to find something that we have naturally inside plants, and in the knowledge of how nature does work and the connection created between organism in the ecosystems. That means that we already know that by properly mixing plants and elements with different properties let&#39;s say, by imitating the &quot;natural way&quot;, not only we don&#39;t need any external product to either fertilize or avoid plagues, but we also are contributing to the natural health and productivity of the land, just by choosing where and how to mix the elements of nature, for example mixing plants that avoid plagues, or trees that cover from wind and sun, or plants that give to the floor and the microfauna a healthy chemical reservoir, or using animals manure to enrich the earth, ...<br><br><br>I think, as you proposed, the real aim of agriculture should be to find a more efficient and healthy way to grow food as the same time it keeps a balance with the environment which should be another basic parameter to consider that a crop land is really efficient, and not only how much quantity or money comes in how much comes out.<br>Maybe we have to find a middle point between new technology and the obvious advantage that it offers and the knowledge about how natures works by its own, so we both get a productive agriculture and healthy food at the same time we regenerate or help maintain the ecosystem which is a crucial point in order to keep thriving as a specie.", "comment_date": "2020-01-07T12:15:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sandhya chowdary", "comment_text": "Keep video about BIO  weapons", "comment_date": "2020-01-07T01:44:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "emuh", "comment_text": "7k ppl who hate GMO food all together", "comment_date": "2020-01-06T23:38:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Scroogle", "comment_text": "Soil depletion.

The low number of animals had been identified as a cause for concern during the initial review process, but the <b>peer-review decisions ultimately weighed that the work still had merit despite its limitations</b> . A more in-depth look at the raw data revealed that no definitive conclusions<br> can be reached with this small sample size regarding the role of either NK603 or glyphosate in regards to overall mortality or tumor incidence.

Insect feeding opens up the plant tissue to soil or air borne diseases that can also contain carcinogens That said it is still a pesticide sprayed onto the plant tissue, so i get your point.  It is vital to have individual free choice in matters of food especially.  Choose for yourself.  Come take part in the discussion and debate that is taking off at Grow the Farm up, It is a first of its kind platform YouTube channel for food consumers to clearly communicate with food producer and utilizing the collaboration to provide the consumer with exactly what they want.  What a novel idea!  remember farmers, it is our job to provide our customer with what they want.  We need your feedback and ideas, we have learned so much in the short 3 weeks since we launched the channel, come join the discussion.  Communication between farmers (food producers) and food consumers (everyone in the world!) is rudimentary at best and non existent at worst we are decades behind communicating between consumers and producers of food.  Grow the Farm up is changing that, its time to open up a dialogue and Grow the Farm Up is the place that the discussion and debate about different farming practices, organic, conventional, NON GMO, and GMO&#39;s is taking place  Also we are discussing efficient, accurate and low cost food labeling starting from the independent seed, one of the downsides of trying to label all food supplies is it will increase the cost of food. If you start with a pure, natural and high quality seed independently owned and grown all the 2nd generation plants will be pure, natural and high quality also,  Seed Production is about 1% of all Agriculture, so labeling the seed is a much more economical and simpler way to arrive at the same result.

At the very least to say &quot;The science is in. Eating GMO plants is no more risky than their non-GMO equivalent&quot; (quote from the video) is not supported by the provided sources. <br><br><br>Here are some examples:<br><br><br>In regards to the source labeled &quot;# Are GMOs bad for your health.&quot; <br>-This article is is not about human health. It is about the effect of Genetically Engineered plants on the biodiversity of plants in general. It does not really mention humans.<br><br><br>In regards to the source labeled : &quot;GMOs are safe\u2013 various studies and reports by respected authorities: National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine.&quot;<br>-First I would it should be noted that this is not a study conducted on GE crops it is a review by a collection of experts and committees of experts about the relevant studies that have already been conducted.<br>-In Chapter 5 &quot;Human Health Effects of Genetically Engineered Crops&quot;<br>--In the introduction to this chapter the study states: <br>                    &quot;It is important to make clear that there are limits to what can be known about the health effects of any food, whether non-GE or GE. If the question asked is &quot;is it likely that eating this food today will make me sick tomorrow&quot;? researchers have methods of getting quantitative answers. However, if the question is &quot;is it likely that eating this food for many years will make me live one or a few years less than if I never eat it?&quot; the answer will be much less definitive. Researchers can provide probabilistic predictions that are based on the available information about the chemical composition of the food, epidemiological data, genetic variability across populations, and studies conducted with animals, but absolute answers are rarely available.&quot;<br>--Also in the introduction the study states:<br>                   &quot;With regard to the issue of uncertainty, it is useful to note that many of the favorable institutional statements about safety of foods from GE crops in Box 5-1 contain caveats, for example: \u201cno overt consequences,\u201d \u201cno effects on human health have been shown,\u201d \u201care not per se more risky,\u201d and \u201care not likely to present risks for human health.\u201d Scientific research can answer many questions, but absolute safety of eating specific foods and the safety of other human activities is uncertain.&quot;<br>--Also in this chapter, in the section OVERVIEW OF U.S. REGULATORY TESTING OF RISKS TO HUMAN HEALTH <br>                  &quot;FINDING: The current animal-testing protocols based on OECD guidelines for the testing of chemicals use small samples and have limited statistical power; therefore, they may not detect existing differences between GE and non-GE crops or may produce statistically significant results that are not biologically meaningful.&quot;<br><br><br>                   &quot;FINDING: In addition to experimental data, long-term data on the health and feed-conversion efficiency of livestock that span a period before and after introduction of GE crops show no adverse effects on these measures associated with introduction of GE feed. Such data test for correlations that are relevant to assessment of human health effects, but they do not examine cause and effect.&quot;<br><br><br>                   &quot;RECOMMENDATION: Before an animal test is conducted, it is important to justify the size of a difference between treatments in each measurement that will be considered biologically relevant.&quot;<br><br><br>                   &quot;RECOMMENDATION: A power analysis for each characteristic based on standard deviations in treatments in previous tests with the animal species should be done whenever possible to increase the probability of detecting differences that would be considered biologically relevant.&quot;<br><br><br>                    &quot;RECOMMENDATION: In cases in which early published studies produced equivocal results regarding health effects of a GE crop, followup experimentation using trusted research protocols, personnel, and publication outlets should be used to decrease uncertainty and increase the legitimacy of regulatory decisions.&quot;<br><br><br>                    &quot;RECOMMENDATION: Public funding in the United States should be provided for independent follow-up studies when equivocal results are found in reasonably designed initial or preliminary experimental tests.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-06-22T13:27:39Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Bern", "comment_text": "So GMOs are basically yet another tool in our belt.

One thing though, I would like to see the Abbreviations for this controversy changed, so maybe part of the argument can be put to rest.  It is my understanding that a GMO occurs naturally, not just by human intervention, like two strains of plants, one being slightly more resistant to a dung beetle or some insect that lives in it&#39;s area and likes to eat it&#39;s roots.  By natural selection (I think that&#39;s what you&#39;d call it) the one plant more resistant to the dung beetle, maybe by having a less tasty root, prevails more often, therefore it&#39;s seeds are more successful and grow larger, making more of that strain, and so on and so on.  From what I understand, that is Genetic Modification.  When a farmer from the 1700&#39;s or a modern scientist purposely mix two seeds from different strains, or changes an amino acid in a plant seed, to speed up natural selection, or by bass it all together, creating a specifically desired outcome,  would be what I consider Genetic Engineering or GEO.  Or is the farmer that is just combining seeds hoping for a better result, still just GMO, and it doesn&#39;t reach GEO until scientists change things on a molecular level?

The danger is that GMO crops are completely controlled by agro-giant Bayer, and only work when sprayed with additional pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides which are sold to farmers by Bayer alongside the GMO seeds. The GM seeds are contracted to farmers for 1 year cycles, so farmers aren&#39;t allowed to save seeds or they face legal charges. This means they have to keep buying new seeds from Bayer. The brute forth growth of plants allowed by GMO genes, and the toxic chemicals doing the job the GM plant&#39;s failing immune system can&#39;t do anymore, kills all the important life and soil and causes soils to die off over time. Crops are only as nutritious as the soil they are grown in. We are now at a point where GMO farms have such nutrient devoid soils, that GM crops often only contain 5% of certain nutrients that an organic version of that crop would contain. The pharma giant Bayer has the majority of the USA in a headlock in this way; most GM farmers soils are in such a bad state that without a complete shift to regenerative organic agriculture, they get reliant on Bayer&#39;s GM seeds and chemicals just to grow anything at all.", "comment_date": "2019-04-04T21:50:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Td l48", "comment_text": "I see people all the time nearly spend their whole paycheck on organic food and with the same amount I end up buying nearly three times as much food and have money left over.

Running around and playing god, is no good. We do not know what we are doing. Until human beings know enough about DNA and how to manipulate it. We should not be changing DNA and then using those modified organisms just because there producing more food. We ll I don&#39;t think we will have to worry about more food if most of the population cant have children anymore. Food Crises adverted. We do not know enough of the cause and effect of changing DNA, to be Mindlessly changing these plants to suit our own needs, while disregarding the fact, We didn&#39;t create DNA, We have almost no idea how DNA Really Does work, and then to be changing these plants and animals DNA, Which is completely Irreversible. Once we start changing the DNA, we cant take it back, we change the DNA of a plant, release it into the wild, then years later it has a very negative effect on the environment. Its going to be hard to just get rid of those plants. Then not to mention the GMO Plants, Mixing with the NON GMO Plants.

its such a young science. and personally i dont think we know enough about it to just use it in the amounts we do. but well it makes money. i dont think its a totally bad thing i see the benefits but can we slow down a little bit here?

The soil is dead, the renewing mechanisem starts to do it&#39;s magic to heal and protect the soil by growing weeds, now we need to get rid of weeds and we use herbicides.

Breeding worked at the same pace as normal evolution. The current and new genetic manipulation is RAPID, and because of this nature won&#39;t be able to keep up. And this could cause permanent damage to earths ecosystem. Lets say a bug that lives tree leaves. A GMO fruit tree is rolled out in California, which is incredibly resistant to this &quot;leaf mite&quot;.

Intensive farming methods are causing long term damage to our land.

They assume that illnesses caused by GMOs will be apparent as being caused by GMOs.  This is not to say there is data to show that GMOs are causing negative side effects, but to illustrate how difficult this debate is.  Medicine for example is monitored by specialists i.e. your Doctor.  If it causes a side effect it is more likely to be detected as the cause by the specialist.  Most people eating GMOs are not specialists.  Also most people do not know that they are eating GMOs, so even if they were specialists they would not know if a GMO caused the symptom or not.  In the US GMOs are not labelled and this is true for most countries that allow them.  <br><br>You rightly identified the economic issue as a major concern, but not really elaborated on this as much as I think you should.  Concerns about patent is a major issue.  Varieties bred by communities for thousands of generations, can be taken by a company, modified slightly and then patented, without any compensation to the community that originally bred in thousands of other beneficial traits.  Nor did you address the fact that GM companies have successfully sued farmers whos crops have been contaminated with GM.  Not only have these farmers lost in many cases their status as non GM but now have to pay license fee, for a product they never wanted, but was introduced by seeds being dispersed.  One famous case in Canada, where a truck with GM seeds crashed and those seeds contaminated his land where he grew plants he bred over decades, went bankrupt because of the dispute.  <br><br>You failed to discuss how farmers in India that initially bought the new BT toxin resistant cotton, saw a dramatic drop in yield of 17%, which led to large numbers of suicides, as farmers had borrowed money on the promise that it would increase yield, when really the small print always says &quot;COULD&quot;.  Reality was they were sold BT cotton designed for the US and not tested in India.  There is clearly huge scope for abuse in the system.    <br><br>There are some clear success cases for GMOs i.e. Hawaiian papaya (although not all of the papaya is GMO, so one wonders if natural selection would have done its business and we would have a GMO free papaya industry).  However, my pet hate is the golden rice example.  People are still using this as a future possible solution to a problem that has nothing to do with nutritional content with food.  There is enough food on this planet to feed an additional two billion people even now.  The solution is not GMOs, as the price of food is often controlled by governments and indeed by companies that profit from it.  The problem is distribution.  <br><br>The pretense that GMOs are offering a solution to this problem is laughable.  It is not the solution to world hunger, not even close. It is not even the solution to drought resistance, in many cases as is often spouted.  Intensive farming and in some cases even traditional farming has destroyed the land.  Other more sustainable solutions have been tested (TED talks has a great video on one of these, but dont have the link to hand) and exist.  Did you know that the record for rice production is held by a farmer in Bihar, that used a simple method of not doing intensive farming and basically spaced out his crop more (bit more complicated than that, but basically), literally quadrupled his yield.  BBC report on it somewhere.  <br><br>I could go on, but you get the point.

For example, Monsanto has a type of corn that is made to grow with an herbicide. The fields are soaked in this herbicide, and only their corn grows. This causes all of the guys in the area to go away and so Monsanto requires that their farmers plant a 10% portion of organic crops so the bugs stay, and Monsanto will sue farmers (who are paying customers) who fail to do this. This is also one of the things that harms bees. Also, terminator seeds are used in India, and indian farmers have killed them selves because they did not make a big enough profit to buy seeds again. Also, GMO food is not made to feed the world, it is made for profit. 40% of corn is for ethanol, another 36% for livestock feed. This leaves 34% to actually be eaten, and then that 34% is either exported or turned into high fructose corn syrup. Also, glyphosate is very bad for the microbiome (something kurzgesagt made a video on) and the intestinal wall. So just because it doesn&#39;t directly kill us, doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t harm you in other ways.

GMO being the new organic?!! If there is no longer organic there is no more EARTH. we will deplete water which is the most valuable substance on earth as we speak and till today we don&#39;t understand how water works. thats another topic to discuss but it seems scientist are getting dumber then consumers or they are just interested in the destruction of man or the earth. for what to make it all over again. make room for an alien that cannot live in our world unless its acidic. or turn mars into the new earth once again I don&#39;t fucking know but it is indeed pointless. wake up people this is to something you brush off. this is your neighbors live (animals who are not food) We are the aliens, we are the plague. and we are blindly promoting it with money that is just a figment of our imagination. With think we know math,.... but we do not, or shall I say we cannot because our brains are incapable. not evolved to that extent. because we don&#39;t let it evolve organically, instead genetically. we must add slowly with organic compiti\u00f3 not multiply by taking big steps. there is no short cut. Why, because if we keep looking we will eventually find something. and soon find something we are incapable of comprehending. like an equation that will take decades to solve from our mistakes. Imagine we need earth like other animals not you seems earth needs us. and if we kill us earth is doomed because we made all food chains GMO, so the world will be an odd number rather an even number. and with us, the ODDS no longer capable of solving that equation. we will replace earth. Then they all need us to produce for earth let alone animals. so we have to be the ones to start hurricanes to clean an area that needs to be. or spread water to a spot thats too dry. so on and so forth.

GMO is not a pro for this reason. agriculture is bad because it promotes competition within the owners alone not the consumers. meaning they decide what you eat, when and how now a days. the competition leads for the use of pesticides which our plants survive it but our insects do not. Didn&#39;t we already prove the insects are being immune. if we are too far into it, insects will figure out how to own our crops one day, or be like the tardigrades. also putting insects at the top of the food chain. Also does our DNA change,... so why should our foods DNA. Oh wait we are changing, we have dicks on chicks, and men who think they have muscles but its just pig and cow fat rapped around them like burritos. Then they ask how did I get cancer I don&#39;t even smoke. Even though its obvious in this day of age that cancer is produced due to your lymphatic system being clogged. Meaning the serpent is inside you. Meaning the digestive tract, your colon, your shit whole. you must fast with fruit juice for a month just to understand a little as to where cancer comes from but anyways. The world is a mathematical equation and we are taking numbers and changing them to another number that doesn&#39;t sum up to another number. Like,.... the polar bear maybe, or other extinct species. Since we are all connected hmmm I wonder if our number will have to change. Or the earths number. which bring me back to how the dinosaurs died. Not how since we know, but rather how did it lead to that. hmmm Dinos eat and shit much more then we. Predators seems to have won the fight and stole enough eggs,.....EGGS and ate enough meat,....MEAT to polite the ozone leading toooooo yeeeaaaa. So the examples don&#39;t seem to stick with humans huh. No we just want a Nobel prize and money,.... which is dead plant in hand to mentally stimulate our purpose that has no purpose. its not a health risk. its an agricultural devastation. think about it, destroy plants, to have more herd, to feed them more plants, to feed us what is obviously not food. Don&#39;t get me started with the whole B12 thing. You all practically are destroying the existence of the bacteria that gives us B12 so the knowledge also is disappearing and THAT humans is the perfect example of a cycle. Kill one piece of the puzzle and you can&#39;t finish the puzzle. so what do you do. You throw away the puzzle cuz you&#39;re missing a piece. shall we say meteor. Everything is like its own Number. If the bacteria that gives us B12 dies cuz of our wars and chemicals. Then we have to find a reason to get it. But we still need it. So we kill, we cook and we destroy. more number fall off the equation and more extinctions. less predators, more insect more chemicals. ohh but don&#39;t worry humans are happy cuz our food is shiny and are packaged nicely in alphabetical or even aliens will understand it once we allow them in with no common laws because we have no ozone layer. Why are humans more stupid then animals nowadays. Again its not the health of GMO plants is the not keeping track of the numbers that need to stay in place for the equation to always finalize correctly. Our 42 will eventually end up like mars once again. knowing the origins of mars should give you a clue! no how about dinosaurs? No! how about B12? NO! How about earthquakes and tornados and tsunamis?

The agricultural aspect is the connection between the way the eastern and western worlds farm soil without taking into consideration that soil is like a bank and that deposits of more than merely 3 to 4 elemental minerals must be made for human vertebrate health to be sustained without present chronic diseases. I hope you enjoy researching everything I said to make the video should you choose to do so. the overall conclusion behind all of this should be somewhere near the fact that the human body doesn&#39;t just need sugar, protein and vitamins and salts to be healthy, it needs elements too and preferably in colloidal form over other mediums of elemental supplementation.

You are using a direct approach and eventhough i love your videos, in this one especially (its more recognized since this is a huge debate in the last years) the approach is too shallow as to confront the insuline to GMOs. Yes scientifically they can be the exact same thing. But humans and human nature is much more complex than that. Thats why we treat them differently. Atomic fission has two sides, nuclear reactors and atomic bombs, so do you treat them as equals? Should we treat them as equals? Human race needed energy, lots of energy to expand his existence and to produce more to help other people and to defeat the enemies of human kind. Well the reasons seems innocent. We first discovered steam power. Wow a great scientific discovery. We still should be thankful for it. But, a big BUT! Eventhough it helped us alot, it also destroyed the nature in the name of progression and let the production of &quot;modern killing machines&quot; ie. weapons. Which then led to 2 World Wars. Then we discovered Atomic fussion. It could save our planet if we used it well. But no, we used it as a weapon and killed thousands and harmed millions of people. So eventhough the intention is good in a scientific discovery or scientific advancement, it doesnt mean we should accept and use it only by considering a narrow and shallow point of view and say it will do good so we should use it. No i dont accept this approach. In a discussion like this, you shouldn&#39;t only focus on the PROs, but you should focus on the CONs and risks we should face eventhough there little probability. After we know all the on the cons and risks we should face, we can make a solid decision. If not what will happen? Oh we have been there lots of times, like the examples i&#39;ve mentioned above.

Genetic altering of amino acids, means that your body will use those amino acids in them. It&#39;s not the same as free radicals. It&#39;s literally going to be absorbed by your body. It&#39;s a completely different situation. A hybrid is not a genetic modification. <br><br>Lets say there is a schematics in our body and our body uses 3d printers to build our body. The 3d printers in our body use amino acid blocks that are all different shapes and print our body all the time as it gets damaged it looks at the schematics which is DNA, it then uses the amino acid building blocks to repair our DNA and any damage done to our body. So far our body knows how to handle the ones in the natural world and hasn&#39;t had the time to understand any new amino acids done by scientists. Scientists want to mess with those blocks in which our body uses to fix us, it could get confused and use their dodgy Genetically Modified Amino Acid building blocks, in which scientists have designed to shape people in a way they want. Meaning the more people eat GMOs the more they become addicted to GMOs or worse scientists are not sure what they&#39;re doing, which is what is implied in a lot of cases they&#39;re doing trial and error, slicing DNA apart looking for clues on what does what. So that is even worse because our bodies or children might end up crippled as a result of them playing with that which our body uses to fix that which is used as a schematic of our body.

Hoping that genes mix and create something new. Which is different because nature is finding  a work around based on our tampering, not us actually tampering with genetics to create something new, in which could cause massive biological problems for us long term as our body absorbs their dodgy work, since scientists don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re doing.

What that means is, if you buy GM seeds and plant them, the seeds from your harvest are not owned by you, therefore you cannot plant them, sell them, or even keep them. If you do you would be breaking the law and could face legal action and financial ruin. Many farmers have been sued for everything they have over these issues by big business.<br><br>To make this 100 times worse the GM seeds can easily spread into farmers fields that aren&#39;t using them and that opens them up to a lawsuit that will ruin them. Think about it, if a farmer keeps the seeds from the strongest plants to use for next years crops he would unknowingly use the GM seeds because they would be bigger, stronger, and more resistant than the rest of his crop. At that point he would unknowingly put himself at the whim of a predator corporation, and these corporations are vicious and act without mercy. Wouldn&#39;t it be great if you could just sue your competition out of business? What GMOs actually are is a strategy to achieve total control of the food supply. Just think for a second, what happens when there are no more wild plants? <br><br>This doesn&#39;t just stop at plants, GM animals are owned just like GM plants. So what happens when someone makes a super breed of animal and releases it into the wild. It would easily out compete its wild counterpart, just like an invasive species, forcing it to extinction, and once that happens an entire species is now privately owned. you cannot catch it, eat it, or sell it, unless of course you pay tribute to your overlords.

Bangladesh is a particularly bad example, as reportedly, hundreds of thousands of farmers are committing suicide, often burning themselves alive, as a political statement against Monsanto, as the company&#39;s aggressively dubious business practices are often driving them into destitution. Monsanto&#39;s own stated goal is to control the entire world&#39;s agriculture, and having the entire world&#39;s food supply under the umbrella of a single corporation is a frightening thought indeed. See also the documentaries &quot;Bitter Seeds&quot; as well as some others available here on Youtube.<br><br>I agree that GMOs are going to be a requirement for humanity&#39;s continued survival - even if we somehow capped the population where it is now, there current agricultural model and output is unsustainable. Converting everything to &quot;organic farming&quot; isn&#39;t a real option, as the death toll from the increased food prices would make the environmental damage the traditional methods cause look like a cakewalk. However, the laws and regulations revolving around GMOs now are focused on maximizing exploitation and profit, not increasing the food supply.<br><br>Given that genetic engineering is eventually going to apply to humans themselves (and to some degree, already does), the simplest solution to this is to make patenting genes illegal, via global trade agreement. If we don&#39;t do this soon, we&#39;re going to have patented people walking about in the near future - generations of them. Making genes unpatentable, eliminates a great deal of the detrimental and exploitive practice companies like Monsanto practice, and would largely mitigate not only the damage they cause, but the power they acru (often used to taint the results of the very GMO safety you are claiming, if you follow some of the stories revolving around your evaluation links).<br><br>Some would argue that this would stifle genetic research, but the nice thing about new gene formulae, is you only need to create them once. Further, you&#39;d still be able to patent gene research methods, and sell that service - not to mention the government could always fund such. The potential for increased crop yields is more than enough profit motive, in and of itself. At the same time, you would have no legal justification to lay claim to someone&#39;s farmland, simply because your patented genes cross-pollinated with their crops, and other such dirty practices that ruin many lives, for the profit of a few.<br><br>I also like the fact that you apparently have a &quot;The Death of Bees&quot; video I&#39;ve yet to watch.

By altering via either hybridizing or modifying the gnome of an organic thing you are basically creating a new living thing. This introduces the unknown into our chemistry and can cause increase in cancer or a sensitivity to gluten for instance. It also alters the taste of the food. I have a few examples. Do you like bananas? Have did you eat them for the past 30 years? Did you also know they are now genetically modified? Do you know that guy that usually walks into the office with a banana in his hand and about mid day it&#39;s a gas? Well we have genetic alterations to thank for that. This new addition of a gene that had saved the plant and the banana industry causes excess gas; it shows that this product was not tested and released to generate money for the industry.<br><br>Another case is the increased gluten sensitivity. I understand many will argue with me that Hybridization is not the same as Genetic modification but in a way it is. Hybridization has been the normal process of splicing genes and this process has caused a really big issue. The new industry is causing diseases that were rare and making them common as a one dollar bill. Celiac disease cost the USA citizens 5 billion dollars and an estimated 1 in 133 Americans have this issue and to top it off are 50% more likely to have colon cancer...<br><br>GMO&#39;s need to be carefully tested against a large range of human DNA.

They essentially serve as a bandage to further enable us to become more comfortable and overly dependent on an unsustainable system. Soil nutrient density is decreasing and salinity is increasing rapidly from over-farming plots of land. Soil came about as a result of millions of years of geological activity, and it isn&#39;t something we can so easily replace.<br><br>GMOs give us the ability to teach plants to grow bigger and more colorful with higher soil salinity, and less nutrients, which as a temporary fix is great, but if the underlying issues remain unchecked... it will kill us all after some time.<br><br>In addition, each modification to a plant could present harmful effects to not only human bodies, but the entire ecosystem. Studying any one change and fully understanding its effects at large, could take more than decades of repeated research.

All of this is also causing waste from animal products production to get into our oceans causing deadzones and pollute the water and the fish we eat. Scientists also actually calculated that if we continue eating fish like we do now, the oceans will be empty in 2048. That&#39;s in 30 years. And if the oceans die, we die. It&#39;s as simple as that. This is a bigger issue than people think, but all environmental organizations ignore this because in the end they&#39;re all companies and need donations to make money and keep their business going, and many people won&#39;t donate if the companies say that what they love doing on a daily basis is wrong. (Watch Cowspiracy)<br><br>Consuming animal products also has a major impact on our health. New science actually shows us that we are naturally herbivores and not omnivores like we&#39;ve always thought. In consideration to this it&#39;s not surprising that the lifespan is actually going down and that 9 out of 10 top causes of death in the UK can be cured and prevented by living on a plant based diet, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis, Alzheimers etc. (Watch Forks over knives and What the health)<br><br>It&#39;s not surprising at all that people can get upset when they hear these facts, because they want to continue living as they always have. And I was one of those people too. I believed that humans are omnivores that need animal flesh for protein, cow&#39;s milk for calcium etc, and my mind was blown away when I found out nothing of that was true. And it&#39;s sad that people are this brainwashed, but the industries continue to do this because they don&#39;t want to lose money. Half of the money that for example the egg industries make they use to sponsor people so they will tell others &quot;what health benefits&quot; you get for example eating an egg every single day. These industries has a reason to lie, they want to make money. But vegans don&#39;t, because there aren&#39;t any big vegan industries that are able to support vegans with that much money.<br><br>But health and the environment aren&#39;t the only reasons some people want to go vegan, it&#39;s the animals too. Animals are mistreated in all the industries, and the diary industry is the worst. Watch &#39;Earthlings&#39; to see what actually happens behind those closed doors. Even if the animal has a good life and even if they would get massages every day and killed in &quot;the most humane way possible&quot;, in the end you&#39;re still killing an animal that doesn&#39;t want to die. An sentient, kind animal that did nothing wrong, that had family, friends, personality, feelings, and a will to live.<br><br>And if you are a meat-eater, I don&#39;t blame you. I don&#39;t want to be like the vegan stereotype is, angry and judging. But really the most vegans I&#39;ve met have never been angry or upset, but I totally understand why some people are because the society is so brainwashed and we don&#39;t get a chance to let people know the truth. I used to be a meat-eater and I didn&#39;t really like vegans and I didn&#39;t understand their choice. But now I do. Being vegan is not about being a weird, tree hugging hippies that wouldn&#39;t even kill a mosquito. Being vegan is about being compassionate and respectful to all living beings. You don&#39;t necessarily have to love animals to be a vegan, but you have to respect them. If someone would be standing and kicking a dog you would probably stop it. Now I&#39;m only asking you to do the same to all animals, the planet, and yourself.

Studies to identify adverse health effects of GMO have been blocked. I have wondered about attempting to live purely on a substance that has changed much faster than evolution can accommodate. The concern with heavier use of pesticides is that none of the growers will remove the pesticides from the harvest before shipping it out and what is received for food processing is mixed in so we can&#39;t remove it either, the lazy bastards. The biggest concern, and the one reason this GMO operation needs to be shut down is because they are being patented. Originally, the cross breeding concern with old growth mentioned in this video was addressed by Monsanto to remove every original plant from planet earth. Their method was to sue farmers growing the original and have their farm put out of business or forced to grow GMO . They also use this same lawsuit attempting to outlaw the original plant in that area. If Monsanto were to succeed, they would have every food production on planet earth under their patent. The GMO&#39;s designed to not produce seeds would force every farmer on planet earth to buy the seeds from Monsanto every year . We don&#39;t want to give Monsanto , or anyone, the power to decide who eats and who doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s too dangerous for anyone to have the power to sanction an entire nations food supply until they comply with anything Monsanto wants. That would make them the most definitive and dangerous dictatorship the human race has ever seen, with the power to see humanity itself to it&#39;s bitter end. Corporations have been pushing ingredients disregarding public health a long time . It&#39;s old news . It&#39;s the danger of supporting this progression. Fuck the health concerns, do you wish to implement your own enslavement ? Because gaining freedom from thiss kind of monopoly is highly unlikely. Can anyone be trusted with that kind of power? No .

Moreover, if we take GMO soy seeds of Monsanto(the highest market share holder in the seed market) they made the plant resistant to their pesticide so it only kills the weeds that grow around the plants.

The consequence of this is that if at any point we have a regret about a certain gene we have a problem : to turn back the clock you would have to check every seed of every species potentially. Every seed on the planet would have to be checked to ensure that a certain gene that we have regrets about is completely eliminated from the biosphere. In other words it&#39;s impossible to turn back.

In short, nature&#39;s mechanisms have a proven track record of yielding a working and varied ecosystem. We have only been meddling for a couple thousand years and genetics is mere decades old.

Agriculture followed by industry, etc. Yes we seem to be on a roll and going through a transformation. But that doesn&#39;t always mean that they old way of doing things was bad or worse.

A huge aspect was put aside, the impact it has on ecosistems. I saw that so let me explain why. I come from Romania, aggriculture has a great role in our economy. Since we entered the EU a couples of years ago GMOs and pesticides where used more ofthen because it was easier and you could make a lot of money. But since this happend a lot of insects and small animals have dissapeard, every year when i visit my home country i see less and less, flyes and mosqitos have mostly survived. By massivly using GMOs we kill insects plants and other animals that we dont like, the thing is we need them. This kind of problem can be solved like breeding native animals, insects and plants that protect our field from the ones we dont like.

And their track record hasn&#39;t proven harmful repeatedly down through the years?  And if they have nothing to hide, then why not allow labeling?  You see, right there is what is wrong- it should not be up to them to allow or disallow labeling, but it is.  Their gmos require more and more pesticides because the bugs become resistant.  Look at India.  Look up Richard Blaylock and why we have leaky guts now. Look up the revolving door policy and the FDA in regards to Monsanto.

However, I am trained in such a way that you should test every theory with the core foundations. And my problem is that you are saying GMO foods are not sooo bad they are even quite safe and good which by itself is disturbing conclusion. This is in direct contradiction not only with the core foundation that &quot;you should be very careful with things that are easy&quot; in regard to the &quot;easy way&quot; of doing things but also with my senses. Note that I did not use the word &quot;feelings&quot; because as Freud and his nephew Bernays proved feelings can be manipulated with ease (electing Trump is yet another milestone showing just that) and you are continuing to do so quite elegantly as the first comment suggests - very satisfying animation indeed. <br>In addition, the GMO foods are also not the &quot;natural&quot; way of breading and you and your sponsors (I can only presume) are playing God in the agriculture industry as if it is an easy peasy job to do.<br>Yes, we have come quite far as far as medicine, biology and technology goes, however, let us not fall for the teenage blooming phase trap/paradox. We do not know what are the consequences of eliminating a certain gene, we are quite new to this. The proper response is to take a step back and evaluate our advancement but not a step forward and start profiting of this new knowledge right away. You are playing with fire and you are trying to cover your initial immaturity with even bigger mistakes. However, the other core foundation that I rely on is that &quot;what comes around goes around&quot; so we will inevitably see the ultimate results as we are seeing the disturbingly negative results right now. <br>I am not saying that soon we will have three arms and a middle leg. What I am saying is that I rely on my core foundations and senses in order to see the transparency of your argument. Just a little example - take a strawberry and look at it. If I take it from the big hipper-mega-tera market in our city I will see tasteless, enormous and hairless fruit. If I take it from my garden, 100% fertilizer-free and grown in good soil and grown with my attention (conditioning) we will see better tasting, much smaller and fruit with some hairs. Furthermore, if I take it from the forest the wild strawberry has an aroma, it is melting in your mouth in a flavorful manner, a little bigger than peas and is full with hairs. <br>What I am trying to say here is that nature &quot;knows&quot; what is the right way and is doing it quite well and for quite some time now. I am trying to understand nature&#39;s way (for example with breading strawberry for private use only) and I am just staring. You on the other hand, have spent billions of other people&#39;s money, spend decades tingling with GMO foods, overpopulating the market with Monsanto flavored foods and now you are trying to tell us that everything is fine and dandy ... I say no sir.

As a personal opinion i would like to say i don&#39;t trust Monsanto and other gmo companies because of their monetary investment in their produce, modification takes a lot of time and money and if there was a potential setback or newer consideration that required a redesign of their product, then they would likely be unable fix it or execute a change it immediately due to the costs associated with it (as likely seen with the cross pollination issues), if company investing in this started genetic modification as a side project and didn&#39;t require this to be successful for continued business it then results supporting them would be a fair bit more trustworthy but there is that inheritance bias associated with them and all this could be avoided if a less complex species with shorter life cycles was selected to create a different form of food.", "comment_date": "2017-04-14T12:39:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "General Rubbish", "comment_text": "All these arguments are logically sound, but unfortunately, they&#39;re probably not going to do much to decrease the opposition towards GMOs when most of the people who oppose them are the same kind of people who think the government is putting poison into vaccines to make their kids autistic.

Unsubscribed.<br>You failed to address 3 points of valid academic criticism and you focused solely of how great GMOs are.<br>Here are the points:<br><br>1) Horizontal gene transfer between species. Your assertion that GMOs can only crossbreed with their own species has been proven false. Horizontal gene transfer between species has been proven to exist and is a major point of concern as it invalidates all forms of testing currently done on GMOs. The problem being that we only test the substantial equivalency of GMOs to normal variants of the same plant. We have absolutely no idea how the same genes will be expressed in a different plant. Normally only plant DNA gets intermixed with other plants, and that has resulted in the biosphere we know and live in today. However the results of transgenic material from other species being put into plant species for which the sequences were <b>not originally intended</b> by the researchers are not predictable. We might be able to engineer bacteria to suit our own needs basepair by basepair, but even that is not a proven technology yet, and plants are vastly more complex organisms.<br><br>2) Biosphere protection. No matter how much you try and protect non-GMO crops from intermingling with GMO crops the fact is that plant species have spread over the entire planet and without them artificially being separated will continue to do so. In other words something that has entered a biosphere is nigh impossible to remove from it. Genetic transfer is much less clean cut than the mendelian reproduction everyone learns in school, or we wouldn&#39;t have hundreds of thousands of exogenic elements (mostly from ancient retroviruses) in our very own DNA. One slip up is sufficient and we won&#39;t be able to undo it. Your argument about safety is a bit like arguments about the safety of nuclear devices. Not nuclear reactors, because currently a lot of the benefits of GMOs you listed are only hypothetical.<br><br>3) GMO research is insufficient. Not only do we not test and can in fact not test the results of a gene being transferred into another species, even the testing done on GMOs themselves is insufficient. Which, by the way, you represented as masses of research all conclusively pointing to one conclusion, even though you had to ignore internal research of the companies that have had many dead-end products that were in fact toxic to humans, which never got released to the wider public and the FDA for testing. As a relative of mine working as a molecular biologist in a company producing GMOs has attested. So GMOs being toxic is not such a theoretical impossibility as you made it seem.<br>The second point is that all these tests and research papers dealing with GMOs are focused on different varieties, and most just use the testing for substantial equivalency to ascertain that GMO crops are okay for humans to consume. The problem is that there is also some research suggesting that the conformation and the structure of nutrients and substances in food influences how the human digestive tract deals with them. This means that something consisting of completely similar amounts of the same substances could in fact have a different effect on the human body than its counterpart.<br>The third point here is that all these tests are not independent and unbiased. Firstly reviews found lots of indirect conflicts of interests with these papers, because while the researchers are not on monsanto&#39;s payroll, their position and job security would be heavily influenced should their results prove negative things about the GMOs they&#39;re testing.<br>The fourth point is that none of the tests have run continuously for the past 30 years, which they should have been would we want to draw conclusions about the long term effects of substances on humans. Who knows what trace amounts of substances those plants contain that can accumulate to large amounts over the years? We know this about traditionally mutating and growing plants, because it takes a long time of cultivation to produce radically different plants. We do not know this in the case of GMOs.<br>The fifth point in this category is that unforeseen consequences can occur with any new substance that spreads quickly across the globe. Remember when antibiotics were used universally for all sorts of things even to preempt infections? Some doctors still subscribe to that philosophy. And now look at what&#39;s going on today with more superbugs appearing. I am not saying that bugs will evolve to be resistant to pesticides produced by GMO crops, i&#39;m saying that something which initially seems all good can be a problem when overused. And as stated above, once GMOs are in the biosphere you can&#39;t really get them out again.<br>The sixth point is a bit less conventional: As much as laymen would like to believe, the scientific community is not monolithic and logical in all its ways. People leveling criticism against the currently reigning theories and widespread beliefs are laughed out of the park by their colleagues. Therefore accepting something as true, just because the &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; proclaims it to be true is moronic. You cannot say &quot;100 studies found this to be true, 2 found this to be false, therefore it is true&quot;. You have to examine the individual methodology of the papers. The point i&#39;m trying to make here is that everyone leveling criticism at GMOs is considered a pariah immediately, as no one wants to risk their tenure and respectability by associating with people not conforming to the current opinion, even if the papers are peer reviewed. Take for example a compatriot of mine Dr \u00c1rp\u00e1d Pusztai and his story. It is a similar problem to calling people unscientific or even anti-science immediately just because they voice anti-GMO sentiment. It&#39;s not that we are anti-science, it&#39;s that we are more critical of things.<br><br>For these reasons stated above being so unequivocally enthusiastic about GMOs and disregarding concerns leveled against them is dangerous.<br>This is despite the fact that i personally completely support research into genetically modified organisms, because i too believe that they might hold the key to the future. The difference being that i support research into it and not just immediately using them as soon as we have a viable &quot;largely&quot; nontoxic product.<br>If you bring the same careless attitude to all your other videos, as nicely as they are structured, and as cute as the animations are, i fear that any information i get out of them might be equally incomplete, and with a topic i know less about i might not even notice.

Many crops are already sterile and provide no seeds, and even those that aren&#39;t do not provide good quality seeds, so as a practical matter, every farmer purchases a new blob of seeds every year, end of discussion.  That&#39;s just how farming works.  About the only logical objection to that would be some sort of hypothetical post-apocalyptic ferinstance, in which case we&#39;ve already got independent activities going on to preserve seed stocks in the event of such an event.<br><br>Anything which allows for more extensive use of glyphosate (which I have always heard pronounced GLIFF-o-sate) over other herbicides is pretty much a solid win.  There are no unique disadvantages to the substance, but there are some unique advantages.  You are correct that it should not be the only method employed by farmers, but farmers tend to agree with you on that and most methodological approaches you might use to combat invasive weed species are less expensive than buying a jug of chemicals, and as such are generally tried first wherever it&#39;s a practical option.<br><br>You may or may not be aware of this, but using the terms &quot;sustainable&quot; and &quot;agriculture&quot; in the same sentence is absolutely begging for misunderstanding.  For better or worse, that compound term was long ago seized by the organic nutjobs.  While I agree that taking it back from dumb people who are using it to mean basically the opposite of what it means is a good thing, it&#39;s probably not something you can do yourself.<br><br>Bacillus thuringiensus is a touch more complicated than you let on.  First off - and this is critically important when you&#39;re talking about subjects where crazy people like to locate their woo - it is not &quot;completely harmless to humans.&quot;  Getting anything remotely wrong about this subject in a way that might be seen as beneficial to one &quot;side of the argument&quot; will automatically disqualify everything you say to some people, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s vital to precisely and specifically outline this stuff when presenting this subject.  Most strains only produce delta endotoxins (crystalline protein structures) that are indeed of no concern to mammals according to the harshest of animal studies, but some strains also produce beta endotoxins, and those ARE known to be toxic to humans.  That, of course, is why we don&#39;t actually put the bacteria itself &quot;in the plant,&quot; but instead only transfer the gene responsible for producing the delta endotoxins, thus reasonable ensuring that we get all the benefit of sprayed BT insecticide while alleviating one of the potential problems.<br><br>Fruit with higher antioxidant levels are not a concern for the vast and sweeping majority of nutritionists.  Antioxidants are an essential micronutrient, but anybody in the developed world that consumes a diet more varied than three bowls of ramen noodles a day almost certainly has no problem.  Don&#39;t buttress your information with woo - antioxidants are one of the most substantial and potentially the most damaging (studies indicate that, like with virtually everything, there is a healthful quantity of antioxidants to consume beyond which further consumption is actually deleterious to health) forms of diet nonsense on the market today.<br><br>GMO crops will never be &quot;the next organic,&quot; and that is a good thing.  Organic agriculture is a nonsense term used to describe the practice of farming deliberately utilizing only methods and resources that would have been available prior to the Green Revolution (around 1950).  It is uniformly terrible for the environment, inefficient, produces no better nutritional or health outcomes in its results, and demands more land to even attempt to deliver similar yields.  The crops themselves are basically unchanged.  Bioengineered agricultural products are detectably and demonstrably different and produce identifiable savings and advantages.

This is the main argument to put regulations on GMO&#39;s. The people who produce them keep throwing out words like &quot;science has proven it&#39;s safe&quot; and people will eat those phrases and studies as the scientific truth, but they are only true in a particular context of how the study was set up. Meanwhile, the mass population suffers from an increase in every disease known, and doctors continue to tell us they don&#39;t know what causes the increase. Until someone can figure out what causes the increases of infertility rates, increases in autism, cancer, Alzheimers, diabetes, you name it, until you can give me a scientific explanation why chronic diseases are rapidly increasing worldwide, I want to know if my food is GMO or not, the ppm of the pesticides on the food, and any other petroleum by-product in the food. This is not even factoring in the soil nutrient depletion rates, circumcision, prescriptions, vaccines etc. I don&#39;t understand why GMO proponents are not following this logical course of precaution and labeling their products appropriately? It&#39;s not that I think GMO&#39;s are going to kill me, it&#39;s that there&#39;s so many other problems that need to be resolved, and I don&#39;t have time to trust every GMO that is put out there. These companies have specifically modified with their only goal in mind of increasing yield or insect resistance. If that is their main motivation, to maximize gains or produce a substance toxic to insects, then I don&#39;t want anything to do with that particular GMO-food. On the other hand if the goal is to modify the food to maximize the nutrient contents specific to the health and well-being of the human body then I might considered their offer, but this would also require the soil to be modified organically to maximize the soil nutrients, but that costs money, and the GMO proponents are not interested in spending money, their food has to be affordable no matter what (sarcasm)!", "comment_date": "2017-04-08T06:15:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Movie- Studios", "comment_text": "this video really change my mind", "comment_date": "2017-04-08T06:01:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J D", "comment_text": "WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY.", "comment_date": "2017-04-08T05:31:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jd06", "comment_text": "@kurzegesagt<br>what about pictures of Monsanto workers wearing hazmat suits while applying the herbicides? those must be hazardous to consume at large quantities right? so why get it at all? thtats why people go to farmers markets", "comment_date": "2017-04-08T04:19:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "raskal", "comment_text": "are we allowed to not like gmo?", "comment_date": "2017-04-08T03:57:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Spathi", "comment_text": "if you haven&#39;t already, can you do a video on the causes of deja vu?", "comment_date": "2017-04-08T03:28:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Twingo Ger", "comment_text": "I remember a discussion in school back in the days when I was a kid.

I don&#39;t appose genetic engineering that will help people, but multiple studies around the world have shown that many people can get severe allergic reactions to them, and many have died. Many farms that have grown GMO crops and have had lacking crop diversity in their fields have been reported to have had major nutritional loss in their soil. Many farms around the US have been abandoned as a result, which wastes land. Alfie Preston, you made a good argument that GMO crops can become resistant to deforestation and save the Amazon. However, would it not be the abandonment of farmland due to GMOs that would result in even more people burning down the Amazon for more farmland? The problem with many of these GMOs is that they may not have verifiably been tested on humans or other organisms. In fact, a possible problem of GMOs in the future would be that they could become invasive organisms and somehow have negative implications on wildlife that we could not possibly predict. Perhaps GMOs will become a great advantage in the future when our technology will become so advanced as to predict these possible negative implications. In this era, however, we have not yet reached that level of sophisticated genetic engineering, and must treat the subject with great care and allow those who wish to avoid GMO crops for fear of those implications to avoid them by making in necessary to label GMO products on the market.

There is a consensus among most scientists that GMOs are safe. Many of them are published by academics who state that their research has not been funded in any way by the biotech industry. There is a small minority of scientists who believe GMOs can be harmful, many of which have been debunked by reputable scientists. I find it hilarious that some people can believe in climate change, which also has scientific consensus with a few dissenters, but never that GMOs are not bad for you even though it has the same level of consensus.<br><br>And natural crossbreeding is actually more dangerous than GMOs. By controlling the exact genes (and therefore the proteins that are created from those genes), scientists can prevent any side effects whereas natural crossbreeding can have unintended side effects. There have already been cases of naturally crossbred celery and potatoes that have been toxic. Also GMOs undergo much more testing than natural crossbred plants, which is why workers in California who harvested a naturally crossbred subspecies of celery ended up with severe skin rash. Or how a potato, which naturally contain toxins, had elevated levels of this toxin after natural crossbreeding.

Just look at how most GMOs are applied--to increase monocultures, force farmers into a cycle of buying the same seeds and pesticides forever, and taking out loans to do so--and its pretty obvious that GMO technology is dangerous. Maybe not by ingesting it, but through the socio-economic means of its control. You slightly touch on this in the video, but very superficially without giving us any suggestions on how to take GMO technology out of corporate hands and into the hands of small-scale farmers or non-profits.

Growing feed crops for livestock consumes 56% of water in the US. 5% of water consumed in the US is by private homes. Livestock or livestock feed occupies 1/3 of the earth\u2019s ice-free land. Livestock covers 45% of the earth\u2019s total land. Animal agriculture is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon destruction.

If they try to switch to different seeds or back to traditional farming, due to lingering contamination of previously used GMOs, farmers can and have been sued by the companies for seed copyright infringement. GMOs are life and life has a way of spreading easily. If for-profit companies didn&#39;t own and control GMOs, they could be used to help sustainable farming instead of fighting against it.

I fall somewhere in the middle, where I can absolutely see the benefits, but I&#39;m closer to the anti-gmo side of the argument. You just barely touched upon perhaps the best argument against the widespread use of GM crops: Terminator seeds and genetic drift. It truly bothers me how the scientific community brushes these things off as though they are of little to no concern and pose no threat. We can&#39;t even predict the weather accurately more than a week in advance. How can we possibly take into account the millions of variables involved in using GM crops uncontained? Even if it&#39;s not in our lifetime there&#39;s a real potential to irreparably damage our biosphere and the scientific community brushes it off.

If you know the present agricultural system is messed up, you can choose to go get some gmo crops that are grown on massive monocultrues or support as local a farmer as you can... But hey, that&#39;s just me. You say you can just wash off pesticides... No. Sorry, I&#39;m sticking to organic and growing my own food whitout toxic chemicals. <br>I&#39;m still unsure about the health benefits of gmo&#39;s. What about cattle getting sick from being fed gmo feed? You say the science is in after 30 years, but is it really? Is it just that the chemicals we spray on non-organic food is bad, and gmo&#39;s we&#39;re safe and healthy all along? I don&#39;t have the time to sift through all the research to make my own opinion, that&#39;s why I watch your videos. Are we sure that gmo&#39;s dont affect our health? The difference seems pretty big between breeding the varieties of tomatoes you like to get better fruit(hybrids) to doing gmo&#39;s but maybe that&#39;s a matter of perspective. <br>So do you think that in the future small farmers (which is one solution to industrial farms) will be utilizing gmo&#39;s? Or would we be better off to find ways to farm that don&#39;t require pesticides and gmo&#39;s where it&#39;s possible, and use gmo&#39;s where it isn&#39;t possible to farm sustainably like with the papaya example and the eggplant? I also support seed companies that save heirloom varieties, there&#39;s an argument to be made that diseases we might not even know about yet would wreak havock on certain gmo crops, and that by saving a wide diversity of seeds we would have a better chance to fight that. I also think you should give us more information on the damage pesticides do to the people and the planet... Yes, increased cancer in populations near gmo fields (because of course they&#39;re sprayed with Roundup and other pesticides and fertilizers I mean let&#39;s not dissociate the two!) Would gmo&#39;s be able to be grown without these harmful substances like Nitrogen you mentionned? The problem is the misuse of the technology, and the greed of certain companies like Monsanto.

It&#39;s definitely possible that some GMOs might be harmless in the long run, but no company would wait the time it would take to ensure they are truly safe as commercialization as soon as possible is the only reason why GMO even exists... and little matters if pesticides, herbicides include well known carcinogens banned in the resto of the world, or if any other ingredient or process will or may causes harm to humans, animals, insects or might have an adverse impact on the environment. <br><br>On a happy and positive note though...

Consuming such a product can cause permanent changes in the biology of those who consume said product, starting at the digestive level by introducing that retro-virus to the good bacteria in your digestive tract.

GMO&#39;s are predicted to be the saver of the world but when everybody needs to buy seeds from a big breeder everyyear for example these are cost calculations you don&#39;t make. Also you radically change the microsystem in the nature too, even faster than constant selection, and nature could adapt like with antibiotics and so you need a new GMO strain all over again. I mostly see bad things in GMO since world hunger is only a problem for those living in bad inviroments. If you can&#39;t survive there you should maybe settle somewhere where&#39;s plenty of food or you just die because there is none. There are natives living in dry and harsh areas since thousands of years and they manage to survive because they adapted. All different are poor people but, why should I for example donate money to dieing children in Africa when the biggest reason for their suffer is the European Colonisation and nowadays\u200b their politics?

Yes, we are making directed gene changes to plants that allow them to carry more diverse traits, but just the simple act of adding additional genes can affect viability. In other words, asking cells to carry out more jobs tends to make those cells less likely to survive or have enough energy to carry out basic tasks. Individual studies or products used in industry are able to have slightly altered activities, such as producing pesticides naturally produced by entirely different species, but combining these into a single engineered plant that can survive drastically different conditions on Mars is challenging.

(This caused the &quot;Dust Bowl&quot; years.)<br><br>If we use bacteria to introduce DNA into crops, how do we know the weeds, and other plants, won&#39;t get some of those bacteria on them and acquire the exact gene we were trying to fight them with?<br><br>We have mapped many genomes, but mostly in a general sense.\u00a0 The genome is a language that we&#39;ve only learned by &quot;seeing&quot; a gene expressed and learning the &quot;word&quot; that the gene is associated with. It&#39;s like pointing to a butterfly and saying it&#39;s blue without knowing that it &quot;reflects&quot; blue without the actual fibers &quot;being&quot; blue. How do we know where exactly the bacteria inserted the DNA into the plant?\u00a0 What if it inserted it in the &quot;middle&quot; of an existing gene (messing it up) as opposed to\u00a0inserting it &quot;between&quot; 2 genes.\u00a0 My concern here could be in the discovery of new cancers that only develop after multiple generations pass without any issue.<br><br>We need to be careful about side-effects that may take a very long time to even occur, and even longer to be discovered.\u00a0 When we first discovered radiation, we were all like &quot;lets irradiate stuff for simple\u00a0medical conditions&quot; and &quot;lets x-ray mosquito bites.&quot; We also tried separating the 2 halves of people&#39;s brains that had psychological issues (not the best ideas, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d agree.)\u00a0 It would be extremely na\u00efve of us to automatically assume that bad choices like this would never happen in the study of GMOs, so (yet again) we need to be careful about How we develop GMOs, How we spread GMO foods, and How we monitor and study the environmental and health effects (if any at all) of them.<br><br>Like everything we discover, it&#39;s amazing, just except those few % when we make an &quot;accidentally&quot; huge mistake with it.", "comment_date": "2017-03-31T06:05:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "euphospug", "comment_text": "Bonus points for CCP logo at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TmcXYp8xu4&amp;t=5m13s\">5:13</a>  - I&#39;d buy that for a dollar.", "comment_date": "2017-03-31T06:04:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "E", "comment_text": "Basically GMOs are superior plants made to avoid pests like aphids and weeds.

Also that the reason why GMOs are hurting other farmers is because Monsanto has the patents not of the GMO plant but rather to the genes of the plant meaning that cross pollination forces other non GMO farmers to give up their crops because their crops became contaminated with GMOs genes. further more thanks to GMOs the industry is pushing in to eradicate any variety of a pant and make a single crop open for consumption, the problem with this is that if a disease ever hits the plant all the plants of this kind will die due to the lack of diversity. in addition GMO plants need more water and minerals to grow since the are all jacked up on chemicals just like chickens. this causes &#39;third world&#39; countries to have droughts and dust blows do to the large consumption of minerals and water of GMO plants.", "comment_date": "2017-03-31T04:07:40Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Alvin Chan", "comment_text": "GMO=America &amp; China", "comment_date": "2017-03-31T04:07:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Khoa Nguyen", "comment_text": "you know what would be really cool. if someone made a history version of this channel with like big events in history", "comment_date": "2017-03-31T04:07:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "markx9000", "comment_text": "why does it take so long to make videos", "comment_date": "2017-03-31T04:06:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vinicius Roman", "comment_text": "I like the channel very much, but I have my doubts about GMOs.

Many of the pesticides used in large doses on GM crops are known human carcinogens.

Think of pesticides as an antibiotic, use too much, too often, on too large a scale, and you end up where we are now with superbugs resistant to most/all known antibiotics.

For example, Monsanto, an agrochemical company, has patented it&#39;s own GMO soy and corn seeds, and has a huge monopoly on these crops in North America. By planting these crops, the GMO pollens pollinates non-GMO crops owned by local and private farmers. This results in the farmers non-GMO crops to produce GMO crops. The farmers are then sued by the Corp for planting patented seeds, and without evidence to say otherwise, is put out of business the ensuing weeks and months. Another example is the use of herb-/pesticide. China being the biggest user of herb-/pesticides, unsurprisingly uses herb/-pesticides that are toxic not only to bugs and weed but to humans as well in the long term, and causes environmental damages. These herb-/pesticides are banned in many parts of the world, including here in Canada. Small time researchers that come up with safe pest-/herbicides are quickly snuffed out by companies that produces the cheaper toxic herb-/pesticides. So when these are used on herb-/pesticide resistant crops, unforeseen damages occur, such as the endangerment of bees that pollinates the majority of the world&#39;s crop supplies that feed us and the animals that we eat (applies to fake vegans).

This problem may or may not exist today, but it did when people first started modifying the genes of crops. I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t talk about it in the video.<br><br>All plants create pollen and attract insects and use the wind to move it to other plants; it&#39;s how they spread their genes. The wind and insects can carry the pollen from plant to plant, which fertilizes the eggs (seeds) of each one. Once fertilized, the seed is produced and a new plant will grow. This can happen between farms, even when they are acres apart. This is natural, and is normally good.<br>When GM plants were first mass produced, there was only one company doing it. You can actually patent the technology, so that no one else can GM their plants in exactly the same way you did to yours. This patent also extends to the crop. The patent labels all plants that carry the same genetic modifications as the patent owner&#39;s (until it&#39;s bought by a consumer, of course).<br><br>What happened was when a GM plant fertilized a non-GM plant, in the way that all plants do, it would always have the modification, even in the child plant. You see, we don&#39;t want to modify every seed, so the modifications are coded to be dominant, and therefore always inherited in the child plants. Because of the patent, if the GMO company found any plants that carried the modifications in another farm&#39;s crops, then they could legally be accused of patent violation, and could claim the entire farm. This happened numerous times, actually. Lawyers and scientists were dispatched to nearby farms to test crops for their modifications, and if even a single plant carried the modification, they claimed the farm.

With using the previous harvest&#39;s seeds a farmer could hit that, but there&#39;s no way to know. And farming is such a precarious occupation that even one really bad season can be enough to put a farm under. It&#39;s just not worth the gamble. So they just don&#39;t do it if they&#39;re smart. It has lead to the problem of monoculture crops and the loss of crop diversity, but this was a problem due to the practice I stated long before GMOs arrived on the scene. Using terminator seeds won&#39;t create any sort of problems for commercial farming AFAIK.<br><br>GMO is like any other technology. It has great promise but with potential drawbacks, some known, others unknown or only speculated on. A complete rejection of GMO is foolish and short sighted IMHO. But we do need to be cautious and resist the urge to go in blind. Good scientific methods and well thought out regulation will go a long way to mitigating any potential problems instead of an outright rejection of the technology.", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T21:50:39Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Dan R", "comment_text": "anybody else catch the bit about modified plants to be pest resistant?

GMO&#39;s are just a tool.<br>This video brings up a important question, Why is genetic modification to develop better medicines considered acceptable? Yet genetic modification of food is met with such distrust. First one misconception, If people understood that certain medicine was genetically modified, and they knew which medicine. There would be a objection to that as well.<br>Now where does all this distrust of the tool of GMO come from? Well to answer that you have to look no further than the anti-vaccine movement.<br>People do not trust the oversight that goes into the implementation of GMO&#39;s. But for medicines people generally have the notion that it that gets tested and scrutinized much more than non-medical applications. If a medicine kills or permanently impairs, maims, or otherwise damages a person, its much easier to trace back to the problem to the medicine in question. Pharmaceutical company&#39;s know this, so they are extra cautious, because they do not want the lawsuits or bad press. Even if it takes awhile for the ill or bad effects to show up. Now even with Pharmaceutical company&#39;s being cautious, deadly and damaging medication does make it into the marketplace. Granted its not common but it happens. <br><br>Now for GMO foods, people do not see the same oversight as often exists medical applications of GMO&#39;s. Plus it much harder to trace back food that makes people ill or sick. Especially if its over long term exposure. Making it harder to prove or win lawsuits.Thus insulating them from bad press, and the lawsuits.<br>Both sides of these are out to make money, and its well known if a shortcut can be gotten away with. Greed will drive corporations and people to exploit this. Its not like this has not happened before.<br><br>\u00a0<br>Essentially people have complete lack of trust in government and oversight to act in their public&#39;s best interest.

The most accurate climate change predictions regarding the relationshipp between temperature and CO2 concentration apply a dampening affect to the temperature increase, as in there is initial temperature change but it does not escalate, rather dampen for a variety of reasons. The dire prediction of 1*C change globally by 2050 (this is based on models that put an escalated affect to the concentration of X3 rather than 0.5; the latter is more accurate) doesn&#39;t seem like a worthwhile catastrophe to try and regulate Carbon emissions, especially for developing nations who have millions dying every year due to the UN blocking cheap/reliable/easy fossil fuels which these people need.

We strip all that stuff away in modern farms, then we have to add those nutrients back in with expensive chemicals. Lack of nutrients causes weak plants that are more susceptible to insects and disease so we have to modify them to resist those newer diseases. Without natural ground cover plants also dry out faster and we have to use more water and also genetically modify plants to resist dry conditions. Without that natural ground cover water evaporates rapidly since there is no barrier there any more. The newer farming practices cause many problems and the solutions may be spun as saving humanity - but we actually caused most of the problems ourselves in our own ignorance.

I agree that we all need to take the approach of food for people, not for business. I feel like crops like corn are more suitable for fuel, ethenal, alcohol, than they are for human consumption (currently). But advancements could help us in the long run, I like the idea of engineering super trees to suck up polution - that would be a game changer for Asia!

Want to know what happens to a population of say, deer that becomes overpopulated? There is a massive DECLINE in their population. Most of them die from starvation or disease because there are so many of them and not enough of anything else. Today, the human population is already overpopulated and nobody is understanding that right now, we don&#39;t have many options. We can be as careful as we want, but nothing will change if we constantly fear the future. There is no way of knowing for sure how GMO&#39;s will be effecting us 50 years into the future unless someone invents a time machine. The traditional ways of agriculture are not fast enough to keep up with us any more and we need something to help us with that. So why doesn&#39;t everyone, instead of arguing the same points back and forth and back again, start working together to come up with some sort of solution to this very real and dangerous problem. Not everyone is going to be completly satisfied with everything, but right now if we don&#39;t figure out something soon, our situation is only going to get worse.

In marketing, many producers jump to get certain types of labeling as it adds an element of trust to the consumers. But, when companies pays millions each year to stop and to hide what&#39;s in their products, then it leave the consumer wondering just what they&#39;re trying to keep from us and why. It&#39;s not unreasonable to want to know what&#39;s in the food you eat.<br><br>The argument is, &quot;you either tell us what&#39;s in your products or we won&#39;t buy them&quot;.. Ignoring us for whatever reason is one thing, but spend million each year to keep us from asking is a completely difference and unreasonable situation.<br><br>While we may believe that science is always constant, we have to understand that scientists may not be. Example, in the 70&#39;s it was widely reported that by doctors, based on scientific research that butter was bad for you and margarine was a better alternative. Today, it turns out that it is actually that margarine is more damaging that butter ever was.<br><br>My point is, not accepting research is not the same as not accepting research sponsored by companies that stand to gain from the result of that research - this is even worst when those same company lobbies politicians to help them hide the complete findings and lobbies the FDA to dismiss any concerns.<br><br>Because of these practices we end up with &quot;fruit juices&quot; that contains less than 2% of actual juice from fruits...<br><br>Take a look at what happened in the 70&#39;s also with the report in congress on sugar. You ever wonder why that &quot;sugar&quot; on the nutrition fact labeling does not carry a percentage while everything else has? Do you think that perhaps it could very well be that the amount of sugar used in today&#39;s products is way over the recommended daily dietary intake?", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T20:14:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XZenon", "comment_text": "What if we&#39;re not the pinnacle of evolution but the manifestation of evolution itself..?", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T20:13:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Podsedneck", "comment_text": "i like the subtle over 9000 reference", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T20:13:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0421\u043e\u027e\u0443 \u211b.", "comment_text": "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T20:13:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "owen", "comment_text": "this video is pro GMO", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T20:13:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "HCO420", "comment_text": "600 hours!?! with such a time I can Google learn Japanese language.", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T20:13:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Johnson", "comment_text": "It&#39;s always sad when people have developed an opinion and it doesn&#39;t matter what facts are placed in front of them.

With GMOs becoming more widely spread, other ways of genetic engineering to <b>try</b> (and I emphasize the word try) helping with our impact on the world while helping us. Out of this discussion came a new subject to scientists that was fantasy to many people of the 80s-2012, but now may become a reality within the next 100 years. You did a similar video to this before, about genetics and their benefits to us in the long run, though as said, this is a new, unexplored, and controversial subject. I say controversial due to the fact it is beyond different, and goes against many people&#39;s ethics. Within the future, modifying our bodies using gene therapy, gene splicing, other gene related substances, and/or machines will become a norm...if we don&#39;t outlaw them. The new idea is basically replacing the dog workforce within our military and police force with genetically modified humans. Now, I know what most would say, that&#39;s unethical to put humans in danger rather than dogs, but just hear me out. These genetically modified humans could serve more roles than replacing dogs or even scanning equipment. The idea itself is to drastically change a person to look, breathe, and hear differently to a Human, often taking animal characteristics, but in all reality, the cheaper option would be &quot;simple&quot; genetic changes that would change some internal things, but nothing &quot;major&quot;. This could breed entirely new species on the planet Earth, fulfilling some people&#39;s dreams of no longer being the only sentient beings on this earth, but also providing militaries with additional manpower in the form of strength enhancement, canine-like senses, or even echo-location if that&#39;s possible. Industries taking advantage of the research would eventually profit off the military (usually) at first, later the public just as the helicopter first served the military, then the public. As said, this is a controversial topic due to the fact it makes you have to make a decision on rights, freedoms, and what&#39;s ethical in all situations. What costs less, or more, what&#39;s the public outlook on isolated pockets of anthropromoprhic soldiers marching amongst regular Humans. Will religions get in the way or support it? Most of all, is that some will see Anthro-gene splicing as an inferior or superior thing, either becoming xenophobic or xenophiles to the very subject...causing outrage among citizens and  those whom volunteered/payed to be changed, no matter how drastic. Work laws over equal working rights would have to be made, the sheer amount of changes would be drastic, but (as an Anthro artist and enthusiast) it would most certainly be interesting.<br><br><br><br>Within my personal opinion, when it were guaranteed that it was to work, I would be first in line to be part of that very genetic program.

There are Some Very Valid Concerns; <br>1] Worrying That Very Few or Just One Major Corporation will Own(Patented) Just About all the GMO Plants We Grow is a Concern. And that would give them Immense Power if they Control the Food Supply around the World. It Would be Great if GMO Crops would be Developed/Funded by Non Profit Organizations or the Government or the United Nations, Point is that It should be looked at, as a Humanitarian Effort, to Help the Whole World.<br>2] It&#39;s the Whole Ownership &amp; Patenting Area Around GMO Foods Where it Falls Into a Grey Area &amp; Cause for Concern.<br>3] In Nature the Diversity of Plant Genes is what Allows them to Adapt to New Threats be it (Pest, Diseases, Climate Change, ect.), If you Geneticly Modify all the Corn and then a New Disease Pops Up that Effects All the Countrys Geneticly Modified Corn Then our Whole Food Supply Risks geting Wiped Out or Contaminated. You Run that Risk when you make Every Plant&#39;s Genetic Makeup Identical. Hence, Natural Selection doesn&#39;t Occur.  <br>4] There Needs to be Oversight and Regulations put in Place. So the Bio-Tech Company&#39;s Don&#39;t Make Sterile Seeds Just so they can Price Gouge the Farmer&#39;s every year because they hold all the Patents to all the GMO&#39;s. Thus Having a Major Monopoly on our Food. <br>5] However Unlikely There Could Potentially be Acts of Bio-Warfare where Someone Creates a Disease Aimed at our GMO crops &amp; It could Cascade Throughout the Whole Country, Killing All Crops &amp; Our Entirely Food Supply! <br>6] Most Corporation&#39;s Purposely Manufacture Inherent Design Flaws in there Product so It Won&#39;t Last Forever, So They can Sell you the Same Product Again.

I think the big thing Kurzgesagt missed can be put under &quot;the effects of the GMO industry&quot;: As I said I trust scientists on the fact that GMOs themselves aren&#39;t bad, but the whole economic thing is dreadful as big companies like Monsanto have been putting patents on life-sustaining crops for farmers in developing countries, which forces them to buy every year at a high price crops that sometimes do not reproduce and/or require the farmers to buy expensive chemicals they haven&#39;t needed before. Soon enough, the greed of these massive companies bring thousands upon thousands of farmer to debt, bankruptcy, and suicide. And even if they do not commit suicide, how fucked up is that? Even in countries as developed as France, replanting saved grain and/or exchanging grains is illegal since you don&#39;t directly buy it from &quot;state approved companies&quot;, and this can lead to enormous fines.<br>The second problem about the GMO industry is biodiversity: As crops become less of a free thing, industry-aimed farms start to engage in monoculture, which is really bad for the environment and requires even more GMO, since diverse crops defend each other. The fact that they defend each other also may mean that we do not need GMOs if we mix crops and cultivate multiple species of the same plant at the same time: Plants work like animals in that a high level of diversity makes for healthier individuals (I&#39;m not making this up, I heard and read about it a couple of times, and I wish I could give you sources in English but I don&#39;t know of any). This is not feasible in enormous farms but if we come back to a system of smaller and more local farms it totally is (and BOOM, it also creates jobs in poorly populated areas).<br><br>Ultimately I think GMOs are just an overkill and are the wrong way of dealing with our problems, we just need to rely less on industry and more on local farmers ...and free the crops! :D", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T19:18:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffman12", "comment_text": "Farms should also start expanding Up instead of Out.", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T19:17:57Z", "likes_count": 409}, {"comment_by": "awe921", "comment_text": "A new video...<br>I must watch it in glorious 60fps.", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T19:17:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bahamuttiamat", "comment_text": "If the west stops throwing away 10&#39;s of million of tons of food, then we&#39;d needn&#39;t destroy the rain forest for farming.", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T19:17:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vyllckart", "comment_text": "The onyl big reason for complaint is: gmos force you to keep buying new seeds. which is a pain in the ass......but compared to starvation...", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T19:17:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mario Knox", "comment_text": "NOT ONCE did he mention the long term effects of killing millions of insects via pesticides.

I agree completely except for one thing. You make it sound like GMOs are the only or the best way to feed humanity in the future.  It looks to me like we should first consider the effects on the environment of the things we eat. The truth is that animal agriculture is the biggest, or second biggest (depending on who you ask), emitter of green house gasses. Much of the reason why we are in this situation is because people in developed countries eat way too much meat. Cows in specific require a lot of resources to grow (2500 gallons of water are required to produce 1 pound of beef). <br><br>In my opinion, people should reduce their dependence on animal agriculture to meet their protein needs. Right now, companies like Beyond Meat are producing plant-based meats that contain as much protein as the usual animal-based meats. There are also burgers created on labs using stem cells. I feel like these efforts in reshaping the way we feed humanity are not receiving the attention they deserve. Instead we only focus on GMOs as the only solution. I don&#39;t mean to insult GMOs, I think they are great and I do believe that they&#39;ll be essential in the future, but they are not the only solution. <br><br>Please consider this and I hope that you&#39;ll make a video about this later. <br><br>Further reading: <br><a href=\"http://blog.ucsusa.org/doug-boucher/beef-and-the-paris-agreement-changing-what-we-eat-to-stop-causing-climate-change\">http://blog.ucsusa.org/doug-boucher/beef-and-the-paris-agreement-changing-what-we-eat-to-stop-causing-climate-change</a>", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T18:26:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pistatic", "comment_text": "sure do I love my Vaccinated Autistic Hawaiian Papayas :)", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T18:26:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0e56\u06e3\u06dc\u2665\u0e56\u0336tacokitten\u0e56\u0336", "comment_text": "I support GMO technology but make a personal decision not to consume GMO foods because I do not consume any synthetic herbicides or pesticides, which are inherent to many GMO plants.

Using the simple principle of &quot;the stronger survives&quot;, humanity has started its own selective breeding thousands of years ago, as said in the video. No one has ever cared about the downsides to this. But why? Because the benefits are greater than the drawbacks. An invention is always usefull when it brings more benefeits than drawbacks.<br>But selective breeding takes several generations to become better and eventually the best. So what is more efficient than selective breeding? The answer is genetic engineering. GE does the same as selective breeding, just faster and more preceise: it changes the DNA of an organism. So why should a preceise, manually controlled change of DNA be more dangerous than the attempt to change a plant by sheer luck?<br>In my opinion this whole debate about genetical modified food is unneccessary. The only problem I see are the people. People always have been afraid about what they do not understand. Maybe our current world isn&#39;t ready for big innovations, for life-changing innovations just because the majority or the people are too badly educated to understand them. Science is not a threat. Science is not our enemy. Science is what seperates the human from animals. People have to wake up and start understanding this.<br><br>Sorry for my bad english.", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T17:28:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rex", "comment_text": "science wins again", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T17:27:44Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Jeffi Q", "comment_text": "give me subs, you wont regret it", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T17:27:36Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "GianniEditsVideos", "comment_text": "I love every single video made by you guys ^^ <br>That being said can we get more astrophysics and quantum physics stuff ?

I breed those and don&#39;t allow the aggressive foxes to breed. I continue this process over multiple generations...

So, while I could create a chimera from a fox parent that is, essentially, domesticated (by removing segments of DNA that may lead to aggressive behaviour and replacing it with DNA that would induce those domesticated traits to manifest) they are not using the natural process of the &quot;insert tod A into vixen B&quot; method.<br><br>I&#39;m not one of those &quot;ALL GMOs ARE BAD MMMKAY&quot; types.

This has lead several countries in restricting GMO use based on the precautionary principle.

That wasn&#39;t even mentioned in this video. Additionally, a lot of things are possible with GMOs, which could have massive impacts on ecosystems and lower the gene pool.

I don&#39;t see the downsides not so much on health, like the video said it&#39;s more a less a modern form of traditional plant breeding, but more on the management side. <br><br>For example one problem is that GMOs are very succesfull (at least on short term) so the quickly are wide spreed and many farmers use more or less the same crops. They could for example be resisstend to an pesticide or produce it so big population of insects will die, but not all of them, some will adapte or are natural ressistant against the pesticides. They will start a new poplulation and spread rapidly with nothing to stop them or slow them, because every farmer uses the same crops. A country could loss a lot of food at once when something like this happens. <br><br>Another problem is with the golden rice kind of GMOs. They are health true, but most of the time those extra nutrients are not necessary when you have an normal diet. A few extra nutrients are usually not harmful for your body, soil they are. The plant doesn&#39;t produce those nutrients magicly out of nothing the take them from the soil and than the soil doesn&#39;t have any nutrients for the next year. You could counter that with fertilization, but that&#39;s expansive and brings a whole lot of problems with them as well, like depleting sources of phosphor or the transfer of to much fertilizers into other ecosystems like rivers and the sea where they cause problems. A better way would be a Crop rotation that also help the soil to regenerate, you get more out of the field and don&#39;t need much fertilizer.<br><br>The problems of world hunger won&#39;t be solved with GMOs, usually GMOs are standardized crops for standardized soild. But most of the world doesn&#39;t have standardized soild. You could create for each soil an own crop, but we already have tens of thousend crops which work on thos thousends of soils, so why reinventing the wheel. The real problems are on the management side, production for export and not the local people, to high meat consumption (70% of our crops go into meat production), big companies that block out small locals, food waste and loss of old knowlage of local crops and soils. <br><br>Most of my agruments are not that GMOs themselfs are bad, but the way the are used or rather the way our foodsystem functions right now and GMOs only work in this system, eventhough the become cheaper to develop a few big companies will never be able to provide some much varrity or react so fast to environmental changes like small local farmers can.", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T16:13:29Z", "likes_count": 49}, {"comment_by": "johnyjoe2k", "comment_text": "600+ Hrs?!

The food was always far nicer in taste, nutritional value, I even lost weight every time I went, possibly due to smaller portion sizes from the vegetation and animals all being closer to how they were 100+ years ago.

When you don&#39;t fully understand DNA but you&#39;re still messing with it in your food you stand a very good chance of getting what you want but also adding in weird side effects you didn&#39;t, just like with gene modification for animal and human experimentation.<br><br>BTW, the reason you need more food and have to turn to either clearing more farmland or making it work harder is all because the population got waaaaaaayyyyyy to big for its own good.

My concerns with them mostly have to do with the business element you mentioned, but also a concern about unintended environmental consequences. The environment is a really complex system, and making changes to it often results in reactions we weren&#39;t expecting. For example, (not based on a real situation, just a hypothetical) what if it turned out that the bugs that the insecticide plants killed off were important to some other part of the ecosystem and then down the road this causes another problem? Now, of course humans have been making these kinds of changes for a long time, however the difference here is how quickly the change can occur. Domesticating an animal or crop takes generations, once one of these GMOs are produced you could replace the entire crop set in a few years if everyone bought into it. So if there are potential harms to it, they could happen to quickly for us to respond to them.<br><br><br>This doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t keep developing and researching this technology, I just think it warrants additional caution/scrutiny before we actually put new untested crops into the environment.

Also, since blight wiped out nearly all American chestnut trees in the early 1900s, people have been trying to bring them back by back-breeding with the Chinese chestnut to get a gene resistant to blight.  This is a process that takes generations (of trees and humans) to get a chestnut tree that has the Chinese chestnut&#39;s resistance to blight but resembles American Chestnuts in all other ways.  Now there&#39;s a possibility of simply inserting a resistant gene and skipping the long process.  Very hopeful for bringing back a tree that is so important to American forest ecology.<br><br>On the other hand, you didn&#39;t mention several concerns people have with staple crop GMOs like corn and soybeans.  GMOs are generally expensive and quickly lose their effectiveness for the same reason simply spraying herbicides loses it&#39;s effectiveness: pesticide resistance.  American farmland is now breeding super weeds that are immune to glyphosate just like the GMO crops around them.  If you spray millions of acres a year with glyphosate, the weeds adapt or die and a lot of them are adapting.  Farmers have to spray more to keep up, and we&#39;re back on the same pesticide treadmill we were without GMOs.  And while I agree that glyphosate is much less dangerous then some things farmers can spray, there is a possible cancer risk according to the WHO, and ALL of our corn and soybeans are sprayed with it now.<br><br>The proliferation of glyphosate spraying has also directly impacted monarch butterfly numbers, since milkweed (which is the only host the larva will eat) is unfortunately not one of the plants that have developed an immunity to the constant spraying.  Other pollinators have felt the impacts as well and bee populations are crashing around the world.  I know you touched on this briefly by talking about mono-cultures, but it bears mentioning again. <br><br>As long as GMOs are used to proliferate mono-cultures, they&#39;re actually more harmful to environment (because they&#39;re so efficient) and slowly lose effectiveness over time like other pesticides.", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T15:33:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Z R", "comment_text": "i love this! thank you for reaffirming my veganism XD", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T15:33:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "axxenm", "comment_text": "wow this looks really nice at 60fps", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T15:33:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u300c Daft. \u300d", "comment_text": "This channel needs more subscribers, you all need to subscribe", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T15:33:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anish Tiwari", "comment_text": "AMAZING AS ALWAYS!", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T15:33:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KingMoni", "comment_text": "Why don&#39;t you tell people in your videos how these modifications are reflecting in a new diseases unknown to medicine and how certain GMO modifications even impact the human DNA?

The fears people have for them really should be directed at some of the current issues with our agriculture system; we use herbicides and pesticides en-masse, and as a result we have crops that are trying to absorb food from soil that is no longer nutrient-rich.  Bees find it difficult to pollinate pesticide-ridden food, and it has resulted in a significant drop in their numbers.  Alternatives that are currently being developed - &#39;organic food&#39;, for example - aren&#39;t able to feed everyone on the planet &#39;and&#39; provide space for humans to live, not to mention wildlife reserves, national parks, and other places that people want to protect.  So if we can find a way to create a type of plant that we can force pests to avoid while allowing other organisms to survive, we will have effectively found a way to kill two birds with one stone.<br><br>More importantly though, it&#39;s going to be next to impossible to produce crops or raise livestock on other planets unless we genetically modify them first.  Currently the way we have planned for food to get to Mars is by growing it there, but people on Mars are going to have health problems without a balanced diet.  Shipping meat and other goods to them will be expensive (not to mention gross, because the most efficient way to get it up there is by either freeze-drying it or liquefying it into a paste), and even if we developed rockets capable of shipping larger organisms it&#39;ll be next to impossible to send live cows, sheep, pigs, or other such animals into space.  Not to mention the fact that, unlike us humans, other animals will have a much harder time adapting to new and harsh environments, so there&#39;s no guarantee that future generations of these livestock colonists will be able to provide the food needed for growth.

One example was corn. corn use to be able to call its own resistant predators from the soil called nematodes (there are two kinds of nematodes ones that eat the roots of plant bad ones, and one that eats other insects around the roots of plants, corn was able to call for help for the latter).  Now the GMO corn relies on its own engineered pesticides BT wich has been used by plant already its a naturally occurring bacteria that plants create a symbiotic relationship with for small periods of time to help prevent bug infestation naturally  but now corn has it running in its DNA and prevents that plant to rely on any predatory insect to help it fight back disease. so corn no longer can create that relationship with nematodes and if you were to look up the soil food web wich is our current understanding of how nature creates nutrients for plants you would see nematodes are a critical component of the soil and sets the stage for a later production of nutrients. Plants that were selective for breeding were able to call and produce this kind of relationships faster and better than their previous generation. while most GMOS who have BT  kill any insect that decides to eat the plant wich, in turn, changes the way the soil functions causing us to use more synthetic salts and or stronger pesticides when they do get a virus or bug infestation. <br><br>There are already plants that fixate nitrogen from the air into the soil without us trying to engineer them there are methods of growing that help prevents a disease from spreading. one example of this was bananas they were completely wiped out from a virus due to monocropping ( growing the same plant all in one field multiple times). and so we had to engineer and breed out a new banana which we know today but we still mono-crop the plant and never diversify with the plant. creating a breeding ground for viruses to attack and now we are seeing another virus starting to take out our current banana plant. even genetic engineering won&#39;t prevent the devastation of monocropping when a virus or bug become resistant to all the pesticides that we put into our plants.<br><br>But selective breeding and nature already showed us an answer to these things you have to have a diverse plant production so when viruses and disease take place they won&#39;t be able to spread from plant to plant. you have to use plants that but nutrients back into the soil and plants that are great for disease resistance these plants call for predatory insects and bacteria or fungi to help fight the disease for all the plants they are growing close to. and we have to keep creating more desirable plants by breeding the plants together. in return, we get plants that grow bigger faster and strong but also improve the soil and relationships with its surrounding crops. <br><br>GMO doesn&#39;t understand that a plant is only one part of a system. we have to look at the fungus and bacteria and insects that rely on the plant to thrive because the plant also relies on these relationships to thrive and survive.", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T15:01:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Norbert", "comment_text": "i hope many people will see this!", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T15:01:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samuel Hvidager", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7TmcXYp8xu4?t=7m53s\">https://youtu.be/7TmcXYp8xu4?t=7m53s</a> in the video you say the world eats 11 million pounds of food everyday, you most surely mean billion because else we would basically eat nothing per human.", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T15:01:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shangori", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TmcXYp8xu4&amp;t=2m10s\">2:10</a><br>Thats because, I kid you not, these people think that the dna we eat gets incorporated into our own genetic makeup. <br><br>Let that sink in.

What would happen if some of these pests had such an evolutionary advantage that they began to swarm causing mass devastation of not just GM crops but non-GM crops as well? Imagine if 90% of our plants share a common genome, wouldn&#39;t that reduce genetic diversity to the point where a single virus could have the potential of killing the majority of all GM crops? Speaking of which, what if such a virus was engineered as a military weapon?

I believe in the technology but I am skeptical as to whether we are ready to use it.<br><br>Edit: I forgot to mention other problems as well.

On the top of that, something you didn&#39;t mention: genetic diversity. In the end of the video, you expressed the rightful hope that by embracing GMO technology we would be likely capable of fixing most of the environmental issues we&#39;ve been generating for a long time now, but there&#39;s a blindness in it that really sets me off. By introducing this kind of organisms worldwide, you are stressing another delicate equilibrium between plants and all their pathogens , between plants and plants, and between plants and insects! These are 3 fuses that would be automatically triggered by embracing such a technology and I don&#39;t see any reminder of errors being made in the past for us to follow....meaning that the first thing we, as a species, do wrong, won&#39;t be perceived as such just like has happened with many innovations we brought ourselves for a better life. You&#39;re work is amazing, I&#39;d love to see another video on this particular issue, but I&#39;ve not seen enough literature covering the argument yet, so let&#39;s be patient and participate to the great work until more questions are answered.
