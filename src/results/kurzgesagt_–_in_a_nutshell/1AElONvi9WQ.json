You need to take them all independently plus eat whole low carb foods. Vegetables, vegetables, vegetables, good fats, coconut butter, olive oil and avocado.  Low lectin foods, low oxalate foods, good protein ,free run chicken eggs, organ chicken and oily small wild fish. Mackerel, herring, sardines. ( no farmed fish) and stop eating poison like Junk foods, dead grain foods, breads, cereals, sugar,  and restaurant foods with all the food additives like msg. If you eat grains, eat gluten free ones, like quinoa, millet,buckwheat, oat groats. Be wise and take control of your health ,today. No matter where you are, you can turn things around. Exhaust your body each day , get those cells dividing and sucking up the nutrients for wellness. Drink only water and teas on your journey, you can do it.  Fast, fast, fast, eat two meals a day. I eat my first meat which usually is my super drink at around 1 pm. Then the final meal at around 5 or 6. Do not eat after 6 , no eating snacks. Dead foods inflame your body forcing your  body\u2019s to be in a constant recovery mode of controlling its ph level of 7.35.  You must keep the acid load on your body to a minimum. You can also make a super shake once a day of these potent super foods which I believe will heal all illness along with your own quantum focus through meditation and deep breathing . I take these in a shake once a day. Spirulina, a\u00e7ai berry powder, matcha tea, wheat grass, moringa powder, ginger powder, turmeric powder.  Ashwaganda and maca root powders, kelp powder, all organic.  Just a 1/4 teaspoon of each. Also eat fermented foods such as kimchi, or sauerkraut for probiotics. I put about 1/4 cup of one of these in my blender with the above every third day.  Health is a choice, choose to be healthy and vibrant. Stop your addictions and poisoning your body with foods that make you ill. I am NOT a doctor of anything and I do not own rights to any products I have mentioned. I am nobody with any medical training I am just telling you what I believe and what I do for my health. Our creator gave us all we need for wellness but man has exploited our health for money and profit. The power of the mind, foods, alkaline water and our breath is unstoppable. Remember , man gave us names like Cancer. It is the perfect name to make a lot of money. Choose names like unwell and become well.

Each cancer is different depending on where it is in the body, but they are the same across different people.. i.e. the cause for left breast cancer is the same emotion in every person. But left breast cancer and right breast cancer are slightly different emotions. <br><br>Cure for cancer: Release(feel) the emotion that is driving the cancer. Easier said than done, because the cancer usually developed BECAUSE of a life spent avoiding feeling that particular emotion in the first place. Imagine spending a lifetime avoiding one particular emotion.... only to then try and surrender to it... it takes a huge amount of humility to surrender and accept those feelings. It feels incredibly painful... lots of sadness, anger and fear usually. Though many people that go through the process feel liberated like a huge weight has been lifted, and they can feel their body starting to repair almost immediately. <br><br>Medications attack the physical cells, and are a barbaric way of shocking the cancer cells into dying off... they can help to destroy the cancer cells, but they dont cure the underlying emotional problem that caused the cancer in the first place. Sometimes people release the causal emotion during the process of having medical therapy... and this leads to recovery too, but often they dont and the cancer can, and does, return.

It is caused by what you eat. We all have cancer cells that usually remain dormant because our DNA prevents those cells from being fed what they need. I have learned about the research and stats that prove ingested animal fats and proteins create the toxins in our digestive tracts that cause cancer to thrive and spread to destroy beneficial cells in our bodies. The path of least resistance can be inherited in our DNA or can be created by other toxins that break down the dams that prevent the spread of cancer cells. It is not clear to me why our DNA can protect us for many decades or do not protect infants and young children, but feeling my symptoms disappear after about six weeks on the vegan diet allows me to firmly believe the clinical research that has proven ingested animal fats and proteins &quot;feed&quot; the cancer cells. Why would government agencies not know this? Why do they recommend we eat what actually causes our diseases? Money. Not only do people make serious incomes from the industries that provide the western diet &quot;food,&quot; but they also rake in profits from the medical industry that &quot;treats&quot; diseases along with big pharma meds. Government agencies print whatever these people want because they are paid to do so from these sponsors. Most wildlife are not affected by diseases that humans suffer and die early from because they are either born with instincts that guide them to their proper food sources or they are taught by their parents what to eat and what to avoid. When humans are involved with other animal&#39;s diets is when they too can become susceptible to diseases. Believe and eat whatever you think is best, but if you are the parent of a child who suffers from disease, I highly recommend making sure your child&#39;s diet is strictly vegan.", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T14:20:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Nielsen", "comment_text": "Whales don&#39;t smole cigarettes", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T14:01:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Black and White Roofing Inc", "comment_text": "I tried to check out the jobs section....

It&#39;s the longest living animals that need to worry about something that&#39;ll take 10 years to grow, because they might still be alive to deal with it when it starts to cause problems. Short lived animals also have faster metabolisms, because they NEED to grow fast enough to reproduce, so metabolic rate also plays a factor.

We are currently confronted with the tremendous power of cancer cells to out-evolve radiation and chemotherapy (Heng, 2019; Heng et al., 2011). Late-stage cancers remain elusive to the world&#39;s top laboratories, despite the many purported advances in the field. Even though we have spent a total of $250 billion on cancer research, the percentage of unsolved Stage 4 cases has decreased little since 1930 (Raza, 2019). What causes such lack of progress? A major cause, is that chemicals are only the physical layer of the cognitive, information-based system that is cancer. The cognition-first model suggests that the signature moment in cancer development is when cells start making evolutionary decisions of their own volition, instead of \u2018following the algorithm\u2019 based on their cell type and role. Many, perhaps all kinds of cells appear capable of autonomous behavior in certain situations (Levin, 2020a). The identity of cancer cells (Moore et al., 2017) switches from regular Turing machine [mobile, laptop computer....] to volitional Turing machine, where the term \u201cvolitional\u201d indicates it is an agent which can choose rather than just obeying its program. Parts of a larger organism defect and start optimizing for their own immor-tality. A Turing machine with agency is no longer a Turing machine;it is something new.<br><br>Cancer informatics is a decryption problem far more ambitious than Alan Turing&#39;s cracking of the German code in World War II. It is an interdisciplinary project that calls for the finest minds in the world in cryptography, oncology, evolutionary biology, semiotics and engineering \u2026 and perhaps music and psychology as well. The endless novelty of cancer is not algorithmic, it&#39;s volitional. What if we tried to solve cancer at the level of cognition, and not at the level of chemicals? Cancer is a struggle of information and intent (Levin, 2020b). If the cognition model is correct, then cancer is not strictly a genetic disease as is normally assumed. It would suggest genetics is merely a trailing indicator of the agency of cancerous cells. Preventing or arresting cancer may be a matter of persuading cancer cells to pursue different goals. Similar implications may apply to the antibiotic arms race and infectious diseases. If this is true, chemo-therapy alone can never provide a complete solution.", "comment_date": "2022-02-27T12:04:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Axolotus", "comment_text": "Fun fact: Your body produces a cancerous cell every 30 minutes and there is a chance that it won&#39;t be killed.<br><br><b>Hope you have a nice time sleeping tonight, have a lovely </b><b><i><del>possibly shortened</del></i></b><b> life.</b>", "comment_date": "2022-02-27T01:57:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Vi\u1ec7t Anh Ph\u1ea1m \u0110\u1eafc", "comment_text": "Amazing video and amazing sub\ud83c\uddfb\ud83c\uddf3", "comment_date": "2022-02-26T09:44:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zak Ch", "comment_text": "Yo mama so fat she immune to cancer", "comment_date": "2022-02-24T16:26:36Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Saltissalty", "comment_text": "Basically, cancer is the best Impostor player in the biological history.", "comment_date": "2022-02-23T06:50:27Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Matthias Scholz", "comment_text": "Hmmm - how abut stress?

Therefore I cut the bad organ, and, as for killing you, there is a method with viruses by abandoned poison more. If the organ is an irreplaceable thing, I am going to deceive it by organ transplantation. However, a soul dwells in an organ. Organ transplantation is to disturb the harmony of the soul and is to betray a fate. Seeing from the point, the Oriental medicine elucidates a cause of illness, and the cure is established, too. The cause of illness is Hindrance of the soul such as departed souls. It is the creature which the vindictive spirits such as animals killed by eating meat dwell in cancer in cellulosity, and is going to possess and kill a human being. Therefore it recurs again no matter how much I cut it. Because the macrobiotic therapy exterminates dirty blood (the meat which I ate becomes the blood) becoming the cell of cancer by not taking in animal protein, and the book of cancer disappears, cancer becomes extinct. A lymphocyte of the immune system preys on a cancer and is cured by natural healing power. I bear a grudge, and the cancer toxin stops by and occurs. A cancer-causing agent is poison, and poison reduces natural healing power. It is necessary to raise weather of splenic (when I say in Western medicine stomach) to overcome a cancer (a ginseng is effective for this). In other words, it is to bring back natural healing power. It is necessary to fix the balance of the Yin and Yang of the heart. I reinforce a weak thing, and physical spirit increase by controlling a strong thing, and it can be the mind and body which can cope with what kind of disease. Therefore important thing is to eat farm products harvested by the natural agricultural methods that are not soaked in a pesticide, a chemical fertilizer with an intake of the poison near at hand.\r<br>\r<br>\u203bThe Shinto art book that Prince Shotoku edited the Oriental medicine, predecessors in the family line past event biography of an emperor completion is the thing which is based to pass. I understand the art and need Huang Ti wisdom to pass, and to be familiar with a bare question. I accept Western lie science, and the fool who is handled as a superstition in Shinto cannot understand Sino-Japanese traditional medicine. The disease is actually caused by the spiritual power of the demon. The Oriental medicine gets over by sending this malarial air outside a body by natural healing power.\r<br>\r<br> The corona is a mere cold. You should use the Chinese medicine of the intense fever theory, but a drug to use is different in progress condition of illness. I let the sun palsy symptom (fever, sweat appearance, backwind, A pulse loosens and is soft) perspire with Keishito by a symptom when illness is contained to pass through the sun bladder of the table and get over. I cure the sun intense fever symptom, influenza (fever, adiaphoresis, chills, A pulse loosens and is obstinate) with Maoto. Therefore you must change the medicine by a symptom. The carrot is medicine letting you activate a kidney positive as for Weather of the spleen, the Processed Aconite Root. The person having a low resistance runs a fever immediately. This is because an organ weakens and becomes the immediate venereal disease of the high heat. Because diabetes is the disease that Weather of the spleen (sugar is left in the urine) weakened, I use Ninjinto. Because the chronic nephritis is the disease that a kidney positive (protein is left in the urine) weakened, I use Bushito.\r<br>\r<br> The cause of cancer is caused by eating meat, and leukemia is caused by an intake of the milk. Cancer is cured with natural healing power. The reason why a cancer occurs is that this natural healing power decreases. A cancer-causing agent is a toxin, and this toxin reduces natural healing power. You must take care of health by a meal to raise natural healing power. The meal strikes it for a small appetite on two meals of days. I stop the snack. The ingredients take only the thing made with natural agriculture. I avoid the thing which is soaked in manure, a pesticide. I take the seasonal thing. I eat brown rice. I do not eat the genetically-modified food (potato corn, soybean, grape Fructose). When I chew it well and digest it with saliva, a burden does not depend on the stomach and intestines.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\u203bThe most stupid one is a scholar of winning the Nobel Prize, and the first genius is Prince Shotoku of the medium of the wisdom that excelled in intuitive power.\r<br>\r<br> We are delivered from it from brainwashing of the science (mathematics, physics) got by a lie, and let&#39;s regain true study in our hand. \r<br> \r<br>The science is the fiction which I made because the devil denies God, and what is listed in a Japanese old legend and the Christian Bible is true. A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).\r<br> \r<br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.\r<br>\r<br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.\r<br>\r<br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.", "comment_date": "2021-12-09T23:45:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I'm Juliett", "comment_text": "A creepy and mysterious thing", "comment_date": "2021-12-09T16:41:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saviour Soul", "comment_text": "So much misinformation in this video.

Smoking is a carcinogen that can mutate or knock out the p53 gene, which edits damaged DNA to prevent cancer. I\u2019m not an expert, but what if it\u2019s simply that their p53 gene is simply better at accounting for unwanted mutations and cancerous cells which promote carcinogenesis. This is why Elephants do not get cancer. Their p53 gene is insanely strong, and is very good at fixing damaged DNA or triggering apoptosis in a cell.", "comment_date": "2021-11-21T01:13:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roee Nili", "comment_text": "On other note the bigger the animal the less he reproduced  meaning the time the cell producing is multiply by himself with giving you far larger of problems mutation over larger amount of begins that element can have one baby every 2 years minimum so on spawn of 50 years ther will be Max&#39;s of 25 more eplhent or less from same 2 of them on other side humans can have 67 while you mulpy the numbers of cells by them self the vexation of mutation that  human go on the lineage is way higher so ther more possibltys for cancer", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T21:19:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yami", "comment_text": "Wow que interesante y educativo!!!!! gracias algoritmo <br>Por cierto \u00d1", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T20:41:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tayi Fay", "comment_text": "\u0420\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440 , \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0442\u044b \u0441\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T19:59:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tayi Fay", "comment_text": "\u041a\u0438\u0442\u044b \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u0442\u044b \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u044b \u0441\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438?<br>\u0414\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0436\u0440\u0443\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0438 \u043a\u0444\u0441\u0438 \u0438 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0441\u044b\u044b , \u0438\u0434\u0438\u043e\u0442\u044b <br>\u0420\u0430\u043a \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0445\u0443\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0435\u0434\u044b", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T19:54:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BIG\u2605COCK\u2605SAGAWA", "comment_text": "\u304c\u3093\u7d30\u80de\u30ad\u30e2\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u263a\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T19:28:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adik Krymguzhin", "comment_text": "Love this channel!

For a weekend, eat nothing but drink, few times a day, some tea with lemon and a little honey, taking on these occasions a tablespoon or two of black grape seed powder.\r<br>The tea can be made using only lemons, well washed, cut into slices and squeezed in water before being boiled (enough, but not too much). Then, after it is no longer hot, sweeten with a little honey (100% natural) and add a new / fresh slice of lemon, also squeezed into the cup / glass of tea.\r<br>I make my own black grape powder at home from dried 100% organic black grape pomace, ground with a coffee grinder (the consumption of black grape powder during healthy periods of fasting, with outdoor exercise, destroys the cancer cells).\r<br>\r<br>I am sorry because many people do not know enough biology to be able to understand all the details from the correct treatment for cancer that I have explained above. Also, most people do not know that it has been proved already that the black grapes powder consumption, over the healthy fasting periods (with outdoor exercise), makes the cancer cells kill themselves.\r<br>\r<br>In addition, it seems that many people do not know the fact that, for those without very serious illnesses (in the final stage), the Covid virus infection is cured with hot teas with lemon (continuous hydration also with mineral water etc.) and aspirin (or anti-inflammatory suppositories for more serious cases), propolis... simple natural remedies (in addition to good ventilation of the rooms).

Whales and hippos do not. They get sick, they die. We get sick, we go to the doctor and they give us antibiotics or we get a surgery to remove a dying organ and we live and we then have kids who get passed our defective genes that are susceptible to disease. Huntington&#39;s, Alzheimer&#39;s, ALS are diseases that are passed down from generations. In whales they died before getting passed down. It&#39;s a terrible thing to say out loud, I know, I hesitate to even utter it in a whisper, but, what if we never had doctors? What if we eliminated children the second we discovered they had something wrong with them so they couldn&#39;t pass that down? Like Down&#39;s Syndrome? Again, I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s a horrible thing to say or to even think about, but what if? I have an eye that has always not been perfect and it needs a different prescription than my other eye which was perfect until this year when I really started needing glasses to read words up close. I&#39;m 48. My brother and 2 of my cousins from my Dad&#39;s side have the same eye issue. That&#39;s an hereditary mistake that we continue to pass down. Glasses fix it of course but now we have a whole tree of people that will have an eye issue. What if my Dad&#39;s father was eliminated as soon as they noticed he had trouble seeing? Weaker humans exist because we keep them alive and it is hurting our existence. Now think about murderers and child molesters who are born with the need to kill and go after kids? What if their ancestors had been eliminated as soon as someone noticed they liked kids the wrong way or killing things for no reason?

It is because humans are the most complex and complicated of all the Life of this world, who\u2019s true name is Eden, once known as the Garden long ago when humans actually were moving forward and so lived in harmony with the Life of this planet and themselves. As every biologist and mathematician knows complicated and complex is not superiors when it comes to Life. Humans assume they are superior so have acted under that assumption that their Life is somehow worth more than even members of their own species. No other Life does this or any of the other unnatural behaviors that the sick animal that just calls itself a human being does. <br><br>Cancer is like all of the species ever growing number of degenerative diseases of mind, heart and me least important of the three all Life use in this reality, the body. It is caused by the humans. You. Not me. Not him. Not her. Only you made the choice to accept the bearded devils answers that said they knew better than Nature. That said they have the right to use Life as if their words and definitions assign value, purpose and meaning to all Life, including yours. <br><br>Humans do not dictate the nature of this reality with their beliefs they just call scientific theories, religious faiths and philosophical laws. This is the fundamental error they have built their entire world upon. That they have looked to others instead of using their own eyes and minds shows just how sick the species have become. The same choices made over and over again to copy the biggest bearded bullies and than fight over whose copied a;swear is the best for more Gold and attention than one human can use or needs and call it a success. It is madness truly. Just as all who become sick with Evil. <br><br>A parody of what they naturally were, that is what they are. As artificial and fake as their every increasing number of cheap products. Blind to the truth that their choices are what has caused not only all their own suffering but the suffering of all the Life of this planet who doesn\u2019t need cheap products or toys to love in harmony and peace. No species needs humans, and in Truth all would benefit when they are gone. Evil never can see itself, it hides like the natural parasites and pathogens tried to show you but you won\u2019t see no, hear, no, speak no words that show you the bright mirror named Truth. <br><br>Unnatural parody of what they could have been. Truly I am embarrassed and ashamed to be associated with them. A world they call superior than nature knowing like everything else they are so proud of is a Lie. The four yahoo always manifest when Evil infects a species have been here the entire time yet they think to just call Natural. A world of opposition meaning War, Discord and Strife, Indifference and Suffering. That is the price for your greedy slothful existence. Your evil as fuck choices to accept the guesses of bearded men because they told you they were worth more. That their minds and eyes could seen more. That they could understand better than any of you.<br><br>Darwin, Moses, Plato. Doesn\u2019t matter the dogma you copied and sell back using your cheap ass personal brand called identity. Your little deck, your house of cards. Constructed from the imagined values you conditioned yourselves to copy and repeat as if they are reality, imagined values you love more than you love each other and the Life of this planet that has every bit the right, and I would say more right to live as nature not humans intended them too. <br><br>Your Life, no Life\u2019s value is for humans to decide. Especially the bearded human who is in Truth the least of the Life which is exactly why he literally made a deal with the Devil and has spent the entire time fighting a war against each other, the females, using the Life of this planet, including others of his own species trying to prove that he is large and in charge. That his bearded word dictates all of this reality and his definitions assign meaning, value and purpose to all Life including yours. <br><br>And you liked this answer and accepted one of the thousands of cheap copies of the same asshole answers. The dogma\u2019s created by the insecure males in their attempt to force a square block through a circle hole. They have fought a war against an enemy they cannot see is themselves. And they have only ended up destroying their only real value along with the females of their species. <br><br>Their answers are not wrong, they aren\u2019t right. They are evil. And evil is not part of the natural world and everything it infects becomes corrupted by it. Becomes unnatural. The unnatural version of what it was naturally because Evil thinks it decides the nature of all reality to suit itself. And all who it infects share this arrogant assumption. A proud stupid scared child\u2019s way of masking his fear and insecurity, of hiding his ignorance by claiming he knows the answers. A bully\u2019s tactic that you have all not only accepted but have copied since the very beginning. You are evil\u2019s cheap, and I mean real cheap version of what you could have been. And evil doesn\u2019t make anything better, it only makes all those it infects think they are better. And only an insecure asshole even cares about who is better than or worth more.

While a typical body cell is replaced after approximately 55 days, factors in our environment or lifestyles can increase the rate at which our cells are being damaged and replaced, which means an increased rate of new cell production, increased rate of imperfect cells (mutations) and eventually the greater rate that a defective cell passes by our detection system and is allowed to replicate, creating more imperfect copies. That is cancer. In our transition from nature to our current society, we have developed habits such as tanning, using tobacco, consuming alcohol, working with chemicals, exposing our lungs to smoke, altering our diets, increasing our stress, and myriad other habits that damage our cells and speed up the rate of cell death and cell replacement.  In contrast, blue whales and other large animals are not exposed to elements that they did not evolve and adapt to. Their stressors are mainly natural. They tend to die from getting eaten by predators or they die of starvation. It&#39;s not rocket science.<br><br>What is also important to realize is that cancer isn&#39;t some bizarre alien that gets into your body. At the earliest stages of embryonic development, we start as a group of undifferentiated cells that grow rapidly. Once our DNA blueprint takes over, cells only grow of certain types (bone, skin, hair, muscle, etc.) and location and obey Contact Inhibition, which means 1) you will only grow skin cells where skin cells are required and 2) if a cell is surrounded by other cells, it will not produce new cells. With cancer cells, the contact inhibition switch is sometimes turned off, which is why they develop into tumors.  Also, every cell in your body requires nutrients, so your circulatory system will naturally develop the arteries and capillaries to supply oxygen and food to all of your cells. Your body sees cancer cells as a part of you, so once a tumor reaches approx 1 cm in size, it is able to send a chemical signal to your body and your body will make sure it has access to the circulatory system. At this point, the tumor may then send its new cells off into your blood system and those cells may make their way to other parts of your body and settle down to make new tumors.

When we hyperventilate (breathe more than the medical norm), we cannot improve oxygen content in the hemoglobin of the arterial blood (red blood cells are about 98% saturated with oxygen during tiny normal breathing).<br><br>2. Overbreathing reduces the CO2 concentration in the arterial blood causing a constriction of arteries and arterioles since CO2 is a powerful vasodilator. Hence, hyperventilation results in reduced perfusion and oxygen supply (confirmed by tens of published medical studies) for the liver, brain, heart, kidneys, stomach, colon, and other vital organs.<br><br>3. The reduced CO2 value in the tissues produces a shift in the O2 dissociation curve to the left. This leads to the so-called shallow or suppressed Bohr effect (a reduced O2 release by red blood cells in the capillaries).<br><br>Therefore, the more a cancer patient breathes beyond the norm, the less oxygen is provided for the heart, brain, kidneys, liver, and other vital organs. Reduced cellular oxygenation leads to anaerobic mitochondrial metabolism, elevated lactic acid values, the formation of free radicals, and cell acidosis or a lowered pH in cells. On the contrary, CO2 is a chemical that is needed for tumor treatment, as numerous studies on carbogen use in cancer indications.<br><br>Since the growth of tumors depends on one\u2019s body oxygen level, chronic hyperventilation promotes the growth of malignant cells and metastasis.<br>Therefore, breathing normalization and the correction of risk lifestyle factors must be a central part of any successful anti-cancer program or cancer cure.<br><br>References:<br>Baddeley H1, Brodrick PM, Taylor NJ, Abdelatti MO, Jordan LC, Vasudevan AS, Phillips H, Saunders MI, Hoskin PJ, Gas exchange parameters in radiotherapy patients during breathing of 2%, 3.5% and 5% carbogen gas mixtures, , Br J Radiol. 2000 Oct;73(874):1100-4.<br><br>Powell ME, Hill SA, Saunders MI, Hoskin PJ, Chaplin DJ, Human tumour blood flow is enhanced by nicotinamide and carbogen breathing, Cancer Res 1997 Dec 1; 57(23): p. 5261-5264.<br><br>Powell ME, Collingridge DR, Saunders MI, Hoskin PJ, Hill SA, Chaplin DJ, Improvement in human tumour oxygenation with carbogen of varying carbon dioxide concentrations, Radiother Oncol 1999 Feb; 50(2): p. 167-171.<br><br>Thews O, Kelleher DK, Vaupel P, Dynamics of tumor oxygenation and red blood cell flux in response to inspiratory hyperoxia combined with different levels of inspiratory hypercapnia, Radiother Oncol. 2002 Jan; 62(1): p. 77-85.<br><br>Da Costa, Jacob Medes (January 1871). &quot;On irritable heart; a clinical study of a form of functional cardiac disorder and its consequences&quot;.

The systemic (whole body) effects however, are physically and physiologically distant from the lungs and therefore are more difficult to understand. The multi-system, wide spread systemic ramifications of chronic hyperventilation are numerous.<br><br>These effects are all caused by the initial effect of pulmonary hypocapnia (low CO2) which causes spasm of the airways leading to asthma. The loss of CO2 from the lung on a long term basis causes a compensatory response throughout the body. This concept is called homeostasis which means that the body is always trying to stay in balance and return to its most comfortable state.<br><br>A partial list of homeostatic controls would include:<br>- Constant body temperature<br>- Constant whole body water volume<br>- Glucose levels<br>- Mineral balance including sodium, potassium, magnesium, zinc etc.<br>- Acid base balance (Ph control)<br><br>The acid base/Ph control mechanisms are very sensitive and closely controlled, because the Ph of the body affects the function of every body system. It is this system that is activated when patients chronically hyperventilate.<br><br>Understanding this concept, we can follow what happens with CHV.<br><br>- The lungs continuously blow off too much CO2 causing local pulmonary hypocapnia (low CO2) and arterial hypocapnia.<br><br>- The arterial hypocapnia immediately changes the Ph of the circulating blood causing an increase in the Ph (alkalosis).<br><br>- The increase in the Ph causes a decrease in the delivery of Oxygen to all the bodies tissues due to the Bohr Effect (In an alkalotic environment, the hemoglobin molecules in the red cells hold onto the oxygen molecules more tightly and will not release the O2 to the tissues).<br><br>- The kidneys see the alkalosis/Ph change and know that it must correct the bodies Ph back towards neutral (neutral Ph is a Ph of 7.40). Once CHV becomes long standing the kidneys response becomes an ongoing process in which the kidneys excrete bicarbonate in an attempt to correct the alkalosis which was created by the CHV.<br><br>- The net result is a depletion of the bicarbonate buffers due to continuous over excretion of bicarbonate which also causes the loss of electrolytes including magnesium and phosphorous which are lost with the bicarbonate.<br><br>- The loss of phosphorous also decreases the production of ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) and ADP which are the bodies\u2019 main source of energy.<br><br>- This then causes a decrease in the functioning of many organs including the muscles, heart, lungs, bone marrow, immune system and liver.<br><br>- These functional changes, coupled with the arterial spasm that occurs directly due to the low CO2 levels in the blood, are expressed in the long term as muscle fatigue, hypertension due to arterial spasm, decrease in the oxygenation of the brain, migraine headaches due to arterial spasm, spasm of the arteries supplying the gut, decrease brain function with memory changes, alterations in the production of proteins and metabolism of lipids in the liver causing elevated cholesterol.<br><br>This is just a partial list of the systems, organs and bodily functions which are affected by CHV and the subsequent low CO2 levels in the lungs and blood.<br><br>This concept regarding the origins and causes of these diseases is very radically different from the way medical schools teach about these diseases. It is revolutionary and may be too simple for many academicians to accept or understand.", "comment_date": "2021-04-17T22:20:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bart De Bie", "comment_text": "Getting Started<br>by Peter Kolb<br><br>While the Buteyko method introduced into the west has been getting excellent results, it does not entirely accord with Professor Buteyko\u2019s recommended practice. During two weeks he spent in New Zealand in December 2000, he demonstrated the Buteyko technique as it should be practiced.<br><br>Aim<br>Firstly, it needs to be understood that breathing too much is a bad habit that leaves you with a debilitating shortage of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate. It usually results from long term, undischarged stress. Any stress makes you breathe more. If this is sustained over a long time period it becomes a habit. The physiology behind this habituation process is well understood. Buteyko therapy aims at reversing this, by habituating to less breathing. You do this by developing and sustaining a feeling of a slight shortage of air over a long time period. This gradually restores your carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels back to normal.<br><br>Maximum Pause<br>While it is possible to stifle an asthma attack with a long and uncomfortable breath hold know as a maximum pause (MP), this procedure does not reverse your asthma and does not retrain the respiratory center to pace your breathing correctly. Professor Buteyko is emphatic that the maximum pause has no therapeutic value in restoring healthy breathing, which is the aim of his therapy. It is also dangerous for people with various disorders such as hypertension, heart disease, epilepsy, kidney disease and diabetes. It can also destabilize your breathing, making it worse. Unfortunately the maximum pause has been introduced into a westernized version of the Buteyko technique, much to the annoyance of the Professor.<br><br>An understanding of the physiology behind the Bueyko method leaves no doubt that the maximum pause cannot improve your breathing.<br><br>DIY/Self-help<br>Professor Buteyko is firmly opposed to the DIY/self-help approach. The Buteyko technique relies 100% on patient compliance for effectiveness. Learning it from a script is like learning Yoga or martial arts from a book. Most people will experience changes in their bodies as their CO2 levels rise. These changes vary from one individual to another. Buteyko practitioners help you deal with these changes, keep you motivated and ensure that you do the breathing exercises correctly. Support for your Buteyko practitioner enables him to continue his work of bringing the technique to other sufferers.<br><br>Nevertheless, very few people around the world have access to a Buteyko practitioner. So here are some basics to help get you started.<br><br>Medication<br>Do not make any changes to medication. Steroids must be taken as prescribed. Because of carbon dioxide shortage asthmatics often don\u2019t make enough Cortisol (natural steroid) and must have supplements. Steroids are not just anti-inflammatories but they are needed by the body and without the right amount it can be almost impossible to get breathing back to normal. Your doctor will be able to review your need for steroids when you stop having asthma symptoms.<br><br>Bronchodilators must be taken only when needed. As you progress, discuss with your doctor the possibility of weaning yourself off long acting bronchodilators and replacing them with short acting ones. That will give you more control over using them when needed. You should find that within days you will be able to overcome asthma attacks with reduced breathing and won\u2019t need the bronchodilators. Nevertheless, you must always carry them with you for emergencies.<br><br>Nose breathing<br>Always breathe through your nose. If your nose is blocked perform the following exercise: After breathing normally (do not make any exaggerated breathing manoeuvre), hold your breath for as long as is comfortable, and then gradually resume very gentle breathing. It may help to pinch your nose, nod your head a few times or do some other form of exercise. In stubborn cases or when the blockage is due to a cold, you may have to try a few more times.<br><br>To avoid breathing through your mouth in your sleep, you might like to experiment with a little light medical paper tape to keep your mouth closed. Mouth taping at night is not recommended by Professor Buteyko, but most people find it extremely valuable. If you do, protect your lips with suitable cream, use a low tack tape (some are quite aggressive), and make sure you fold a tab or handle at each end for rapid and easy removal. Do not go to sleep with tape on your mouth if this causes any form of anxiety.<br><br>Comfort<br>Make sure you\u2019re comfortable before starting the exercises. Remove unnecessary clothing since the improved blood carbon dioxide will dilate blood vessels in the skin, thereby warming you up.<br><br>Posture<br>To get your posture right stand with your back to a wall, heels, shoulders head and bottom touching the wall. Now drop your shoulders. Keep this upper body posture when sitting.<br><br>Relaxation<br>While maintaining your posture, relax all the muscles in your chest, neck, shoulders, arms, tummy and particularly the diaphragm. It\u2019s a good idea to tense them up a bit first before relaxing them so that you can properly identify them and make sure they are all relaxed.<br><br>Normal Breathing<br>Take off your shirt and stand in front of a full length mirror. Watch your chest and tummy for breathing movement. Make sure that your chest does not move at all, and only the upper part of the tummy moves, between navel and breast bone. The second thing to check for is that the tummy moves out with each in breath and not the other way around. Many people get this wrong. Your out-breath must be free, relaxed and unforced.<br><br>Reduced breathing (RB)<br>Your aim is to develop a feeling of slight hunger for air, sustain this over a period and do this frequently. In fact, this should become a habit so that you do it all the time until you have achieved your health goal.<br><br>Try to feel your breathing and become aware of your breathing pattern. Now try to maintain this pattern while taking in just a little less air on each breath so that you develop a slight hunger for air. Initially try to sustain this for two minutes, then five and then ten.<br><br>If you follow all the steps correctly, then you should feel really calm, good and even a little sleepy. If you already practice relaxation techniques, yoga etc, you can combine them with reduced breathing.<br><br>Measuring your breathing<br>Hyperventilators breathe more than normal in order to achieve lower than normal blood carbon dioxide levels. It follows that if you have to breathe more than normal, then you will also not be able to hold your breath as long as you should. Professor Buteyko has cunningly used this principle to measure your blood carbon dioxide by testing how long you can hold your breath.<br><br>You start the pause somewhere in your normal breathing cycle. This is how you start the pause: Look up with your eyes and at the same time pinch your nose and start a stop watch. Just before it starts to get uncomfortable, stop the stop watch and resume normal breathing. You should be able to resume normal breathing without any effort and without taking deeper or more frequent breaths.<br><br>Some precautions:<br>- Do not take a deeper breath before the pause.<br>- Do not make any attempt to empty the lungs before the pause.<br>- Do not worry about which phase of the respiratory cycle you happen to be in before starting the pause. A pause is just an interruption of normal breathing.<br><br>The time in seconds is called a Control Pause (CP). Asthmatics typically have a CP of 5 - 15 seconds. (But not everyone with such a low CP has asthma.) Your aim is to achieve a CP greater than 40 seconds, although for perfect health Professor Buteyko recommends a CP of at least 60 seconds.<br><br>Doing a Set<br>When at rest, correctly seated, comfortable and relaxed and after breathing normally for at least five minutes you are ready to do a set. A set consists of<br>Pulse - CP - Reduced breathing - 3min normal breathing - Pulse - CP<br><br>First measure your pulse and then do a CP. Record the results on a table. Then do reduced breathing for ten minutes. Breathe normally for three minutes, then take your pulse again and take another CP. If you\u2019ve done your reduced breathing correctly your pulse should go down and your CP should go up. Sometimes the pulse remains the same. If it goes up you\u2019re not doing it correctly.<br><br>After three days you should be able to do around 8 to 10 sets a day. You can then start integrating reduced breathing into your daily life. Ideally you should aim at doing reduced breathing all day.<br><br>That takes care of the exercises. Here are a few helpful hints to help your recovery.<br>- Don\u2019t eat unless you are hungry. Only eat until you have had enough. Eating increases breathing; eating excessively increases breathing excessively.<br>- Don\u2019t dress too warmly. Be careful not to overdress children. If you are worried about them being cold, check their ears, nose, hands and feet. If these are warm, they\u2019re OK.<br>- Make sure you get plenty of vigorous exercise. But don\u2019t exercise to the point where you have to open your mouth to breathe.<br><br>If any of these recommendations make you dizzy, sick, anxious or give you palpitations, stop immediately.

Whether you will go there and 2. If you find you&#39;re not on your way there, I&#39;ll tell you how to get there.<br><br>Only two kinds of people get to Heaven: perfect people, and forgiven sinners.<br><br>What is perfect? Well, not stealing regardless of how insignificant it may seem, not saying a single evil word against anyone - not to mention God sees our thought life. And like a judge in court, a penalty has to be paid when evil is done and laws are broken (e.g. if a murderer was let off in court there would be uproar so how much more God)?<br><br>In short - we arent perfect, at all. And rather than Heaven, God, if giving us justice, will have to make us pay for our crimes by death and eternal damnation in an everlasting fire and torment. THAT\u2019s how much God hates sin.<br><br>BUT:<br>There is a way that we can be saved. AND completely forgiven. Jesus - the Son of God - came down to live a perfect life without sin, conquering all evil and the devil&#39;s sinful, lustful traps that so easily ensnare us. Jesus overcame all of that, and was then sentenced to death on a cross.<br><br>While on the cross, God poured out the anger and wrath of sin on His Son - Jesus took OUR fine of damnation in our place. That\u2019s how much He loves us. Unbearable pain and being separated from God. EVERY single evil thought, word or deed that doesnt line up with God&#39; perfection, every sin you ever have/will commit knowingly or unknowingly, Jesus took the complete, undiluted wrath for. <br><br>And, like a fine in court, Jesus paying for it means that we can go free. Not just free, but we can experience God&#39;s love and be completely forgiven and saved from Hell as all punishment was carried on the cross and crucified there for all who believe. Instead, we can live immortally and eternally in Heaven.<br><br>After His death, Jesus rose again on the third day, demonstrating His sovereignty and power and victory over not just the sins of this life, but DEATH.<br><br>GOD HAS VICTORY OVER DEATH.<br><br>Soon Jesus will return and those who died believing in Him will RISE from their graves and go to Heaven, and those who rejected His salvation, message and teachings will suffer Hell to pay their deserved fines for all eternity without a second chance.<br><br>This is your chance now.<br><br>He wants you to repent (turn away from your sin and pursue God&#39;s perfect intent for your life, striving in the opposite direction). <br><br>It\u2019s not only about escaping damnation, it\u2019s entering God\u2019s healing as well. God has a plan for your life, a plan that involves you being recreated into His perfect moral image AGAIN as we were before the sin in the garden. He loves you and wants to cleanse you - He will give you the strength. Now we can walk in His strength, experiencing His love, being taught what it means to be part of His family and too be given victory over sin and death. <br><br>He wants you to have faith in Him, letting Him take the wheel of your life (dont forget, when you&#39;re doing God&#39;s will you&#39;re following perfect love - following Him you can be certain that you are never doing the wrong thing- imagine how cleansing that feels).<br><br>What if I still sin when Ive accepted Christ&#39;s death and resurrection on my behalf?<br><br>Thats why Christ died. For your SIN. When God looks at you, striving towards Him or even falling, He sees the righteous life of Christ covering you you in place of your current, sinful reality. For those who strive to turn from sin, regardless of the pitfalls, God sees Jesus&#39;s life in place of your inability, and His blood so that yours will never have to be shed for your sin.<br><br>Religion = rules to be saved <br><br>The gospel = Christ saved us already we just have to believe it by faith alone in Christ alone. If you lack faith (as I did before), pray. He will make it strong in time. Trust Him as you would trust those close to you. He created you and knows you inside out. <br><br>Sound opposite? Thanks to our natural sinful nature, it likely does, but God knows our weakness and struggles and pitfalls with sin. THAT&#39;S why He wrestled (and won against) every temptation YOU ever faced. Just pray to God, tell Him you are struggling and are unsure - God can and will work with even the slightest desire within you to follow Him and be free from sin.<br>Ask Him to make you willing - if you are willing to be made willing, pray for it, simply shut your eyes and talk to Him.<br><br>When Satan knows people have left His camp, He won\u2019t take it lying down, He often tries harder with more trials and temptations. But Satan cannot do anything beyond what God permits, He will only allow things that will strengthen you or bring you closer to Him if you cling to Him and trust in the promises of His word.<br><br>Where do I start to learn about God&#39;s plan and His promises to me? Well, these Bible relate directly to Christ&#39;s life and our redemption, check out Matthew (or Luke if you want a more detailed account). Do it in stages and try and imagine the events and miracles as they really happened - the Bible is a true account after all.<br><br>And when and note it says WHEN, you struggle and fall on this lifelong process, know you can pray for forgiveness, dust yourself off again and get up because Jesus already bore our guilt and shame. remember that Jesus is the ultimate foundation, the reason we are given Heaven in the first place. <br><br>If you lack faith (as i did for a long time) pray. He desires to give strength and faith to His children in time when they ask Him.<br><br>If you want to let Jesus into your life, even to help you to take the first step, then read through this prayer here to get the gist of it and then just say it - trust God and give it all to Him because He has the - perfect - master plan. If you take a step - just a step - towards Him, He will take a step towards you.<br><br>NOTE: YOU ARE NEVER TOO SINFUL THAT GOD CANNOT BRING YOU BACK HOME.<br><br>Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and there is nothing that I can do to save myself. I confess my complete helplessness to forgive my own sin or to work my way to heaven. <br>At this moment I trust Christ alone as the One who bore my sin when He died on the cross. I believe that He did all that will ever be necessary for me to stand in your holy presence. I thank you that Christ was raised from the dead as a guarantee of my own resurrection. <br>As best as I can, I now transfer my trust to Him. <br>I am grateful that He has promised to receive me despite my many sins and failures. Father, I take you at your word. <br>I thank you that I can face anything now that you are my Savior. <br>Thank you for the assurance that you will walk with me through the deep valley.

Things that are cancerous and sick, may be unfit for the demanding proccess of natural survival becomming prey to man and other predators, removing them from the gene pool. This would serve to reduce the factors increasing cancer within populations to essientially exogenous causes such as carcinogens and radiation and natural mutations. <br> Their reproductive rates also tend to be much slower, which means that any genetic factor would propagate slower through their populations.

At least that&#39;s my guess before watching the whole thing.<br><br>Edit: It&#39;s the first solution possibility mentioned lol. Wouldn&#39;t anti-oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes come with an opportunity cost and be pressured against by the individual cells for the same reason cancer is selected for by the cells? Tumor suppression must make mistakes after all, and that means an individual cell that shouldn&#39;t die will, for the good of the multicellular organism. I wonder if we can find, or have observed, a phenomena like antibiotic resistance where cells slowly fight tumor suppression better, or if it&#39;s too effective at supression to allow for natural selection. <br><br>If it&#39;s just opportunity cost I mean every extra base pair, much less gene, comes with a higher chance of mutation and a higher energy cost of replication and production of genetic material. I wonder if there is something about larger animals that enables them to have more tumor supression in the genome regarding energy available. If an organism has a percentage of &quot;excess energy&quot; available to safely &quot;waste&quot; on more supression then you&#39;d expect the larger animals with more cells to have a larger scalar amount of energy. But that would really break down to looking at Joule/cell or calorie(SI)/cell and seeing if there is an excess at a cellular level. That would really be difficult though since youd like need to know how the metabolic process affects the available energy vs the intake energy, since digestion isn&#39;t perfectly efficient after all. And then you&#39;d also expect certain cells to get more energy than others, like brain cells needing glucose in massive amounts, so I suppose the phenomenon of interest would be tissue specific as well, and that&#39;s before any thought about epigenetics is considered.", "comment_date": "2020-10-11T16:56:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zaori", "comment_text": "Answer: because they dont shove tons of sugar down threir throaths like humans do annualy.", "comment_date": "2020-10-11T16:37:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ian Janson", "comment_text": "Seriously though.

Well, cancer only really became a problem near the end of the 19th century, because that\u2019s when the global life expectancy began rising. When we lived to be older, our chances of getting cancer raised, because our cell divisions increased. Before, cancer wasn\u2019t a problem because very few people lived long enough to develop it. So, there was no evolutionary pressure for our body to evolve in this way. 120 years aren\u2019t nearly enough for us to evolve.

Once this is done, blood supply to the node is cut off and the bacteria are left to starve.<br>The upshot of this knowledge is that antibiotics in food ( such as bitter green veg ) or in medicine ( such as penicilin ) are anticancer, and things that bacteria eat such as sugar and protein are cancerous.", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T06:34:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gallaxi", "comment_text": "Stress .<br>Makes <br>Cancer <br>............", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T05:09:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sguzaki", "comment_text": "I&#39;m just watching the video with both of my families being more prone to cancer, including me.", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T04:33:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "StriasAIDE", "comment_text": "We had Missile Deviation.

As a natural hypochondriach, I have been obsessed with the research and honestly cancer cells are so vast it would be very difficult to find a cure-all treatment as there are so many different types of tumor cells. Its a scary thought and all we have to combat those irregular cells is to focus a beam of radiation to kill the cell off as there are no other ways than surgically removing the tumor itself (unless it became invasive). With all of our knowledge on the topic, we really only have 2 viable solutions. So I think rather than finding a cure-all treatment (which seems impossible), I think we should find a way of finding patterns in which cancer begins to develop so we can use the only methods we know, before it progressivly becomes worse. We need a method of finding it as early as possible and include this method during check-ups.

For the first, the larger the animal the larger any given cell. A shrew&#39;s blood cell is 4x smaller than a blue whale&#39;s. Larger cells divide slower and thus less susceptible to cancer. Also this would mean cell number is not linearly correlated with body mass. Secondly, larger animals have lower basal metabolic rates which logically also reduces cellular stress. Everything is &#39;slower&#39; in those animals. But also some evidence that tumorigenesis is offset in large animals by excessive tumour suppressor genes, so its not really clear cut.

But in this case the cell and base pair stay the same, but the animal gets bigger because the number of cells increases. So the differential between animal size and cell size increases while the differential between cell and molecule size stays the same.   A disproportional change in damage at one scale (mutation) reflected in the disproportional results of another scale at 2 orders of magnitude (life).

If you play a vital role in the survival of your offspring. Small animals like mice are weaned at about 21 days. Whales keep calves in tow for years. Sharks aren&#39;t much larger than humans often, but can take longer to reach maturity and are also known for their cancer resilience. However, humans also take incredibly long to mature but still get cancer, but that could be explained by our social behavior...

So animals improve or degrade their cellular replication and maintenance mechanisms to stay close to that optimized rate of mutation. <br><br>Same with life span. Immortality isn&#39;t impossible, it&#39;s evolutionarily disadvantageous. Life on earth started out immortal and acquired death + sex as early upgrades. Animal life spans are a feature not a bug, and they&#39;re optimized, they&#39;re dialed in. <br><br>The more interesting question is how animals with unusually low cancer rates have figured out how to still thrive, grow and evolve.<br><br>But since you opted not to address this at all, it&#39;s just an educated layman spouting off. I don&#39;t know enough to explain why\u2014as you claim and I trust you that it&#39;s true\u2014why it&#39;s supposedly such an unsolved mystery to researchers.", "comment_date": "2020-03-04T18:47:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rlam 46", "comment_text": "Also probably because no other animals on the planet eat as many chemicals and crap as us.", "comment_date": "2020-03-04T18:43:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cryogenius333", "comment_text": "We are never curing Cancer.

And is almost certainly false. This is because cancer is not one disease, it&#39;s a general term to describe a common end result of some typical mistakes in cellular automata.<br><br>Being immune means specifically that the immune system maintains an immunity toward something, but this is unlikely since there is probably very little similarity across  all types of cancer an organism may develop.<br><br>It is possible that immune system often evolve to deal with cancer more efficiently in larger organisms for exactly the reasons explained in the video, but evolutionally speaking an elephant may have more things common with a mouse than with a whale. It would be a mistake to assume all large animals evolved exactly the same measures.<br><br>What&#39;s more, we are not quite sure that larger animals don&#39;t get cancer - rather that enough are able to survive to a certain age in numbers. it may be that they die from it quickly enough if they do get it but they don&#39;t get it as often.<br><br>An immune system can be better at detecting DNA mistakes as a whole but that probably cannot be called immunity.<br><br>Evolution (evolve resistance or die) is probably the leading factor more or less for most animals. Or rather, small animals don&#39;t live long enough and have higher numbers so evolution does not select against cancer nearly as much. But different animals probably evolved different strategies to cope with cancer. Some, like more cancer suppressor genes and copies of cancer-producing genes, are easy to assume to be more common, but there is probably a lot more to it. <br><br>For example, metabolism rate may play a role, slower overall growth may mean the immune system has more chances to deal with cancer before it becomes too large for that, there may be less opportunities to grow new blood vessels in some tissues and cancers may starve themselves more often.<br><br>Hypertumor hypothesis looks way too sketchy to really consider it before such phenomena are studied a lot better.

He theorizes this metabolic mode is actually the ultimate cause of cells turning into cancer cells, and the damage to the genome is only a symptom. They have done some really amazing research to back up the theory, and it appears that he may be correct, or at least more correct than the mainstream theories on cancer causes.<br>The beauty of the theory is that it can easily be treated with less toxic drug therapy and a form of ketogenic diet.

Both animals and humans were created perfect in the Garden of Eden.

Cancer is, unfortunately, in most cases, a lethal side effect of sin. Animals have no such imperfections because they never disobeyed God. They do precisely what their design intends them to do. Of course, many won&#39;t accept this option because they don&#39;t believe in God and creation. I don&#39;t believe in evolution as the reason because it states mutations in human development cause cancerous cells.

That&#39;s... how do I represent that... 10 to the power of -100 the amount of ionizing radiation at the surface. If cancer rates for a given surface dose rate are the same for whales as they are for humans, the relative lack of exposure to any but the tiniest fraction of a percent of that exposure are really going to limit your chances of getting it.<br><br><br>Okay now I&#39;m going to actually watch the video.", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T19:56:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Book_Worm", "comment_text": "I used the cancer to destroy the cancer.", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T19:56:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Strang", "comment_text": "Cancer: \ud83d\ude10<br>The Cooler Cancer: \ud83d\ude0e", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T19:56:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kenny li", "comment_text": "You lost me", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T19:56:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicolae Lautas", "comment_text": "ha, ha.

So for large animals there was a very strong selective pressure to... well.. not get cancer. <br><br>Now you may expect that that should mean they still get cancer, maybe even at the rate we get cancer, (which would still be impressive resistance since the larger amount of cells would mean they get a lot less cancer than us if they have the same chance of dying from cancer as us). But perhaps, once an effective solution has been &#39;found&#39; (see: stumbled upon during the evolutionary process) it paid off to further improve on that to the point that they barely get cancer at ALL anymore.<br><br><br>As for why evolution wouldnt &#39;force&#39; us to get cancer immunity: we tend to get cancers later in life (or from sources we dont normally come in contact much in our original natural habitat) so it doesnt really matter. Evolution doesnt give a rats ass if you die the second your offspring has become self-sufficient.

That`s why we never fully heal cancer because cancer is the same as stem cell but it is out of control.  Also, oncogenes are not just silenced cancerous genes. I do not sure if they are silenced that way you described though as far as I know they just have weaker promoter which means that expression of that gene must be lower in cell`s environment.

Their bodies are quite poorly made. For example, their skeletons are not very structurally efficient; their eye sockets are barely holding their eyes in their head, hence why exophthalmos is so common in rodents. Their organ function is also not optimal, they tend to have weak hearts, and many rodent species don&#39;t even have fully formed bladders.

Think about genetic algorithms for example - an algorithm that is improved through mutating it, and selectively pruning mutations that result in a decrease in performance, thus in theory leaving only positive mutations.<br>However, it&#39;s not that simple. The rate of mutations spreading decreases or stops entirely when the algorithm is sufficient for the purposes it was put through the gauntlet for. It&#39;s a simple limitation of the mutations and evolution not being a direct result of intelligent design - the makers of the algorithm don&#39;t understand how much better it can be, and the genetic algorithm itself is too inert to understand that it could be so much better than what it achieved.<br><br><br>The large amount of fail-safe genes in Elephants might have no significant downside. There was simply pressure to evolve more fail-safe genes and so it resulted in more fail-safe genes. The reason that smaller organisms don&#39;t have as many, due to both the smaller organisms size and their rate of reproduction. Let&#39;s say that an organism is most likely to reproduce when it reaches twenty years old. Due to this, there&#39;s less evolutionary pressure for longer lives. What&#39;s the point of those fail-safe genes lasting all the way to when the organism is 50 years old when the organism will have already had 50 offspring? The organism will have fulfilled it&#39;s &quot;purpose&quot; in the ecology, and the organisms body will turn apathetic due to genetic programing ONLY being sufficient for its purpose. Elephants in this scenario however, have so many fail safe genes that they simply don&#39;t get cancer very often. There was sufficient ecological and evolutionary pressure for them to have more fail-safe genes, and so they mutated more fail-safe genes. Ultimately, being simple luck that they attained mutations potent enough that they rarely ever get cancer.<br><br><br>My main point about this, is that claiming that a feature of a genetic algorithm has a downside despite not having a clue of that downside is both pretentious and naive. The sad reality is is that Evolution is not Intelligent Design. Evolution is random, uncontrolled, and most of all *unintelligent*. It might make a mistake early into its development, only for it not to bother fixing that mistake because the resultant creation is good enough and the process is too unaware of its own fallacy to try and do better.", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T14:52:14Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Rohith George", "comment_text": "So we can cure cancer by giving cancer cancer?", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T14:52:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bonkey kong", "comment_text": "Because my mother is already dead and she cannot have cancer.", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T14:52:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bogdan Bogdan", "comment_text": "<b>*Breaths in*</b><br><br><b>Yo daaaawg</b><br><b>I heard you like cancerrrrr</b>", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T14:51:58Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Brayden", "comment_text": "That intro tho is amazing", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T14:51:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wojtek Bo\u0144kowski", "comment_text": "I really appreciate their work.<br>IT is So much effort.", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T14:51:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spandan Saha", "comment_text": "Thanks for always putting such high quality video<br>Full of knowledge for free", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T14:51:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CrossingWheels", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AElONvi9WQ&amp;t=4m41s\">4:41</a> basically Jake Paul", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T14:51:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FlyWithMe666", "comment_text": "I\u2019m 6 feet 7 and extremely overweight.

The cancerous cells don&#39;t care about each other either way. They simply wish to get the nutrients and avoid dying. While their growth allows them to reach further away, their &quot;cores&quot; become depraved of nutrients and blood vessels, and thus create necrotic areas inside of them. Blood vessels are also a target to destroy cancerous formations, albeit not the most effective one, and reserved for few types of them.<br>The slower metabolic rate of larger animals might explain part of the issue, yet the problem is that cancerous cells have more metabolic needs than normal ones, in every single organism, due to their not using aerobic glycolysis, but anaerobic. Thus they are inefficient in using the energy provided, wherever they are. <br>Having a theoretical &quot;limit&quot; as to when a cancerous formation can affect the nearby structures is an interesting idea, since most problems come from &quot;pressure&quot; to the nearby healthy tissue and organs, effectively forcing them to malfunction. So, a structure collapsing under its own weight after reaching a certain point is a hypothesis worth checking out. Therefore, our original hypothesis becomes moot, as it&#39;s not that the blue whale or elephant <b>dont</b> get cancer, but rather that they get so many tiny cancers that it doesn&#39;t bother them. <br>What we can do to effectively test this is to take their carcasses, and study for cancer remains, first on the bones, then on the internal organs (provided we take them and freeze them very soon after death). That would shed some light, especially if we can replicate it inside a lab and try chemotherapeutic agents on them, just to see if they react differently to human cancers.", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T14:33:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gurung", "comment_text": "This description matches exactly with religion cancer of humanity", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T14:33:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nellowz", "comment_text": "Now I want to play the cancer game you guys have done in the animation!

Scishow did a video on it not too long ago, but by the time you get around to doing a video on it (Adding to the pile of videos still to be done, as I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a long list), much more research will have been done. Apparently you can even take this T-cell from one person, put it in another person, and it will still correctly identify cancers and flag them for destruction (I don&#39;t know the exact mechanism, as I&#39;m not a biologist). It really does look super promising, even if there are alot of unknowns at this point.", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:49:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alvin Lee", "comment_text": "Hyper hyper-tumours.", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:49:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saiki K", "comment_text": ":0", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:49:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Javier Nathan", "comment_text": "Ooo new intro", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:49:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "imtryingiswear", "comment_text": "Doctor: So, you have a tumour<br>cancer:   :0", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:49:18Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Mcbeg33", "comment_text": "So can scientists insert a hyper tumor into a cancer patient and destroy the original cancer?", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:49:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Till Thrill", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AElONvi9WQ&amp;t=3m00s\">3:00</a> is that a furby", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:49:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PsychOsmosis", "comment_text": "Any biochemist out there that could tell me what pathway is illustrated at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AElONvi9WQ&amp;t=1m00s\">1:00</a>?<br><br>It sure looks like a real pathway, but I can&#39;t put my finger on which one it would be.", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:49:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin parsons", "comment_text": "Covid19", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:49:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bread man", "comment_text": "So what you&#39;re saying is, we just gotta inject all the cancer patients <b>with more cancer?</b>", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T13:49:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ash lay", "comment_text": "It&#39;s almost 1am but fuck it.
