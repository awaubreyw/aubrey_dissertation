Nice \ud83d\udc4d<br>Nothing beats nuclear for cancer creation! Nuclear is the god that cancer prey&#39;s to! Sorry but I&#39;m already 100% renewable energy and totally off grid! Your point of 40 years to go renewable is moot! <br>Climate change is because of nuclear energy! How long does it take for the spent fuel from the reactor to cool down? Oh you didn&#39;t mention that, I wonder why? Nuclear energy production causes twice the amount of heat pollution than any other type of energy, it&#39;s no wonder why the planet is heating, we keep putting more heat in the earth because we haven&#39;t melted the polar ice caps totally yet! <br>New technology has already been with us for a very long time, although nuclear is so old that it needs to be shut down and... Errr I don&#39;t know what to do with a radioactive nuclear power plant? Hmmm maybe we can ask Germany what they did with theirs? They are always at the forefront of technology and they got rid of those clean radioactive waste producing plants! We have had nuclear power technology since the 40&#39;s and the technology is at a dead end, nothing else in the universe runs from nuclear power! It&#39;s not natural. The sun itself is a ball of gas powered by electricity, there&#39;s no nuclear fusion going on in the sun. If that were truly the case, they would have designed the nuclear reactor to power solar panels within it&#39;s confines but the sun doesn&#39;t work like that so it can&#39;t be done! Nuclear reactors still use steam powered turbines to generate electricity! We already had that with coal, we went from dirty coal to radioactive waste! So what&#39;s changed? Neither idea is a good idea, solar, wind and rain is the best thing that happened to us humans!", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T12:11:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The guy who asked and cares", "comment_text": "Donald Trump: China--", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T05:26:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "spectral spectra", "comment_text": "What about scraping nuclear bombs to build nuclear energy?", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T02:04:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "yes papa", "comment_text": "Another reason it\u2019s good is because we can nuke our enemys", "comment_date": "2020-08-25T21:18:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SAIDUN NAHAR AI TRC Mirpur", "comment_text": "We should not use fission energy.fusion energy is better", "comment_date": "2020-08-25T15:36:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KinyACat", "comment_text": "Time to nuke nuclear energy to Jake paul&#39;s mansion!", "comment_date": "2020-08-25T13:45:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brayden Kaye", "comment_text": "Quite non biased", "comment_date": "2020-08-25T09:06:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WOW - ROBLOX", "comment_text": "2020 emissions are much better then predicted", "comment_date": "2020-08-25T08:58:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "D3TOX", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt should be given a part of the governments funds", "comment_date": "2020-08-25T06:54:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "IronSight_Guy[\uae30\uacc4\uc2dd]", "comment_text": "Trump likes this vidio", "comment_date": "2020-08-24T18:31:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mannb\u00fcrste Treibholz", "comment_text": "PLEASE stop translating text into german!

All in all: It would be a catastrophe.<br><br><br>\rBy developing nuclear fusion, which would also take a high effort, we&#39;d maybe have a better soloution for the time we, as you said, couldn&#39;t so quickly introduce and assemble renewable engery enough.<br><br><br><br>Although all of this doesn&#39;t sound so positive, I am very confident we can get full use of renewable energy quickly enough.

How does that work you may ask? There is this condition called the \u201cFlynn effect\u201d. That is where there is strong evidence that average IQ\u2019s. Intelligence Quotient have been increasing over the last several decades. The reason for this increase in IQ\u2019s is said is to be  too rapid to be attributed to genetics or evolutionary forces. One can then conclude there must be other non genetic reasons for this increase in IQ. One reason is of course environmental. ( nature vs. nurture) Two known pollutants that has a known effect on IQ are Lead and mercury. Lead in gasoline was added to prevent knock in engines. Thankfully  the lead in gasoline was taken out in the 70\u2019s. Lead in child toys and paint on cribs has resulted in brain damage and lower IQ\u2019s. Mercury caused Minamata disease in Japan.\r<br>The other is mercury produced by coal plants. This mercury pollution is coming for American plants and continue to this day. It is believed that coal plants from China that do not need to conform to  EPA standards produce mercury pollution that falls on North America.\r<br>Therefore with the construction of nuclear power plants that displaced coal plants. The 103 nuclear plants built in the late 60\u2019s to 1979 therefore prevented the construction of extra coal plants. With a combination of lower mercury pollution by EPA standards and the introduction of unleaded gas. But now that 20% of America\u2019s electrical power comes from nuclear there must have been a decrease in exposure to mercury pollution. This in part must explain the Flynn effect. It certainly is worthy of extra study.", "comment_date": "2019-09-06T05:31:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary Lewis", "comment_text": "China is building 24 nuclear reactors. and 100&#39;s more planed.

I bet you predicted that the human<br>genome would also be mapped. Bill Gates thought the world would need no more<br>than a handful of computers but i bet you believed they would be ubiquitous.

It is a simple and effective accommodation.\u00a0 Here is a corrected and usable transcript:<br><br><br>3 REASONS WHY NUCLEAR ENERGY IS AWESOME (PART 3/3)<br><br>Three reasons why we should continue using nuclear energy:<br><br><br>1. Nuclear energy saves lives. In 2013, a study conducted by NASA found that nuclear energy has prevented around 1.8 million deaths. Even if you include the death tolls from Chernobyl and Fukushima, nuclear energy ranks last in death per energy units produced. While nuclear waste is really toxic, it&#39;s usually stored somewhere, while the toxic byproducts of fossil fuels are pumped into the air we breathe every day. So, just by reducing the amount of fossil fuels burned, countless cases of cancer or lung disease and accidents in coal mines have been avoided. If we can choose between lots of dangerous stuff being put into a deep hole and lots and lots and lots of dangerous stuff being pumped into the atmosphere, the former seems more logical. Nuclear energy feels way more dangerous though. Single catastrophic events burn into our memory, while coal and oil kill silently. It&#39;s like the death rate of flying versus driving. Even in the best-case scenario, it would take at least forty years to switch to 100% renewable energy. So, for as long as we continue using fossil fuels, nuclear energy will save way more lives than it destroys. <br><br><br><br>2. Nuclear energy reduces CO2 emissions. Nuclear energy is arguably way less harmful to the environment in terms of climate change than fossil fuels now main source energy. Since 1976, about 64 Gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions have not been pumped out thanks to nuclear energy. And by the mid-21st, century that could amount to an additional 80 to 240 Gigatons. Humanity&#39;s energy consumption is rising steadily. According to US government projections, China alone will add the equivalent of a new 600-megawatt coal plant every 10 days for the next 10 years. China already burns 4 billion tons of coal each year. Coal is cheap, relatively abundant, and easy to get to. So, it&#39;s not likely that humanity will stop using it soon. Nuclear energy might be the only way of dampening the effects of climate change and preventing a catastrophic man-made global warming. Compared to the other things we do; nuclear energy is relatively clean. So, even if it is a good idea to quit nuclear energy long term, it might be a good solution for the next hundred years or so, compared to the alternatives.<br><br><br><br>3. New technologies. Maybe technology will solve the problem of nuclear waste and dangerous power plants. The nuclear reactors we&#39;ve used so far are mostly outdated technology, because nuclear innovations stopped in the 1970s. There are models, like the thorium reactor, that could solve the problem altogether. Thorium is abundant, really hard to turn into nuclear weapons, and up to two orders of magnitude less wasteful than current nuclear reactors. The waste material might also be only dangerous for a few hundred years, in contrast to a couple of thousand years. One ton of thorium is estimated to provide the same amount of energy as 200 tons of uranium or 3.5 million tons of coal. So, while we cannot know for sure if alternative nuclear technology will keep its promises, shouldn&#39;t we at least do more research before we forego an opportunity to solve lots of humanity&#39;s current problems? It might not be an easy challenge, but that hasn&#39;t stopped us before. So, should we use nuclear energy? There are risks involved in any great human endeavor, and we have to make an informed decision, rather than rely on gut feeling.", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T21:54:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Unpopular", "comment_text": "Aren&#39;t we gonna run out of coal in about 40 years?!", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T04:26:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Unpopular", "comment_text": "Thorium is must more costly!", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T04:25:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yasir Irshad", "comment_text": "Doea nuclear fission solve the problem tho??", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T13:44:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kitora Tanaka", "comment_text": "Yes yes okay we all know what\u2019s good about nuclear energy and yes it does have low death rates but please does it really have to be built near villages?

The &quot;high level&quot; waste, which needs to be stored for a couple thousand years is an insoluble, solid, ceramic.  So it can&#39;t really &quot;leak&quot; and it won&#39;t dissolve in water or get into the water supply unless you intentionally put it there.  The only realistic danger is that the miniscule amounts of gas that is produced by decay (which will be slightly radioactive) escapes.  But This is easy to detect, and easy to patch.  <br>Another nice thing is that there isn&#39;t very much of it: After decades of nuclear power, all the high level waste produced in the US would fit inside a football stadium 2 stories high.  That&#39;s from 20% of the US&#39;s electrical power for the last couple decades.  For any industry, that&#39;s minuscule.  <br>Non-high level radioactive waste only needs to be stored for a hundred years ago until it&#39;s barely more reactive than natural ore.  And if you&#39;re worried about it: remember that the medical industry produces far more low-level radiation than the power industry, so closing nuclear plants wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference.<br>The other main concern is weapons proliferation.  But making a nuclear weapon from powerplant waste is nearly impossible: nobody&#39;s ever seriously considered it (not the US, not Russia, not North Korea, and as far as we can tell, no terrorists have even tried).  To produce these weapons, you need specialized reactors: this is what North Korea has been trying to do.  Even if they just made a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; (which is just a regular bomb with radiactive material mixed in), the effects would be tiny: a handful of people near the bomb would have slightly elevated chances of getting cancer in the next couple decades.  You know what&#39;s easier and more effective for terrorism than a dirty bomb?  A regular bomb.  <br><br>Otherwise, the effects of low levels of radiation are tiny, if they exist.  We spent the entire cold war testing radiation on humans and animals and in every case, low levels of radiation showed basically no sign of causing damage.  In some cases, it even appeared to decrease cancer rates.  How many things have we spent decades studying, but still can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s dangerous?  Basically, the method governments use to &quot;estimate&quot; how many people will be killed by a radiation leak (known as the Linear No-Threshhold) is known to be overly conservative.  So when a number is given for the &quot;deaths caused by Fukushima&quot; (or Chernobyl) we know it&#39;s actually far less than that.  As another example: during and after Fukushima, not a single member of the public received a notable dose of radiation.  And only about 40 workers received higher-than-accepted doses: most likely, none of those will die from it.

Chernobyl was really poorly made, and the operators were insufficiently trained. They shut down the cooling system for a test. Rule number one of a nuclear plant DO NOT SHUT DOWN THE COOLANT SYSTEM! EVER!.The coolant was liquid graphite (a high explosive). The Soviet government took 3 days to respond. There were no containment towers (something that all US and pretty much every modern plant has). A true mark of their stupidity, some of the Chernobyl reactors were kept in operation until 2004!  How dumb do you have to be to not shut that place down. We are lucky it didn&#39;t explode again. Well designed and maintained nuclear power is much safer. The biggest issue is waste disposal, and we already have a good idea how to do this but many countries keep it trapped under political squabbling. In the US we lack a disposal site because every time we try to make one whatever state it&#39;s in screams tha we need to put it somewhere else and that it isn&#39;t fair to them. They all want a site but no one is willing to hold the ball. This is essentially what happened with the really promising Yucca Mountain site under the Obama administration (and no I am not anti-Obama, that was just a really big mistake).

That said the solution is to allow them to sort of &quot;lead the way,&quot; while protecting the private companies and research groups so they can maintain their independent status without fear of being steamrolled by Exxon or BP. We will need their money anyways as nuclear reactor facilities are rather expensive.

There is a fusion test going on fairly soon that is intended to serve as a model of safe, clean nuclear energy. The ITER project will build a deuterium-tritium fusion reactor in France. The reactor will generate plasma and magnetically contain it to spare the reactor from the insane heat (10 times hotter than the core of the sun) it will produce. Should the confinement fail though, the plasma will immediately stop fusion upon contact with the reactor wall because plasma can only self sustain in as near perfect conditions. Conditions which do not involve adding new elements to the recipe. Neither deuterium nor tritium produces a long lived waste.  Granted that still does mean we will be stuck with hazardous waste for ~100 years but a plant will only need 250 kilos of material per year. That&#39;s compared to the 27 tons per plant per year used by light water reactors. It&#39;s estimated to be able to produce it is estimated to produce up to 1.7 gigawatts and be slightly more expensive per kilowatt than fission until the technology is developed and adopted further. <br><br>It&#39;s not a replacement to current technologies like solar wind or hydroelectric but it is should be a part of a green future. Solar, wind and hydro are small power generators and slightly sporadic depending on your climate. Fusion can be used to fill batteries for rainy days or disasters and act as power hubs for large draws on the grid. Things like our houses, cars, schools offices can form their own power ecosystems and either be supplemented or backed up by the fusion grid.", "comment_date": "2016-10-31T13:34:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dry", "comment_text": "Thorium reactor!?

Nuclear will begin to look a lot more favorable as an option.  We will have around 200 years worth of Uranium if we choose not to use breeder reactors.  This will probably appear to be the favorable option to the mathematically illiterate public.  Towards the end of the 200 year period, the same issues will begin to appear and the public will begin ravenously looking for source of energy to provide them with their comforts that they&#39;ve been accustomed to.  Then all of a sudden breeder reactors that convert this 200 years of Uranium waste into useful fuel will begin to look like a great idea.  Then the new energy system should remain sustainable on the current reserves for the next 30,000 years.   This should provide ample enough time for us to begin harvesting the mineral resources of the rest of the solar system.

This is not conditional on the continued use of fossil fuels.<br><br>Throughout you put an addendum on each positive point to fossil fuels that it would still be a good idea to end nuclear energy generation in the long term, yet provide no data/justification for this. Collecting diffuse energy sources (wind, solar, tidal) will always be resource intensive simply because you need to collect energy over a massive geographic area to match the energy dense alternatives. The push for PV solar in some western nations is driving a massive, environmentally destructive expansion of high grade silicon production. Silicon which is refined with energy from coal power plants and uses chemicals far more toxic than could ever come from a coal or nuclear power plant (also, toxicity and radioactivity are different things, a nitpick for point 1). To switch to renewable for even a significant minority of global energy generation would require a huge expansion in mining simply to get the raw materials for the volume of PV generators, thermal generators, batteries (another highly environmentally harmful industry that is ignored because it happens out of sight in china) and generator materials (because you are running far more small generators at low efficiency than a few massive generators at high efficiency). Diffuse energy sources suck for the enviroment, the environmental footprint will always be huge and you cant improve it because you run up against physics, not technical limitations.<br><br><br>If you think nuclear should be given up long term, explain why another option is better. The only alternative to fission (and the thorium reactors are very promising and could even compete with this if they pan out) is fusion if you are looking to minimise humanities environmental footprint. However fusion is still in its very VERY early experimental stages and it has not been demonstrated that the current issues are technical and not caused by simple physics (is it possible to get more energy out of fusion than is required to maintain the magnetic bottle the fusion takes place within?) A German research group recently had some developments but it is still up in the air.<br><br>Even then fusion is so tricky running a fusion plant would be like balancing a bowling ball on a pencil. It requires constant corrections and adjustments to keep running. What you want is a middle ground between immediate shut-down and a runaway reaction. So if you don&#39;t micromanage the system physics keeps the system stable without running out of control or shutting down. Previous gen nuclear reactions run out of control but the liquid fluoride thorium reactor design self stabilises. Too hot and the liquid fuel expands and the reaction slows, too cold and the liquid contracts and the reaction speeds up (higher density = faster reaction in nuclear fuels).<br><br>So like the video says, if you want to solve the energy problem, push for energy research, prevent the blocking of nuclear energy research by calling representatives and opposing environmental laws designed by fear and ignorance and supporting laws that encourage research.

Coal power plants pump a massive amount of radioactive particles in the air and nuclear power can actually recycle waste fuel through recombination  recycling. In other words the radioactive waste, with the proper technology, can be recycled into the next batch of uranium and produce even more electricity. The confirmation amongst people is insane too--chernobyl and fukishima were pretty much the only &quot;disasters&quot; and three mile island hardly counts since people are exposed to more radiation traveling on air planes and getting xrays then they could have possibly received from three mile island. For some reason people are really scared about nuclear energy, but its just pure ignorance and confirmation bias--they don&#39;t look at the number of deaths that emerge from gas and coal power plants because its diffiult to show how cancer is connected to it. Even hydro plants have problems since they block up massive rivers causing significant environmental damage down stream. And no other technology can even come close to producing as much energy as nuclear in a single power plant. <br><br>Finally you have to remember that chernobyl and fukishima actually show the reliability of nuclear power. It took like 20 years of neglect, a built in defect, and an incompetent team of engineers and buearucrats to cause the incident at chernobyl. In japan it only took a massive earth quake, a gigantic tsunami, and the incompetent engineers who put their generators underground and were subject to flooding. And fukishima was built in the 1970s while chernobyl was from the 50s ffs. Reactors built in 2015 have MASSIVELY better safety practices and containment, since, go figure, technology improves.

No human can go near there again without extensive protection, and even that will not guarantee you safety from radiation. And radioactivity lasts for millenniums! MILLENNIUMS!!!

Nuclear waste, on the other hand, cannot be fixed no matter what you do (unless someone brilliantly devises a way to use such radioactive waste) and won&#39;t effectively wear out long into the future. People are quick to assume coal and gas are just a short-term solution to a long-term problem, but nuclear energy is just as risky as they are.

Thorium is commonly found with rare earths, which we use in a lot of products and it is just thrown away. another great pro is that it only has one isotope. this is important because you don&#39;t need giant rooms of centrifuges to get a pellet that is only 10% of the fuel you need (what is done today). Safety is another key reason it is a superior metode. Because it is a salt and the fuel is a liquid, it&#39;s not pressurized. It also has a 1 safety system, 100% reliable proce.
