Unlike fossil fuels, uranium has never been part of Earth&#39;s energy cycle, without humans causing a nuclear reaction, this energy would remain trapped forever. <br><br>It is 1950s technology, using steam power, an even older technology of the 19th century when global warming was just being started, to run turboines. It has thus added the sum total of energy released to the problem of a warming world, and cqannot be considered any part of a solution. Yet nbuclear cultists continue to claim it is thechnology for the future, that anyone who opposes it is a Luddite and doesn&#39;t understand, that nuclrear supporters are advanced and hampered by the ignorant. Actually the reverse is true, modern technology is harnessing power from wind, water, tides and sun, this technology did not exist back in the 1950s when nuclear was started principally to supply plutonium for weapons. The mind set of its fans is thus fixed in the 1950s, and no amount of raqtional argument or logic seems capable of persuading them it is not what it seems. That&#39;s why I call it a cult; based on false beliefs, mired with secrecy and misinformation, and growing every more costly so much so that nuclear builders demand a high energy cost paid by consumers to profit them into the future. So electricy bills would need to rise and rise to pay for the costs whiuch run into many billions and are revised upwards during the course of the ten years or so build time. Renrewables at the sdame time are halving in cost annually and are now the cheapest and fastest means of supplying actual clean cheap energy, something nuclear constantly claims when what it produces is worse than dirty and costs the Earth. <br><br>The only possible future is 100% actual renewables, and not those claimed as renewable which are simply not, such as geothermal, which again adds all the energy created to the already warming planet, energy which would otherwise remain deep in the planel&#39;s crust. Nuclear power pumps billions of gallons of hot water into the oceans, considered waste by the blinkered nuclear cultists and of no consequence, illustrating their total ignorance of not just the ecosystem but of energy reality. <br><br>It would be good to see Wikipedia reflect this reality and not be so encouraging and complacent about nuclear. And I haven&#39;t once mentioned nuclear disasters, of which there are hundreds but only t5he biggest are mentioned, and the continuing problem of sp-ent fuel, which has always going to be a problem for future generations to cope with, I think future generations are going to have trouble enough simply surviving the shattered world we will be leaving them. Another problem o9f nuclear never considered or mentioned is the fact of sea levelk rise and the inconvenient fact that nuclear power stations are almost always situated on coasts at sea level for access to unlimited cooling water, the energy so transferred being pumped straight into the sea. Perhaps nuclear fans can enlighten everyone on what will happen to a flooded nuclear pile? <br><br>And with Thwaites Glacier due to break off into the sea in a matter of 2-5 years, I wonder if any politicians are considering how to decommision all the existing nuclear plants in the world before that happens. Building any more is folly of a kind not even hominids have indulged in before. <br><br>What&#39;s needed is clear critical thinking on this subject, not the usual simplistic, complacent, patronising &#39;experts&#39; who think everyone failing to support their pet megafix needs to be educated on the process which will somehow banish all doubts.  <br><br>~~~~", "comment_date": "2022-03-31T14:12:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Random Cubing", "comment_text": "tbh Nuclear bombs are just like private firearms.

But rather from the overreaction of the government not allowing people to return to their homes. <br>     A lot of people could have returned to their homes with very few mitigating factors. <br>   With Chernobyl, the RBMK reactors primary design was to create plutonium for nuclear weapons. Electricity was just a byproduct.<br>     The accident occurred because of the reckless ambitions of the lead engineer on duty. The deaths were created by the Soviet government not being upfront about the disaster.<br>   Just hundreds of feet away was reactor number three and then reactor number two and one. They kept running for about another 15 years.<br>   In both these scenarios today there is tourism including people that are walking right up to the reactor for a limited amount of time.<br>   Everyone knows that the news sells fear and anger. The news is part of the problem with keeping this truly green energy source from being deployed.<br>     There are forces that want to make nuclear power so expensive it can never be bilt.  Principle among them are oil companies. <br>     The deaths and expense of global warming with its extreme weather is obvious and plays out everyday.<br>     I&#39;m excited about generation 4 reactors.  They&#39;re about six different designs and they have about six different characteristics. <br>    Some of the best characteristics are<br>-They&#39;re considered walk away safe.<br>-They burn more nuclear waste than they create.<br>-The waste is considered hazardous for far less time.<br>-They&#39;re non-proliferation so they can&#39;t be used for nuclear weapons. <br>- The designs are small and can be as common as a hospital. They take up the footprint of about a Walmart. A truly local power grid to accompany wind and solar.<br>    This is truly the future that&#39;s going to power our electric cars and  trucks.  Some of the byproducts of nuclear power is creating hydrogen. This could power our airplanes, trains and ships.<br>    I look forward to clean skies without smog or inversion layers.<br>    I would much rather live next door to a nuclear power plant then a power plant admitting CO2 gas in other poisons and toxins.", "comment_date": "2021-03-25T05:49:28Z", "likes_count": 126}, {"comment_by": "Alparslan Korkmaz", "comment_text": "Nicely explained.", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T11:20:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "MinemanYT", "comment_text": "My exam in a nutshell: &quot;it was there, it worked and it wasnt terribly expensive&quot;<br>also the real paper..............................<br><b>I like your cuh G</b>", "comment_date": "2021-03-20T13:53:47Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Antrey", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcOFV4y5z8c&amp;t=2m55s\">2:55</a> So that is?<br>Fucking glorified steam engines.", "comment_date": "2021-03-18T20:02:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bernard Appiagyei", "comment_text": "people: neuclear power is great!<br>Chernobyl: And I took that personally....", "comment_date": "2021-03-18T17:24:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "questical", "comment_text": "I&#39;m in pain", "comment_date": "2021-03-16T21:51:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "itzjord", "comment_text": "I have a nuclear power plant in my city and I just know I have some mutated animals in my city.", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T13:50:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cloner Random", "comment_text": "Who saw the police box from doctor who?!?!!?!", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T12:22:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "calcium with magic", "comment_text": "Water power is better", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T01:40:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ua730\u029f\u1d00\ua731\u029c \u1d0f\ua730\ua730\u026a\u1d04\u026a\u1d00\u029f", "comment_text": "Hello, can you please make a video about Plutonium?", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T12:43:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexah Cagle", "comment_text": "i\u2019m doing this for school and was hoping the answers would be in the comments. turns out it\u2019s just a bunch of mf\u2019s who think they know it all\ud83d\ude12", "comment_date": "2021-03-05T09:17:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omar Moghazi", "comment_text": "TYSM IM SO GOOD IM POWER", "comment_date": "2021-03-02T16:43:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Janarthanan G", "comment_text": "Where does the neutron comes from?

It&#39;s &quot;expensive&quot; because of fear-mongering and legislation. It&#39;s not actually <b>that</b> expensive when you can mass produce a standard model, like France and South Korea does.<br><br>Also, LWRs, the way you described them, would constitute a lot of non LWRs. LWRs are unique in one major regard: the coolant and moderator are both regular water, and these designs are predominantly Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs), some are BWRs (Boiling). It&#39;s also important to note that these designs are largely based on an inspired by naval reactor designs, as that is where reactor plants first started emerging, which is why modern reactor designs are trying to get away from that, because, obviously, we can accomplish more on land than in a submarine with more efficient designs. There are no size or area restrictions. The LWR/PWR design is really great for small reactor plants, but not the most optimal for large, commercial reactors, which is what 80ish% of the world&#39;s reactors are like.. they&#39;re Gen2 Reactor Plants. I will grant that the LWR is not the &quot;safest or most elegant&quot; reactor design, but I think putting it in that context is a but misleading. LWRs are VERY safe, and still statistically safer than any other power production platform, outside of other reactor plant designs. Technically, a lot of our Gen4 designs that will be in construction by the end of this coming decade are safer, more efficient, and considerably more complex than LWRs, or any other current operational reactor that we have.. but they&#39;re all still very safe, and their capacity factor, at least in the US, is very high. About 90%. <br><br>I also think it is unfair to say that Three Mile Island &quot;barely escaped&quot; its catastrophe. The containment vessel, which is made of reinforced steel and several feet of concrete, did its job, and it wasn&#39;t even close to succumbing. This is a prominent difference between Chernobyl and TMI, or the Soviet Era reactors and the US. The RBMK-1000 would have never been licensed in the US, for a number of reasons, including the positive reactivity coefficient and the lack of a containment vessel. Some reinforced steel and concrete would have nullified everything that die. Also, regulations are much more strict in the US, and so is the safety atmosphere in general. <br><br>The &quot;radioactive cloud that threatened central Europe&quot; is extremely hyperbolic. Europe was just fine. People fictionalize the extent of radiation or how much it increased the surrounding areas. <br><br>Here&#39;s my question. Everyone, and I mean everyone, seems to know about Chernobyl or Fukushima. Movies, series, and YouTube videos will be dedicated to them regularly, including videos like this. Yet, how&#39;s come we never hear about the worst energy disaster? The Banqaio Dam Collapse in 1975 China killed 200,000+ people and displaced 11 million from their homes, and I sincerely doubt anyone really even knows about this, let alone will we see the media talking about it. Nothing comes close to this disaster, and its environmental impact and death toll is worse than every nuclear reactor plant in history, combined. Yet, hydroelectric power is still one of the safest forms of energy, just being nuclear. <b>It&#39;s an example of how unfairly it is treated, fictionalized, and sensationalized.</b><br><br>&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-06-17T16:44:46Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Anatoly Dyatlov", "comment_text": "Amateurs.

It is a simple and effective accommodation.\u00a0 Here is a corrected and usable transcript:<br><br><br><br>NUCLEAR ENERGY &amp; HOW IT WORKS (PART 1/3)<br><br><br>Have you ever been in an argument about nuclear power? \u00a0We have, and we found it frustrating and<br>confusing, so let&#39;s try and get to grips with this topic. \u00a0<br><br><br>It all started in the 1940s. After the shock and horror of<br>the war and the use of the atomic bomb, nuclear energy promised to be a<br>peaceful spin-off of the new technology, helping the world get back on its feet.<br>Everyone&#39;s imagination was running wild. \u00a0Would electricity become free? Could nuclear<br>power helped settle the Antarctic? Would there be nuclear powered cars, planes,<br>or houses? It seemed that this was just a few years of hard work away. One<br>thing was certain: the future was atomic.<br><br><br>Just a few years later there was a sort of Atomic Age hangover;<br>as it turned out, nuclear power was very complicated and very expensive. Turning<br>physics into engineering was easy on paper but hard in real life. Also, private<br>companies thought that nuclear power was much too risky as an investment; most<br>of them would much rather stick with gas, coal, and oil. But there were many<br>people who didn&#39;t just want to abandon the promise of the Atomic Age; an exciting<br>new technology, the prospect of enormously cheap electricity, the prospect of<br>being independent of oil and gas imports, and, in some cases, a secret desire<br>to possess atomic weapons provided a strong motivation to keep going. <br><br><br>Nuclear power\u2019s finest hour finally came in the early 1970s,<br>when war in the Middle East caused oil prices to skyrocket worldwide. Now,<br>commercial interest and investment picked up at a dazzling pace. More than half<br>of all the nuclear reactors in the world were built between 1970 and 1985. But<br>which type of reactor to build, given how many different types there were to<br>choose from? A surprising underdog candidate won the day: the light water<br>reactor. It wasn&#39;t very innovative and it wasn&#39;t too popular of scientists, but<br>it had some decisive advantages: it was there, it worked, and it wasn&#39;t terribly<br>expensive. <br><br><br>So, what does a light water reactor do? Well the basic principle<br>is shockingly simple: it heats up water using an artificial chain reaction. Nuclear<br>fission releases several million times more energy than any chemical reaction could.<br>Really heavy elements on the brink of stability, like uranium-235, get<br>bombarded with neutrons. The neutron is absorbed, but the result is unstable. Most<br>of the time, it immediately spits into fast-moving lighter elements, some<br>additional free neutrons, and energy in the form of radiation. The radiation heats<br>the surrounding water, while the neutrons repeat the process with other atoms, releasing<br>more neutrons and radiation in a closely controlled chain reaction. Very different<br>from the first destructive runaway reaction in an atomic bomb. <br><br><br>In our light water reactor, a moderator is needed to control<br>the neutrons energy. Simple, ordinary water does the job, which is very<br>practical, since waters used to drive the turbines anyway. The light water<br>reactor became prevalent because it&#39;s simple and cheap. However, it&#39;s neither<br>the safest, most efficient, nor technically elegant nuclear reactor.<br><br><br>The renewed nuclear hype lasted barely a decade though. In<br>1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania barely escaped a catastrophe<br>when its core melted. In 1986, the Chernobyl catastrophe directly threatened<br>Central Europe with a radioactive cloud, and in 2011 the drawn-out Fukushima<br>disaster sparked new discussions and concerns. <br><br><br>While, in the 1980s, 218 new nuclear power reactors went<br>live, their number and nuclear\u2019s global share of electricity production has<br>stagnated since the end of the 80s. So, what&#39;s the situation today? Today, nuclear<br>energy meets around 10% of the world&#39;s energy demand. There are about 439<br>nuclear reactors in 31 countries. About 70 new reactors are under construction in<br>2015, most of them in countries which are growing quickly. All in all, 160 new reactors<br>are planned worldwide. Most nuclear reactors were built more than 25 years ago<br>with pretty old technology. More than 80% are various types of light water<br>reactor. Today, many countries are faced with a choice: the expensive<br>replacement of the aging reactors, possibly with more efficient, but less<br>tested models, or a move away from nuclear power towards newer or older<br>technology with different cost and environmental impacts. So, should we use<br>nuclear energy?", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T21:32:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "F4F Phantom II", "comment_text": "How to get funding by the government for your project:<br>Step one:<br>-Show your project<br>Step Two:<br>-say it&#39;s good for the military<br>Step 3:<br>???<br>Step 4:<br>-Government: ...<br>Government: <b><i>sHuT uP aNd taKE mY MoNeY!!!</i></b>", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T08:59:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Teob700", "comment_text": "Fuck nuclear reactors and fuck Chernobyl!", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T08:36:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PBandJ1001", "comment_text": "Im here cus i have to explain nuclear energy in class this week and idk shit bout science like this\u2026", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T07:07:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Parker Varin", "comment_text": "THORIUM", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T16:29:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sterre", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcOFV4y5z8c&amp;t=1m41s\">1:41</a> that TARDIS tho", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T10:17:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lukas Seltsam", "comment_text": "It is just very dangerous and irresponsible way of boiling water.

They need to plant enough trees near the power station<br>c.) Volcanoes emit sulfur dioxide, so if there&#39;s a volcano nearby the power station, the carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide will interact each other and will cause acid cloud to form. This will cause acid rain to fall.<br>d.) They are finite resource because they take millions of years to form from dead swamps.<br><br>b.) Nuclear Fuel<br>Pros: <br>a.) They are cheap<br>b.) They don&#39;t emit pollution<br>c.) They don&#39;t need to plant enough trees near the power station.<br>d.) If there&#39;s a volcano nearby the power station, it won&#39;t cause acid cloud to form. This won&#39;t cause acid rain to fall.<br>e.) They emit hydrogen and nitrogen which is harmless to the environment.<br>f.) They are renewable resource because they take a fortnight to form from dead jellyfish.<br>Cons:<br>a.) They are formed under the sea and it&#39;s difficult to get.<br>b.) They are type of carcinogen, a cancer causing agent which can be harmful to DNA and RNA, so they need to wear protective clothes and handle nuclear waste very carefully.<br>c.) If there is an accident, large amount of radioactive waste can be released to the environment which can stick around for thousands of years. It must be stored safely.<br><br>c.) Wind Energy<br>Pros:<br>a.) They don\u2019t cost any money<br>b.)They are efficient<br>c.)Wind energy is a renewable resource because wind is unlimited<br>d.)Wind energy doesn&#39;t emit pollution<br>Cons:<br>a.) Windmills are very noisy and it would distract people and animals nearby and this noise could damage your ears<br>b.) They can\u2019t build houses near the windmill<br>c.) If any birds and flying object got in contact with the moving windmill, they\u2019ll get seriously harmed or destroyed or even killed<br>d.) Windmill electricity is affected by the wind. We can only get windmill electricity when it\u2019s windy. When it\u2019s not windy, electricity isn\u2019t produced.<br>e.) Some people might get distracted.<br><br>d.) Water Energy<br>Pros:<br>a.) They don\u2019t cause any money<br>b.) Water is a renewable resource because water goes in cycle<br>c.) Water doesn\u2019t emit pollution<br>d.) Some water in the water combustion can turn saltwater or polluted water into fresh water.<br>e.) They can control flooding, deep water ways for shipping.<br>f.) Some dams have fish ladders.<br>g.) Tidal barrages and hydroelectric power stations are very reliable and can be easily switched on.<br>Cons:<br>a.) It takes quite a long time to build a water combustion dam<br>b.) If there were an accident, it could cause flood and ruin the habitat nearby<br>c.) If we set a nuclear atomic bomb, it might cause tsunami to surge<br>d.) It can\u2019t be made anywhere in the land and it only can be made near the water area<br>e.) It has been difficult to scale up the designs for wave machines to produce large amounts of electricity<br>f.) Dams interrupt the life cycle of the organism nearby.<br>g.) Sometimes reservoir water is cold and destroy organism nearby.<br>h.) Dams flood farmland and push people from their homes.<br><br>e.) Geothermal Energy<br>Pros:<br>a.) Geothermal energy don\u2019t cost any money<br>b.) They are tough, not delicate<br>c.) They are renewable resource because they go in never ending cycle like the water cycle<br>d.) They don\u2019t emit pollution<br>e.) It takes a short time; each cycle lasts for a minute or even way shorter.<br>f.) They are very efficient.<br>g.) They take a short time to build.<br>Cons: No Cons<br><br>f.) Solar Energy<br>Pros:<br>a.) Solar Energy is a renewable energy because the sun is always there<br>b.) They don\u2019t emit pollution<br>c.) They are shiny like metal<br>d.) Solar cells can provide electricity in remote locations where there is no mains electricity<br>e.) Some solar energy is efficient<br>f.) Some solar energy is cheap<br>Cons:<br>a.) Some solar energy is inefficient<br>b.) Some solar energy is expensive<br>c.) On sunlight or twilight can turn into electricity. When it\u2019s cloudy or raining, there will be twilight.

Electrical Energy<br>Pros:<br>For Lightning:<br>a.) Lightning contains millions of voltages, so each struck can store lot of electricity<br>b.) Lightning is a renewable resource because thunderstorms are part of water cycle<br>c.) Lightning doesn&#39;t emit pollution<br>d.) Lightning doesn&#39;t cost any money<br>e.) We don\u2019t have work for lightning because it\u2019s done naturally<br>f.) Lightning is very efficient<br>g.) If lightning struck slightly off the power station, it\u2019ll still work<br>h.) Lightning goes in zig zag, so if the lightning start striking above where it\u2019s not the power station, it can curve and find its way to the power station<br>i.) Lightning is bright and very hot enough to strengthen the electricity<br>For Electric Eel:<br>a.) Electric eels contains thousands of voltages, so each electric eel can store a lot of electricity<br>b.) Electric eel is a renewable resource because it\u2019s an animal, it can multiply.<br>c.) Electric eel can be done anytime even though it\u2019s not stormy<br>d.) Electric eel don\u2019t emit pollution<br>e.) Electric eel don\u2019t cost any money.<br>f.) Electric eel can be placed accurately.<br>g.) They can build houses nearby the electric power station<br>h.) People and animals who is nearby won\u2019t be distracted and won\u2019t damage their ears.<br>Cons:<br>For Lightning:<br>a.) Lightning can\u2019t be done anytime and it only can be done when it\u2019s stormy<br>b.) We can\u2019t predict where the lightning will exactly strike, so it may not strike the power station<br>c.) Lightning is very hot and it is about 30,000\u2103<br>d.) Lightning is very loud, therefore they need to be away.<br>e.) People or animal nearby would be distracted and this noise could damage their ears.<br>f.) They can\u2019t build houses nearby the electric power station<br>g.) This noise can be frightening to them<br>h.)

The power station must be metal aluminum, otherwise it won\u2019t work<br>For Electric Eel:<br>a.) Electric eels are difficult to get because they live in the sea<br>b.)Electric eels may use electricity for defense, so they need to wear protective clothes and handle electric eels very carefully<br>c.)Not only using electricity, electric eels can kick someone, so they need to use an oil rig to get the electric eel and trap it in the net very tightly.", "comment_date": "2016-05-22T03:48:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mazokura", "comment_text": "I smell fallout 4", "comment_date": "2016-05-22T02:49:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Supreme Tyrant", "comment_text": "thanx for uploading i love your Graphics\ud83d\ude03", "comment_date": "2016-05-20T20:44:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "CW reed", "comment_text": "Anyone catch the Weyland Yutani logo?", "comment_date": "2016-05-19T07:06:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bilbo_Gamers", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcOFV4y5z8c&amp;t=4m14s\">4:14</a> A fusion reactor that can&#39;t sustain itself and doesn&#39;t produce energy, maybe?

We can&#39;t expect change to occur if the FINANCIAL incentives remain the same.<br>The real battle is between nuclear and fossil fuels. So why is fossil fuel usage more abundant than nuclear fuel for electricity production  - even though the latter is cheaper and cleaner? My theory: <br>Fossil fuels are consumed in far larger quantities, so a company handling for example oil will be far more PROFITABLE than one selling uranium or constructing nuclear power stations (exacerbated by the risk associated with them). That&#39;s why there are is no ExxonNuclear or Royal Dutch Uranium. And with money comes influence, that influence is then used to promote the usage of oil in electricity production. The foundation is then laid for increased profits, increased political leverage, increased profit, etc. As significantly less uranium is consumed for nuclear power, most of it is a one-time cost --- in other words not as profitable as the steady sales of oil.<br>The situation is that we have one block benefitting tremendously from increased fossil fuel consumtion (the producers and the car industry) --- versus the entire rest of society (the energy consumers, most notably the public) --- and the former wins simply because in practice, they work toward a very clear goal (increasing consumtion of their product) whereas the latter are fragmented in all the other sectors that consume energy, and doesn&#39;t produce it.<br>1) Oil companies have a disproportionately large amount of influence and revenue, simply because of tradition and the fundamental dynamics of how oil is consumed combined with the market.<br>2) In order for nuclear power to become viable, the consumer has to become the producer. ALL OTHER industry sectors would benefit hugely from decreased energy prices -- they just need to invest and lobby for it, and provide an ACTUAL counterforce against the now unopposed fossil fuel industry.<br>Oil producers are way overdue, technology already exist to compete with them, it&#39;s just a matter of market dynamics.", "comment_date": "2015-09-30T23:58:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cark Chan", "comment_text": "is it me or is there a hidden TARDIS in each video", "comment_date": "2015-09-30T22:22:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jesse", "comment_text": "i have an idea to get rid of nuclear wast.......<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Just shot rockets filled with it at north korea", "comment_date": "2015-09-29T23:05:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nyan mask", "comment_text": "Can you make another video about nuclear power explaining the remaining other reactor technologies besides the light water reactor?", "comment_date": "2015-09-29T03:21:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Prior", "comment_text": "anyone notice the sneaky tardis:)", "comment_date": "2015-09-28T07:47:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alloytrident", "comment_text": "Anyone notice the Wey-yu (Weyland-Yutani) reference from aliens in the video?", "comment_date": "2015-09-27T16:42:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Mosley", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcOFV4y5z8c&amp;t=1m38s\">1:38</a> ;-)", "comment_date": "2015-09-27T09:35:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Santerre", "comment_text": "Watched some of the &quot;nutshell&quot; videos.
