Your brain is part of you, and you are part of your brain.\r<br>\r<br>Agency -- the perception of control -- is a complex topic.\r<br>\r<br>From a neuroscience perspective, &quot;you&quot; are a dynamic construct of your brain. Your sense of who you are is a model your brain creates as a strategy to coordinate optimal action.\r<br>\r<br>The perception that you have of causing an action to occur is a by-product of goals generated by your brain that lead to an action plan, which in turn is split into two pathways: in one pathway, the plan leads to motor movements; and in another pathway, the plan leads to expectations of what perceptions will result from the action. If you reach out your hand to shake the hand of another, you expect your outstretched arm to appear in your field of view, and you expect to feel your muscles and arm moving. When these things happen, you are not surprised and you brain attributes the witnessed action to you as the cause. If you failed to see your arm, you would feel shocked and impotent. If you saw your arm move but had no memory of intending anything, you would say it was a spasm of some sort, or that your arm &quot;had a mind of its own&quot;.\r<br>\r<br>This does not mean that the mind is &quot;coming along for the ride&quot; as a passive witness to the actions of the brain. The mind is the framework that is the basis for action plan formulation. This framework, maintained and updated by the brain, is the basis for incorporating new information and understanding the world -- a world that happens to include itself.\r<br>\r<br>In the end, the mind is just a higher level of abstraction for understanding the activity of the brain in the same way that a virtual machine (VM) in computer science is a level of abstraction above a physical machine or CPU. Does the virtual machine control the physical machine? Yes, in the sense that program actions in the virtual machine cause the physical machine to do things. Or is it actually that the physical machine controls the virtual, since the CPU is the source of &quot;life&quot; for the VM? Ultimately, neither one controls the other.

I am not a brain, I&#39;m not a body, I am the pattern my brain is made in. Everything that I experience changes my brain in the slightest way, changing the pattern, changing ME. I am just the way my brain is organized. If you organized the cells in my body to make me fat, I would still be Seth, just fat. If you organized the cells in my brain to change my whole personality, I would be a new man in what used to be Seth&#39;s body. I would no longer exist, Id&#39;ve been just replaced by a new organization of cells. People could and would still call me Seth, but people can call me, as I am right now, Jason, or Mark, or Garthalomous. A name is simply an identification. I&#39;m not SETH, I&#39;m a pattern recognized as Seth.", "comment_date": "2021-08-27T03:00:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sidhe", "comment_text": "Wow, the linguistics are doing <b>alot</b> of heavy lifting in this video.

And the video didn&#39;t give a direct answer to them. So I wrote down my thoughts for other people who are confused:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVmkDUkZT4&amp;t=0m08s\">0:08</a><br>&quot;How much of yourself can you remove before you stop being you?&quot;<br>I think there&#39;s no such an amount. The more you remove, the less you are being you.<br>You wont suddenly become someone or something else. You will be 99% you, 95% you, 90%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 5%, 1%, 0.001% and when your last cell is removed, 0% (empty space).<br>So, if I have to give a number, I&#39;d say 1 cell. When you remove 1 cell from you, you are no more you. Because the definition of &quot;you&quot; includes that cell which is now removed.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVmkDUkZT4&amp;t=1m26s\">1:26</a><br>&quot;Does this mean that a part of you became a part of another person or is this other body keeping a part of you alive?&quot;<br>I think the answer will be &quot;both&quot; if we replace the word &quot;you&quot; with &quot;old you&quot; to make things more clear. <br>The organ is the part of old you and not the part of the old &quot;other body&quot;. <br>Also, it is no more part of the new you and it is the part of the new &quot;other body&quot;.<br>So, it is both part of old you and part of new &quot;other body&quot;<br>I&#39;m not a native speaker but I think if we don&#39;t replace the word &quot;you &quot; with &quot;old you&quot;, the answer would be the first option.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVmkDUkZT4&amp;t=1m46s\">1:46</a><br>&quot;At which point would they become you?&quot;<br>While in transfer, both of you no more exist. Because as I explained above, the moment your first cell is transfered, you are no more you. <br>You are replaced by newly created and different persons. However, at the end, both of you will be recreated. We can abstract this process with the word &quot;teleportation&quot;. However I dont think this is technically a teleportation.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVmkDUkZT4&amp;t=3m40s\">3:40</a><br>&quot;How much of Henriata is in these cells?&quot;<br>1 divided by her total number of cells<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVmkDUkZT4&amp;t=3m44s\">3:44</a><br>&quot;What makes one of your cells you anyway?&quot;<br>They are connected to the other parts of you.

It\u2019s a copy...<br><br>This is why if someone looses a limb I don\u2019t feel like they have lost a part of them selves really, but if they loose their memories car accident, dementia...

Yes, a lot of cells die and are replaced, but not neurons (simplified).

How much of your body can be taken away before you cease to be &quot;you&quot;? Well, all of it, except your brain.

For to hear the buzz of the fly and to answer it actively by giving it its rights of life, and not to hear the prayers for eternity made through the tongues of the above twenty truths of innumerable human rights which reverberate through the heavens and earth like thunder, and to transgress all those rights, and for a wisdom which as is testified to by the order of the fly&#39;s wing wastes not even such a wing, to waste utterly man&#39;s abilities, which are bound by those truths, and his hopes and desires, which reach out to eternity, and the many bonds and truths of the universe which nourish those abilities and desires, would be such an injustice and so impossible and such a tyrannical ugliness that all beings which testify to the Names of Truth, Preserver, All-Wise, All-Beauteous, and All-Compassionate reject it, declaring it to be utterly impossible and precluded. Thus, in reply to our question to our Creator about resurrection, the Names of Truth, Preserver, All-Wise, All-Beauteous, and All-Compassionate, say: &quot;Just as we are truth and reality, and the beings that testify to us are true, so the resurrection of the dead is true and certain.&quot;<br>Risale-i Nur Collection Rays  239- Bedi\u00fczzaman Said Nursi", "comment_date": "2019-09-01T17:59:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quiet", "comment_text": "Lacking moral compass due to an absence of consciousness a cancer cell is exempt from blame.

We are a continuously running consciousness perpetuated by a self-repairing body. We aren&#39;t our cells, we aren&#39;t the matter. We are the net result of the systems of the body working together, and as long as that process isn&#39;t interrupted, we stay around. This makes sense to me because it&#39;s the only unique thing I can point to. It can&#39;t be our exact configuration, because you could theoretically clone that (see Star Trek transporters). It&#39;s also why you could theoretically transfer yourself out of the flesh body... maybe. Here&#39;s how I think you could do it. <br><br>If your brain can contain you, then it can still contain you if you lose one brain cell. You lose brain cells all the time. So, you could replace that one brain cell, with a synthetic replica or equivalent. Do that, and you&#39;re still you. That means you could replace another brain cell, then another. There&#39;s no one point where it makes sense to say that you stop existing, and a clone starts existing. It&#39;s a similar form of replacement to what we experience constantly, yet we still exist. Therefore, you could replace every cell in your body with something else and still be you, as long as the mental process of &quot;you&quot; doesn&#39;t stop. Don&#39;t think of this like the Ship of Theseus, at best the ship would be your body, not you. The ship is not conscious, it does not have a &quot;self&quot;. The analogy doesn&#39;t really work.

But although our existance is completely dependant on material requirements, the self is an &quot;experience&quot;, derived from matter sure, but not equivalenbt to matter. I think we should view this &quot;experience&quot; as another phenomena of existance other then matter (although one is dependant on the other). So, can we then say that we actually experience a &quot;you&quot;, a &quot;me&quot;, a constant self? In the breif moment I dare say yes, but over time, the experience of who we are seems to shift and change.

Answer: I am simply an emergent property of the thermal energy and entropy that is utilized, and manipulated by the individual cells that comprise this body.

Individual parts of this movement like cells, or organs are still a part of this emergence. Influencing the next layer of emergence. If you take layers of this emergence and swap them with others, or take them apart into individual cells. The notes, and instruments still play their own unique melody while contributing to the next layer of emergence. The final layer of emergence that is you is a delicate melody where to much interference changes, or ends the melody. The emergence still claims to be the same while ignoring that itself is indeed a different emergence than before. The sub layers to this emergence replace themselves completely every seven years.

All of this emergence is just causality. It seems like a true scientific definition of a god.

Even if you don&#39;t think of yourself as a creative person, just by acting or even existing in any way, you are pushing the causality further and further down the line.

The species at the top of the food chain has the ability to clone living organisms.  It is a Parasite that every human in the world has and its been in us since day one on our existence.  The Parasite is Hookworm and Medical Science calls it Cutaneous Larva Migrants.  Science knows only a tiny fraction of the life processes of the Human Hookworm  within the body and nothing about it&#39;s &#39;Larva&#39; that it produces.  This Larva is what causes Cancer and a host of other sicknesses, including &#39;Aging&#39;.   Aging is a sickness because the Larva are cloning ourselves into them.  If the Larva doesn&#39;t kill you by sickness, it will certainly kill you when your body can no longer ward it off.  As you start to age, eyesite starts to diminish.  Cateracs are Larva growing in the pulple.  Hearing diminishes because of build up ofLarva in the ear canals.  Samething as &#39;Surfer Ear&#39;  Google image Surfer Ear and you will see the Larva growing.  Remember what it looks like for further reference.  It would be appropriate to call this Parasite &#39;Larva&#39;.  The Larva are what causes the majority of all of our sicknesses, including all Cancers and Degenerative Diseases.  The Cure to Cancer is so elusive because it is one Culpret that is responsible for all sicknesses.  That&#39;s why we have so many deadly sicknesses with no answers to what it is and what causes it.  It has a collective mind of its own and know that humans are easily fooled by it, even though it&#39;s right in front of our eyes.   Humans boast being so smart, yet we&#39;re being outsmarted by a &#39;Worm&#39;.  But this is no ordinary worm with its ability to clone us into them.  They reach maturity in the human body in approximately 65 too 70 years which is the average life span of a human.  After death, your body will completely turn into the Larva.  This is what we call &#39;Mold&#39; and is unimaginably embedded into our World and environment.  The Earth is a living form of life, as is Water, Land, Clouds and Wind.  The Elements live, see, parent and protect children and have emotions just like we do.  Thats why we see things in the clouds like angels and faces in the clouds.  It is a crossroads/intersection of Life as we know it and Earth all in gasous form.  Google image clouds and supercells and you will see Eyes within most all images.  Some are faint and some are startling because it gazes upon you.  If Medical Science can kill the &#39;Larva&#39; then Immortality can be achieved.  From there on, I can only speculate the outcome.  I can go on and on about this subject  and am currently creating videos to express my amazing numerous discoveries of Life, Earth and Universe.   Once one discovery was made, it was like seeing a Vista of discoveries, some good and some not so good.  Ask any question to unknown questions and an unimaginable accurate answer will follow.  I did not set out in search of these discoveries, instead they found me.

This almost makes sense, but would that mean that if a brain were to be exactly replicated, the person in that brain would control two brains? <br><br>What I am trying to say is that most ways to define who someone is, do have flaws. And one flaw that is consistent through most of them is this: <br>If there were to be an exact copy of someone, either that person would be controlling both bodies with the same mind, or they would be different persons, but with the same looks, thinking process and memory. If the second possibility is the case, then that would mean that if those two copies of each other experience anything, anything at all, different from each other, if they began looking differently, thinking differently and/or knowing different stuff, they would not be copies anymore. They would be like any normal one-egged twins. Similar, but not the same person.<br><br>The only way to define a person without this flaw would be to define them by their consciousness, or their &quot;soul&quot;.<br><br>And this is where it becomes unclear and merely just speculations.<br>We don&#39;t know what consciousness is. We just know that it is what defines us. <br>Our consciousness, soul, what makes us ourselves, is just something that can&#39;t be changed. If it could be changed, it wouldn&#39;t feel like we&#39;re the same person as we used to be before. <br><br>Since we don&#39;t know what consciousness is, that means we&#39;re still no further in explaining who we are than what those who believe in souls and reincarnation were/are. <br><br>Because if consciousness truly cannot be changed, is what defines us, and not our memories, cells or thinking methods, that means we can and most likely will be reincarnated in some way. If we were reincarnated, we wouldn&#39;t remember our past lives at all. It would be as if we weren&#39;t reincarnated. The only difference would be that it wouldn&#39;t be completely nothing after death. Surely, we would never know that we will ever live again or that we&#39;ve lived before, but it&#39;s still better than nothing, right?<br><br><br>PS: Now that I&#39;ve reread this for myself, I think I should have a warning for a potential existential crisis...", "comment_date": "2018-06-28T19:19:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "???", "comment_text": "Justin Y isn&#39;t here!", "comment_date": "2018-06-28T19:03:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "____________________", "comment_text": "This video didn\u2019t even attempt to answer the question it posed.

In an attempt to search for meaning in existence, humanity creates ideas such as the spirit and religion which provides comfort and satisfies some people&#39;s lust for meaning. But religion isn&#39;t right. We have disproved religion using science, which we believe is truthful. Those of us who subscribe to the ideas of science are then left with a meaning-shaped hole in their existence. Science doesn&#39;t provide meaning, which means the truth is that meaning is a false hope. Creatures that question their own existence question the idea of life, and what it actually means to live. But living organisms are just, as this video explains, collections of systems which are controlled by firing neurons. But the neurons aren&#39;t controlled by anything. Neurons fire without any signal or action causing them to happen. In essence, they are entirely random. These neurons are what consciousness is comprised of, and since consciousness is the idea of control over an organism&#39;s entire being, and since consciousness is created by a random process, does that mean complete consciousness in a living organism such as humanity is a paradox? Life contradicts consciousness and so the two can&#39;t coincide, so it must be a paradox, right?

This has been a long standing philosophical question usually know as Ship of Theseus. The original question was: if you gradually replace every part of a ship, is it still the same ship?<br>Heraclitus was also perceptive enough, depsite not having the knowledge of modern science, to suggest that since we&#39;re perpetually chaning, we don&#39;t actually have identities. &quot;You can never enter the same river, since the water is always moving&quot;. Thus he said that &quot;nothing is, but everything is becoming.&quot; One of his students, who&#39;s name escapes my memory at the moment, went even furhter and jokingly said that since names are attached to identity and we have no lasting identity, we shouldn&#39;t even name things, but simply point in them. (Kind of reminds me of that passage from &#39;100 Years of Solitude&#39; when Marquez writes: &quot;It was back in the days when a lot of things weren&#39;t named yet and we had to point at everything&quot;).<br>Another philosophical reference I rememebr is that of Marcus Aurelius in his &quot;Meditations&quot; who takes the view expressed in the video around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVmkDUkZT4&amp;t=05m27s\">05:27</a>, that since we all share the same elements and atoms (which at that point was thought to be undivisable (the meaning of the word atom) and eternal), our identity remains in them even after our death.<br>Another view on the subject, also mentioned in the video, is that identity from the very get go was a mistaken concept. This view has been held by certain religions in Eastern Asia, such as certain types of Buddhism and Hinduism, and is also thoroughly discussed in Herman Hesse&#39;s &quot;Steppenwolf&quot;.<br>My own personal opinion is that identities are simply useful. Somewhat of a pragmatic view. As Bertran Russell said &quot;matter is simply a convenient way of grouping events&quot; so is identity a quite handy tool in order to actually avoid simply pointing at stuff. Alternatively one could say that the illusion of identity, if it is indeed an illusion, is so strong that for us it may as well be true. Once again, this a sort of pragmatism of Peirce and James, but in this insatnce I&#39;m willing to subscribe to it. I am a completely different person, both physically and mentally, from that time when I deposited money into my bank account, but let me pretend for the sake of convenience that I&#39;m the same person, so I can have the money to buy things...", "comment_date": "2017-06-16T13:56:42Z", "likes_count": 105}, {"comment_by": "Generic Profile", "comment_text": "I want to watch a video not contemplate myself again.", "comment_date": "2017-06-16T02:19:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cennty", "comment_text": "I wanted to learn something, not have an exisentsial crysis", "comment_date": "2017-06-15T20:26:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chris c", "comment_text": "According to this video, I am some kind of weird bird thing and everybody else around me is the same creature.

A particle can also be a wave. Cause and effect does not necessarily have to be linear. What happened now is not necessarily the only thing that could have happened because of what happened before now. An electron doesn&#39;t have to be in one place, it could be in another. Virtually anything is possible, and in another universe, some&quot;where&quot; else, it has already happened. In fact, if you had a silly dream as a child that you never achieved, probability and quantum physics dictates that there is another you who achieved that dream. You may not be the same you that you were yesterday, the universe the same one it was seconds ago, but does it truly matter? Things change. Everything changes. Or, perhaps, everything is remade anew in every moment. Think about it. You could become someone new and different and amazing, and be as true to yourself as you were as a child.

It&#39;s really misleading when you say that your cells don&#39;t have basically the same DNA because they absolutely do. 1,000 mutations is actually an incredibly small number compared to the THREE BILLION chances you have for mutations.", "comment_date": "2016-09-01T01:51:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mancan", "comment_text": "\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u258c\u2592\u2588\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2584\u2580\u2592\u258c<br>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u258c\u2592\u2592\u2580\u2584\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2584\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2590<br>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2590\u2584\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2590<br>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2588\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2588\u2592\u2590<br>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2584\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2592\u258c<br>\u2500\u2500\u2590\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2580\u2584\u2592\u2592\u258c                   <br>\u2500\u2500\u258c\u2592\u2592\u2590\u2584\u2588\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2580\u2588\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2588\u2592\u2590<br>\u2500\u2590\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u258c\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2580\u2584\u258c       The invasion has begun......<br>\u2500\u258c\u2592\u2580\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u258c<br>\u2500\u258c\u2580\u2590\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u258c\u2584\u2592\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2590<br>\u2590\u2592\u2580\u2590\u2580\u2590\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2584\u2592\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u258cCopy &amp; Paste this on every video you see.<br>\u2590\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2580\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2590<br>\u2500\u258c\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u258c<br>\u2500\u2590\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2590<br>\u2500\u2500\u2580\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u258c<br>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2580\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2580<br>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2590\u2580\u2592\u2580\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2584\u2580<br>\u2500\u2500\u2590\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2580", "comment_date": "2016-08-31T22:42:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joes Spot", "comment_text": "There is one thing that can escape death and that&#39;s energy. We are spheres of energetic probes harnessed by the universe and it&#39;s because we are possessors of energy that has an awareness that we are the means by which the universe becomes aware of itself. So, if you know you exist, then you do. So what makes you, you? Who are &quot;we&quot;? Our brains? Our brains are a body part like our fingernails and our hearts. Why is that the part that&#39;s makes us? It doesn&#39;t, because we have a sort of voice that&#39;s in our heads, the part of us that thinks, that feels, that is aware that we exist at all. So, if you&#39;re aware you exist, then you do. That&#39;s why when we die, we&#39;re still here, as energy. That&#39;s our awareness. What&#39;s true in our minds and in our awareness, is true, whether some people know it or not. Our bodies are just vehicles. We are energy driving a meat coated skeleton made from star dust, riding on a rock that&#39;s hurling through space. These videos describe everything physical. You are all &quot;gods&quot;. God is consciousness... not a creator. God is the source of creation, the energy. It (not he or she). It is not independent of you. It is the totality of everything. So when I call you all &quot;Gods&quot;, I am not talking about your personal self. I am talking about the expression of the god self that rests inside of you. The verb.... the energy, not the noun. We all caress the infinite light, the verb, the energy. Once, you think god is a noun, person, place or thing, you&#39;ve separate yourself from it and immediately you become a limited being. That&#39;s what separates the believers (religious) from the know-ers (spiritual). You decide by the way in which you apply your energy what is love and what is hate.<br><br>Many people use religion to avoid finding themselves because they&#39;re scared of what they might represent. The scariest day for man is when he starts thinking on his own. Find yourselves and your place in this world. If we don&#39;t awaken and discover ourselves, we will be easily exploited and led like cattle. No power establishment allows this to happen, because the real self is dangerous for the established church, dangerous for the state, dangerous for the crowd, dangerous for the tradition, because once a person knows his real self and finds himself, he becomes an individual. Independent from everything else, conscience, informed and capable of critical thinking. He no longer belongs to the mob psychology. He will not be superstitious. He cannot be exploited and he cannot be led like cattle. He cannot be ordered and commanded. He will live according to his light or energy. He will live from his own inwardness. His life will have tremendous beauty and integrity. That is the fear of the power establishment.<br><br>Integrated persons become individuals, and the society wants you to be non-individuals. Instead of individuality, the society teaches you to be a personality. The word &quot;personality&quot; has to be understood. It comes from the root, persona, which means a mask. The society gives you a false idea of who you are, it gives you just a toy, and you go on clinging to the toy your whole life, just like a dream. Society gives you this personality whether it&#39;s a police officer, a lawyer, a doctor, or some public official that clouds your judgement from doing the right thing and instead you do what you can for money. It gives you an excuse to commit harms against others because of a &quot;god&quot; that forgives you or a country that calls for your &quot;duty.&quot; You hide behind your badge, uniform or religious robe, not aware that you&#39;re making a separation between the unified creation. We shouldn&#39;t separate ourselves in a universe that unites us just because we&#39;re a little unsure of who we are. We are energy, driving a meat-coated skeleton made from stardust, riding on a rock that&#39;s hurling through space.

So wen you transplant and organ the person who get a new organ didnt become someone else. It&#39;s just better help to keep us alive, but that person still remains with HIS brain. We can keep replacing our body parts as much as we wabt, but as long as we have our brain, we are still we.And by this logic, it makes sense that you cannot transport brains for example. When our brain dies, we stop being us and noone can become us and it is end of us. And in fact, here&#39;s the catch. Even if make it in future possible to make transplants of brains, here&#39;s the catch. If brain from person A gets transplated to body B, the body B is actually a person A.

More often than not, the language that is used amongst many scientists today is the confusion of why and how, where they will use why instead of how to describe the functions of the world. This is wrong. Science can never explain why because why steps beyond the natural (bound to the laws of the universe) and into the supernatural (beyond the laws of physics). In order for you to assume why something happened (the purpose behind something) you need to assume that there is a reason for it. If there is reason there must be a design because design is the manifestation of order for those reasons. If there is a design to the Universe there has to be a Master Designer, and the only one who claim to be such a Master Designer is an omnipotent God who created and knows everything. Why? Because without God, we would only be here by random chance. If there is no God, there is no life after death because there is nothing beyond this dimension. That&#39;s why I believe in the existence of the soul which is not bound to our physical existence. It is eternal. I believe that my conscious self was created by God because there is no explanation for my conscious self through just biological processes that are found within my brain. Animals, particularly other mammals, do have very similar structures in their brains, even go through similar thought processes as humans when working through their means to survival. Dogs can understand human commands. Gorilla&#39;s can even learn sign language, but then neither have the ability to ask questions. Only humans can, and that is what makes human clearly distinct. We are living beings. We know what it means to be. Dogs do not. Gorillas do not. They live in the moment, and they cannot interact with their memories in the way that we can, not just as a way to learn, but also to plan for the future.", "comment_date": "2016-06-05T20:29:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pro One", "comment_text": "Ist das ein deutscher Kanal oder wieso hei\u00dft der Kurzgesagt?", "comment_date": "2016-06-05T20:26:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YeahGetThaT", "comment_text": "I hear some David Hume in this piece! @ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVmkDUkZT4&amp;t=1m55s\">1:55</a>", "comment_date": "2016-06-05T20:19:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Dennis", "comment_text": "What happened to this channel...", "comment_date": "2016-06-05T20:09:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Baun", "comment_text": "I am a dolphin with a hat\ud83d\ude44.", "comment_date": "2016-06-05T20:07:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ani Vasion", "comment_text": "That we will never know the answers to these things is the most frustrating feeling I know.", "comment_date": "2016-06-05T20:01:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ani Vasion", "comment_text": "That we will never know the answers to these things is the most frustrating feeling I know.", "comment_date": "2016-06-05T20:00:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JokuRandomPoju", "comment_text": "This video fucked Up my brain.", "comment_date": "2016-06-05T19:53:55Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "computo2000", "comment_text": "&quot;...So we might just be a self-sustaining pattern without clear borders that gained awareness at some point and now has the ability to think about itself through time and space, <b>but really only exists in this exact very moment</b>&quot;<br><br>I am a little disappointed.

The fact that a new type of cells derived from original cells were created has nothing to do with Henrietta! To make it even more obvious, I make cells that my kids are made of, how much of me is in my kids? NONE! Because our existence and life is not conditioned by matter. Only our physical form is.

The body as we understand it is a close knit community of individual cells. Within the cell, we find yet another, even smaller community which comprises the individual (the cell itself, in this scale). On the macro we participate in societies, not just with each other, but other organisms as well. We assume in this video that cells are devoid of consciousness. To establish this we must agree on what consciousness is. Some set the bar rather high, I think. For example, why would one presume that without the &quot;theory of mind&quot; a body cannot still posses a self? I do not see the correlation. &quot;theory of mind&quot; is a specific &quot;idea&quot; of what consciousness is. I do not feel it adequately describes consciousness. Intelligence, self awareness, and consciousness are not the same thing. We presume that micro organisms do not experience pain because they lack a nervous system. This may be so, but they respond to noxious stimuli with aversion or dormancy...  is  this is not a cellular reflection of what we refer to as pain? One&#39;s consciousness, in my view, is the aggregation of the communication and collaboration between your cells. Your cells themselves are sophisticated communities of molecules, communicating and collaborating. Our bodies also collaborate in social groups. Within these groups we see similar compartmentalization and specialization that we find in lesser scales. Organelle, Organ, Organization. If you absorb my precepts, one obvious question arises. If what we perceive as ourselves is the communication and collaboration between our cells, is there a potential for a sensate social consciousness to arise? An awareness of a Self within a body of bodies akin to our experience as a Self. Does it exist already? Would you know? Do your cells know you exist?

The body as we understand it is a close knit community of individual cells. Within the cell, we find yet another, even smaller community which comprises the individual (the cell itself, in this scale). On the macro we participate in societies, not just with each other, but other organisms as well. We assume in this video that cells are devoid of consciousness. To establish this we must agree on what consciousness is. Some set the bar rather high, I think. For example, why would one presume that without the &quot;theory of mind&quot; a body cannot still posses a self? I do not see the correlation. &quot;theory of mind&quot; is a specific &quot;idea&quot; of what consciousness is. I do not feel it adequately describes consciousness. Intelligence, self awareness, and consciousness are not the same thing. We presume that micro organisms do not experience pain because they lack a nervous system. This may be so, but they respond to noxious stimuli with aversion or dormancy...  is  this is not a cellular reflection of what we refer to as pain? One&#39;s consciousness, in my view, is the aggregation of the communication and collaboration between your cells. Your cells themselves are sophisticated communities of molecules, communicating and collaborating. Our bodies also collaborate in social groups. Within these groups we see similar compartmentalization and specialization that we find in lesser scales. Organelle, Organ, Organization. If you absorb my precepts, one obvious question arises. If what we perceive as ourselves <b>is</b> the communication and collaboration between our cells, is there a potential for a sensate social consciousness to arise? An awareness of a <b>Self</b> within a body of bodies akin to our experience as a <b>Self</b>. Does it exist already? Would you know? Do your cells know <b>you</b> exist?

Absolutely everything is constantly changing, so what we give names to is entirely arbitrary.

The problem is, that baby will never stop changing, within a couple of years it will no longer even be called a baby, but it will continue having the same name.  Try not to think about it as an object, but as a story.  A human is a thing, and every thing that can be observed is also a story.  We observe things, but we name their stories.  If you find a mountain and name it, you are naming more than you are observing.  You are naming the mountain from the time it was formed until the time it no longer exists.  That is not a thing, that is a story, because everything is constantly changing.<br><br>That was not an easy idea to communicate, but to sum it up, we do not name the things that we see, we name their stories.  When an object changes, we see something else, but the story keeps on going.  Just like a human, it will never stop changing, but its name will stay the same.

We are a result of this configuration of various atoms and molecules with so and so biological purpose, which all work together to project our consciousness. This differs from spirituality, however, in that the software is not your soul. It is simply the phenomenon that occurs when the various lobes of your brain are having electrical interplay amongst each other. This also differs from the &#39;philosophical&#39; part of this video, where the video describes consciousness as a collective pool of entity with no clear borders, which is then housed into our bodies. There is no pool of such an entity. It doesnt exist outside of our bodies, but as a result of our bodies. Taken another way, &#39;you&#39; may one day be projected by a device entirely artificial and manmade, making our bodies simple the current most advanced latticework to run us.", "comment_date": "2016-05-31T21:41:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew James", "comment_text": "Doesn&#39;t this just boil down to a rigorous definition of &quot;you&quot;?

You cannot. Doctors have a very low opinion of evolution, they call it cancer. Every mutation observed has been shown to reduce the genome&#39;s information, not increase it. In humans, there are approximately 100 information destroying mutations (which get passed on to your offspring) per generation. Otherwise, we could just DNA test grand parents and grand kids, and find the latter to have a larger genome than the former, so that all the life on Earth was evidence for evolution.

Take note that this is mostly me mimicking Buddhist philosophy. The idea of anything physical being &#39;you&#39; is a null concept. You are not your organs, you are not your cells, you are not your DNA, and you are not your atoms. You are your consciousness. Even if parts of your body are removed bit by bit, as long as your consciousness is still intact, you are still yourself. So if you donate your organs to someone, you did not put a part of yourself inside someone, because that organ does not hold your consciousness. You are simply gifting a complex lump of cells that used to belong to you. Similarly, once you are dead, any part of you is not you anymore.<br><br>But there&#39;s more. What we consider the &#39;self&#39; is incredibly complex and dynamic. We may think we only die once, but over the course of a lifetime we die thousands, maybe millions of times. We change much more than we realize over the course of time, and what we identify as &#39;us&#39; is subject to change at any moment. Either from the proccess of maturation, life experiences, trauma, enlightenment, or even changes in our biochemistry, what we consider &#39;us&#39; may change even faster than our physical body can go through cells, even to the point where we may seem like an entirely different person.<br><br>Sorry if that seemed a bit rambling, I just wanted to get that out there.", "comment_date": "2016-05-31T20:24:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rashed", "comment_text": "So wait Mitochondria were once just bacteria and they merged with us?

If we can assume everyone has this property, then we must assume anything with a brain has it, because thinking is only the interaction between neurons, not something only humans have.

So long as you don&#39;t sever continuity you will always be you, which is one of the major issues with one-step teleportation and brain uploading. In order to properly maintain &quot;you&quot; between the beginning and end of either procedure, you NEED to maintain mental continuity, so at some point a single consciousness MUST be active using resources from both the old and the new. Either procedure could be done during sleep, as uncomfortable as it may sound, but the brain must remain active throughout the gradual process. The ship of Theseus is correct in assuming it is  the same ship, but only if it has the same crew, the same continuity. if the boat is given to another crew, it has a new continuity, and the new ship of the old crew supplants it. Granted, you could argue the same &quot;if a member of the crew dies and is replaced, and over the course of time all members do the same, is it still the same crew?&quot;, but I would counter and say that, so long as there was a period where it was mostly the old crew with the new member in it, this new member becomes part of what is considered the old crew and is no longer considered a new member when the next new member comes, only a younger member.<br><br>Additionally, to discuss the cell-swapping example in this video, I&#39;d say that &quot;you&quot; don&#39;t move anywhere. &quot;You&quot; are located in one spot, and as one cell at a time is incorporated into your body, so long as it is a brain cell, it becomes a part of your mental continuity. Granted, there would be a point where eventually you would lose all your memories and only have the memories of the other person, and the same to them, so this process would likely result in personality death or at least extreme mental stress as you feel yourself lose all recollection of who &quot;you&quot; are, which would be horrible, but &quot;you&quot; itself would not move regardless.", "comment_date": "2016-05-31T19:57:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jere.S", "comment_text": "great vide. keep it up", "comment_date": "2016-05-31T19:57:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Warelis", "comment_text": "Nice!

Indeed, in the game&#39;s story (SPOILER ALERT) a pattern/light phenomenon  is discovered by a pair of astronomers and dubbed simply the Pattern. Its physics-bending and liquid-light nature aside it is upheld throughout the story that the Pattern is just that, not a thing, not a being, but a.... phenomenon that has somehow achieved sentience. It is said explicitly that it is not a &#39;thing&#39;, nor is it &#39;alive&#39;, it is &quot;something we do not have a word for&quot;. The idea is very intriguing and it deals basically with what the video is about: is it &#39;alive&#39; if it doesnt have a body? Is it sentient if it doesnt have a brain? What is the simplest, most stripped down form of life? WHAT IS LIFE? <br><br>Personally even without the game and this video to consider I was of the mind that since life cannot be assigned to a physical quantity it is an closer to an idea or pattern, a phenomenon that arises from a certain arrangement of certain elements, self preserving like an infinite feedback loop. Not much more significant or essential to universe than a rock rolling down a hill, just a natural consequence of the few simple laws that construct the world. Do we really need a meaning behind such events? We can describe how it happened, what conditions lead to what outcomes, but to say that there is a need for &#39;reason&#39;? Does a rock need a reason to roll down? No, it just does. It moves from a position of high potential energy in the central gravitational field of the bigger rock it is in contact with (ie The Earth) to a position of lower potential energy.

Society doesn&#39;t exist without the people that make it up but a person can exist without society. Society has a general consciousness (or a movement? I don&#39;t know how to word this...) in a way. People who go along with the established ways of living would be normal cells. They live and die really quickly and don&#39;t really matter much individually but still form a small part of something that keeps society alive. People who rebel against society and turn it over, making it into something else would be the &quot;cancer&quot; (not saying rebels are always bad). I&#39;m sorry this isn&#39;t coming out right. I&#39;m hoping someone will know what I&#39;m talking about. If one person (or many people) move to a new place (new society) and conform to the societally acceptable way to live there, they become part of that society but they were still made originally by the old one so they are part of both kind of but mostly the new one. When they die (very quickly), their children will grow up 100% in the new society and most likely live in the acceptable way there so they&#39;ll be 100% part of the new society.So anyways if I continued along this line of thought, a society is that society because the people in it interact in a certain way that allows the society to move and do things &quot;consciously&quot;. A person is that person because the cells in it interact in a certain way that allows the person to move and do things consciously. Most societies share certain ways that people interact. People all share certain ways that cells interact (ie heart cells). Each society has a few slightly different ways that people interact. Each person has a few slightly different ways that cells interact (ie different ways of thinking). I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m not saying anything new by saying this but its a way of picturing it at the very least I guess..?

If we try to be &#39;objective&#39; and watch from outside of time, and life really is a giant chain of bodies coming out of other bodies, wouldn&#39;t life itself be one giant &#39;self&#39; and wouldnt &#39;we&#39; be just akin to its &#39;cells&#39;? Living and existing to sustain the continuity of a greater body? Maybe the only reason you think of yourself as &#39;you&#39; in the first place is simply evolutionary. It&#39;d be convenient for our survival if we thought of &#39;our body&#39; as a whole, not an ecossystem, but the concept of self would be no more than a tool. It&#39;s all just a pattern, parts over parts over parts, working &#39;cause they worked before.

Here we are again. Painting pictures on a wall. I can\u2019t decide what to write about, so I\u2019ll just write what comes to mind. It won\u2019t be perfect, and it won\u2019t be eloquent, but at least, it\u2019ll be. And isn\u2019t that what matters? Being? Thoughts come into and pass through your mind like water passes through a river, forgotten in the sea of time. A vessel can only hold so little of it, but a portion of a fraction of a miniscule percentage, and only for so much time before it spills or crumbles to dust. But for a moment, we may behold it, and perhaps for a time it will remain, so that it is given a life it did not choose. The great flow never stops, but occasionally, it floods. The rains feed the sea in a cycle that never ends, except in death, but is death the end, or merely another beginning? Are beginnings ends of times of oblivion or are they just a human effort to put starts and ends in a journey where nothing applies. And what of the erosion, of the crumbling of the banks against the unrelenting power of the stream?  I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever know. But I don\u2019t ask for the answer, I ask for the question.<br>Plans. Plans I\u2019ll never follow. Goals I won\u2019t achieve. Dreams that don\u2019t come to fruition. Why do I do it all? Because effort matters. Time matters. And even if I don\u2019t get where I want to be, at least I\u2019ll never be where I was, again. Maybe lower, but ropes and ladders will stay to climb. Do I burn them, so that I never have to drown? No. Falling is inevitable. Failing is inevitable. Pain is inevitable. Suffering, is optional.<br>Choices. Decisions. Will. Is identity the purity of action and intention? What hidden chains do I pull against? What subtle knife is aimed at my throat? The conscious and subconscious fight when it is better for them in harmony for neither can comprehend the concept of compromise and neither would trade an opportunity to do what they want. The blade is mine, and the chains are stitched of my own sinew and bone. To break them, is to break me.<br>Freedom. Power. Perhaps I should be broken. Remade, forged into something different, better, more. Why am I so attached to the concept of reality and myself when they are ever changing but may never be destroyed?", "comment_date": "2016-05-31T15:38:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "M M", "comment_text": "You are not you", "comment_date": "2016-05-31T15:38:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mongis Lort", "comment_text": "You are what you think.", "comment_date": "2016-05-31T15:38:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mistereo", "comment_text": "I believe that whats you , isnt your body , your cells , your brain .

With language we could structure our thoughts and share them more easily, as well as ask questions. That being said, I don&#39;t believe any individual cell can possess consciousness.
