The so-called ocean conveyor belt is very important for our climate. This term describes a combination of currents that result in four of the five global oceans exchanging water with each other. They form a worldwide circulation system.\r<br>The conveyor belt is also called the \u201cThermohaline Circulation\u201d, with thermo referring to the temperature, and \u201chaline\u201d to the salt content of the water. Both determine the density of the water.\r<br>While the masses of water may be moved in part by wind, primarily the different densities of the global oceans are responsible for their movement.\r<br>Warm water has a lower density and rises.\r<br>Cold water sinks.\r<br>The water density also increases with a higher sat content.\r<br>At the equator the heat from the sun is especially strong, resulting in a lot of evaporation and thus a rise in the water\u2019s salt content. That is where the Gulf Stream begins.\r<br>The Gulf Stream is very important for the European climate. Its length of 10,000 km makes it one of the largest and fastest currents on Earth, and it\u2019s very warm.\r<br>At roughly 2/m per second it brings up to 100,000,000 m3 of water per second toward Europe.\r<br>A constantly blowing wind, the southeast trade wind, drives warm surface water to the northwest, into the Gulf of Mexico, where it heats up to 30\u00baC.\r<br>The turning of the Earth and the west winds then direct the Gulf of Mexico towards Europe and split it up. One part flows south, another east to the Canary Current, and a third part flows north where it releases a lot of heat into the atmosphere as the North Atlantic Current. the water becomes colder there.\r<br>Its salt content and density rise on account of evaporation, and it drops down between Greenland, Norway, and Iceland. There we also find the largest waterfall on Earth: the so-called Chimneys, roughly 15-km-wide pillars with water falling up to 4,000 m.   17,000,000 m3 of water per second, or roughly 15 times more water than is carried by all the rivers in the world.\r<br>This creates a strong maelstrom, which constantly pulls in new water and is the reason that Gulf Stream moves toward Europe.\r<br>Countless species use the Gulf Stream as a means of transport on their trip from the Caribbean to the northern areas. But it doesn\u2019t just bring us animals, an enormous quantity of the warm air also comes with it. In order to produce the same heat that it brings the shores of Europe, we would need 1,000,000 nuclear power plants. That&#39;s why we also call the Gulf Stream a heat pump.\r<br>Without it, the temperature would be significantly colder here, at least 5 to 10 degrees. Instead of lush fields we would have long winters and sparse ice-covered landscapes in Europe.\r<br>In the last few years, scientists and pundits in the media have repeatedly expressed the fear that the Gulf Stream could come to a standstill due to climate change.\r<br>Because if the polar caps actually melt, the salt content in water of Greenland would fall, as would its density. The North Atlantic current would no longer be heavy enough, and so it wouldn\u2019t sink as usual. In the worst case, that would bring the Gulf Stream, our heat pump, to a stop.\r<br>Some climate experts also assume that climate change could compensate for this effect.\r<br>We know that it can be normal for the climate to change by looking at the development of the Earth over the last few million years.\r<br>There are ice ages and warm periods:\r<br>In the last ice age, a gigantic flood of melting water crippled the heat-bringing North Atlantic Current, covering the Northern Hemisphere in ice.\r<br>Scientist have different views of the impacts that climate change will have on the global ocean conveyor belt, but one thing is clear: when climate changes, then the complex system of ocean currents and winds, which has remained fairly stable since the last ice age, will change in ways that we don\u2019t yet understand.\r<br><br>HOPE IT&#39;S USEFUL!!! : )<br>(HAVE A NICE DAY!)", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T20:28:00Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Dani Zanzibar", "comment_text": "Climate change is a load of BULLSHIT LOL", "comment_date": "2020-10-17T13:59:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pipe cleaner Master", "comment_text": "The first intro", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T13:05:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keith Lipkowski", "comment_text": "I didn\u2019t this video became 7 years old today.", "comment_date": "2020-10-11T04:47:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "That Meme", "comment_text": "Man, I miss that old, simple intro Kurzgesagt had back in the day.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

The telluric currents mostly goes along similar paths as what is called the boundery of the so called &quot;tectonic plates&quot; and is the cause behind geological activity found there.<br>The reason why you can- but most often won&#39;t find earth quakes in places where the ocean is at it&#39;s deepest is because the telluric currents goes trough the salty ocean water instead of beneath the crust there.<br>Hawaii is as far as you can get from the so called &quot;ring of fire&quot;. So in popular theory you should expect it to be one of the least geologically active places on earth. But if you look at the map of the oceanic currents you will find that hawai exists in the midle of one. This is why you should expect Hawaii to be geologically active.<br>A nother important factor behind geological activity is when the current have to go back or forth between different media. When ever a current is experiencing a change, like a change in voltage, current dencity or temperature, a so called &quot;double layer&quot; will ocure. The double layers becomes a transitional boundery between plasma (or a medium that behaves like a plasma) of different properties. This results in the transiton from one property to a nother to become abrupt or step like, instead of having a smooth transition like in a gas.<br>The double layers is what they sound like. They are two sheats of denser charged plasma, that are parralel and very close to one and another. One of the sheets will be negativly charged and one will be possitivly charged. But the most important property here is that they tend to be unstable. So rappid changes, like a sudden increas or decreas in current, can cause the double layers to explode. This is the cause behind earth quakes.<br>So you should expect these double layers form when the currents exist in shallower water and near the sea shore. Because there you will find the currents to transition between a conductive charged molten rock media and a salty water media. It is in shallow water near the sea shore which you will find the most of the geological activity.<br>You should allso expect to find them to form when the currents go trough places where the altitude changes. When the altitude changes you will find a change in current density and a reduction in resistance of the currents that goes trough the molten rock under the crust. Which is why you will find mountainous terain to be geologically active, due to the sporadic formation of double layers.", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T13:16:59Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Theriwen", "comment_text": "good video", "comment_date": "2017-02-02T21:23:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Davincerica", "comment_text": "Why haven&#39;t we harvested this energy? :)", "comment_date": "2017-02-02T03:57:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheUKNutter", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuGrBhK2c7U&amp;t=4m13s\">4:13</a> LOL there&#39;s a Tardis", "comment_date": "2017-01-29T21:12:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aldis mengelsons", "comment_text": "I believe,i must say &quot;thanks&quot; to british petroleum...Good job guys!!!(  OIL SPILL, GULF OF MEXICO)...(<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Deepwater-Horizon-oil-spill-of-2010)...GS\">https://www.britannica.com/event/Deepwater-Horizon-oil-spill-of-2010)...GS</a> slowing down thats actually is a good thing-we in europe  going to get rise population of polar bears !!! :))))....then-kill the bear-get a coat-be in warm-shut the mouth!.....)))", "comment_date": "2017-01-18T22:35:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "grindupBaker", "comment_text": "There&#39;s a direct contradiction in this video with something that I&#39;m intending to figure out one day. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuGrBhK2c7U&amp;t=2m05s\">2:05</a> &quot;the turning of the Earth and the west winds then direct the Gulf Stream towards Europe&quot; and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuGrBhK2c7U&amp;t=3m43s\">3:43</a> &quot;...wouldn&#39;t sink as usual....that would bring the Gulf Stream our heat pump to a stop&quot;.

If this melting will continue when the Gulf Stream gets weaker is to be seen, but so far the melting rate is (probably) faster than the weakening rate of the Gulf Stream, which was last reported in perspective to a century while we can almost watch the ice melt.<br>On another note are the Phenomenons of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a that affect the Humboldt Stream between South America and Australia, with El Ni\u00f1o being the inversion of the current and La Ni\u00f1a the over strengthening of it due to air pressure. Both are becoming more frequent in recent years and can take effect on the weather on a world-wide scale. For examples: The Famine that was part of the reasons for the French Revolution is connected to them while El Ni\u00f1o in particular let two certain Wars with Russia fail miserably due to an induced harsh winter.

But nevertheless i cannot guarantee anything, all i see is evidence from other people that i cannot be sure of what is right or what is not. The only thing i am sure of is that i am veeeery much confused.", "comment_date": "2015-08-14T02:09:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Philfer87700", "comment_text": "er reason why gulf countries are richer.. lol", "comment_date": "2015-07-30T16:52:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Umut \u00d6zbaysar", "comment_text": "\u00d6ncelikle bu kanalda ki videolara kim altyaz\u0131 ekliyorsa te\u015fekk\u00fcr ederim.
