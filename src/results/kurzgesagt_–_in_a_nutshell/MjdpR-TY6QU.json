Many of them even named themselves after the name of the Christ for believing they can live forever even without obeying the Law that the Lord Jesus gave to Moses. \r<br>\r<br>Exodus 3:14\r<br>And God said to Moses, \u201cI AM WHO I AM.\u201d And He said, \u201cThus you shall say to the children of Israel, \u2018I AM has sent me to you.\u2019 \r<br>\r<br>John 8:58\r<br>Jesus said to them, \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>The result of disobedient life, people get sick, old and die without knowledge why these things happen to them. \r<br>\r<br>Job 36\r<br>If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. But if they do not obey, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.\r<br>\r<br>The Lord God who is the God of love showed mercy to them; He called Abraham out of the Gentile people and washed him by making him follow His laws and commandments. The Lord God\u2019s intention through Abraham\u2019s seeds that He will build a country as Israel where the Gentile people can seek His truth about their lives on earth and live by it, so that they can live as the tree, you cut it down but it grows back, and not as the animals. \r<br>\r<br>Job 14:7-10\r<br>For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its tender shoots will not cease. Though its root may grow old in the earth, and its stump may die in the ground, yet at the scent of water it will bud and bring forth branches like a plant. But man dies and is laid away; Indeed he breathes his last and where is he?\r<br>\r<br>So, Israel became a teacher of the Gentile people to guide them to the path of truth where they can regain forever life. Israel committed sin by crucifying the Lord Jesus. The Lord God took His Kingdom from them and gave to the nation that will guide the people of Gentile to the truth. This Kingdom is called Mount Zion, Heavenly Jerusalem. It is now located in the east part of the earth. The Book of Isaiah called it PLACE OF FEET OF GOD. \r<br>\r<br>Isaiah 60:13\r<br>The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; And I will make the place of My feet glorious.\r<br>\r<br>Matthew 21\r<br>Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it. And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder. Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking of them.\r<br>\r<br>Hebrews 12:22\r<br>But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels.\r<br>\r<br>There is a province called Negros in the Philippines. It is the only island has the shape of a man\u2019s foot. If you are seeking God\u2019s holy truth about life and death, look for Mount Zion, Heavenly Jerusalem. It is the only place on earth where you can get truly saved. No vitamin, medicine or surgery that can save you from aging and death, but it is only by living in the truth, and this truth is obeying the laws and commandments of God.  \r<br>\r<br>Job 33\r<br>His flesh shall be young like a child\u2019s, he shall return to the days of his youth. He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him, he shall see His face with joy, for He restores to man His righteousness. Then he looks at men and says, \u2018I have sinned, and perverted what was right, and it did not profit me.\u2019 He will redeem his soul from going down to the Pit, and his life shall see the light.\r<br>\r<br>Isaiah 28:16-18\r<br>Behold, I lay in Zion a stone for a foundation, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; Whoever believes will not act hastily.\r<br>Also I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plummet; The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place. Your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand;\r<br>\r<br>Lord God of hosts, Holy Father\r<br>Lord of hosts, Lord Jesus\r<br>The Spirit and the bride\r<br>Mount Zion, Heavenly Jerusalem\r<br>Gabriel, an angel of the Lord", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T15:47:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M R", "comment_text": "it&#39;s all about INSULIN.", "comment_date": "2022-05-31T16:22:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HungryPorpoise", "comment_text": "Lets make an immortal mouse", "comment_date": "2022-05-28T17:39:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u015eamil Kafa", "comment_text": "Unforeseen Consequences and orange color.

Due to global warming and CCD (colony collapse disorder) of bees there will be way less fruit and vegetables to eat. The world will starve, extreme weather will occur, and other diseases like corona virus will run rampant. Millions upon millions of people will have to move some where else because of rising sea levels, creating even less space in the already overpopulated earth, if we don&#39;t find a new solution to plastic soon we won&#39;t have much of an ocean anyway, but more of a giant floating soup of rubbish, and many countries who heavily rely on seafood to feed their population will be in big trouble. And there are now talk arising (I don&#39;t exactly know if it&#39;s true) that humans will soon run out of water to drink. You would have to live through all of this, being immortal, unless you died from starvation or something, I believe this would suck. Therefore, if a solution to ageing comes out, I am going to take a stand and not use it.

All damage to the body can be attributed to entropy. It may be possible to repair body systems using a mechanistic approach, but radiant youth will not be established that way. It may be that aging is 100% due to entropy, and that if that entropy was dealt with, the body would revert back to a youthful form. You have to notice the difference between a youthful body and mind and an aged body and mind. The amount of energy flow through the body is the crucial difference. Even the breakdown of the telomeres can be traced down to entropic influence. Essay:<br><br>Atoms are subject to rust, rot, and degeneration. However, if you constantly run an electric current through a piece of metal, the process of rusting will take much longer. Running energy through matter can achieve this same result for other substances too. Matter is a high entropy substance, but applying coherent energy to it can make a difference. In our bodies the condition of advancing entropy is temporarily offset by ingesting food, which provides energy to cells and reinforces their structure. Energy is also replenished by the sleep cycle, and by energy chakras that take energy from the sea of energy present in the world and also spiritual dimensions.  <br>Matter may not be as connected to vital energy fields, when compared to the human spirit. Matter&#39;s connection to energy fields may be weak and objects made of matter may be compartmentalized and mainly cut off, like separated, discrete islands. Pieces of matter have a propensity to rub against each other randomly in the environment (or external energy impacts the matter indirectly from various sources), causing destructive friction and descent into entropic disorder. Energy circulation and influx systems are combating this tendency in the body, but eventually they fail. The deterioration of the telomeres is an example of this, the telomeres eventually decay because of entropy&#39;s influence and failure of body energy systems. It seems that the body is not receiving enough energy as it gets older, which is really what causes the breakdown into entropy. The resulting disorder manifests as missing bits of telomere DNA code that pass into evaporation. When available energy in the body is at a low state, it is closer to entropy, and thus degeneration. What the body needs is a constant supply of energy in order to keep it intact. Energy must be running through all parts of the body, every cell and DNA strand, on a constant basis. This is not a simple task. The consciousness of the person must be adapted to permit this, or overstimulation of the mind will lead to madness. The amygdala, or pituitary gland, can receive energy from energy resources that extend beyond our Universe. <br>When a coherent resonance state of energy in the body is reached, time will slow down for the person and even timeless reality can be experienced. Spontaneous teleportation and time travel avenues may open up for a body so enhanced. Entropy may reverse, and negatropy may ensue, which is the state of coherent, high energy resonance, accumulating energy flow, and interconnection. All energy converges at a high energy state, so when enough subtle energy is passing through the body normal parameters of physics will no longer apply. Stability will increase, rather than abate. The process is not without risk, as many phenomena will rapidly be encountered, but who said that living forever would be boring. Once the body is exposed to a high energy resonance reality it may explore various pockets of resonance, that ultimately comprise the energy continuum. In conclusion, energy and the connection to energy fields is the means to immortality. Our body, in its current state of matter, is subject to erosion. Circulation of energy through the body is thus necessary to delay the aging process. The energy has many safe sources, energy from food, sunlight, chi energy, kundalini, energized water, minerals. The answer to longevity will likely not come through a pill or therapy, but by enabling the body to receive enough life giving energy so it is made stable when high energy resonance is attained. Extreme longevity is somewhat the realm of the spiritual hero or science fiction adventurer, but it may be feasible. <br><br>The implications of supreme longevity are radical. Understanding regenerative Physics is the means to discovering how longevity can be extended indefinitely. Consciousness and its connection to source energy completely circumvents entropy, reversing decomposition and maintaining stability. Deliberate commitment to focused, high energy resonance and interconnection to energy fields can lead to eternal life. Relying on virtually disconnected and detached matter will eventually lead to death. Energy does not have to always flow downhill, it can flow uphill into higher dimensions. The mind is the prime engine of this upwards action. Energy can flow both downhill and uphill, in a feedback circuit of interdependence and escalating dynamics. Once the body and mind are firmly plugged into the spiritual energy flow and are receiving copious energy, the accessible niches of experience are interminable. <br>Opening and exposing the human physical body (or any other piece of matter) to a burgeoning stream of spiritual energy will cause the matter to act in manners that are not typical of its usual virtually sealed off condition. Exposure will strengthen and augment matter so treated. Interconnection is positively correlated with coherence, when interconnection is improved coherence increases. Harmony between interconnected entities is the synthesis.", "comment_date": "2018-10-31T13:53:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zel", "comment_text": "If only our classes were this amazing", "comment_date": "2018-10-31T09:35:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Fred", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjdpR-TY6QU&amp;t=1m25s\">1:25</a> DO YOU EVEN PHINEAS AND FERB BRO??<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>they\u2019re aglets.....", "comment_date": "2018-10-31T01:40:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Inferno", "comment_text": "i love your youtube channel sooooooooo much i love your channel because you teach people of all ages stuff that didnt know now im gonna smarter then all of the kids in my class :)", "comment_date": "2018-10-30T23:16:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shin Drad", "comment_text": "leave mice alone", "comment_date": "2018-10-30T15:02:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris G", "comment_text": "I want to live as long as wolverine.", "comment_date": "2018-10-30T05:16:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BEER WEI", "comment_text": "Growing hair is all I care about", "comment_date": "2018-10-29T20:51:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hudson Valente", "comment_text": "Hello, huge fan of the channel.

Whenever Science does not know what it is exactly, an adjetive as such is applied.  These so called &#39;zombie&#39; cells are cells that have been cloned by a Parasite we know as Cutaneous Larva Migrants (Hookworm Infection).  Its not the actual worm that causes aging, it&#39;s the &#39;Larva&#39; they produce.   They have the ability to clone living tissue into themselves.  These Larva (worms) are charterized by being serpentene, jagged and pointed at the ends.  An older persons face will be inundated with them underneath their facial skin.  Humans have the propensity to be oblivious to life processes going on right in front of our eyes.  Wrinkles are not caused by years, they are parasites underneath the skin.  Take a look at your belly button, its a curled up hookworm.  The word migrants means that this larva can travel through the blood stream or flesh.  It goes to where you bleed.  And the navel is the first place we bleed.  Go ahead and google image belly buttons and you will see.  Humans are immortal, yet no human ever born has ever lived the full life a human is actually capable of living.  The human hookworm larva has killed every person ever born.  We only live as long as our bodies can ward off the Larva from killing us.  The ability to clone is a powerful weapon in survival of the fittest.  That puts this parasite at the top of the food  chain, not humans.  Once Medical Science apply their test towards how these Larva can clone, then they can kill it.  After that, I do not know.<br>In 100 years they will look back at us and be bewildered on how we thought the sickness of aging was a natural life process.

The first two have been largely adopted and the average lifespan in emergent countries is of 100 years of age. The concept of third world or underdeveloped countries does no longer exist and the first two have been largely adopted, but there&#39;s still a little bit of stigma against the latter. I am myself an 101 aged man which would probably look middle-aged to most of you. My hair has only recently started to grow white. That&#39;s because I am one of the people trying the new option, and my lifespan has been increased. We also have managed to advance cancer treatment to the point it&#39;s no worse than pneumonia is to your time, and really, looking back I&#39;d say the treatments I used to see given to cancer patients as a teenager were rather barbaric. We have managed to take down the antivaxxer movement and the vast majority of the population is vaccinated against thirty common types of cancer or so, and people who have any of the other ones can be tested any time and cured with a few shots they can be given in their homes. Treatments against physical wounds have also advanced due to research based on axolotls and people below age 80 can be perfectly healed from any heart damage or disease. Deaths by assassination are getting less common than the psychological trauma of near-death survivors since many people can survive stab wounds to the heart if they&#39;re taken to the hospital or at least an ambulance quickly enough. Our main problem right now is the many scandals with APCs (anti-privacy corporations, such as the NSA, you have probably heard about it but don&#39;t have the term) in many countries, leading to riots almost everywhere, but I&#39;m an optimist and think these should probably <i>die off</i> pretty soon.<br><br>This message will take a few minutes to send, phew.

We are highly concentrated frequencies and coils. There are 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms of spinning and vibrating energy we consist of.

It would immediately stop if the motor or generator was turned off. But we are connected to some kind of self generating holodeck where what we think becomes images.

Among the best is:<br>light acts like you\u2019d expect on scales well above its wavelength and<br>acts weird on scales below.  In order to take a picture of a thing you<br>need light to bounce \u2026<br><br>The only thing physicists have actually seen is basically a computer<br>image, not the real image, and second, they observe electric fields,<br>not the particle itself. They do not observe particles themselves;<br>they are able to observe only the field. However this alone does not<br>prove anything, but that the electric energy field exists and that\u2019s<br>about it---no atoms, no photons, no electrons, no quarks. no nothing.<br>So no, particles do not exist. Particles exist only inside<br>mathematical abstractions and nothing more and nothing else. We don\u2019t<br>know what actually exists in the real world, except that there are<br>energy fields---electric, magnetic and all other forms and all other<br>kinds of energy fields.<br><br>I forgot to add what exactly is visualized with all these microscopes<br>including STM--the scanning tunneling microscope. What is visualized<br> is the charge density of the electric field.<br>Basically you observe vibrations---electric vibrations.<br>You haven\u2019t seen an atom either.

Microscopes use lenses and light to help zoom<br>and focus on small objects. Electron microscopes, on the other hand,<br>use quantum scattering theory to construct the shape of small objects,<br>then the data is transferred to a computer to create a model.

Long HEALTHSPAN.<br>Previously of the &quot;CURE AGING EPISODE&quot; we discussed about of course curing aging. But theres this 1 point and logic missing.<br>Lengthening HEALTHSPAN makes us healthy right? Making our brain cell strong, making our bones, muscles and tissues and other organs to be healthy. Making our IMMUNE SYSTEM totally at its full strength. So if we lengthen HEALTHSPAN we obviously also lengthen our LIFESPAN. Aging is the number 1 limit or BARRIER of our LIFESPAN getting older is what it meant to be much more weaker. Making us vulnerable of sorts of diseases. Making us dead slowly and slowly.[I wish i can make this rule officially mine but im just a kid who likes watching videos and playing games and stuff and im not even a american and just a normal average filipino. IDK if i am a average human but still]<br>Lengthening HEALTHSPAN means lengthening LIFESPAN and also means having suffer at the end once again. But all of this is just one of the possibility that could happen on that research. Humans have been very clever and thats what makes them survive and reach this time. Maybe the lengthening healthspan has like some self instant destruct system which kills the human without pain and with ease only at some certain age or time. So as this is only short since this is a comment im going to end i right here.<br><br>Put Kurgesagt ending scene here", "comment_date": "2018-05-21T11:02:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Eagin", "comment_text": "Aging is what gives human life meaning.

We die so that we may pass into judgement. The good to eternal life and the wicked to eternal damnation. So it is theologically wrong for human to try and live forever, when God forbade it.<br><br>At the same time, Christians have so varied beliefs among them and are very often inconsistent in their hermeneutic that it wouldnt&#39; surprise me if they embraced cure to aging as some sort of blessing from God (even though no god has anything to do with it).<br><br>Either way, this video is very exciting.

You&#39;ve mentioned that Stem Cell is a proof of concept in theory. This is not true. It is actually being performed in China at the moment and had already shown a significant in the slowdown of aging and curing of certain diseases. My family had be in this business since year 2013 and it had grown successfully and cured hundreds of patients. The main application really required people to accept and understand the benefits of stem cells and how it work. It would need people to understand to gain stem cells, it does not mean to take it from a embryo. We can use our own or ones from umbilical cord that were not stored. It is effective, and like you&#39;ve mentioned in the video, can help to rejuvenate and increase the metabolism of cells around it. <br><br>For those who think they&#39;ll have a chance, I am sorry to inform you that the process takes a long time. It can range from 4 month to a year before it really helps you to stop aging. You have to constantly take injection from Stem Cells therapy and have a good diet.

As NAD+ is a key factor in basic cellular respiration the only mechanism I can think of that injecting it into your system actually helps is that by using the concentration gradient, the systems is more likely to respond by shifting NAD+ to its reduced form.

Maybe the right word is &#39;solving death&#39;. For example, say &#39;death&#39; is cause by radiation from the sun and the interior of the earth. Then the &#39;solution&#39; would be to distance ourselves from the radiation (such as setting ourselves up in interstellar, if not intergalactic, space). Perhaps this is why we have not been &#39;visited&#39; by &#39;intelligent&#39; aliens (woe to us if we are visited by unenlightened aliens with advanced technology) - they are keeping their distance from the radiation. This is just one example, but it demonstrates that &#39;death&#39; may be a simple &#39;cure&#39; or &#39;solution&#39;, we simply are not looking at it right.<br><br>Good topic - thanks for the mental stimulation (and now I&#39;ll watch your video, knowing in advance that you will not come anywhere near my advanced thinking).<br><br>On Increasing &#39;Healthspans&#39;<br><br>Your video covers health spans, but what about &#39;consciousness&#39; spans - meaning, if you are able to reduce the amount of sleep you need, your &#39;conscious&#39; life will be extended by a good percentage, and you will also have more &#39;peak&#39; hours (with which you could address the Great Struggle, if you were enlightened, but you&#39;re not - so they would merely be wasted).<br><br>The Last Mistake You Make<br><br>The last mistake you make in this video is focusing on technology and medicine, when, as I&#39;ve just illustrated, the root of the problem is philosophical - why even bother to extend life if it is going to be wasted on foolish, clueless endeavors? It is a world for the depraved, who will dominate such a world. Isn&#39;t that a pleasant prospect? (answer: no, it is not, and it illustrates how clueless science really is without an adequate philosophy behind it (such as mine)).", "comment_date": "2017-11-04T01:39:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tordah!", "comment_text": "So, I just need to inject baby brains into mine?", "comment_date": "2017-11-04T01:39:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mara mma", "comment_text": "ive decided to live forever out of pure will power death can suck it", "comment_date": "2017-11-04T01:39:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lyn malonzo", "comment_text": "This video turned this channel to: Mice - In a Nutshell", "comment_date": "2017-11-04T01:37:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lim Wei Min", "comment_text": "20%", "comment_date": "2017-11-04T01:36:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "naneto", "comment_text": "In 2069: You guys don&#39;t know the struggle of not having a robot which does everything for you and a hoverboard which travels near the speed of light, back in my day we had to walk and we had hands to do shit.

However, can\u00b4t help myself thinking what the ability to cure all aging eventually mean to humanity. We are already concerned about the overpopulation on earth (although this will eventually peak and then decline as pointed out in another video of Kurzgesagt). But if we stop aging or are able to vastly prolong life wouldn\u00b4t it mean that we have to adjust how often and/or much we procreate? Will we end up with more a less a static population of the same individuals and will these people be able to drive innovation and advancements of the human kind in the same way? Many great minds developed their best contributions to humanity in their early 20\u00b4s. Younger generations  tend to be more innovative than older ones.

However, the most effective of these methods requires that we be able to both repair out telomeres, but also find better ways of dealing with the inevitable increase in cancer that comes with making our cells functionally immortal.<br><br>With these sorts of treatments, human beings could all conceivably live at least to be 100 years old in good health. Of course, we&#39;ll eventually hit other problems in our biology that tend to be glossed over by the fact that we die to other things more quickly.<br><br>For example: mutations in your cells that are naturally occurring and are unique to individual cells essentially lead to the cells in your body being less and less &quot;uniform&quot; as you age. This isn&#39;t something you can fix through simple methods. The way that nature fixes this problem is through reproduction, and by making sure each new &quot;body&quot; starts with only a single cell with a specific set of DNA, but we don&#39;t have that option if we&#39;re looking to live longer. <br><br>Fixing THAT problem I can see as being far more complicated. We would need to find a way to genetically engineer our cells on the fly - perhaps having genetically engineered special cells or such that go around and make sure that the DNA within the cells of your body &quot;match&quot; some kind of master DNA record. Then either destroying cells that do not, or replacing their DNA with the correct copy. Of course - where would this record be stored? If it was stored in your body, it would have the same fundamental risk of being &quot;corrupted&quot; over time.<br><br>Perhaps this is where technology besides bioengineering could come in? If we had a cybernetic implant for example that held a master DNA record for your body, and was able to release nanomachines or simply inform your body of what DNA is &quot;normal&quot; for its cells, then all would be well. This method also would also be a cure for cancer, as a side note, since cancerous cells only are cancerous due to faulty DNA.<br><br>Although: how to read the DNA of a given cell on a nano-scale while not disrupting the function of said cell is another story of its own. Perhaps the way that this could be done is by essentially telling a given cell that is being checked to go through a certain kind of mitosis, so that any kind of damage would only be to the &quot;copied&quot; cell. If the cell was not able to undergo mitosis as requested, or the DNA did not match the master &quot;record,&quot; the cell would be destroyed.<br><br>I think this would be most efficient by essentially just genetically engineering our immune system to perform this function. Now that I think about it as well, if you had enough copies of the &quot;master DNA record&quot; within your body to be checked, and those records THEMSELVES were consistently being compared against the &quot;majority,&quot; no amount of mutation through radiation or such would be enough to damage the &quot;true record&quot; in question. <br><br>Just rambling here, but this stuff is exciting to think about.

Take senescent cells, for example. Killing a large number of cells all at once can be potentially fatal, meaning that this will be of less value to those who are already old. Additionally, senescent cells play an essential role in wound healing. This means that in addition to the complications that can arise from killing too many at once you&#39;d also be faced with slower recovery if you survive. On the plus side, it would definitely be of value to those are are middle aged at least and if the dosage can be controlled to minimize cell death to a gradual occurrence might eventually be of use to those who are currently elderly. While the peptide would be destroyed by digestion, injection is not the only possible route of delivery. Inhalation can also work, with a nasal spray being a possible route to ensure that it also gets delivered to brain cells directly. <br><br>In regards to stem cells, the embryonic stem cells are actually of less value than your own adult stem cells. Studies attempting to use them have had very mixed results. However, if you save the adult stem cells from the cut umbilical cord it can be of use later. Unfortunately, although it&#39;s possible to culture adult stem cells in the lab, I can&#39;t seem to find a single lab willing to do so - and I&#39;m a genetics major! All of the labs I spoke with seem limited to extraction from one part of the body and either storage or immediate re-injection. They told me it was illegal, so it might be a consequence of laws aimed at stopping embryonic stem cell research (out of concern for unborn children) spilling into adult stem cell research (that does not harm children). This is problematic, because to get the most benefit from a stem cell injection you need to extract them when healthy and culture them for later re-injection. Your stem cells can even be programmed prior to re-injection, such as making them immune to HIV infection. Another issue is that as stem cells are exposed to the environment and undergo replications that experience epigentic changes - many of them harmful - so you&#39;d really need a few lines backed up. You&#39;d also want to extract a special kind of stem cell from the bone marrow that wouldn&#39;t have undergone any divisions or epigenetic alteration to start from if you didn&#39;t have your cells collected at birth. <br><br>There are attempts for creating a national stem cell bank based on the premise that only a limited number of types will be needed for everything, but there are risks even here. If, hypothetically, you started to get extremely high levels of stem cell injections on a regular basis it could potentially inhibit the release of your own stem cells. While this would be great if you were TRYING to replace your cells over time with genetically modified cells, this is probably not a good thing if you are just getting a cocktail of many different people&#39;s DNA. Truth is, I have no idea what would result from such a scenario, but I&#39;d err on the side of caution. <br><br>Another area of study not mentioned in this video is that there are regenerative compounds in blood that decline over time. When young blood from a young mouse was transferred to an old mouse the biological age of it&#39;s organs ended up matching that of the younger mouse. However, in that case they surgically connected the vascular system of the two mice so the particles in the old mouse blood may have been filtered by the younger mouse, or that it was an issue of quantity. A followup study found that the levels which would be safe on humans didn&#39;t have a statistically meaningful impact. This is in large part because a full blood replacement from someone of different genetics can be harmful, whereas the mice used in studies are so genetically similar they might as well be clones. Of course, that new study doesn&#39;t discount the possibility of storing large quantities of your own blood over time and then reinjecting with it later to flush the system and restore the youthful state. It also doesn&#39;t discount that, when you have to get a large blood transfusion anyway, the age of the donor might actually be important, but we have no way of testing either because personal blood storage at those volumes is rare and blood donation doesn&#39;t log the age of the donor (although, imho, it should at least record the age group of donors, especially considering that most ends up being sold for medical studies rather than given to people in need)<br><br>Overall though, I&#39;d say that a nasal spray with a cocktail of peptides, special proteins for brain function, NAD+, and adult stem cells taken as a twice daily medication would be extremely valuable. Although, they&#39;d have the logistical issue of needing to either group the dose into stem cell types (don&#39;t take someone else&#39;s nasal spray!) or have it specially made from your own stem cells sent to a lab. Might be more expensive, but then every cell and protein going in would be made from your own genetic information for maximum benefit. <br><br><br>A reference:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/12/141211124526.htm\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/12/141211124526.htm</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fountain-of-youth-young-blood-infusions-ldquo-rejuvenate-rdquo-old-mice/\">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fountain-of-youth-young-blood-infusions-ldquo-rejuvenate-rdquo-old-mice/</a><br><br><a href=\"http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/11/22/young-blood-does-not-reverse-aging-in-old-mice-uc-berkeley-study-finds/\">http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/11/22/young-blood-does-not-reverse-aging-in-old-mice-uc-berkeley-study-finds/</a>", "comment_date": "2017-11-03T16:46:33Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "WILLY LYNCH", "comment_text": "Pretty soon we are gonna have super mice that live for ever and breed super fast, we are fucked.
