As science progressed, we found out spinosaurus was much larger and fiercer than imagined (due to its teeth) so its design was adapted to a more T rex figure. More recently, scientists believe it to be an aquatic or amphibian species (due to its webbed tail) so currently, it&#39;s being represented as a sort of salamander.

Things that are simply TOO big. Titanosaurs and the like would be an issue for small towns because they would probably trample or eat crops but wouldn&#39;t be the best farm animals themselves. And even if they don&#39;t do that, such a creature would damage human constructs as it trampled through and be a pretty tempting piece of meat and bone for human hunters. Outside Africa, our own gigantic Megafauna have not faired well. And even in Africa, humans still represent a huge threat to them.<br><br>2. The unstoppable predators. Coexisting with giant Azhdarchids might be a problem. An animal the size of a giraffe and the weight of a bear, which could fly and swallow people whole, would probably demand a lot of resources to coexist safely with, and after enough people were impaled or swallowed by them, or people got tired of wearing spikey armor when near them to discourage swallowing, it&#39;s pretty likely that people would take to exterminating them on sight. The slightly smaller Azhdarchids might fair slightly better because people wouldn&#39;t be afraid of ending up in their stomachs, but I doubt anything over 8 or 9 meters would be common within 100 km of a human settlement, and there&#39;s a real possibility they&#39;d be driven to extinction.<br><br>3. The ones who just eat a cow for breakfast. If you think ranchers don&#39;t like wolves, what would they think about animals 200 times that size? 8000 kg predators like T. Rex would become victims of predator culling and overhunting even if it would be fairly easy to stop them from entering human settlements and monitor their activity from vast distances. Stopping them from eating farm animals would be quite a chore, and ranchers probably wouldn&#39;t get the memo that there are maybe 20000 Rexes at any given time in all of North America despite their total dominance of the ecosystem. Tyrranosaurs take up a lot of niche space with their different growth stages and if humans start culling any of their growth stages OR its main prey, you can expect their numbers to drop precipitously.", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T03:29:02Z", "likes_count": 31}, {"comment_by": "Cyborg Baby", "comment_text": "More paleontology related videos pls", "comment_date": "2021-11-03T02:27:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rayven Hitt", "comment_text": "Since we&#39;ll never actually see (real) dinosaurs, I choose to imagine them in their scaley, Jurassic Park style.

Predators need to blend with the environment.  Most plants are green and so most colors in the jungle are as well. A small animal that is quick can get away with flashy colors, not a large animal.  Also color blindness was another factor too.  If you are colorblind, why would you be a plethora of colors.  You\u2019d literally be signaling your presence.<br><br>Polar bears appear white because they are in an environment that matches.  Lions are yellow and brown because they match their environment.  Bears are brown and black to hide and to sneak up on prey.  Panthers are black and yellow for the same reason.  Crocs and alligators are greenish black to match swamp like conditions. Snakes that are in normally green environments are either green or black.  Snakes in a forest or desert are most likely tan or black.  Same goes for prey.  So when you think ppl got it wrong...which are you referring to? You\u2019re saying that a TREX that is the heighth of an elephant was possibly purple and Orange? Right... They wouldn\u2019t have lasted even 1000 years unless the rest of their prey were retarded.  Also, smaller prey tend to be more intelligent due to brain vs size difference which gave them an advantage, if you can say that, with evasion of larger prey.  So it\u2019s not just as simple as taking a chicken\u2019s DNA and claiming \u201clook, the color purple might be in here.  That means TREXES were purple.

In fact, I am a High School dropout and have never taken a college course or any theology classes. I\u2019ve never read a \u2018Commentary\u2019 on any Scripture, I can\u2019t read Hebrew, Greek or any language other than English.\r<br>\r<br>I say all that to say this: If you glean anything from what I&#39;m about to say you need to know it is from the Living God. Not me. The confidence I have in His word comes from Him. The faith that I have in His ability to transform and redeem lives comes from Him and from personal experience. The knowledge I have of the Living God (the God of the Bible) comes from knowing Him and His inspired word, and my understanding of it comes from the indwelling of His Holy Spirit. I do not proclaim to know all that there is to know about the Lord, but what I do know I am grateful to have the opportunity to share with you. The Lord gave me LIFE when I was living in the deepest darkness\u2026with no hope\u2026or a future\u2026 and I am here because I was not alone in that darkness and I want YOU to know the God that saves. [If you don\u2019t already] . And If you do, then I pray you will join me in my quest to bring God\u2019s glorious light into the darkness that is consuming our world. Not for my sake\u2026but for the sake of those who are still lost. Join me in crying, \u201cCome to the cross of Jesus! He is MIGHTY TO SAVE!\u201d\r<br>\r<br>You need to know that there is irrefutable evidence that God\u2019s word was written by One who knows the end from the beginning, so don\u2019t believe the lie that all believers in Him have a \u2018blind\u2019 faith that is based on \u2018feelings\u2019, and nothing more. Many of us came to Christ with blind faith [with little to no knowledge of God], but if we\u2019re growing in our relationship with Him and the knowledge of His word we will grow into a mature Christian that cannot be swayed by false teachers, mockers, or staunch unbelievers, for how can we deny one we KNOW? And how can we not defend the One who has redeemed us, transformed us, and given us eternal life?\r<br>\r<br>I am not still following Christ with blind faith\u2026but am, rather, walking towards heaven with my eyes wide open\u2026confident in the God I serve\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026and I just want to make my Heavenly Father proud.\r<br>\r<br>The word of God says that we have all sinned. All of us. And sins penalty is death. The good news of the Bible is that God loves us so much He didn\u2019t want us to have to pay the penalty for our sins so He paid the penalty for us! He literally died for us\u2026so we wouldn\u2019t have to! And because he\u2019s God he rose from the dead to prove that He was who He told everyone He was\u2026and, [His word tells us] to prove that He was successful in doing what He came to do. To pay the penalty of our sin in full.\r<br>\r<br>So does that mean that everyone gets to go to heaven now? No. Everyone could\u2026.but everyone won\u2019t. Because not everyone is grateful that Jesus died for them. And some people don\u2019t even feel guilty for their sin. They like sinning. And for that reason they will reject Jesus. Some people just don\u2019t believe in Jesus. Some are so crazy they don\u2019t even believe He ever even existed, even though there\u2019s irrefutable evidence and proof that He did. And others think they\u2019re pretty good people\u2026and think they can earn their way to heaven because of that goodness. The problem is they\u2019re comparing themselves to other people. People who are worse than them of course. And we don\u2019t get to go to heaven because we\u2019re \u201cbetter than our neighbors.\u201d No sin can enter heaven. None. Period. And bottom line is only those who have repented of their sins\u2026asked Jesus to forgive them for their sins\u2026believed that He died for their sins\u2026and asked Him to save them\u2026will go to heaven. God made heaven. It belongs to Him. And He is the One who gets to decide who can go there, and who can\u2019t. He has made a way for all of us to be able to go to heaven\u2026but many people are so arrogant they think they can do it \u201cthere way\u201d and still get there. :( They\u2019re wrong.\r<br>\r<br>To repent means to not only admit you have sinned\u2026but to be truly sorry in your heart for sinning as well. [Not sorry because you got caught\u2026but sorry that you ever did it\u2026there\u2019s a big difference.] Repentance is the key ingredient to salvation that many people overlook. They think they can just pray a prayer\u2026like it\u2019s magic or something\u2026and be saved. But that is not the case. Repentance is a requirement because God only forgives those who are sincerely sorry for what they have done. Just saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d is not good enough\u2026it\u2019s all about what\u2019s in our hearts.\r<br>\r<br>Think of it this way. Do you have any siblings? Or cousins? Or someone in your life that\u2019s done something to hurt you\u2026that then had your mom or dad or someone tell them to apologize to you for what they did? And then they looked at you and said, \u201cSorry,\u201d in such a way that it was obvious they were not sorry and were only saying \u201csorry\u201d because someone in authority over them was making them do it? That is the opposite of \u201crepentance.\u201d It\u2019s only words. It meant nothing because they didn\u2019t mean it and they wouldn\u2019t have even said it if they hadn\u2019t been made to. Now, if you can tell the difference between when someone is truly sorry, and when they\u2019re just saying \u201cwords\u201d how much more can God\u2026who knows everything! Our every thought! Our every deed! If we\u2019re not truly sorry\u2026we will not be forgiven. But, if we are truly sorry\u2026and we ask Him to forgive us\u2026He will do it! Immediately. And when we do that\u2026and we believe that He paid the penalty for that sin\u2026and all of our sin\u2026and ask Him to save us\u2026He will do it. Immediately. It\u2019s all about what\u2019s in our heart. Being sincere.\r<br>\r<br>And, if you don\u2019t know Jesus yet, then today you can ask Him to forgive you for your sins\u2026[but only if you mean it]\u2026and you can repent of them\u2026tell Him you don\u2019t want to keep sinning and you need His help to change\u2026and put your faith in what Jesus did for you on the cross\u2026paying your sin debt in full. The choice is yours, the Lord has given you a free will\u2026and He loves you so very much. But He will never force you to love Him in return.\r<br>\r<br>We are, right now, very late in the Biblical \u201cend days\u201d\u2026and the return of Christ for his church prior to the start of the tribulation that will follow is \u201cat the door,\u201d so I hope you\u2019ll consider what God\u2019s word has to say about the days we\u2019re living in and those that are soon coming, because although people can still place their faith in Christ after the rapture they will then lose their lives as a result of their newfound faith as the Antichrist will have no tolerance for those who choose Christ over him. Only 1/3 of those who enter the tribulation will still be alive at the end of those 7 years. The horror of it is, quite simply, incomprehensible. :( If you don\u2019t yet know Christ\u2026please\u2026please don\u2019t wait. Today is the day of salvation. Jesus desires for all to be saved\u2026for none to perish, and we know from His word that is why He has tarried in these end days before coming! But\u2026He will come\u2026soon\u2026because He is the God of His word\u2026and if He said it\u2026He must bring it to pass.\r<br>\r<br>If you\u2019re interested in knowing what\u2019s going on I can tell you with 100% certainty what is happening in our world. Why it\u2019s happening. And what\u2019s coming next.\r<br>\r<br>You see, 2000 years ago [and more] we were told by Daniel, Ezekiel, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke, John, Paul, and Peter among others [inspired by God], what would happen in \u201cour\u201d generation! The \u201cend day\u201d generation\u2026\r<br>\r<br>Why our generation? Because\u2026for reasons only God knows\u2026He himself predetermined that He would fulfill His \u201cend day\u201d prophecies during our lifetime. And so, as He inspired those who loved and served Him to write His word He gave us precise signs and \u201cprophecies\u201d that would be fulfilled in our generation, so that, we would \u201cknow that He is God.\u201d In fact, the word of God prophesied a great many details about the days we\u2019re living in. More than most even realize!\r<br>\r<br>One of the most important keys to interpreting Bible prophecy is to remember that it revolves around God\u2026Israel\u2026and Israel\u2019s Messiah\u2026Jesus Christ. I see many making the mistake of trying to \u201cinterpret the prophecies\u201d by the \u201csigns\u201d, rather than \u201cinterpreting the signs\u201d by the \u201cprophecies\u201d. I didn\u2019t really think about that until I responded to a comment I received from a man who believes we are already in the \u201ctribulation\u201d prophesied in Revelation 6\u201318. He is making that exact mistake which is terribly heartbreaking. He\u2019s seeing \u201csigns\u201d and then is looking for \u201cprophecies\u201d to match them. In doing so he is misinterpreting Bible prophecy. And, as a result, [in his own words], he\u2019s living in daily torment as he sincerely believes many have been deceived and have unwittingly received the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d, [which seals the eternal fate\u2014to hell\u2014 of those who receive it] from Revelation 13 [which has not yet been implemented]. I don\u2019t know if he is telling individuals that they now have no chance of being saved, [referring to those in some countries, who are already using a monetary system that involves them being \u201cscanned\u201d in some way, with a chip in their body, but the implications are horrific if he is!] Telling people that they are now condemned to hell, when in fact they are NOT\u2026 and telling them they have received a \u201cmark\u201d that isn\u2019t even yet the \u201cmark\u201d of Revelation 13 is\u2026well\u2026just unimaginable. :(.", "comment_date": "2021-10-13T18:51:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tobig Russia", "comment_text": "Damn this made me tear at the end", "comment_date": "2021-10-13T18:50:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Breh", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is&amp;t=2m26s\">2:26</a> sheeesh", "comment_date": "2021-10-13T18:49:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "[A] Bobby", "comment_text": "Seeing David Attenborough as an animation (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is&amp;t=9m32s\">9:32</a>), brought a gush of happiness and delight!<br>It&#39;s a little detail that means a lot, as I see David&#39;s work of dedicating his entire life to studying and documenting nature; as an inspiration of the highest quality. <br>The world through his eyes, revealed a beauty that many of us would probably &quot;not know&quot; or care about, although it is all around us.<br>Thank you &lt;3<br>I&#39;ve subscribed just now! :D", "comment_date": "2021-10-13T18:48:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Liebrand", "comment_text": "I fall bs.

Not to sound over-dramatic but imagining the loss of all that knowledge, I felt very empty and terribly sad. Maybe it is the fact that it is a challenge that humans cannot overcome...or maybe it is the pure beauty, scents, animal calls, mating dances, the moments where a species assures its survival and the moments they were lost forever. The fact we can experience or even just know what they were and ANYTHING about them, the loss of all that knowledge is terrible, and fills me with great sadness.<br><br>It did help reaffirm the idea the dream I have of seeing to the survival of as many species as possible. Wonderful areas, cordoned off from human interference but still observable through hi definition cameras. Everything from the largest land animals to the tiniest speaks of coral that desperately struggle against the yawning void of extinction if we don&#39;t save them immediately. Maybe climate controlled waters, their own rich ecosystems, so not only do the species survive, but thrive. An animal utopia or garden of Eden, and by using OUR evolutionary gifts, remove many of the lethal hardships that plague them in the wild. Not only will these species live in an actual heaven on Earth for themselves, but we can rid them of diseases, parasites, and speed up the recovery of their major injuries.<br><br>Humans have the right to exist and to shape the world in ways we see fit to ensure that we thrive, but we have so much more knowledge than we did a century or two ago when we began our reckless expansions into every possible niche we could find and thrive with the aid of our industrial and technological might. We know what effects we have on the environment and animals that do not have the capacity to understand their peril nor prevent their extinction. And while we rightfully grow our species, cultures, artist masterpieces, and the other hallmarks of culture and civilization, we SHOULD take the initiative to protect those that we share this planet with. We polluted the world while we climbed through the grime and filth of the industrial revolution and the modern era and now that we sit comfortably in the Information era, we have the technology and ability to turn the planet back towards something resembling what it once was. It almost feels like it is a moral obligation, to correct our mistakes and gently guide and improve the lives of species that are unable to do it themselves.<br><br>I want to keep as much knowledge away from the unknowable past. I want our species to employ our wonders and might in the defense of those who cannot protect themselves in face of planetary sized threat. Although I wish to do it for other reasons than just the empathy for the animals, we should do it to preserve as much of the history of life as we can. With so many wonderful species catalogued and so many we had no chance of discovering, we should record every scent, sound, color, and more, to be able to confidently say that &quot;These beings lived, they existed, they thrived!&quot;. And if we CAN reduce the suffering or misery of species that are being wiped out, why shouldn&#39;t we? Let us extend the fruits of our evolutionary struggle back to the world that birthed us along with the other creations that managed to experience life. As far as we know, this planet is the only one we know for sure has life on it, with all the wonders and horrors that life entails, let us do what we can to make sure we can cultivate and nurture life as long as humanly possible. For if we die, and our mistakes continue to plague the planet and its other inhabitants, we might snuff out the only life in the Universe. As unlikely as it is that Earth is the only cradle of life in the Universe, shouldn&#39;t we do our best to preserve and help life thrive? If life succumbs to premature death that started by our hands, we MAY wipe out a unique piece of the Universe, one that we do not know how to recreate nor is guaranteed to happen again.<br><br>It would be a tragedy for the Universe to exist with all the wonders in our little current slice of time, and be NOTHING around to experience it. Even if it is just an animal that raises its head to the sky because something caught its attention.", "comment_date": "2021-10-13T10:15:42Z", "likes_count": 88}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Mendoza", "comment_text": "Why did this make me tear up a little bit?

It really shucks to see who many going extinct before we can save them for the future when we can PROPERLY clone them and bring them back. <br><br>We are trying our best with the knowledge and data sets we have. But honestly its hard work and i dont think were doing enough even. The amount of diversity needed to preserve to actually bring a species back and not have it die out from genetic dead ends is quite a lot. But I guess we can say its better then doing nothing right? <br><br>Maybe in the future we will be so advanced with Biology&#39;s code as we are with Computer code to fix these issues. Maybe we will be able to rewrite entire genomes with predictive algorithms and AIs that make ours look like toasters. Basically all they will need is a starting blueprint, so the thousands and thousands of unique individuals we are currently preserving will be nice backups but in theory u could just rewrite one individuals genome to act as thousands by changing things all over the genome that would allow for natural reproduction to be stable enough in the wild without our intervention in the lab.<br> I HOPE SO anyway.<br><br>I do wish u guys would have touched on our work at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is&amp;t=9m33s\">9:33</a>.

A lot of the things that are told to the public with confidence are still hotly debated in academic circles. Something as simple as whether or not homo habilis (the first species of homo, named after its supposed use of tools) actually used tools after all, is still debated more than half a century after its discovery. When you don&#39;t even know if a species named after its tools actually used tools, you have to admit you don&#39;t know much at all. My tutor used to say that evolutionary anthropologists &quot;take a bone and a few rocks and build an entire civilization&quot;, where an archaeologist from a more recent era would look at the same finds and declare there was &quot;insufficient evidence to form a meaningful conclusion as to what happened here.&quot; <br><br>We can make some good educated guesses by juggling physics, chemistry and biology to get every tiny scrap of data from the fragments we find, but we are trying to basically squeeze a camel through the eye of a needle. We don&#39;t <i>know</i> that a certain primate species could walk upright, we just think it <i>probably</i> could based on measurements of its ankle bones and comparisons with modern species. We don&#39;t <i>know</i> that neanderthals appreciated art, we just think they <i>probably</i> did because they&#39;ve been found to adorn themselves with raven wings and feathers (they might have just been mimicking humans, or took to wearing them by habit because humans adorned neandertals with them during interaction, in the same way a chimp wears clothes because humans adorn chimps with clothes). In the end we often have to admit we don&#39;t know, and can&#39;t prove even the things the public have come to think are established facts. <br><br>And the soil is an ideal decomposer of organic matter. It destroys the things we need to understand the things we find. Indeed the ground keeps so little of its history, that the further back you go the more you have to just say there is &quot;insufficient evidence to form a meaningful conclusion.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-10-13T06:10:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Peter Cortens", "comment_text": "Amazing and uplifting.

So even though hundreds of millions of years of time (instead of just a few tens of thousands of years) separate birds and dinosaurs, it&#39;s not unreasonable to expect dinosaurs to display many of the same behaviors and physical traits of modern birds, including extravagant mating displays, nesting behaviors, diet, and care of young.

People always go on about raptors in Jurassic Park not looking like that and that they were so small, but the raptors in Jurassic park are based on the Utah Raptors that stood around 6 feet tall. I imagine those things looked very similar to how the raptors looked in Jurassic park but with a few differences like the T. rex did.
