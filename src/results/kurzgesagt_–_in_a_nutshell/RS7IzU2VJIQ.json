I don&#39;t want to oil industry to go bankrupt. Recycling is the answer. I think we should teach children from a young age how to recycle properly and all hospitals, schools and businesses and care homes should be required to recycle by law. Metals are elements and can be used over and over again, we just need to use the technology available, because we already have the tech to solve climate change. Perhaps we could make synthetic oil which would mean taking carbon out the air and when it&#39;s burned it returns to the air it came from, instead of adding extra carbon by digging coal, drilling oil or extracting gas! Sometimes there is a simple solution for a drastic problem. People tend to want a drastic solution to solve a drastic problem. There is no need to go vegan/ organic because we just need to be more careful and efficient and use what we have instead of being lazy and dumping it in land fill or washing it into the sea! If everybody cooperated we could probably FIX climate change whilst still having life&#39;s luxuries. Technology is only going to advance further and further, with clean cheap energy for all in the decades to come! We should build things to be recycled after use and we need to USE science such as GMO&#39;s, not ban them and go organic. GMO&#39;s have such potential, yet all you ever hear is bad things about it from people who know nothing about them. If you don&#39;t believe me, go to the genetic literacy project! I&#39;m sure with a little help and a bit of tweaking here and there we could solve a lot of todays problems with very little impact of our quality of life or multi billion companies such as Bayer Monsanto and McDonalds!

They are absolutely the most efficient way to preserve food. Even though paper enjoys a slightly  higher recycling rate, it too exudes methane as it decomposes, its reprocessing requires far more resources (like water) than the reprocessing of recycled plastic. Plus do you think we want to go back to using more paper/ cutting more trees? <br>People need to know that plastic is VERY GOOD for disposal in properly designed landfills (which we have in the US - mostly)-all of its carbon is sequestered within it,  it does not leach contaminants into the soil, and it creates a stable base upon which a park can be built at the landfills decommissioning. BTW the first thing you do when making a landfill is line it with plastic! <br>All the problems with plastic litter is caused by LITTERING.

Plastic is now pretty deeply incorporated into the ecosystem. It causes extinction events and is extremely likely to be harmful to people in the long term.

Yeah. But we&#39;re still overpopulating the Earth, and our life expectancy is way higher than it ever was. Not only that, but plastics are the greatest method of resource utilization since the invention of alloys and have actually enabled us to enter the Silicon age and literally make leaps in all scientific and medical fields. <br><br>Totally worth it. The fear of plastic is just a fear of the loss of agency. The average life expectancy will drop a decade (if nothing else changes), but who the hell cares?

So if you go to the store once a week you\u2019re replacing 52 plastic bags with that one cotton bag. So take the carbon emissions of 52 bags and compare it to 1 cotton bag. If you reused that plastic bag 7,000 times then yea I\u2019ll believe it\u2019s better for the environment than the cotton bag but you need to factor in the fact that a cotton bag is not the replacement for a single plastic bag. It\u2019s a replacement for hundreds to thousands of bags. I think this misleading info is exactly why people don\u2019t bother using reusable bags.

It is also the most viable substitute for natural resources like metals and minerals; and by far the best use of crude oil possible.<br><br>Also, most consumer plastics are inherently inert, hypoallergenic, safe and even consumable like medicinal oral gel caps, beauty products, food binders, glycerin and food grade polyethylene glycol... it is some of unnecessary additives, like BPA, benzines, and colorants introduced during product manufacturing that are harmful.  <br><br>Plastics in the Postal industry have contributed the most significant reductions to global deforestation. Plastics are also the single most contributing factor to the cost reduction, mass availability and shelf life extension of medications, availability and affordability of vehicles, computers and electronics to the world, revolutionized food and beverage preservation, and most importantly, the global distribution and delivery of clean water.<br><br>The problem is not plastics.  But, the miseducation, recycling and sustainability of such a precious resource.

With this new scope of manufacture scientists could re-think materials, what can lead to build new types of materials wich could be more eco-friendly (the scale of this kind of manufacturing helps around this subject) just such as people are doing with new eco-friendly homes made by giant 3D printers today, but of course, with increased vision around it.

Humans created this unnatural requirement, money=power.<br><br>Crime (in any form or by any means) is also a result of money, 99% of crime is related to money. People do everthing for money (included short term and stupid things), because it is so powerful and is required all of the time.<br><br>Polution is a crime, a result of saving costs. Producing plastic is cheap (main reason) so it is used for everything to save costs or maximize revenue. Again, it is all about money.<br><br>The only way to break this irresponsible behaviour is to dismantle the power of money by stabalize the need of money. Solve problems by starting at the source and do not try to fight against the result, doesn&#39;t work (there are many examples to prove this), no sypthom combat. Start to introduce a basic income for everyone as a human right, no one needs to work at (environmental) risky or dangerous jobs for a few cents each hour to get an income (for example in india). Most people do their job because there is no choice, they can&#39;t say no.

Eventually, so much carbon was buried in this manner that the climate cooled and the rainforest swamps covering much of the land collapsed.  Eventually, microorganisms evolved which could digest lignin, and nature found a new balance.<br><br>Plastic is another such organic polymer.  While my knowledge of organic chemistry is limited, I see no reason in principle why organisms couldn&#39;t digest it for food, just like fat, protein, or carbohydrate polymers, if they had the right enzymes available to do so.  With the age of quantum computing approaching fast, it may soon be possible to design such enzymes from scratch, then print an appropriate DNA sequence to code for that enzyme and insert it into the genomes of certain bacteria or other organisms.  These organisms could be released into the environment, where they would begin the task of decomposing plastics like any other organic material.<br><br>Indeed, once a decomposition enzyme is developed, it should be relatively easy to evolve enzymes that catalyze the reverse reaction - plastic synthesis.  Within a few million years or less, I could easily see modern plastics becoming a natural part of Earth&#39;s ecosystems, with plants and animals using them for the same properties we use them for, and various decomposers breaking them down for food.<br><br>That is not to say we should ignore the problems caused by plastic pollution here and now.

Only thing you don&#39;t know if you are drinking from a PET bottle is if it was made with Sb2O3  katalysts... that may cause health issues.", "comment_date": "2018-07-05T10:22:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amie S.", "comment_text": "Save the planet; drink out of coconut shells.

My point being, don&#39;t abandon all plastic just to satisfy your moral impulse. Consider each major use of it independently. Water bottles (great for replacing with reusable non-plastic OR plastic alternatives) and most straws could go, whereas some other plastic products are better to use than alternatives but MUST be recycled responsibly to mitigate their impact.<br><br>Food for thought directed at comments advocating a plastic-free lifestyle.<br><br>Edit: Someone pointed out to me that we still don&#39;t have a good alternative to plastic straws for people with disabilities requiring temporary or permanent liquid diets.

When solving a problem, it&#39;s important that the cure isn&#39;t worse than the disease.<br>Second, that 90% of the plastic pollution is coming from China. That&#39;s not saying that the western world is without blame, but it does mean that if the entire western world went into the most pollution-preventing overdrive, it would still only have a minuscule impact on the whole problem. &quot;Optimize at the bottleneck&quot; is an obvious adage for software developers.

The only question is how to transport it.<br>So it&#39;s not separating and throwing your plastic in a different bin that&#39;ll make the difference.

This includes sorting it out, recycling, new and less complex packaging (i call it 1 type of plastic per package and max of 2 types of non-binding materials in a package (plastic + alu or glass or carton or etc). Plus banning items we can live without - straws, small sticks that you find in candy, C/PP, glued packaging such as tetrapac, etc (actually a list needs to be made, because there is a lot of stuff we need to abandon and learn to live without). In the end of plastic and waste life we need modern recycling facilities and incinerators that produce electricity and/or heat. All in all - the goal is to construct a system that contains plastic within human society. Banning everything is not the answer. Plastics will never go away. We just need to make it cycle within our domain. Like used radioactive waste! We don&#39;t just through it in the forest, do we?.. Same here.<br>I am an inventor and i only work with wood and metal and refuse plastic packaging altogether.

I think this is only by considering the energy required in production and the carbon dioxide released in production, but by not considering the impact of them after use. After use a cotton bag can degrade into the soil wherever it is thrown but a plastic bag chokes drain and harms creatures and this impact is avoided only when it is disposed off properly for recycling. It does not degrade automatically if it is thrown in the soil. So, plastic is being avoided because we have not been successful in properly conducting its waste disposal process. We have to become stringent and careful regarding its disposal and also limit its use to essential purposes.

That the best reason to climate change, polution and all social issues is that there are too many humans.

YES you hear it right, colonialism 2.0 but this time not bad for africa, asia or latin america but for the sole purpose of helping them. We should do birth control and give subsidies to women under 25 sterilizing themselves (women from countries that get more than 2 kids per women). what this youtube channel also never seems to mension is all the good points of nuclear energy but it instead preaches solar pannels and windmills. YOU KNOW, the huge iron poles that generate a very low and inconsistent amount of energy, you know the plastic things you place on your roof that generate no energy. What I think is that we should block all trade with india if it doesnt stop building the 400 coal energy plants and does birthcontrol. Did you know the population of india quadrupled the last 50 years? The exact same happens in afrika. the population grows fast but still migrates to Europe, the countries are developing and this development speeds up the population growth. What we should do is close all borders with developing countries and half the human population before 2050 if we truly care for this planet.

There has been several studies done to estimate the amount of fish, but it seem like the foundation who made the fish=plastic claim deliberately choose in the low end instead of the high end which is 28 times bigger. The plastic amount used by the foundation was based on a study that only predicted the amount in 2025 and the researchers behind the study said it wasn&#39;t possible to predict further.

Bacterias gotta be competitive and able to colonise the environment so shud be engineered to thrive in landfill sites and able to spread, but controls shud be there to prevent it dividing out of control so controlled decomposition of plastic products. The long chain polymers are a problem but monomers are chemicals that have identified reactions that we can monitor and predict movement of lone pairs of electrons in mechanisms, in other words functional groups can undergo reactions in biochemical pathways that are identified. Just my thoughts. Or u could genetically engineer existing bacteria to make them more competitive and able to divide in high numbers, but bacterial growth is exponential so there is no origin value cause of the laws of powers so when x is 0 y has to be a function of 1 depending on translations and additions to exisiting functions ie e^0.2x to multiply  by 5 if f(x) = e^x. This means over 500 years of decomposition started from a set natural number so there must be some detectable bacteria on surface of plastic products introducted through contact with other environments, so these can be analysed and have base sequences identified so they can be produced in higher numbers with the gene for the hydrolytic enzyme for strong c-c bonds ie able to exert forces of attraction to  produce carbon-carbon double bonds. So enzyme has to be able to rearrange atoms in componds by dividing electrons between products which can then be reacted further and broken down into smaller products resembling chemicals in high concentrations in the cytoplasm of cells constituing complex eurkaryotic organism(s) we consider in our efforts to reduce landfill. Depends if its condensation polymers or addition polymers, but a reaction pathway has to be identified involving an enzyme causing elimination of long chain polymers, in conditions that means it is be able to react to reform c-c bonds. Another method could be defined within field of science that causes the reverse of addition polymerisation. We rely on these long chain polymers for functioning and in a lot of cases bulk material that surrounds us that we created ie clothes game console carpet. In the same way these polymers were produced from repeating monomers unit isolated and reacted at specific conditions the reverse process can be identified. I like what ur doing with the channel attempting to inform ppl about different fields of knowledge, and reduce ignorance while keeping their attention span with more vibrant colours in a easier to internalise style.

I also found in the magazine that by using a weed burner or other type of heat on wood, you can effectively increase it&#39;s durability as burning it makes it harder to soak up moisture in the air.

So instead of plastic why not grow many many more trees 5 per cut down and use all these methods and techniques to increase it&#39;s durability and strength?.<br><br>Funny enough here in Sweden we are TOO good at recycling our trash.

Competition ultimately gives rise to monopolies and monopsonies which don&#39;t compete with each other but actually cooperate because it&#39;s more profitable. This leads to low wages and scammed consumers.<br><br>Capitalism has boom and bust cycles, which is just another wealth transfer mechanism, another way to fuck people over and widen the abyss between the poor and the rich. Nothing makes the rich richer more spectacularly than a bust. This is leads to abject economic inequality. In capitalism it&#39;s more profitable to pollute then to not pollute, this is called negative externalities. A negative externality is a human, environmental or social cost of an economic activity that doesn&#39;t affect the parties who choose to incur them.<br><br>Capitalism depends on cyclical consumption.

Always drunk as in follower of Dionysus (Greek god of festivity, excitement, party, wine, ya know da deal.) Always drunk. So Midas is like &quot;yo bruh. I be helping u get out of dis hole and u be living in LUXURY!!!&quot; Then the satyr be like &quot;yo bruuuuuhhh! Yeah! I totalllllllllllyyyyyy want OUT!!!

NOW. please?&quot; Dionysus be like &quot;gold touch?&quot; Midas be like &quot;YASSSSS!!!!!!!!!! GOLD TOUCH!!!&quot; Then the rampage of turning everything to gold happens...  Midas be HUNGRAY!!!!!!!  He takes a grape outta his new golden bowl and nearly  shatters his teeth. (Ouch!) the grape had turned to gold. He decided to rest on his bed.  Long story short, the bed turned to gold. He tried hugging his only daughter, but she turned to gold. Longer story short, he got rid of his powers by ...bathing in a river...  You might&#39;ve thought, &quot;oh he learned his lesson, bla Bla BLA.&quot; BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. OF COURSE HE HADN&#39;T!!!!!!!!!! He was on ANOTHER walk. This time spotting a pan(Greek god of the wild) party. Pan was playing his &quot;lair&quot; and  Midas drunk, said &quot; pan be better musician than Apollo.( Greek god of the Sun, art, prophecies, hunt, bow, music, medicine, plague, and much MUCH more. You heard music, right?) so that got Our little friend Apollo triggered. Midas got ass&#39;s ears and his barber found out. He swore secrecy.
