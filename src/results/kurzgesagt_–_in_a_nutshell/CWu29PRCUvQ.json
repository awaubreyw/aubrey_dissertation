In this video I noticed that wars and conflicts was absent in the narrative that drove these improvements and in my opinion it was the very potent reason for innovation. And this conflicts is not necessarily a human to human thing, I think it is basically a human to every other element around him. And this conflict between a man and all other elements stems on an innate fear of pain. Pain is the primary driver of innovation and all many ideas and concepts we could think of. I think a man would rather live his whole life avoiding pain driven events like surviving a lion attack or being burnt by fire than live their own lives in pursuit of pleasure.

Well this is just a theory but what if back then they were animals and like animals they ate each other, which would make them cannibals. Which if you look at tribes living in South America today they still are cannibals, so chances are back then they definitely were. And then as time moved forward and humans got smarter they started to question if killing another tribes member, who looked the same as you, and then eating them was the right thing to do or a moral thing to do?

This has caused widespread soft tissue calcification for many people, including in their brain.  This is a normal process, but it is happening faster because of the huge imbalance between calcium and magnesium in our foods.  Some people have differences in how their body processes calcium that also worsens this effect.  Artificial Vitamin D supplementation can cause calcification to accumulate faster as well.  When parts of your brain calcify, it can be impossible to think clearly or to balance multiple conflicting priorities and perspectives at once, causing stubbornness and aggression.  This calcification literally reverses itself once you start consuming enough magnesium!  If legislation were passed that required fortified foods to contain calcium and magnesium in proper proportion, the polarization in the US would decrease significantly within just one generation.  The less magnesium you consume, the more toxic calcium is.  Taking a high dose of calcium is actually HORRIBLE for your bones, NOT good for it.  You MUST consume about as much magnesium.  Otherwise, you will wreck both your bones and your soft tissue.

While I believe space studies are a field to absolutely keep on furthering our knowledge in, we have many more problems to study and solve on Earth. We should keep our view wide but optimised on VERY urgent matters (large things like economics, politics, POLLUTION AND GLOBAL WARMING, how to defend society from bad leaders and capital owners, etc.). <br>And on a VERY personal note, I would not want to expand human influence and problems outside before we have not even learned to manage ourselves on this planet. <br>   I could see the argument that space travel might give hope of a better future for humanity (maybe like in the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s) or that it would open doors for us that might help us improve in  a better society. But speculating, it could also continue as it is (which I find alarming, just my opinion) or worse. <br>I&#39;m putting in an ethical and moral perspective, but I think it&#39;s a factor to consider among the others and that we are abandoning ourselves to developments (mostly technologicals) without posing the question &quot;Looks like we could do it. SHOULD we do it?&quot;<br><br>   It&#39;s heartwarming hearing your comments about learning from our past and keeping in mind the efforts of our ancestors, but I find the sense of GRATITUDE misplaced when the point is observing history. <br>It should not be a cold science, but the fact is that we are observing HOW things went (or speculate with our scarce data left by the eons) and should not judge if it was good or bad, right or wrong. Or not make it the direct point of the studies, at least. That should be a later discussion when taking decisions in the present.<br>    Our ancestors might even have hugely screwed up and of the many possible outcomes we got the worse ones. Who knows! I&#39;m grateful for their efforts and findings, but I think that when dealing with History it can be a very delicate matter to nurrish these kind of feelings. We rewrote history many times on the basis of ideologies of the time, which is dangerous  or at the very least complicates our studies.  And also, even with the many things I might be grateful for, humanity has also chosen rather dark paths many times and the consequences have very negative effects to this day.<br><br>Once more, thanks for the content!<br><br>Federinz", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T13:11:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DH", "comment_text": "Awesome channel!

There is evidence however that human congregations at least in the case of the Tigris Euphrates and the Nile river systems seems to have been more  or less driven by environmental shifts than anything else.  People otherwise seemed to have lived in family groups or tribes until they were forced to change in what was probably a discontinuous process that occurred for different reasons in different places. Large colonies formed earlier during the Neolithic perhaps related to the sea level rise that had been ongoing as the planet but they fell apart at least in one case likely thanks to the adaptation of a food born illness into the veritable scourge known as Y. Pestis.   Agriculture and herding played a huge role in the drastic acceleration from the wet phase of Africa and the middle east/Arabian peninsula which occurred at a drastically accelerated rate of centuries rather than the normal transition period of a few thousand years. This was unequivocally tied to the extensive archaeological evidence of widespread pastoral herders in the area overgrazing the Sahara triggering desertification to more rapidly drive the transition. As the grasslands and savannas  and eventually most of the rivers dried up into barren desert humans were effectively forced to migrate to the few rivers that hadn&#39;t dried us the Tigris Euphrates watershed fed from the mountains and the Nile feed from the Ethiopian highlands and the continental interior. After a stark period of violence with little records remaining of what happened exactly only then did the first true densely populated cities and civilizations arise in the Mediterranean region. I suspect similar stories are probably behind the rise of civilizations elsewhere being spurred by the precessional shifts of the Earth&#39;s orbit. From this story unraveled from sediment records and archaeological evidence revealing this one instance I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if much of change in human history was  forced on us by circumstances.", "comment_date": "2020-10-09T23:19:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julian Krapfl", "comment_text": "Imagine ODESZA running in background, I would find myself in heaven, I guess.

It seems crazy to me, that there is not enough nature left in most countries that you could choose to be an independent nomad and live off nature  instead. That there are borders everywhere, no places that do not belong to anybody, where people could just live simple lives and be allowed to hunt and gather or just build a little house for themselves and just exist without having to pay rent and taxes.

Think of it like this. Homo Sapiens have existed for the past 1.8 million years. About 20,000 years ago, the Agricultural Revolution began. We are absolutely not &quot;Exponentially Growing.&quot; We are growing faster as the Industrial Revolution began 220 years ago. After that we created computers in 1822, known as a Difference Engine. It weighed tons and was the size of an entire room. It could perform simple math problems and could print using over 25,000 parts. We sent a person to moon in 1969, and already had Yuri Gagarin enter space earlier. We are progressing in the space sector, and many people are joining this interesting change in humanity.  In about 10,000 years we may be fully taking use of the resources of the terrestrial planets and moons in the solar system. It is hard to make an assumption but the practice of being a historian may be nearly entirely dominated by machines. If robots can do a job much faster and cleaner than humans, then that would mean that people would still enjoy seeing wonders from the past, maybe even everyday items for us. At this time it could be harder to study history as we would be in multiple places. We may even separate into completely different groups. Let me explain how this logic works. If we stay isolated from one another from long enough, we may not see other people as something similar to ourselves. Of course I could be entirely wrong as progress itself is speeding and becoming harder and harder to predict. Imagine this scenario: In the early 2000&#39;s, a Motorola DynaTac costed  $3,900. Now, a iPhone X costs about $999. Imagine the difference. A flip phone and a phone which has 1Terabyte of memory. This just shows, how in under 20 years, we progressed so much. Still don&#39;t understand? Then let me explain what I said at the beginning again. Homo Sapiens have existed for 1.8 million years. For 1,780,000 years we had slow progress until the agricultural revolution. Around 12,000 years ago, we formed communities. Around 6,000 years ago, the first empires emerged. About 1,000 years ago, we were able to advance not only our warfare, but also learning skills. We created printing presses, discovered electricity in the 1700&#39;s, began the Industrial Revolution in the 1800&#39;s, and in a mere 110 years we began aviation. This wasn&#39;t enough, so in 69 years we sent a man to the moon. In 31 years, we created phones, and here we are now. Do you see how the time in-between major events keeps getting smaller and smaller?

No doubt you will find in your time a true treasure trove here of both vast knowledge and lives lived and gone. As a generation, we had become fascinated at how technology had changed the way we could live our lives and communicate with one another. Many of us found ourselves into a new world where we could consistently record the little things that counted, and I am sure for those among yourselves with a curious mind, that occurrence has unraveled many of the little questions you wish we were capable of answering.<br><br> As exciting as this may be for us, for you, this thing we call the internet is a tool of far greater wonder. You are able to look back in a way no human has ever before been capable of. Perhaps by your own standards, this is all rudimentary technology at best, but with this network being a historical artifact like none other, you are capable of doing what in my own time was impossible: travel into the past. Unlike any time before my present, you are capable of seeing, hearing, and experiencing &#39;en masse&#39; the whole human experience from those before you. For better or worse, my generation has opened their hearts, minds, and lives to you.

Yuval Noah Harari, writer of Sapiens, Homo Deus, and 21 lessons for the 21st century said this happened because of the resurgence of cereals in the middle east due to the end of the ice age. In the beginning, wheat was one of the many foods we ate. But as humans had to move wheat from the place it grew in to their temporary settlement (caves etc), some of it inevitably fell and flourished. Over time, temporary outposts were built at the wheat sites for 2-3 months or so, to harvest and collect them. We learnt that wheat grew better if the soil was plowed. We did that since we thought it would give us more food. Slowly, one step after another, we settled down, in the hopes of making our lives better, but ultimately, we made it worse(until the Industrial Revolution 300 years ago, atleast). Women who couldn&#39;t give birth to kids while hunting/gathering since they were always on the move and breast-milk was limited, now started popping out kids as helping hands in fields, weaning them on porridge and other cereals. Little did they notice that that meant the food/person would fall, and that the lack of balanced nutrient-rich food at such a young age caused a fall in health, immunity, and ultimately mortality. The Agricultural Revolution, at least until supplemented by the industrial one, was humanity&#39;s biggest tragedy.", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T09:15:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Viorel Tudorache", "comment_text": "In the description of the Calendar, you have this: 11&quot; x 13&quot; cm.

While at the same time dependent on herds of wild animals, who&#39;s numbers grew and shrank from year to year. Essentially life as a hunter gather means a population is always under stress from one thing or another. So when agricultural started paying off, our ancestors saw it as gift from the Gods. Now a person can work their own fields and produce their own food. No longer were they slaves to wild plants and later no longer slaves to wild herds, as raising livestock be came a thing.

And large number civilisations always won, whether in terms of fighting, or defending their territory. Farms also allowed specialisation, i.e. one farmer grows one type of crop and becomes an expert, and can feed the entire village. This allowed for scalability, because a farmer can grow for 10 people, but he can also grow for 100, as he could harness &#39;technology&#39; (i.e. animals, and farm tools). Farms formed villages which allowed for a complex civilisation, i.e. where there is a leadership structure, and segregated roles. This would always win out over nomadic tribes, because villages could grow to cities, but nomadic tribes cannot scale past certain numbers, because they are groups that are constantly on the move, and their numbers are kept small, and when numbers are small, there is inability for a complex civilisation to form.", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T05:53:34Z", "likes_count": 68}, {"comment_by": "KillerTacos", "comment_text": "Fantastic video as always you guys", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T05:53:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raul Lara", "comment_text": "2020 came to show us, that living at historical times is not always, if ever, fun", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T05:52:13Z", "likes_count": 61}, {"comment_by": "Niraj Gupta", "comment_text": "It was beautiful", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T05:51:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Mai", "comment_text": "I love this channel", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T05:51:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fermit_the Krog", "comment_text": "Step by step ohh baby I don\u2019t want to be a Neanderthalllll", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T05:50:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I I", "comment_text": "Is it ok that I really want to see humanity 20,000 years ago?

Done! Finish! we will never get to live ever again! So enjoy this life! YOLO XOXO!\r<br>7) On top of all this, this channel teaches how to exploit the shit out of your home planet and when there&#39;s nothing left move on to the next one.<br>8) That everything is unfair in this world.\r<br>9) So whatever you do doesn&#39;t matter. In a way encouraging us to commit crimes against our own.\r<br>10) Shitty theories about how our universe formed from a singularity point and bang bang!

I know it&#39;s controversial, but I think it very neatly explains why and how humans transitioned from hunter gathers to farmers at that specific time. So back some 12,900 years ago, there were large glaciers over Europe and North America. Something caused those glaciers to melt away within the time span of a few thousand years. Following that initial spark that caused the ice to start melting, the Earths temperature took a nose dive and dropped to full glacial conditions creating a winter for most of the planet that lasted over a thousand years. Sea levels rose some 400 feet (think of all the ice in Antarctica and Greenland, that&#39;s how much. This was certainly a transformative time in Human History that is not talked about much, the very definition of climate change. Nearly half of all mega-fauna went extinct, &quot;American horses, sabertooths, lions, camels, giant sloths, cheetahs, dire wolves etc... I think it inconceivable for humans to have killed and made extinct all these animals, given their utility and our lower population. Most food would have been scarce coming out of this long winter. All these people living on the coastal cities would have been displaced, losing their homes, having to scavenge, centuries of failed crops due to the cold, losing some of their previous knowledge with successive generations in this long winter, eventually coalescing to create great coastal cities once again when the winter finally ended.<br><br> Thousands of years from now, if we may be as unfortunate as our past ancestors, there will be hardly a trace of many of our current coastal cities, Los Angeles , New York City, Miami, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Wherever you may live on the coast etc... for they would be under the water and eroding away with hardly a trace of their visible existence, eventual being buried by sediment. Just as the Titanic is but a fragment of its former self, Future archeologists will not find these and they will be lost to time. I&#39;m not saying that this will be caused by solely us, but I highlighting a very much forgotten part of our history, the &quot;sinking&quot; of our past coastlines.", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T23:29:01Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Hotbox Nerd", "comment_text": "I love this channel man, they put so much effort in research and animation.

The Sphinx has water erosion from rainfall, and it was 10,000 years ago the last time it rained.  I think these and many other ancient ruins were built by the Clovis people, who disappeared about 12,000 years ago, possibly due to the huge meteor that hit southern Greenland about that time.  There have been lots of artifacts that date to impossibly old times based on carbon-dating, but these artifacts are usually ignored if it doesn&#39;t fit the narrative of civilization starting up at about 4000 B.C.

The presentation of society evolving in a linear way, from hunter-gatherers to nomadic herders to sedentary agriculturalists, I think is a misrepresentation and oversimplification of nomadic societies on a few levels. I&#39;ll use Central Asia as an example.<br><br>Firstly, the distinction between nomadic herding societies and sedentary agricultural societies is less binary and clear-cut than frequently assumed. In Central Asia, steppe nomads would often only live in a nomadic, traveling lifestyle for part of the year, residing in mountain valley villages when conditions are less suited for grazing. In this way, nomadism can be seen as an ecological adaptation, rather than a stage in a linear societal evolutionary process. Peoples in regions where the terrain is suited for grazing animals often oscillate between living in semi-permanent settlements and moving along grazing routes. Of course, this kind of lifestyle-switching is less viable in the modern world, but nomadic herding societies still exist today, residing at times in modern cities and at times on the move. The existence of cities weakened but did not completely eliminate the ecological niche of nomadism, even in the modern age.<br><br>Secondly, nomadic and sedentary societies were not segregated, but rather coexisted and frequently interacted in mutually beneficial ways. Although agricultural towns have an absolute advantage in the production of goods over nomads, nonetheless herders maintained comparative advantage in many goods, especially those related to animal husbandry. In fact, many Central Asian settlements from the Bronze Age into the early Modern Era specialized in producing goods catering to nomads. One notable example is the oasis region of Khorezm, which served as the major gateway between the sedentary societies of the Middle East and nomadic fur traders of the Urals in the vital North-South fur route. In Khorezm, a major industry was silversmithing, since silver objects were frequently used as high-value currency for the northern nomads. This is how Sasanian silver was found in the Ural Mountains, and demonstrate how settlements at the edges of ecologies benefitted and benefitted from both sedentary and nomadic communities. It was certainly a two-way street.<br><br>Most importantly, the portrayal of nomadic society as a stepping stone towards a more &#39;civilized&#39; sedentary agricultural society denigrates the cultures and customs of nomads. This is not to put the blame on Kurzgesagt; in fact, I think they handled the portrayal of the people in nomadic societies quite respectfully. I&#39;m not blind to the central guiding theme in the video of people remaining largely the same even as society evolves. Still, the framing of the presentation matters, and in most media portraying the evolution of society over time, nomads are inevitably portrayed as a transitory phrase of human existence, a footnote on the path towards human flourishing. Certainly, there are definitions of civilization for which nomadic societies contributed little of note. Nomads didn&#39;t invent penicillin, computers, or nuclear weapons. They didn&#39;t discover black holes and supernovas, they didn&#39;t produce opera and novels, they didn&#39;t invent automobiles and political theories. Nonetheless, in cultural richness and sophistication nomadic societies are by no means the leaders of their sedentary counterparts. They produced beautiful and inspiring art, engaged in commerce and innovation, created complex social structures, and even founded empires. The stirrups seem inconsequential today, but they revolutionized warfare and communications, and enabled the rise of vast contiguous land empires, and this history-changing device was invented not by city dwellers but by nomadic herders. The largest land empire in history was not founded by the sophisticated civilizations of Rome and Xi&#39;an, but by the steppe warriors of Karakorum. Is it any wonder that the societies of dynastic China and Turkic nomads beyond the border regions rose and fell simultaneously? Certainly the nomads prospered with trade with and raids upon the agricultural settlements\u2014but we should not forget that the external threats of invasion and the opportunities of commerce with nomads also helped sedentary communities to organize into larger societal units.<br><br>This is again not a knock against Kurzgesagt and the new video, which I thought was on the whole excellent. I just hope this can serve as a reminder and a celebration of the great and unexpected diversity of humanity.

But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God&#39;s son Jesus died paying for your sin.  <br>God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWu29PRCUvQ&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a>  <br>God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don\u2019t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there&#39;s only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO&#39;s are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it&#39;s too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T20:26:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silvan Elsire", "comment_text": "Wow \u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T20:26:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shadow IV", "comment_text": "You guys make excellent videos!

It created the conditions for the great ancient empires with their enslavement of large parts of humanity. It may have also led to the subjugation of women under patriarchy.  This video leaves out any discussion of war. Archeologists think that large scale war was almost entirely absent from pre-agrarian societies. Almost none of the human remains from pre-historical times have injuries that were not caused by animals, and there are no cave paintings of human on human violence (but lots of paintings of using weapons to hunt animals). <br><br>For most of the agricultural era the vast majority of humans were poor serfs or outright slaves. Only in the last couple centuries has civilization provided any benefits to the common person. All this is not to say that we can or should go back to a hunter gather lifestyle today.

The farming societies had a more stable food source and could support a larger number of members. Because of this, it was easier for their society to grow and &quot;reproduce&quot; by taking over new lands (which they needed to grow more crops). All else being equal, societies which could grow their own food instead of relying on finding their next meal have a higher evolutionary fitness. I think to call the switch from nomads to farmers a deliberate choice made in thousands of individual societies is misleading, because there may have been other thousands of societies that chose to remain nomadic. They would have been much smaller and wouldn&#39;t have lived in concentrated areas that we would now call archeological sites, so we would know very little about them. The fact that we see very little nomadic societies today doesn&#39;t mean that they all decided to switch. It shows that, at the time of the split, being able to farm your own food led to higher fitness than having to find it. <br><br>It remains to be seen if we are actually better off for farming in the long run.

They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can\u2019t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system.

Because frankly, in my opinion, if we can&#39;t establish that Star Trek-esque utopia where poverty is basically gone and the environment is restored and everyone has good mental health care and we are a multi planetary species... and if we pretty much stay in this cycle of neoliberal capitalism that leaves the majority of the human population out of the benefits of the agricultural/industrial/information revolutions (not to mention the utter destruction and suffering we&#39;ve caused by our environmental impact)... then I think it&#39;s pretty fair to say we and the planet Earth would have probably been better off w/o the Agricultural Revolution. idk", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T19:06:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stone_ play666", "comment_text": "That was a beautiful video..

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain?

So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God\u2019s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have confidence in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

In short, hunter/gatherers would have had a more nutritious diet, but they would have eaten less often.

But I don\u2019t feel any sense of pride watching this video. Just... fear. Fear that we\u2019ll colonize another planet an ruin it as we\u2019ve ruined this one. Watching this video just makes me wish that we had stayed in the wild, staying in packs and hunting animals. We deal with so many modern stressors  that no other animal will ever deal with. Why do we put ourselves under constant stress, dealing with bills, work, school, other responsibilities? Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to live the way that we were always intended to live, as wild animals, co-existing with other animals and hunting/gathering for our groups? In the wild, we would have other things to deal with, and we would still have stress. We would still have to work for food (like hunting and gathering and creating tools), we would still have to take care of family, and we would have to defend ourselves from other animals. But we wouldn\u2019t be put on by constant unnatural stress like we are in current society. <br><br>I fear what\u2019s in the future. I hope in 12,000 years we\u2019re not living on another planet, as that means we\u2019ve probably nearly or completely destroyed Earth by then. And then... once we colonize another planet, we\u2019ll just destroy it like this we have this world. Because we\u2019re selfish like that. We see human progress as great, wonderful, amazing. And sure, it\u2019s great... for us. But human progress destroys our natural world. We refuse to coexist alongside nature and instead seek to destroy it for our own selfish gain. We\u2019ve already polluted the Earth, I don\u2019t want to see us pollute space (more than we already have) and other planets.<br><br>What positive things have humans even done? The only positive things I see us doing is attempting to reverse the damage <b>we\u2019ve caused</b> to our own planet. Yeah sure, we\u2019re intelligent, and our intelligence is impressive. But our intelligence causes living things to suffer and be destroyed... and it causes suffering for our own species, as we\u2019re all forced to live in society with all these unnatural stressors. <br><br>I\u2019m not a hippy, nor do I care if people chose to eat animals, as our species is meant to eat meat. But life is a beautiful scientific phenomenon... and all we do is destroy it in unnaturally high numbers. We\u2019ve caused so many species to go extinct and we\u2019ve caused several areas of the planet to just become barren. Areas that were once teeming with life are now just covered in buildings, human settlements, sometimes just dirt. I just don\u2019t want life on this planet to go extinct because we were too selfish to live alongside it.<br><br>What good qualities do humans have other than their intelligence? And even our intelligence as a good quality is debatable, because our intelligence causes our species to believe we\u2019re above all other life, which helps us justify our actions. Even if <b>most</b> life can not match our intelligence, that doesn\u2019t make them any less beautiful. The very fact that life even exists as a phenomenon is amazing. <br><br>Seriously though - tell me one good thing humans have done that wasn\u2019t directed at our species, tell me something we\u2019ve done that wasn\u2019t an attempt to reverse the damage we\u2019ve caused the earth. Tell me something we\u2019ve done that wasn\u2019t done selfishly to help or advance our own species, and something that was done to benefit the Earth. I\u2019m losing faith in our species and every day I hate being alive because of the species I was born as. I struggle to find any good qualities about our species and just see us as a pest, a parasite sucking up the resources on this planet and killing it. Our hyper intelligence was a mistake by nature and should have never happened.<br><br>If anybody read this far, I thank you. I know this was a rant and I probably seemed insane writing this. Just... thank you to anybody who listened. To be clear, I don\u2019t hate anybody as an individual. I only hate our species as a whole and what we\u2019ve done. Individually we can be good, and most of us mean no harm.

Like the very first cities...<br>--I suggest pursuing Donnely &quot;Atlantis: The Antedilluvian World&quot; - no &quot;Pyramid hat&quot; he went all over the world and compared different mythologies including non-western, non-christian based.  And found tales all over of a golden age, men/gods from the sky giving man gifts/technology, an older world that was evil destroyed by a FLOOD...  Not going to go &quot;Jack Chick&quot; on you, rather the end of the last ice age waters rose very quickly, that wiped out this earlier world civilization/s that likely were jump-started by extraterrestrials.  The remnants regressed with their knowledge becoming myth and mystery, then recovered into our modern world eventually.

Something terrible happened then which nearly wiped us all out, and the event was imprinted on humanity&#39;s collective memory all around the world, because it&#39;s effects were global and felt everywhere. That is why stories of massive floods exist in many cultures. Many theorize it was a massive comet impact, which is referred to as Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.\r<br>\r<br>It&#39;s also suggested that there existed a high civilization, which was utterly wiped out in this disaster. Plato&#39;s story of Atlantis is based on that society, and the inspiration for it came from a story passed down by countless generations when a city was submerged under water in a disaster. The timeframe of that event in the stories coincides exactly with the Younger Dryas event.\r<br>\r<br>The events of THIS VIDEO take place AFTER that cataclysm, and these people are the descendats of those survivors. For roughly a thousand years after the disaster, Earth was a hostile landscape which was recovering from a global incineration and flooding, when Earth was literally on fire. \r<br>\r<br>We know so little about our past, and we think all that existed before was hunter gatherers, but in reality the truth is way more complex than that.

Mainly because the script is wrong.<br><br>The first mistake is clearly the absolute glorification of nature and the hunter-gatherer life. Nature is ruthless and spares no pity to no one. The life of a hunter-gatherer is no different from the life of an animal. It&#39;s horrible. Very easy to die, if you are sick or injured you can&#39;t hunt nor gather and you just die at the spot from hunger, if you are lucky and don&#39;t become pray yourself.<br><br>So I say YES the transition to agriculture was a decision but for pretty obvious reasons. Because it really had no disadvantage over hunter-gatherers. It was a safer and easier life. Farming actually gives more food for less work than walking the forest all day to find nothing. So at the end. Farmers were more free than hunter-gatherers. Because really... Are you free if all you do is walk non-stop to the next area, pushed by the seasons, forced to wander around all day long just to survive?<br><br>I also don&#39;t buy that agriculture reduced the diet variety. Just my grandfather still remembers a lot of wild plants and animals that were eaten before. Farmers kept eating the same things as before, but of course the crops became dominant in the diet. Mainly because they now had more food. They could eat more. Not to mention that the crops and cattle were far more easy to digest than the wild plants and animals, and thus, more nutritious.<br><br>Also... What makes you all think that the agricultural transition was peaceful? I imagine there were a lot of disputes between tribes that kept being nomads, and those that settled on the land. They were competing for the same resources. And it&#39;s pretty easy to imagine nomads stealing crops from the farmers, and the farmers responding violently to protect their farm. Since... you know... A bad yield could mean starvation... and the stolen crop the difference between life and death for members of the family.

(And even though I have a smartphone, there are others who live in non-industrial societies, etc.).

And even modern hunter-gatherers interact with agricultural societies, so their lives are also affected.

We have countless black marks on our history, yes, but we are also the dominant species on the planet and even the 2nd and 3rd best don&#39;t even come close to what we&#39;ve done in just a few thousand years. Humanity has SO much potential. We&#39;ve gone from hunter gatherers to farmers to astronauts to particle physicists. We survived the Toba supervolcano, the ice age, basically got so damn powerful in warfare that its been all but entirely deincentivized, took flight without wings, left the planet, landed on the moon, and invented a means by which to connect our entire species globally through near instant communication. And truthfully, we&#39;ve barely even begun as a species. Even when we screw up astronomically we can and do fix it, and we have the potential to do it again and again.

People, such as myself, who live in first world postindustrial countries have completely and utterly transcended natural survival. Our food, water, and shelter is guaranteed and insured. We no longer need to deal with the problems associated with trying to survive naturally, instead, we need to survive artificially. Artificial survival is a process that has been in development since the dawn of civilization, and it is only in the 21st century when total artificial survival has become the mainstay way of life in most developed countries. This means that, with our basic life needs guaranteed, our concept of survival revolves around unnatural and artificial things we made, like money, social status, material possession, and philosophical motives (like a life goal). This is our survival now. People like to glorify natural survival as a harmless and good thing to do, and that human civilization has been a net negative to our species, but they suffer from the fallacy of thinking that just because something is natural it must mean it is good. Natural survival was just as stressful and hard as it is to artificially survive in today&#39;s world, we just stress about different things. Instead of stressing over how we will physically get our food, we are more concerned with the artificial monetary value of the food we are guaranteed to get. It is our goal as a species to transcend artificial survival one day, which would essentially be a utopia. A society where we live perfect lives untouched by hardship or any concept of survival. The second you are born, you are guaranteed everything. This is, of course, hypothetical, and I don&#39;t necessarily think that it is even possible to fully transcend artificial survival as an entire species.", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T16:48:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joon Jung", "comment_text": "Kurtzgesagt as a god:more birds!

Just like the choice to slowly remove trophically-inefficient foods (meat, eggs, milk, etc.) from our diets isn&#39;t a choice many of us want to make, but may have to make to increase the Earth&#39;s carrying capacity and hit the brakes on climate change for the sake of our collective survival.", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T16:34:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0394sp", "comment_text": "Future archeologists when they find a calendar for year 12021:<br><br>...What the hell?", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T16:33:44Z", "likes_count": 265}, {"comment_by": "TheKri\u00e9ger", "comment_text": "This makes me want to bury stuff with a small note saying what it does<br><br>Edit: someone should make a museum of just random things so that people in the future could understand them", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T16:33:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Douglas Willer", "comment_text": "The only thing I can say is: Perfection!", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T16:33:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shotacon", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt is made for our future generations to look back on our current understandings", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T16:33:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashesh Dubey", "comment_text": "Y&#39;all trying to tell me that we are in the middle of a pandemic because one of our ancestors decided to &quot;settle down&quot;??<br>Ok Boomer.", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T16:33:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JakeS Bujie", "comment_text": "Thanks, you changed my perspective on life again !", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T16:33:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OUSSAMA CHAIB", "comment_text": "This is related somehow to Dr. Stone<br>Where are u fans ? \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T16:33:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Braeden", "comment_text": "This video was beautiful!

Especially when that way of life is not that bad. I find the argument that significantly lowering your standard of living, just to be togheter with more people, not convincing. It does not matter how &#39;good&#39; you think people are, they will not want to give up their food and conforts, just to be togheter... <br>Another thing which is wrong in the video is that you seem to suggest that by the spreading of knowledge and the meeting of people the Agricultural Revolution came about. But it is proven that this revolution happenend in at least a dozen places on earth independent of eachother and on the same time! It is also proven that hunter gatherers knew how to cultivate crops, they probably did it on a limited scale, but they did not have to engage in agriculture because it was not (yet) necessary.  There were animals and plant enough in &#39;nature&#39;. The Agricultural Revolution was not a technological revolution! <br>A more convincing explanation I find in the concept of &#39;Population Pressure&#39; (even if it is contested...). Due to a very slow, but steady increase in population, the food you want is becoming more and more scarce. So you can do two things; 1. eat something else, but people don&#39;t want to do that if they have to. You can try to go somewhere else, but eventually all places will be taken by other people. So 2. people start growing the food they want themselves, or they stay in a particular place were they know they are certain they will find their food. Population pressure is not when a particular area can not sustain X amount of people anymore, but it is when there are to many people in that area for them to continue living the way they were. So people HAD TO engage in agriculture, I don&#39;t think they really wanted to.<br>Source: Sanderson D., The Neolithic Revolution, in Social transformations.

Small correction at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWu29PRCUvQ&amp;t=4m46s\">4:46</a>: it is not necessarily the case that &#39;pockets of knowledge expanded&#39;, depending on what is meant by it. Our ancestors had the same amount of knowledge as us on an individual level. They just knew more about their immediate environment, about plants, animals and nature in general. That insane amount of &#39;local knowledge&#39; kept them alive as hunters/gatherers, which would be impossible for us if we went back in time. On a societal level, the accumulation of knowledge is of course true: we accumulated knowledge by our extraordinary capacity to learn socially. Social learning combined with language is what distincts us from other intelligent species. There is, however, a lot of knowledge that is gone forever so it is not just a cumulative process or a one way street. This process is continuous: a lot of languages are dying at this very moment, and with them the &#39;local knowledge&#39; that accompanies those languages.

As an example the nordic bronze age culture had a lot more hunting than before. It is speculated that the concept of the earthmother is a remnant from the original europeans and the sky-father from the indo-europeans. The malnourishment of the settled tribe which only feeds on grain is the reason why the vikings, mongols, indoeuropeans, magyars and many more had the ability to invade as their diet had more animal protein and fat.

The mammoth was hunted down to extinction by humans.<br>And this is when we started using agriculture. Because we killed every megafaune in the nature. Because it was impossible to live just hunting. Maybe there were &quot;faune change&quot; people telling to stop overhunting and there were &quot;faune change denier&quot;. The humanity cornered itself into agriculture.<br>And right now, we are doing it against. By overexploiting our environment, we are cornering ourselves into finding new solution. So far, it was green revolution that drastically improved the productivity of agriculture.

Our time is limited and we cannot expect to answer all the questions about humanity in our lifetime. A lot of people including me have a hope that we will live to see humans evolve into a type 1 or a type 2 species but the sad truth is that we most likely won&#39;t. Instead of hoping we were born a few thousand years in the future we should enjoy the life we do have because we are lucky to be alive at all. Most people have a fear of being forgotten, we need to get over that fear. We need to know that every single one of us matters even if only to a few. Some of you reading this will go on to be multi millionaires but some may not even be recognized in society but what you need to know is that all that matters in your life is that YOU should be happy. History may remember a few but if you look at the big picture it is impossible to not be forgotten. In a few hundred years noone will know who Charlie Chaplin was or  who Albert Einstein was. You need to know that no matter how much you do or contribute you will be forgotten and you need to accept that fact. This generation is lucky we are may be too early to explore the universe but we are right on time to pave the way. It isn&#39;t about us it&#39;s about the future. All you need to care about is making you, your friends and family happy. All in all phenomenal video<br><br>Edit: Quite a few people commented saying that there are a lot of people who will not be forgotten but I shouldn&#39;t have been that specific with the time lol. What I meant was that eventually everyone will be forgotten. Like the big big picture like 2000-3000 years. My guess is noone alive will be remembered because the technology that they invented will either become obselete or so common that we won&#39;t even realize it was invented by someone (Most of us don&#39;t really know the guy who invented the wheel do we) and like that lights as we know it today will probably become obsolete along with the person who invented it.

You go from a few hours hunting and gathering, to a few +1 hours tilling crops as a supplement. A generation or so later this becomes 6 hours.

When Heracles came and Hades explained the situation, Heracles grabbed each prince with a hand and ripped them off the chairs, but their butts were stuck there for all eternity... and that is why ancient Greeks believed men from Athens have no ass...
