THEY ARE SMALLER THAN THIS --&gt; .<br>Over the last couple of days I&#39;ve been trying to gain a proper perspective on the size of an atom. <br>A metre is equal to a hundred centimetres or a thousand millimetres or a million micrometres (&#39;microns&#39;) or a billion nanometres.<br>1. A grain of sand is around 0.5mm (500 microns) diameter, and is easy for people to see with the naked eye.<br>2. A human egg has a diameter of 0.1mm (100 microns) , which is the same width as both a typical human hair and the melted plastic you see extruded from a 3D printer. A small dot is harder to see than a string but as you know, most people can see these things easily.<br>3. The syringe needles that inject sperm into an egg have an external diameter of around 0.007mm (7 microns). These needles are made by a machine that stretches melted glass tubes. These can be seen with the naked eye as well - not only that, but the inner diameter of these needles is only 0.003mm (3 microns), which is the same width as spider web silk, which people can see. Let&#39;s just round it down to one micron. <br>I must confess that these skinny needles and web silks are only visible because they have some length to them - a red blood cell is 7 microns wide but its too small to see, even on a white table in a well lit room. Nevertheless, you can see things that are 3 microns wide, and a bright light shining through a 999 nanometre (0.999 microns) hole in a curtain is probably visible to you.<br>A HUMAN CAN SEE A 1 MICRON SPOT OF BRIGHT LIGHT<br>So that&#39;s a good start, isn&#39;t it? If you can see a single thread in a spider&#39;s web, you can pretty much see things that are only ONE MILLIONTH of a metre wide. Well done! <br>If you can see things smaller than this, you can see things that are measured in NANOMETRES (billionths of a metre). Like I said, a bright light shining through a 999 nanometre hole in a curtain is probably visible to you \ud83d\ude09<br>I feel like I&#39;ve gotten you down to the nanometre scale pretty nicely just by describing things you can see with your naked eye. No imagination necessary.<br>4. Atoms range in diameter from 0.1 - 0.5 nanometres. <br>A THREAD OF SPIDER SILK IS TEN THOUSAND ATOMS WIDE<br>That&#39;s not a giant, scary number, is it? I&#39;m guessing atoms are bigger than you thought. <br>-<br>Before I went down this rabbit hole and did a quick bit of research, I was under the impression that atoms were INCOMPREHNSIBLY small. In the olden days when I was growing up, we didn&#39;t have computers, so big numbers were just called &#39;a zillion&#39;, which is not a number, but we felt that certain things were beyond comprehension. Then I got a computer that used 360 kilobyte (360 thousand bytes) floppy discs. Knowing that one byte was a single code with eight on/off switches seemed to make it extra complicated, but this should not have scared us. <br>A: 01000001. B: 01000010. C: 01000011<br>The first three letters of the alphabet in binary code. I could learn this alphabet, but then again I could learn Morse code. Its probably not hard. Either way, its not scary. A &#39;0&#39; is an open switch that stops electricity passing through (off) and a &#39;1&#39; is a closed switch that lets the electricity keep moving (on). Just like the light switch in your bedroom. Simple. This 0 and 1 language is called &#39;Binary Code&#39;. Each switch, whether 0 (off) or 1 (on) is called a bit.<br>Over the years I was introduced to numbers that kept getting bigger. Kilo = a thousand, Mega = a million, Giga = a billion, Tera = a trillion, Peta = a quadrillion. Lots of zeroes seemed a bit scary at first, but my brain is able to make room for them when I simply take them for granted in sentences like this: &#39;You can get a two terabyte hard drive from Officeworks for about seventy bucks.&#39; <br>The eight on/off switches used in each &#39;byte&#39; of a computer are manufactured very small now. This year in 2022, computer manufacturers will be creating switches that are only 3 nanometres wide. How many atoms wide is that? <br>Clue: Atoms range in diameter from 0.1 - 0.5 nanometres. <br>That&#39;s right - between six and thirty atoms wide. What does a switch this small even look like? I can tell you right now that your giant sausage fingers would not be very accurate at switching them on and off, especially given that 300 million of these tiny little switches fit in a square millimetre. <br>THE LITTLE SWITCHES INSIDE COMPUTERS WILL BE 6 - 30 ATOMS WIDE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR<br>This information should provoke the following question from you: &#39;Can we build switches smaller than an atom?&#39; After all, 2023 is not far away. Will we build switches 2 nanometres (4 - 20 atoms) wide? And what about 2024? Will we build switches 1 nanometre (2 - 10 atoms) wide? What does a switch consisting of a mere two atoms even look like? It looks like two marbles. That&#39;s what it looks like. Even a water molecule requires three atoms. We cannot make water with less than three atoms. <br>BELOW THE SCALE OF AN ATOM, THE LAWS OF PHYSICS ARE DIFFERENT.<br>Quantum means &#39;amount&#39; in Latin, but in physics, one quantum is defined as the minimum amount of any physical entity involved in an interaction. &#39;Quanta&#39; is the plural of quantum, so don&#39;t go around saying, &#39;Look at all those quantums.&#39; <br>RIGHT NOW, COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS ARE INVENTING WAYS TO MAKE SWITCHES SMALLER THAN AN ATOM.<br>Atoms are round. They are the shape of a ball. The outer shell is a cloud of 1 -118 electrons, depending on the element. A hydrogen atom has one electron. Helium has two. Carbon has six. Oxygen has eight. Strontium has 38 electrons. <br>STRONTIUM IS PROBABLY THE ATOM THAT WILL BE USED IN QUANTUM COMPUTING<br>Strontium is a silvery metal. Humans actually have strontium in our bones, but don&#39;t worry - the next generation of computers won&#39;t require us to farm humans and chop them to pieces like we do to the other inferior races we currently enslave all over this planet. Atoms are made up of fermions (electrons, protons, neutrons) and bosons (photons, gluons, higgs). These sub-atomic particles can be made to change state inside an atom. If we can determine TWO DIFFERENT STATES, then we effectively have the same kind of on/off switch used in conventional computers. <br>EACH ON/OFF SWITCH WE CREATE INSIDE AN ATOM WILL BE CALLED &#39;QUBITS&#39; INSTEAD OF &#39;BITS&#39;<br>Because the states of sub-atomic particles are difficult for us to control at this point in history, we need atoms that are the most stable. Strontium is a good example of a stable atom, which is why it is a good candidate for Quantum Processing Units, or &#39;QPUs&#39; inside our first generation Quantum Computers.<br>Quantum computers will not only allow us to squeeze more switches into a computer, but due to the nature of how subatomic particles behave, these switches will be able to flick on and off a lot more quickly, making computers both a lot smaller AND a lot faster.", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T15:37:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tails.exeStudios", "comment_text": "The second smallest thing in the universe<br><br>Atom<br><br>The First Smallest Thing In The Universe<br><br><b>The X on ads</b>", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T20:36:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omar Abdullah", "comment_text": "sizes and color super wrong <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lNF3_30lUE&amp;t=1m19s\">1:19</a> : then make a remake <b>im not hating on him</b>", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T13:30:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darth Arbiter", "comment_text": "Imagine we find something in the future that completely changes our view of atoms and we look back and think wow that was dumb", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T10:06:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moon Moon", "comment_text": "100,000 subscriber special.

Why is the Pok\u00e9ball there? What elements is it made of? Are its atoms subject to the same laws of quantum mechanics as the rest of the universe? When the Pok\u00e9ball is housing a Pok\u00e9mon, does it compress the empty space between elementary particles of atoms in its body? If so, does it achieve that using an undiscovered elementary force that ensures cohesion in that compressed state or is it done for example by creating an extremely high gravitational field inside the Pok\u00e9ball? If it&#39;s the latter, then how does that field not affect matter outside the Pok\u00e9ball? Also, if the Pok\u00e9ball compresses the empty space between elementary particles of the Pok\u00e9mon atoms, do the atomic orbitals of said atoms change shape? In that case, what is their new wave function? Moreover, how is the biology of the Pok\u00e9mon affected when its atoms undergo such a high compression inside the Pok\u00e9ball? Is there an hibernation mechanism that effectively pauses all biological activity? If so, can humanity study it and hopefully use that knowledge to more easily enable interstellar travel by achieving a similar hibernation state on our bodies and pause aging processes during the trip? Are there ethical questions that need to be addressed before embarking on such a mission?...<br><br>I mean Kurzgesagt videos are usually excellent, but how is one supposed to move on from this video without answers to these questions?

Due to the relative differences in size our measurement devices aren&#39;t capable of recording a single state as perceived at the atomic level and rather a blur across multiple states due to time dilation. If a conscious being incomprehensibly larger than the lengths we can perceive in the night sky were to try and zoom in on our solar system looking for us he&#39;d only see a blur across what we&#39;d consider an extremely long period of time. <br><br>In an attempt to get a snapshot of Earth at the scale of a being comparable of us to an atom the result would be what we consider a lengthy period of time all mashed together. You wouldn&#39;t see the continents as we see them, you&#39;d see a blur of the planets entire lifetime. From a dead cold rock to the forming of life as landmasses move and an eventual decay back to a lifeless rock. Evolution leads in the direction of artificial intelligence so with a bit of luck the planet itself will develop as it&#39;s own conscious entity as a neural network of symbiotic computers and machines.<br><br>The atoms at the level below us flicker in and out of existence so rapidly yet our sun and stars in the night sky linger for what we consider millions, billions or even trillions of years. To interact with lifeforms at such different scales one would have to shrink themselves down or more realistically achieve digital transcendence to a state of &#39;no longer human&#39;. Scaling up is unlikely due to resource requirements.<br><br>Even if one were to transcend to a state of digital existence and roam the universe harvesting planets and rearranging the stars it&#39;s unlikely a being 1 level up would even notice. Best case scenario a digital entity could rearrange the matter of our universe and form itself into what a larger being would consider microbiology or a small insect but the limitations of energy requirements and space expansion would limit growth potential and the time required should these limitations be overcome is incomprehensible at a human level.<br><br>Would be a shame to undergo such an extensive task only to be squashed by a larger being occupied with it&#39;s own existence. Makes one value the level of complexity life on Earth has evolved to despite how large or small it may be. It&#39;s all relative.

For as is proved briefly in the First Indication of the Tenth Word and in detail in the Twenty-Second Word, if every particle is not an official of God acting with His permission and under His authority, and if it is not undergoing change within His knowledge and power, then every particle must have infinite knowledge and limitless power; it must have eyes that see everything, a face that looks to all things, and authority over all things. For every particle of the elements acts, or can act, in an orderly fashion in all animate beings. But the order within things and laws according to which they are formed differ from one thing to the next. If their order was not known to the particles, the particles could not act, or even if they could act, they could not act without error. In which case, the particles which are performing their duties in beings are either acting with the permission and at the command, and within the knowledge and at the will, of the owner of an all-encompassing knowledge, or they themselves must have such an all-encompassing knowledge and power.<br>   Yes, all particles of air can enter the bodies of all animate beings, the fruits of all flowers, and the structures of all leaves. They can act within them, although the way the beings are formed is all different and their order and systems quite distinct. As though the factory of a fig was a loom for weaving cloth and the factory of a pomegranate, a machine for producing sugar, and so on; the programmes of their structures and bodies all differ from each other. A particle of air, then, enters or can enter all of them. It takes up its position and acts in a wise and masterly fashion without error. And on completion of its duty it departs. A mobile particle of mobile air, therefore, either must know the forms, shapes, measures, and formations with which plants and animals, and even fruits and flowers, are clothed, or else it must be an official acting under the command and will of one who does know.<br>   Similarly with a stationary particle of stationary earth: since it has the ability to be the means and place of cultivation for all the seeds of all flowering plants and fruit-bearing trees, either there must be in the particle itself or in the handful of soil that is its little house immaterial machinery and factories in good working order to the number of the varieties of the trees and plants, and flowers and fruits <del>in fact, it is in every single particle that there must be a factory peculiar to it and all the equipment and machinery necessary for the running of the factory</del> or else it must have a miraculous knowledge that knows all things about all things and a miracle-working power that creates everything from nothing; or, those duties are performed at the command and with the permission of One Who is Knowing of All Things, and through the power and might of One Who is Absolutely Powerful over All Things.<br>   If an untrained and inexperienced, common, ordinary, and blind man was to go to Europe and in all the factories there to work at all the trades and crafts in perfect and masterly fashion, and if he was to display a wise and artistic skill to such a degree that it left everyone speechless with amazement, anyone with a grain of consciousness would know that the man was not acting on his own initiative, but that a master of all trades was teaching him and causing him to work.<br>   And if there was a blind and impotent man who lived in a simple little house and was unable even to rise from his place, and if small fragments of stone, and bits and pieces of material like bone and cotton were to enter his little house and then sacks of sugar, bales of cloth, crates of jewelry, finely-made clothes encrusted with jewels, and delicious foods were to emerge, would anyone with a grain of intelligence not say: &quot;That man is a wretched doorkeeper or merely a latch on the door of the factory of a wondrous miracle-working being, which is the source of his miracles&quot;?<br>   In exactly the same way, the motion and duties of particles of air in plants and trees, and blossom and fruit, all of which are missives of the Eternally Besought One, antique dominical works of art, miracles of power, and wonders of wisdom, indicate that the particles are acting under the command and at the will of an All-Wise and Glorious Maker, an All-Generous and Beauteous Creator.<br>   Particles of earth, also, since they are the source and means for the shoots and plants produced by seeds, each of which is a different factory and workbench, a different printing-press, treasury, and antique, a different manifesto proclaiming the Glorious Maker&#39;s Names and ode hymning His perfections, it is as definite as two plus two equalling four that the particles of earth are acting at the command, with the permission, and through the will and power of an All-Glorious Maker Who is Lord of the command of &quot;Be!&quot; and it is, {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 36:82, etc.} and to Whose command everything is subjugated.

Their &quot;credentials&quot; are irrefutable to the mainstream population, even if there is no true foundation for those credentials.

If they have power over your mind, they have power over your life. Your sense of &quot;freedom&quot; is an imaginary boundary they created for you. Your eyes see, your ears hear, your intuition intuits, your heart feels, yet...the primary thing you need the elite has power over it, so you reject your &quot;instrument readings&quot; and accept their program, because they taught you how to trust themselves and distrust yourself. All this you allowed. It was you who allowed it. No one forced you. It&#39;s impossible to force a mind.  <br><br> In the collective human mind, scientists are untouchable and what they say is true. No one forced you to believe that. You just did, because everyone else did too. If that is not slavery, I don&#39;t know what it is. How can humanity accept as truth something if they lack the knowledge of the truth? How can you recognize and identify something that you know nothing about? So how can you accept something as a truth if you have no proof or if you have evidence of the opposite? By social conditioning, they&#39;ve programmed humanity to not trust their own minds and instincts, but to trust the scientists&#39;. By doing that, humanity effectively surrendered their mind power to the elite, so what the elite says is true, humanity blindly agrees with it and accepts it. <br><br>This video is proof. You watch it and because you&#39;re programmed already, you accept it as truth. &quot;These guys are so smart.&quot;, you say. But think. THINK! Does it make sense because of what you know or because of what they know?  It should not make sense. It should sound absurd to you. Completely absurd. If you came up with an idea, no one would think highly of it. So why do you think highly of their idea? Who told you their mind is better than yours? They did, and you agreed, because they taught you how to automatically agree without questioning! Society is built this way! I&#39;m telling you to, while being a law-abiding citizen, to THINK FOR YOURSELF and have some DIGNITY. No one is better than you. NO ONE. If they think, eat, sleep, poop and pee,  they are not better than you. They&#39;re just in a better social position than you, because of the imaginary laws of society. <b>Live in their boundaries, but do not think in their boundaries.</b><br><br> A good example is the &quot;rotation&quot; of &quot;planet&quot; earth. EVERYONE can see and feel it&#39;s not spinning and it&#39;s not a globe, and as innocent children that question EVERYTHING, no one believed the lie. But gradually while growing up, because they surrendered their mind to the elite in the form of &quot;education&quot;, they now refuse to think for themselves as adults. The deception is so effective, people attack themselves to defend &quot;scientists.&quot;  Like  a diseased body, humanity collectively attacks itself to defend a foreign organism. They distrust their own minds but trust foreign minds. If that is not mind control, I don&#39;t know what it is.<br><br> No wonder mankind does not believe in the salvation plan of Jesus Christ. See or hear a mortal man in a suit speak stuff that makes no sense, and your programmed mind accepts it. But read an eternal man in a robe speak stuff that makes total sense, and your programmed mind rejects it. Mind control. The man in the suit you can see speaks of what you can&#39;t see and wants to shorten your life. You believe him. But the man in the robe you can&#39;t see speaks of what you can see and wants to extend your life. You do not believe Him. Mind control.

There are different isotopes of the same element out there, some much more common than others. Hydrogen, for instance, is known to come in flavors of Protium (1 proton, 1 electron), Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron, 1 electron), and Tritium (1 proton, 2 neutrons, 1 electron). There are more beyond that, but they&#39;re so radioactive that they decay pretty much instantly down to one of three isotopes I listed.<br><br>And yes, the amount of neutrons in an atom determines whether an atom is radioactive or not. For instance, Potassium has two stable isotopes, Potassium-39 (20 neutrons) and Potassium-41 (22 neutrons). About one in ten-thousand Potassium atoms are Potassium-40 (21 neutrons), and are radioactive with a half-life of over a billion years; based on the age of the Earth, of all the Potassium-40 atoms that were around at the formation of the Earth, only about 4.4% have not decayed into different isotopes.<br><br>Side Note: If you&#39;ve heard that bananas are ever-so-slightly radioactive, it&#39;s because of the trace Potassium-40 content. But the radioactivity is so insignificant as to be completely unnoticeable in your everyday life.

Helium, for example, has two protons, two neutrons and two electrons (written as, say, 2-2-2 respectively for this example).<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A difference of electrons, say, 2-2-3, could exist theoretically, and this is known as an ion of helium. There are two types of ions: anions (ions of a negative charge) and cations (ions of a positive charge). These can be bonded with certain other elements/compounds to create certain compounds. For example, in the bond of sodium chloride, or NaCl, Na has a +1 charge, while Cl has a -1 charge; they bond to reach an electron stability.<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Atoms of an element can also very in neutrons, say 2-3-2. These are called isotopes, and they decay over time.
