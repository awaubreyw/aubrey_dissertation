Time doesn\u2019t even exist proven by many big heads in our world ... were just a genetic soup or a zoo ( experiment) , dont take this life to seriously its not worth it system wants you to care about your life so you could work for them and reach their selfish goals , we should all be one but yet we tell our selfs lies so few people can be on the top and have everything for them selfs thats why we are not ready to see our fathers/creators. Only nasa and few special people knows about them yet they manipulate us about their existence that they dont exist yeee right ... sad truth is were just cattle and shepherd is not ready to let us free.. were waiting in line to be killed for their ambitions , i could write allot more but its not worth it  i told my point . im just an ant in the ant field waiting to be exterminated by the owner of the land which grows his selfish fruits for him self not caring about others and other living things. Nature is my true teacher and im happy to die for it are you ? Or are you going to die for somebody else which intentions sre selfish and evil??

Consciousness+curiosity+memory+reflexion+creativity+space.time=intelligence a.k.a. the skill that makes you breack your current condition to evolve to another. Hi there, i thought about that and i think we can reduce the application or the tool into the core, or the fundamentals wich in interaction will give the tools. My exemple : learning=memory+consciousness+Space.time+random. Here we got consciousness= who and what you are and do naturally. Memory: the matter(and the web of it) that stock, the energy (and the streams of it) that circulate and is emeted. random is universal chaos occuring (influencing the learning). Space.time because what the fuck is going on to anything without it? So here, we got an application (learning) and the core(the formula) activating the process. I thought about it like the formula is like electron and proton and the result of this fundamental core is called atom or intelligence in this case.

For example, we won&#39;t need doctors because machine learning can diagnose and heal diseases better than any human-doctor. The situation will be similar for surgeons, mechanics, engineers, etc... So what jobs still exist in the future. I suppose we still need actors, athletes, comedians, football players, tennis players, or prostitutes... which are relating to entertainment because when we are unemployed, we will have plenty of free time.<br>3/ In the far future, when most of the problems in the universe would have been solved, what humans will become? May people be devolved? If someone watched Wall-E, an animated science fiction, you probably have the same questions. Will we be meatballs? When we don&#39;t use our brains and muscles to do anything, they will be useless and shrunk. We may have tiny brains with limited cognitive capability.<br>4/ People have been evolving because we have to work, create, fight against enemies, solve problems, and so on in order to survive and make progress. We have been suffering and struggling all the time, but all the obstacles and sufferings have helped humans evolve. If AI can do all the issues for us, will we bother to do anything? If we don&#39;t need to work for food, for energy, or money, since these resources will be abundant, what will drive us? Shall we become gods or meatballs?<br>5/ AI may become more intelligent than humans, but will they have emotions, feelings? Can robots love, hate, have jealous feelings?

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.<br><br>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.<br><br>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.<br><br>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.<br><br>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.<br><br>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.<br><br>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.<br><br>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.<br><br>He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.<br><br>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.<br><br>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.<br><br>He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.<br><br>He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.<br><br>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:<br><br>For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:<br><br>For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:<br><br>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:<br><br>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:<br><br>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:<br><br>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences<br><br>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:<br><br>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:<br><br>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.<br><br>He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.<br><br>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.<br><br>He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.<br><br>He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.<br><br>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.<br><br>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.<br><br>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.<br><br>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

Our Intelligence is based upon expectation.  Why?  One neural network has a conditional output of an expected input. In simple language, It&#39;s like you can&#39;t put 3 pin plug into 2 pin socket. Only the data from the 3 pin socket can flow. Hence, the mesh of various neural networks in our brain co exist together to form a dynamic filter to get filtered input from the world and expected evolutionarily learnt output as behaviour to survive.  That creates a learned mesh of neural network which always expect a certain kind of behaviour of a certain kind of action taken by certain kind of a being, thing, or something they visually learnt, etc. That&#39;s what creates intelligence. Remember, at core level, everything began in simpler terms, there was input and there was an reaction as an output. Expectation is just a product which led to intelligent behaviour. If you don&#39;t expect and stop expecting altogether you will find that you are dumb in a way.

Oh, and also being financially successful and sharing the same black and white morals and religious beliefs with your social circles. Having a post-secondary degree that isn&#39;t required for your job helps too. Also being confident that you&#39;re right when you&#39;re wrong makes you more intelligent than communicating that you might be wrong. <br>Of course, this isn&#39;t what intelligence is. But it&#39;s what everyone inherently thinks because humanity varies so widely in cognitive function that they can&#39;t agree upon anything deeper than surface pleasantries and conveniences. The only way to recognize intelligence is to have intelligence yourself. This is because intellectual cues and subtleties are only noticed by those who share them. A dumb example is the show Frasier which was wrongly but popularly known as a smart show. A large enough number of TV viewers at the time (supposedly) struggled to understand the jokes. How would those people determine who is and isn&#39;t intelligent? Since, of course, we all feel like we know an intelligent person when we see one. They will use themselves as a marker for intelligence (as we all do) and find someone that shares their own psychological traits. <br>I just made all this stuff up and don&#39;t stand by any of it. Sounds alright so maybe idk. Also, some people waste too much time trying to calculate and test intelligence. They&#39;re doing the same thing as dumb people, using themselves as a standard, and creating a method where they can score high. I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re not going to be able to test for intelligence. Albert Einstein, a man so intelligent that he&#39;s a household name and the poster boy for intelligence, might not have even been very intelligent beyond his scope. There&#39;s so much in the world, are we to think that an intelligent person should be better than most other people in 50% of those things? How much does intelligence really matter? Are we just trying to recruit more innovators and scientists? Well then maybe we&#39;re looking for a certain type of person and not a certain level of this &quot;intelligence&quot; concept. Is intelligence even real? Maybe some people are just better at certain things for no special reason. Consciousness might not even be real either. It might just be a fancy word for &quot;awareness&quot; that we like to give to our own species because we can do things with hardly any relevance to anything like recognize ourselves in a mirror or take credit for achievements made by other people by saying that it&#39;s a human achievement. I can&#39;t find iron or forge it and I can&#39;t build textile factories so if it were all just me then no iron age and no industrial revolution. Can all intelligent people do those things?<br>Don&#39;t let all this text fool you, I really don&#39;t care. Add me on Snapchat and I&#39;ll send you my IQ score that determines how good of a human I am.

The whole blue and black or white and gold dress is a perfect example of how someone views the world. They connect images and sounds with what they perceive through their eyes and ears, also our senses our taste and touch play a major role. So people who had a different outlook probably either peaceful/calm see the dress as gold and white  and people who were stressed or mad keep in mind that this could be subconscious or not but it makes you see blue and black. The real world is opened up to people who know the truth to perception and how the world actually is but only a few number of people are adapting to see outside the \u201cnorm\u201d and these kids are being snatched and kidnapped so they elite can place them in their network of future prodigy\u2019s at what they do also not to mention them being trained their whole life almost to excel at this thing.

(I can&#39;t remember what I read in 1 page but If I read, for example, a book 3-5 times I&#39;d remember but that takes too long + I hate reading, especially reading made up stories that are irrelevant or I already know the point of why they were written in the first place) that&#39;s why I won&#39;t ever graduate because school cares only about your memory, not your actual skills, awareness or that you are great at anything else. It just doesn&#39;t feel fair to me. Well I still can find a job but without any title so, obviously and fairly, I&#39;ll get paid less. That leaves me with only one good option, making my own business and hoping for the best. I hope this literature thing can be sorted out in the future for other dyslectic people with real inability to read too much.

Also see Orcas teaching their kids to hunt seals by wounding them then battering them around with their tails like they&#39;re playing baseball and the seal is the ball.  (I don&#39;t think that&#39;s origin of the &quot;killer whale&quot; epithet, but it&#39;s that sort of behavior that earns it in my books.)<br>Self awareness/awareness of mortality is a really difficult thing to measure, but most animals can be observed taking steps to preserve their life in life-threatening situations, meaning the concept of death is not unique to humans.  Awareness of its inevitability might be, but the fact that elephant mothers will stay and mourn their dead baby, in some cases for so long that they wind up separated from the herd and dying on their own, but we don&#39;t see similar displays about older elephants suggests there might be a certain understanding of the fact that the baby has more life left than the old timer.  Or it&#39;s just that elephants have a very strong mothering instinct that overrides the rational conclusion that the baby is dead and it takes that amount of time for the mother to recognize that fact and move on.  Like I said, difficult to measure<br>Tool use has been observed in many species.  In many cases, the animal in question even enhances the utility of their took by doing things like removing stray branches off the stick, etc.  There&#39;s also some animals that will keep their tools, though they do have a tendency to leave the tools where they are and bring the job to the tool - or find a new tool nearby - rather than keeping the tool with them.<br>The one thing that humans (and our ancestors - the many extinct species of out genus, and the main contender for the precursors of that genus, the Australopithecus) do that I&#39;ve never seen an animal do is using tools to make better tools.  All the way from the simple stone cutting edges of the earliest stone cutting tools to the Acheulean handaxe to obsidian blades, all stone tools require the use of another stone to create them, and all but the simplest - particularly something like an Acheulean handaxe or obsidian blades - take a considerable amount of effort to make and were almost certainly crafted to be used long term.  Moving upward from there we get into metal technologies, wherein we use a complex structure to melt ore into metal, then we use other complex tools to shape the metal into the desired configuration.  And then it just keeps building on things from there - now we have complex oil refineries built using tools that use oil based products in order to make oil based products more efficiently, we have keyboards to program computers that would have no way of understanding what to do with a keyboard&#39;s signals had not one of its ancestors something like 40-50 years ago now been programmed with how to interpret a keyboard by punchcard, which in turn was only intelligible because the people building the first punchcard based computers did something with the design to make it intelligible using some other method of input...  It&#39;s all just layer after layer of tool refinement that makes human technology do the things it does - so many layerings in fact that no one human could ever hope to comprehend the full chain of events with enough detail to be able to reproduce them.<br><br>Of course, this theory falls apart the moment we find some animal that consistently uses tools to create better tools for later use and shows no sign of conquering the world despite having been doing so for millions of years as well.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:20:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Heusch", "comment_text": "Looooooooove\ud83d\udc9c", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:20:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zachary Rugee", "comment_text": "Im glad this episode didn\u2019t give me a existential crisis like the egg", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:19:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Geoffrey Gonzales", "comment_text": "who are the people disliking this tho and why", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:18:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rubenpros 609", "comment_text": "You guys need to make a game in this cuarenting", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:18:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maxim Quantum", "comment_text": "When the gates open to Belgium, I\u2019m gonna buy many items from the kurzesagt shop.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:18:37Z", "likes_count": 23}, {"comment_by": "Kmonique", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:18:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anamalece Beyonder", "comment_text": "Yeaas,Yess,Bss", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:18:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Ortega", "comment_text": "Hermosa animaci\u00f3n y contenido !", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:18:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anamalece Beyonder", "comment_text": "Yeaas,Yess,Bss,Bad Bad Na/No", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:18:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FalconTalk", "comment_text": "Depth", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:17:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anamalece Beyonder", "comment_text": "Yeaas,Yess,Bss", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:17:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChrispBacon", "comment_text": "This video made me uncomfortable", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:17:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quackerz", "comment_text": "&quot;Our intelligence is invaluable, since we always sell ourselves out with it.&quot;<br><br>~Some Person named Me.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:16:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tam ko", "comment_text": "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.\r<br>A proverb from the Bible.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:16:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Conor Murphy", "comment_text": "Can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t talk about Mice, the most intelligent species on the earth.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:16:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anamalece Beyonder", "comment_text": "Yeaas,Yess,Bss,More", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:16:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sauli Saarimaa", "comment_text": "Thats cool and all, but<br>This video needs more birds.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:16:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anamalece Beyonder", "comment_text": "Yeaas,Yess,Bss,Bad Bad Na/No", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:16:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael", "comment_text": "&quot;Intelligence, something common in Europe and Asia, but a rare trait in American and Brazilian government officials&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:16:10Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Anamalece Beyonder", "comment_text": "Holy Books,Sacred Texts,Scripture,Word Of God,God&#39;s Word,Literature,Entertainment/Sports Entertainment,x3sxpsxPs", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:15:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Coppola", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t know what it is but I know my friends do not have it", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:15:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Volant", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=5m38s\">5:38</a> Minecraft dungeons ref", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T23:14:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Google made me do it", "comment_text": "Hmmm, this really gave me a different view on culture.

To bring True Healthcare Change and lower drug and procedure prices by getting rid of unneeded regulations and paperwork, requiring that American drug prices match or beat European prices to have access to American Markets and banning the Pharmaceutical lobby from influencing legislation. We will deliver on Lowering the cost of College, we will do this by eliminating subsidies that are not used directly for education, and regulating the amount of administrators per student so that bloated college bureaucracies dont line the pockets of people who do very little. We will reform the justice system. In a nation where many states have outright legalized marijuana, why are there people in jail for marijuana crimes that would not exist in some states, all prisoners who were convicting solely on possession of Marijuana shall be released. In fighting the drug war, we must not punish adicts solely on their addiction, but the providers, and especially those that distribute to minors. To stop the overt influx of drugs, we support a strong policy of border security, most notably a wall. In areas of the Southern Border where it is feasible, checkpoints and wall should be built to see to it that our communities are not poisoned by the loss of overdose and the destructive consequences of addiction. Through these measures we will rebuild the American family, we will restore justice, we will empower the most unfortunate people of our society, and we will thrive. <br>Republicans will better the K-12 education system, will lower the cost of college and healthcare, will rebuild the communities that need it the most, will end the drug crisis, and ensure justice reform.

Studies looked at the way chimpanzees learned how to use tools to get termites. It turns out it&#39;s pretty complicated. Not any stick will do. It has to be from a very specific type of plant that makes straight twigs, the chimps have to remove the leaves and side branches, and the twig has to be the right size or the termites will snap it in two with their mandibles, yet it still has to be small enough to pull the termites out of their colony without knocking them off the side of the stick. The point here is that this is not an instinctual process, because we can look and see young chimps completely messing it up over and over again.

Everything has consciousness, it&#39;s just that consciousnesses are on different levels, and for inanimate objects, this is so low that time seems to skip until said object&#39;s materials are recycled into beings with consciousness. Biological creatures, robots and other analog clockwork computation machines with sufficient perception can experience consciousness. The idea is that consciousness exists everywhere in everything, it&#39;s just that it can only be experienced by groups with sufficient perception.<br>I know firsthand about the different levels of consciousness, having been awake, asleep and dizzy in different parts of my life. When my brain is functioning at a lower level, it experiences it less. I can dream, but my brain is writing backwards while sleeping and that&#39;s why they&#39;re hard to remember. Yes, I assert that amnesia induces neutralisation of previous consciousness from that time, like a sort of psychological rebirth. Also, unconsciousness isn&#39;t something that exists. Whatever you call that is just consciousness on an extremely low level.

A video where I know the field and can comment on it with full confidence!<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=0m13s\">0:13</a> It is a trait, it&#39;s just that crazy ideologically possessed people don&#39;t want to accept it. For more on this ideological possession and why psychology and other social science fields have a particular tint to them, read the Psychopath Test<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=0m32s\">0:32</a> All of these things are inter-related and some are just reworded or just in a different context. This to me is as close to the truth without actually just saying it.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=0m41s\">0:41</a> This is actually the main problem with the topic, people cannot decide on a definition. Some people for good reasons, others for malicious ones there to obfuscate or manipulate. The second example is intelligence. The first example is not, and the second example is more of a consequence rather than the actual meat and potatoes.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=0m53s\">0:53</a> This is actually a huge problem. It&#39;s not that there isn&#39;t a clear answer, Spearman did a fantastic job, it&#39;s that there is a sub section of ideologically possessed people who don&#39;t want this to be true. Their entire philosophy hinges on everyone being equal, when their goal should be to treat everyone equal.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=1m14s\">1:14</a> This is a good analogy, it&#39;s not how I would describe it, but it works and it&#39;s understandable. Keep in mind though that this can confuse people as some people equate personality such as agreeableness (wrongfully termed as emotional intelligence) <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=3m17s\">3:17</a> It&#39;s not. Hard wired behavior doesn&#39;t include learning new skills, which is the basis of intelligence. Think of it like playing a card game like Magic the Gathering, you can use a deck that was made for you, and follow basic instructions on how to use the deck, but this doesn&#39;t make you a good player, or able to learn new things. Intelligence is learning new things not included in the default programing. I said earlier that it was a trait inherent, this is because you have a set rate at which you can learn. This is often measured as IQ. You can degrade this by abusing yourself, not eating right or enough, and with time, like all other biological functions, degrades with time. The reason why people think that hard wired behavior is intelligence is a semantic problem, but fortunately it&#39;s not related to ideological possession I talked about earlier so far as I can tell. Why there is a blurred line in all this is because it&#39;s hard to separate, at least for some people, learning as a hard wired trait and a general unwillingness to set a line somewhere practical. If the line is &quot;any behavior, hard wired or not, that solves a problem in the world&quot; then most organisms have intelligence. if the line is learning new behaviors, then that draws a clear line through most living things. People who are lower in contentiousness (the personality trait) don&#39;t like lines because that restricts thoughts, it really is just a personality difference between researchers.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=3m26s\">3:26</a> This is intelligence. The bee learned something. The act of learning is nothing special, so we often measure how fast they can learn based on the complexity of the problem.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=5m00s\">5:00</a> So far this video is doing a good job, but this part is a problem. Creativity is not intelligence, it&#39;s personality. Openness to experience, although related to IQ in many ways, defines creativity. Being willing to play with ideas is not the same as being able to learn. The simplest way I can put it is that where intelligence is the tools in the toolbox, creativity is whether or not the mechanic is willing to use the tools in strange ways. Say for example you need a hammer, some people will say &quot;I don&#39;t have a hammer, can&#39;t do it boss&quot; but more creative people will say &quot;haha, I got a hammer for you&quot; <b>pulls out a pipe wrench.</b> Creativity in this way is personality, not intelligence. People who are less creative aren&#39;t less able to learn (although as brought up before there are correlations to IQ and creativity, we can explain this by the two working well together, but they are still separate things) <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=5m54s\">5:54</a>: This is a personality trait called conscientiousness, which I brought up earlier. It also has a correlation with IQ but is not as highly correlated as Openness. Conscientiousness is the proclivity to use intelligence in long term planning rather than just short turn planning. Its also related to conservatism (openness being related to liberalism) and a want to draw borders (both politically and definitionally) around things. Plans work better when things are hard defined rather than vague, after all you can&#39;t plan for things if you have no way of defining other elements. These two personality traits are not exclusive, but often show up as the main divide between political lines (outside of agreeably which is how well you work with others, this is the main trait for the other political sphere we&#39;re seeing more of: globalism, and a want to see people working together). Each of these traits push us towards solutions to problems. Problems always have multiple solutions, like the racoon example, an agreeable person might not want to destroy things to get what they want (though this can be changed through conscientiousness as that trait also tends to judge, and with agreeableness having a &quot;us and them&quot; mentality, it can devolve into what we know as racism and other forms of prejudice based on in group and out group preferences). But a less agreeable person might just say &quot;Fuck this... imma tip that bitch over&quot; and get the treat that way. If personality wasn&#39;t involved, solutions would be made randomly.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=6m56s\">6:56</a> This is an example of agreeability. Given though you don&#39;t have to have much of it to consider other people, it still is a good example of the personality trait in action. People who are less agreeable will discount these elements.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=7m48s\">7:48</a> This is conscientiousness verses agreeability.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=8m05s\">8:05</a> This is actually just complex agreeability and conscientiousness, both of which humans are well known for. Some of you who got this far might be thinking &quot;culture is evil! Racism! RRRR&quot; without really understanding that all tools have downsides. High IQ individuals have problems they have to deal with. Mental illness, and proclivity for things like Alzheimer&#39;s is one such draw back. Getting rid of culture means getting rid of past knowledge. People who want to do this often want to replace it with norms of their own, and that&#39;s something we need to understand: humanity will never be without culture.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=8m30s\">8:30</a> Also for anyone wanting to say I went too political, they did too. :p<br><br>Overall, I like the video, but the politics was unnecessary. You already have videos on the subject, and it really detracts from the learning aspect of the video by sticking your personality in other people&#39;s faces.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T18:04:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rune Goon", "comment_text": "Intelligence is just biological efficiency.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T18:04:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ali Re\u015fit G\u00dcL", "comment_text": "modern problems require modern solutions -_-", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T18:04:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Davis Marasligiller", "comment_text": "Absolute terrible video, explains nothings, gives nothing, only takes.

So the more neurons you have - the more intelligent you are.

BUT, having also attained culture and societal impulses, we figured it would be astronomically faster and easier to collaborate on large projects. But given enough wealth to attain all the required resources and having at least the minimum required intelligence to achieve success, a single human could build, program, and delegate the actual construction of said objects to robots designed to help with such tasks. They would be exponentially more efficient as the mistakes humans often make would be virtually nonexistent providing the programming was inclusive enough to cover it. <br><br>All said, the real success of our species is in our ability to not only work together, but to realize that it is mutually beneficial to collaborate on the most difficult aspects and develop a society that instills that cooperation throughout the generations. We are the planets greatest success story. If there is such a thing as a God in the universe, either it is so unbelievably more complex than us that it doesn&#39;t bear considering...or more likely...WE are the Gods. I believe that if we thought of ourselves in that context that we would be far more careful and morally just in our lives, to the point that if we ever did make contact with other intelligent life in the universe that we would be unlikely to destroy them immediately for simply being vastly different than ourselves. This doesn&#39;t imply that we should think ourselves above everything else and as such that everything that isn&#39;t human is substandard and should be subservient to us...but that we should treat everything with respect.

Stephen Hawking said &quot;Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing.&quot; So, he thinks the law of gravity is nothing but actually that is something. Dr. John Lennox points out that that is self contradictory. Lennox says &quot;If I say x creates y this presupposes the existence of x in the first place in order to bring y into existence. If I say x creates x, I presuppose the existence of x in order to account for the existence of x. To presuppose the existence of the universe, to account for it&#39;s existence is logically incoherent.&quot; It&#39;s much more easier to believe Genesis 1:1 than to believe that sci fi nonsense. So, some Atheists have to redefine nothing to make it something so something can come from nothing. Also the complexity of DNA is proof for intelligent design. &quot;DNA is so compact that a one square inch chip of DNA could encode the information in over seven billion Bible&#39;s.&quot; - The new answers book 2 p. 70. Bill Gates said &quot;DNA is more advanced than any software ever created.&quot; Here, the following are just some out of many scientists who are Biblical creationists, Dr. Jason Lisle has a PhD in astrophysics from the University of Colorado, Dr. Georgia Purdom holds a PhD in molecular genetics from The Ohio State University, Dr. Nathaniel Jeanson holds a PhD in cell and developmental biology from Harvard University, Bodie Hodge has a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Dr. Danny Faulkner holds an MS in Physics from Clemson University and an MA and PhD in Astronomy from Indiana University, Dr. Terry Mortenson holds a masters of divinity and a PhD in the history of geology. It&#39;s not that science is against the the Bible, the darkened mind interprets the evidences for it through a naturalistic presupposition that doesn&#39;t allow anything spiritual because God&#39;s word says it&#39;s because people love their sin and wanna suppress the truth Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=1m18s\">1:18</a>-32. Note, archaeology confirms the Bible, the Popular handbook of archaeology and the Bible&quot; Page 181 says &quot;Today nearly 100 Biblical figures, dozens of Biblical cities, over 60 historical details in the Gospel of John and 80 historical details in the book of Acts, among other things, have been confirmed as historical through archaeological and historical research. Moreover, the Israeli Antiquities Authority has over 100,000 artifacts [discovered in Israel since 1948] available on their data base.&quot; Also it&#39;s strange when Christians bring up the fine tuning argument which there is evidence, atheists have to make up the multi verse theory which there is no evidence, so they make up a theory with no evidence to try and refute a scientific fact of fine tuning, so at that point its the atheist who&#39;s going by blind faith. Some atheists say they don&#39;t believe in anything immaterial but the laws of logic are immaterial and it exists. Jesus said &quot;So it will be at the end of the age, the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous, and will throw them into the furnace of fire, in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot; Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=13m49s\">13:49</a>-50. Jesus also said &quot;You are my friends if you do what I command you.&quot; John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck4RGeoHFko&amp;t=15m14s\">15:14</a>. Jesus taught that the only way to be saved is to choose him as your Lord and Master, repent and believe that he died for the sins of his people on the cross see John 14:6.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T16:16:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "EyesOfByes", "comment_text": "In my PP.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T16:15:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evan", "comment_text": "Is anybody else watching this and thinking I want to play that game\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T16:15:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aldo the Lizard", "comment_text": "Can human evolve and make new toolbox?<br>Is human at the end stage of its evolution?", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T16:15:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Partridge", "comment_text": "no single person could build a rocket...BUT A HYPER INTELLIGENT A.I.

Humans on the other hand can choose to focus and that way direct the subconscious to make a passive decision based on previous knowledge on the focus subject. The active decision is in the focus and the rest is passive. You don&#39;t choose what to eat for breakfast. You choose to focus while looking for food and then your subconscious makes the passive choice that ultimately informs the result of what you will eat. The initial choice of focus is what free will is about. It&#39;s a focus switch that is not determined by initial conditions (to an extent of course).

The Mercator projection (which i think you used) places the equator way to low and diminishes the size of South America, Africa, Oceania and part of Asia.

I think that it&#39;s important that if this resources will be used at schools, the students don&#39;t get the idea that the countries in the southern hemisphere (where there&#39;s a lot of development to be done for example) are actually just a small thing or a small part of the globe.<br>If the reason for that projection would be the percentage of the population living in that half of the globe for example, i think it would make more sense, but either way i hope you can keep my observation in mind.

Plus after this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That\u2019s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour.
