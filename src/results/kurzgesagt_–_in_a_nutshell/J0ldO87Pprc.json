Dont forget that despite the struggles and madness in this world today, God is full of justice, mercy and love. <br>Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world&#39;s previous perfection to be<br>destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don&#39;t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot; - if we break one in thought/word/deed it&#39;s as if we&#39;re guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans <br><br>. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God&#39;s perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn&#39;t and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. <br><br>If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It&#39;s about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it&#39;s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). <br><br>He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ&#39;s death as our own in our place. <br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. <br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can&#39;t. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way. <br><br>Christ says in John 16:33: I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have\u00a0[perfect]\u00a0peace. In the world you have tribulation\u00a0and\u00a0distress\u00a0and\u00a0suffering, but be courageous\u00a0[be confident, be undaunted, be filled with joy];\u00a0I have overcome the world.\u201d\u00a0[My conquest is accomplished, My victory abiding.]<br>-\u00a0 (AMPLIFIED version) <br><br>NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER.

I&#39;m here to warn you all of a GRIM FUTURE! Corona Virus is just the beginning! Aliens will land on Earth on the year 2070 and we will share technologies. One of the technologies that these Aliens share with us is the ability to transfer or upload a consciousness to a &quot;Mind Drive&quot;. The Aliens will leave never to visit Earth again, but before leaving they came into contact with the Corona Virus and a new mutant strain emerged, one with Alien Genealogy. Humanity didn&#39;t stand a chance. By the year 2075 nations erupted into war over resources and territory. Nuclear warheads became ineffective due to new technology that was shared with us from the Aliens. A new satellite defense system was deployed surrounding the Earths atmosphere, the satellites formed a ring that when connected would send out an atomic pulse that would disrupt nuclear atoms preventing the chemical explosion of nuclear fission from occurring rendering nuclear weapons obsolete. In the year 2076, the world was officially at war with every nation that had a military fighting for resources, and control of strategic geographical locations. Alliances were formed and as the fighting continued, many of the Super Powers of the world held a conference that would change the fate of humanity for ever. In the year 2077 peace was achieved and a New World Order was formed. Countries no longer had Presidents but rather Ministers, that reported to Continental Governors, that reported to The World Council of Leaders. Remember the &quot;Mind Drive&quot; technology that I mentioned earlier? In the time I come from, the year 2222, The World Council of Leaders has remained unchanged since 2077. The same people have been manipulating and controlling the world for 145 years all thanks to the &quot;Mind Drives&quot; which essentially gave them immortality. This knowledge is not known to the general public in my time. &quot;New&quot; leaders are &quot;democratically&quot; voted into The World Council of Leaders, but all of them are just puppets. They&#39;re only purpose is to trick the public into thinking that their voting makes a difference, that the people are in control, but that was never the case. The same people who were in control in the year 2077 after The Great World War are still in control in the year 2222. Before the The Great World War, the new alien strain of Covid-19 killed roughly 35% of the world population until a Vaccine emerged after the war. The war itself took the lives of over 500 million people, both soldiers and civilians. The vaccine was held from the Public during the entirety of the War as Nations fought. No one knows the real reason as to why it was held, not even us, but we do know that there was a vaccine available. Only a few of us know the truth. I was one of the first to find out. A few scientists around the world also knew and came together to form a plan to end this New World Order.

The sun is very big and has lots of different layers, and these layers can vary greatly in terms of temperature and pressure.<br><br>For instance, if you take your sample from the sun&#39;s corona\u2014the outermost layer\u2014all you&#39;ll get for your trouble is a few energetic particles. These particles might reach a temperature of a few thousand degrees, but you&#39;ll get just a handful of them so they won&#39;t actually do much. There&#39;s a bigger danger from air rushing in to fill the vacuum than from the actual piece of sun itself.<br><br>But if you take your sample from the sun&#39;s core, you&#39;ll be bringing back a chunk of matter that holds more energy than a dozen nuclear bombs. In the core, particles reach temperatures of several million degrees, and the density sits around 150 times the density of water. If you bring a chunk of the sun&#39;s core back to Earth, it would annihilate everything in a 150-mile radius, create a shockwave that would circle the globe, and trigger a global ice age that would last for hundreds or thousands of years.<br><br>Parts of it burn at more than a million degrees Fahrenheit\u2014thank goodness it&#39;s so far away.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

Upon entering, you stock up and light a fire in the cabin stove. After a while you notice that the room is significantly warmer than when you entered, so you take your coat off to hang it up. Passing by the roaring stove you accidentally brush against it, but to your surprise far from burning yourself, you discover that stove is COLDER than the temperature in the room. <br>This is exactly the problem with the hydrogen-fusion model of the Sun, it violates the laws of thermodynamics; how does the Sun\u2019s internal heat of millions of degrees penetrate the outer observable photospheric shell of 6000 degrees, then heat the outer solar corona which is millions of degrees?<br>Then there is the rotation puzzle.<br>Despite sitting slap dab in the middle of the solar system, the Sun has such a slow rotation rate in comparison to the outer gaseous planets. Despite being in the outer planes of the solar system, they can be observed to be rotating in mere hours, whereas the Sun takes a good month to make one rotation.<br>This is at odds with the Law of angular momentum (think of a spinning skater pulling in their arms, spinning ever faster.). <br>A contracting accretion solar system theory abiding by laws of gravity and angular momentum, would have the central Sun spinning at a rate far greater than the outer planets.<br>This obvious inconsistency has not escaped the notice of the stellar physicists who have come up with an explanation for this:\u201dMagnetic Braking.\u201d<br>The story goes that as the Sun inaugurated nuclear fusion in its core, the solar magnetic field somehow lost its angular momentum by virtue of all that left-over detritus that was blown out of the solar system.<br>At a glance, that seems reasonable, but fails to explain how Jupiter, our largest gaseous planet in the outer plane of the solar system, seems unaffected by magnetic braking.<br>In comparison to scale, the moons of Jupiter are magnitudes bigger and closer than the planets orbiting the Sun, and In terms of having the capacity for magnetic braking, Jupiter\u2019s powerful magnetic field and sizable orbiting moons ought to illustrate a perfect magnetic braking mechanism for the system.<br>Yet Jupiter makes a rotation in a mere ten hours, whereas to scale, the much larger central Sun has much less braking material to magnetically slow it down, yet takes roughly a month to make one full rotation.<br>Then there are the observations made by the Kepler Space Observatory, that has gathered data on thousands of stars, measuring their differing rotation rates, but not a SINGLE ONE OF THEM has ceased to rotate. <br>If magnetic braking were real, would one not expect at least some of these stars - especially older ones - to have ground to a halt?<br>Then there is the curious observation that the Sun is as close to round as our instruments can measure (presently with an error of plus or minus 7 kilometers)<br>The sun rotates once every 28-30 days, and being fluid, slower at the poles, faster at the equator. <br>According to past oblateness calculations, because of the Sun&#39;s perceived mass, it MUST have a bulge at the equator due to its rotation.<br>Of course, aside from intelligent speculation, no one actually knows what is going on inside the Sun, but for our purposes, think of the solar energy propagation interior as a restless gremlin that weighs X amount. <br>This \u2018gremlin\u2019 inside the Sun may take many forms, but it cannot shed its weight and so no matter what shape it takes, because the Sun rotates, a solar equatorial bulge ought to be visible.<br>So that knowing the mass of the Sun and its rotation rate, it ought have an oblateness, no matter what its interior configuration may be.<br>If the Sun&#39;s actual mass is as presently to be believed, the calculations lead to a conclusion in which the rotating Sun MUST have an equatorial bulge, an inescapable conclusion based on calculations determined by its accepted mass.<br>These observations:<br>The Coronal Problem;<br>the Sun\u2019s lack of angular momentum, it\u2019s slow rotation rate, despite being the central body of our solar system; <br>that the magnetic braking scenario does not hold water, and that NO stars are observed to have stopped rotating;<br>a Sun without equatorial obleteness:<br>Any viable theory solar theory MUST supply reasonable explanations for these observed phenomena.<br><br>Hope you enjoyed :-)", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T23:48:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Petebeingrenewed", "comment_text": "we die", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T23:27:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juuliano", "comment_text": "Ooooooh geez, uuhm science man oooh geez", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T23:15:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lauri", "comment_text": "but if you actually just took the pure mass out of the sun without the effects of the surrounding amount of mass, a pile the size of a truck wouldn&#39;t give out much more energy than a compost of the same size. the mass itself is a actually fairly inefficient at producing warmth. a pile of that stuff at the scale of our sun on the other hand is a able to produce the amount of energy we witness every day.", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T23:00:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dziwny Kole\u015b", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ldO87Pprc&amp;t=3m38s\">3:38</a> this gave me idea how to weaponize teleportation", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T20:30:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u8df3\u8df3\u864e\u7684\u597d\u670b\u53cb", "comment_text": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f53\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8d44\u6599\u4e86", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T19:09:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chance", "comment_text": "The Sun Isn&#39;t Made Out Of All Plasma (I don&#39;t think) But Is Mostly Made Out Of Hydrogen And Helium", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T19:01:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The P!nkDuck", "comment_text": "We die<br><br><br><br><br>I mean like the sun is frrugging hot", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T17:16:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Green Is Not A Creative Colour", "comment_text": "I wasn&#39;t going to click the like button, but then suddenly, Ice King!", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T16:30:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke Spencer", "comment_text": "Was just about to comment &quot;you die&quot;

Basically, the sun is so hot that the fact that it is ionized and there are electromagnetic forces doesn&#39;t matter much, because those forces are small compared to the thermal jiggling.  It&#39;s a far cry from, for example, the plasma inside a neon light, which is ionized not by thermal jiggling but by radio-frequency electricity.  That stuff truly isn&#39;t a gas, since it behaves quite differently, with the thermal, gas-like behavior being dominated by the electromagnetic behavior.  <br><br>Fact is, stuff in the universe can&#39;t really be separated cleanly into just four boxes that we call solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.  Liquid and gas blend together at high pressure, solid objects of the same material can be in different phases with proper phase transitions between them, weird shit like Bose-Einstein condensate exists, etc.  The Sun is a gas <b>and</b> it&#39;s a plasma.", "comment_date": "2017-09-09T22:05:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bork bakker", "comment_text": "The world would burn", "comment_date": "2017-09-09T20:50:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "danidominguezromero", "comment_text": "amazing video, like the other,  keep doing this guys  like", "comment_date": "2017-09-09T20:42:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Funderburgh", "comment_text": "tsar bomba had 50 kiloton yield, not 40.", "comment_date": "2017-09-09T20:38:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elijah _", "comment_text": "I also have some hot and wierd goo \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43", "comment_date": "2017-09-09T20:08:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B. iez", "comment_text": "can also read what-if.xkcd which is fantastic", "comment_date": "2017-09-09T20:01:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zwerggoldhamster", "comment_text": "Xkcd by Kurzgesagt xD", "comment_date": "2017-09-09T19:54:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ezra", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ldO87Pprc&amp;t=6m17s\">6:17</a> So what you&#39;re saying is if I really want to know the answer, I should bring the sun to Earth myself.", "comment_date": "2017-09-09T19:33:26Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Asd396", "comment_text": "This puts coming with the force of a thousand suns into a whole new perspective.", "comment_date": "2017-09-09T19:28:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zoop", "comment_text": "are they running out of ideas? &quot;Guys what&#39;s something really cool and scientific and philosophical we can do for our next video?&quot; &quot;Uhh...space!! wait that&#39;s too vague......uh...the sun is big!! uh.....THE SUN!

Bob is actually still alive, but as a ghost, so Bob is actually dead but alive as well. Just as a ghost. Bob is only able to possess pieces of clothing, so everyday he wears this stupid hat with his stupid sweater and stupid jeans with his stupid shoes. One day he decided to go back to his school and try to figure out how to split atoms in the science lab. So he went to the school, and instead of figuring out how to split atoms he figured out a way to fly out into space. So he flew out into space and decided North Korea shouldn&#39;t exist anymore. So he flew over over to the Sun and since he was a ghost he was safe from the toasty surface temperature.
